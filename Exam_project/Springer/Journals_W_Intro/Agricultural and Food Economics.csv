Particularly, uncertainty associated with price volatility negatively affects investment and production decisions by risk-averse farmers. An intuitive illustration is given by Figure1 that displays the FAO real monthly food as well as the respective cereals price index. The data shows that global food markets exhibited serious patterns of uncertainty over the past decade. FAO real food price indices. The FAO real food price index consists of the average of 5 commodity group (meat, dairy, cereals, oil, sugar) price indices weighted with the average export shares of each of the groups for 2002-2004. The cereals price index is compiled using the grains and rice price indices weighted by their average trade share 2002-2004. The Grains Price Index consists of International Grains Council (IGC) wheat price index and 1 maize export quotation. The Rice Price Index consists of 3 components containing average prices of 16 rice quotations: the components are Indica, Japonica and Aromatic rice varieties and the weights for combining the three components are assumed (fixed) trade shares of the three varieties. However, the role of technology adoption and adjustment of supply is of central importance with respect to securing adequate levels of agricultural production and achieving global food security. Consequently, recent studies stressed the role of market transparency and information flows for improving production decisions in agricultural markets (see UNCTAD2011). Thus, market transparency can be understood in terms of parameters that, at least partially, are under control of public and private agencies. Governmental and non-governmental organizations then may enhance transparency by providing a greater deal and more reliable information on important determinants of price movements, such as indicators of climate change, international market conditions, government price stabilization schemes, weather forecasts, disaster relief programs, stricter food safety standards, insurance and alternatives (UNCTAD2011). Against this background, the present study is concerned with the impact of changes in markets transparency on agricultural production levels. In particular, we study how the ex ante expected volume of agricultural production responds to additional information when information also affects the futures market for agricultural commodities. Earlier studies addressing this issue have modeled market transparency solely by means of exogenous changes in the distributional parameters of the market price. In such a framework, the futures market is completely separated from the underlying transparency concept (see Newbery and Stiglitz1981, Kawai and Zilcha1986, Frechette2000, Moschini and Hennessy2001, Allen and Lueck2003 as well as Hudson2007). In our view, this approach misses out an important link that exists between market transparency and risk-sharing opportunities on futures markets. In our model, we endogenize uncertainty through an information system provided by governmental and non-governmental organizations or related agencies that explicitly links market transparency to the terms of contracting on the futures market. The notion of market transparency underlying this approach is adopted from the work of Eckwert and Zilcha (2001,2003). Along the seminal contributions of Blackwell (1953) and Hirshleifer (1971), market transparency is linked to the informativeness of an observable signal which is (imperfectly) correlated with the future spot price. The uncertainty the farmer is exposed to then depends on the observed signal as well as on the information system within which the signal can be interpreted. We find that a higher degree of market transparency leads to higher expected profits but does not increase agricultural production levels per se. However, when we vary the prevailing risk-sharing regime such that farmers have no access to futures markets, transparency does increase ex ante expected utility and output. In particular, we consider a model where a farmer faces risky revenues due to a random product price. The distribution of the price is given and there exists a futures market (see, for example, Broll et al.2013). The terms at which the farmer can hedge the revenue risk through trade in futures contracts negatively depends on the degree of market transparency. Higher market transparency then affects the farmer’s production decision in two opposing ways. Firstly, price uncertainty declines and ex ante expected utility increases, resulting in higher production levels. Secondly, additional information on future market conditions may interfere with the operation of risk-sharing markets and thereby decrease ex ante expected utility and production levels. The paper is organized as follows. In section ‘Methods’, we introduce the model and our concepts of information and market transparency. Our main results are derived in section ‘Results and discussion’. Section ‘Conclusions’ concludes.",2

More precisely, it looks into the influence of demographic variables on obtaining funds from the rural development policy: we define as “consumption of policy” the farm’s ability to obtain funds from rural development policies. A general characteristic of the agricultural sector in many European countries is the presence of an overlap between the productive and domestic spheres, that is farms’ strategies depend on the family situations (Jervell 1999. According to Gasson et al(1988), family farm businesses are related to situations where: 
the principals are related by kinship or marriage,
 
business ownership is usually combined with managerial control, and
 
control is passed from one generation to another within the same family.
 In this context, any boundary between productive and reproductive work in the farm household is artificial (Errington and Gasson 1993) and conditions farms’ strategies and aptitude to invest: the number of family members and localization in the life cycle could be relevant variables of influence. In a lot of cases, demographic transition, either vertical or oblique (Bergstrom 1996), is stimulated by policies aiming at favoring intergenerational transmission. Besides, other investments are necessary to maintain a farm’s profitability and its persistence over time. In order to cope with an even more competitive scenario and to secure a family farm’s resilience, a mix of strategies has to be carried out (Darnhofer 2010). Recent rural development polices make a set of instruments available in order to sustain farm competitiveness and to diversify agricultural income. The possibility to obtain funds is influenced by a set of constraints which, in many cases, reduce the consumption of policies. In this situation, an interesting field of analysis is the influence of demographic variables in accessing rural policies. After presenting a brief theoretical overview, the paper proposes an empirical test within an Italian region (Lazio), where the odds of gaining access to rural development policies will be examined through a logistic regression model. The paper sustains the hypothesis of differentiation in the access to policies, due to demographic factors in the composition of family farms. As Offutt (2002) points out, since farm households are demonstrably diverse, analysts would seem obliged to investigate hypotheses about differential response and impact. One of these differences concerns demographic variables: family contexts are particularly favorable to set up a farm venture (Jervell 2011): an abundant economic literature has emphasised the strict connection between farm household strategies and style of farming (among others, Whatmore, 1994), by demonstrating the persistency of family farms (Sabbatini 2011). Their ability to survive over time witnesses the relevance of F-connection1 in fostering lower levels of transaction costs and a higher aptitude to adapt (Ben-Porath 1980; Pollack 1985; Corsi 2009). Social approaches to this theme underline the relevance of non-profit decisions in maintaining farming activity (Kuehne et al2010). For example, some researchers emphasize the relevance of family identity in strengthening the links between the future and past family history (Burton, 2004). Furthermore, a sentimental attachment to the place (place dependence and place identity) reinforces the links between farmer and farming and delays the eventual decision to retire (Kuehne 2012). However, in many other cases financial constraints are determining factors, thus inducing the abandonment of activity. To avoid this, agricultural policy offers financial support to promote farm adjustments. Some authors have recently stressed the role of the Common Agricultural Policy in preserving small farms (Koutsou et al. 2011), through the process of the functional repositioning of agriculture, as a result of deepening, broadening and regrounding, and through the creation of rural webs (van der Ploeg and Marsden 2008). As a matter of fact, family farms are expected to play an important role even in the new scenario of “modern rurality” designed within the rural development policies (Abdelmalek, 2000). Family units are requested to face competitive challenges through the definition of farm strategies, which are generally overlapping with family strategies (Caillavet et al2005; Abdel 1997). In this context a relevant subject of analysis is related to the capabilities of gaining access to rural development policies, which contain a set of measures to sustain either farm competitiveness or diversification, along sectorial or territorial trajectories of development. This ability could be decreased both on the supply and the demand side. From the supply standpoint, a large literature taking origin from Downs (1957) work has demonstrated that deviations emerge in a context of public choice. As far as demand is concerned, collective action theories evidence the relevance of pressure groups in conditioning policy decisions (Olson 1965; Becker 1983)2. The impacts of agricultural policies on farms’ structural adjustments are analysed also within agent-based models (Balmann 1997; Albisser and Lehmann 2007; Balmann et al. 2003), which endogenise the importance of psychological and social factors which interfere in the farmer’s strategy definition. They are considered to be a useful tool to evaluate agricultural policy impact (Berger 2001; Happe 2004). More recent studies have emphasized the relevance of territory, social capital and socioeconomic farm characteristics in obtaining access to rural policies and fostering local rural development (Sabbatini, 2008; Meert et al., 2005; Marotta, 2007; Casieri et al., 2010). The inclination to adopt rural policy, that is to receive subsidies within the rural development framework, is variable and could depend on socio-demographic characteristics of the farm: family size, presence of young farmers and localization in the life cycle are influencing factors that should be examined in depth. As a matter of fact, consuming policy is a costly activity in terms of time spending and opportunity costs; in addition, informational asymmetries represent an important barrier to access. To overcome these obstacles, farmers have to improve their attention: neo-Austrian perspectives permit to get a better comprehension of the decision processes through the concept of entrepreneurial alertness (Kirzner 1973). In the Kirznerian perspective, the entrepreneur is characterised by the aim to increase profits: to this end, he or she must pay attention to opportunities. Kirzner (1997) makes reference to the concept of alertness to summarize the entrepreneur’s aptitude to take advantage of opportunities. Access to rural development policies becomes a way to support farm adjustments. The decision about consuming or not and about what measures are better to adopt could be influenced by demographic variables. As thoroughly demonstrated in literature, demographic variables are commonly recognized as explanatory factors influencing farm strategies: family composition and localization in the life cycle are determinants of different paths of development. What does the term demographic really mean? Should one refer to all the members of the family, or to the members effectively employed on the farm? Are there any differences if considering one or the other typology of family farms? Our paper sets in this context and aims at analysing the influence of demographic variables on the farm’s decision to adopt rural policies. By proposing a two-way classification of family farms, the hypothesis under analysis is that possible differences in the access to rural development policies could emerge. The research is conducted through interdisciplinary approaches which privilege a demographic perspective of analysis, where the fundamental elements are related to farm family traits. To this end, after a brief methodological note our analysis proposes an empirical test of the access to rural policies, within an Italian region (Lazio). The hypothesis under study is that family composition influences the consumption of policies.",5
1.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,09 October 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-7532-1-11,Determinants of sheep and goat meat consumption in Switzerland,December 2013,Matteo Aepli,Robert Finger,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In Switzerland, there are currently almost 418,000 sheep and 82,000 goats. This production activity has a high importance especially for small-scale farms and part-time farming in Swiss agriculture (Aepli and Jörin 2011). About 20% of all Swiss farmers keep sheep or goats (SFSO 2012). The feeding system is mainly grassland based. Almost half of the sheep are grazing on summer pasture with increasing tendency during the last years (Kaulfers 2009). The production of these small ruminants contributes substantially to conservation of landscapes and diversity associated with Swiss and European agriculture (Dýrmundsson 2006). For instance, grazing of summer pastures prevents the natural regrowth of shrubs and forests (Herzog et al. 2009). Preventing this forest regrowth is of high societal and political interest because this is associated with negative impacts on biodiversity and the valuation of mountain landscapes by people (e.g., Gellrich et al. 2007; Hunziker et al. 2008). A recent investigation shows that this regrowth occurs particularly on steeper slopes and at higher elevations where cultivation costs are high and yield potential is low (Pellissier et al. 2012). These are, however, exactly the plots that are either only suitable for small ruminant grazing or where this land use implies the smallest costs of cultivating these areas (e.g., Dux et al. 2009). Thus, even though the consumption levels of sheep and goat meat are currently small (1.3 kg per capita for sheep and goat meat, Proviande 2012), small ruminants play a decisive role in Swiss agriculture. This role is determined by consumers’ decisions to buy sheep and goat meat.a Despite this relevance, there is no study that has addressed this question yet.b Switzerland as a high developed country is a particularly interesting case due to high production costs of farms for livestock and for crops on the one side (e.g., Lehmann et al. 2005; Lips et al. 2007; Raaflaub et al. 2005) and high purchase power of the consumers on the other side. Against this background, the goal of this article is to identify the determinants of sheep and goat meat consumption in Switzerland. Sheep and goat farming are under great pressure in Switzerland as well as in the whole of Europe because of a decreasing demand, high imports from Oceania and a price drop in some countries in the recent past (Boutonnet 1999; Proviande 2013; Aepli and Jörin 2011). An important reason for this consumption decline is the substitution with other types of meat like poultry and pork as well as fish (Dýrmundsson 2006; Jaquet et al.; 2000). Such substitution was also observed in Switzerland (Aepli and Jörin, 2011), where the consumer price for sheep meat increased by 30% since 2000, whereas the consumer price for poultry and fish has remained constant (SFSO, 2013). During the next years international competition will further increase and at the same time sheep and goat meat consumption may continue to decline (Dýrmundsson 2006; European Commission 2012). Therefore, the understanding of the determinants of demand is crucial for the European sheep and goat meat production. The analysis of Swiss demand will give some useful information for the whole European market. Following recent studies (Abdulai 2002; Gallet 2009; Jaquet et al. 2000), we focused our research on the following determinants affecting sheep and goat meat consumption: different meat prices (sheep and goat, beef, pork, chicken), fish price, total expenditure and expenditure for food, as well as households’ characteristics like the presence of children and education. In addition, we are also able to account for within-country cultural differences determined by language regions in Switzerland. Estimating the relevance of these determinants will contribute to a better understanding of the driving forces of demand and will provide an empirical base for marketing activities. We use data from the Swiss household expenditure survey covering monthly data for the period 2000-2005 with a total sample size of 20,940. Even though the use of detailed micro-data (i.e., highly disaggregated data with respect to time, product groups and households) is superior to other approaches (e.g., Akbay et al. 2007; Lazaridis 2003; Majumder et al. 2012; Thiele 2008), we face two major methodological challenges when analyzing this household expenditure survey data for sheep and goat meat. First, many households do not purchase this kind of meat every month leading to a large share of zero observations. Second, no direct price data are provided in our data set. To overcome these problems we combine recently proposed approaches to a) avoid selection biases associated with zero consumption using Tobit regressions (e.g., Ma et al. 2006; Yimer 2011), and b) we derive quality adjusted price levels at the household level using the approach proposed by Majumder et al. (2012) or regional market prices where available.",7
1.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,27 August 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-7532-1-10,Hawai‘i’s food consumption and supply sources: benchmark estimates and measurement issues,December 2013,Matthew K Loke,PingSun Leung,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2007–2009, public concern, interest, and debate on food security and food self-sufficiency has intensified in Hawai‘i and elsewhere in the United States. This concern is real and understandable, considering Hawai‘i’s geographic isolation in the Central Pacific Ocean, looming threats of global warming and climate change, and the 2008 food crisis, which showed serious vulnerabilities in the global food system. Hawai‘i’s supply of food, as it presently exists, is vulnerable to disruptions in the shipping chain, production fluctuations in the continental United States, severe weather conditions, and sudden spikes in the prices of food products, as well as higher prices for fuel, feed, fertilizers, and other agricultural “inputs.” During the 2008 food crisis, the surge in food price inflation worldwide was caused primarily by rising oil prices, depreciating U.S. dollar, increasing demand for biofuels, and export restrictions imposed by leading food producing countries (Heady and Fan 2008). In some quarters, there is a genuine desire to dissociate local food prices from the rising global oil price. In order to start a meaningful discussion on food security or food self-sufficiency in Hawai‘i, we must have a reasonably good assessment of the consumption level of food groups, the characteristics of food consumed, and its origins or supply sources. In 1937, H.H. Warner, then Director of the Agricultural Extension Service, Territory of Hawai‘i, wrote on the character and variety of foods consumed by people on the Islands. He described the unique situation in Hawai‘i: “Probably nowhere else in the world is there to be found a group of similar racial proportions with as distinctly varied diet habits, isolated from a large part of their natural food supply.”a While changing diets have evolved since then, including the creation of Euro-Asian cuisine and the Hawai‘i Regional Cuisine movement, Warner’s insightful comment is still valid and relevant today. At the current time, Hawai‘i lacks an established set of benchmark estimates on the availability of food for market consumption and its supply sources. This paper serves to fill that persistent gap in the existing literature and proposes to present available facts and a logical empirical methodology to establish definitive estimates on various food groups consumed from local and import sources. Hence, the two primary objectives in this paper are as follows: (1) map existing food supply flows and to determine the various levels of food consumption in Hawai‘i; and (2) suggest modified measures of food self-sufficiency and import dependency to provide a more accurate assessment on the extent of food localization in Hawai‘i. The amount of food consumed in Hawai‘i that is sourced from imports is not readily available. This deficiency is due to the difficulties in reconciling the various data sources on food imports and food expenditures. For example, interstate trade flow data are rather rudimentary, unlike customs data on foreign imports, which are fairly disaggregated. The problem is further complicated by the conversion of data consistently from the various sources to a common baseline in the supply chain (Leung and Loke 2008). Despite these challenges, various local studies have been conducted. A Rocky Mountain Institute study estimated the import share of food in the County of Hawai‘i at 85% (Page et al. 2007). Likewise, popular food system analyst, Ken Meter, estimated that more than 90% of Hawai‘i's food is imported (Halweil 2004). Later, the Ulupono Initiative estimated that Hawai‘i consumers spend only 8% of their food budget on locally grown food, while spending the rest on imports (Ulupono Initiative 2011). Then, the University of Hawai‘i at Hilo produced a Hawai‘i Island food self-sufficiency scorecard that estimated the percentage of locally produced food consumed by commodity group, ranging from 0% for grains to 95% for fresh milk (Melrose and Delparte 2012). Recently, the state planning office, in a report on “increased food security and food self-sufficiency strategy,” noted that 85–90% of Hawai‘i's food is imported (OP-DBEDT 2012). These estimates have been widely cited despite lingering questions about and critiques of their methodologies and estimated parameters. In comparison, the food self-sufficiency measure for the New England states is estimated at 27% in 1997 (Holm et al. 2000).",30

1.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,20 August 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-7532-1-7,On the relationship between regional trade agreements and agricultural technology and productivity,December 2013,Pascal L Ghazalian,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) represent a prominent feature of the current international trading system. For instance, the number of RTAs that have been reported to the World Trade Organization (WTO) exceeded 500 in 2012 (WTO, 2012). RTAs normally encompass reductions (or eliminations) of policy trade barriers (e.g., tariffs, non-tariff barriers) between member countries. Also, RTAs often bring about higher levels of business cooperation and trade facilitation measures (e.g., development of regional trade-enhancing infrastructure) between member countries that further promote intra-regional trade flows. RTAs are commonly associated with increases in intra-regional trade flows in agricultural productsa. Naturally, such increases in intra-regional trade would be accompanied with a rise in market competition levels, in domestic agricultural markets for producers in importing member countries and in foreign regional agricultural markets for producers in exporting member countries. The formation of an RTA is expected to generate various implications for agricultural technology and productivity in the importing and exporting member countries. This is because the formation of an RTA, which promotes intra-regional increases in agricultural trade flows, would eventually magnify market competition levels. In this context, several studies (e.g., Krugman, 1991; Frankel, 1997; Perdikis, 2007) noted that reductions in regional and bilateral trade barriers would not only decrease market prices, but would also compel firms in RTAs’ member countries to upgrade their production technologies and to realize more efficient uses of inputs. The RTA-induced intensification of market competition, realized through increases in import levels, could potentially provoke domestic firms in the agricultural sector to respond by upgrading their production technology and productivity levels to maintain or expand their domestic market shares vis-à-vis foreign regional exporting competitors. These potential responses are in accordance with many conventional studies indicating that increases in import competition levels would potentially induce domestic firms to upgrade their innovation activities (e.g., Pugel, 1978; Caves, 1985; Levinsohn, 1991). Furthermore, following the formation of a regional trading bloc, domestic firms in the agricultural sector become more exposed to foreign production technologies and practices. In this context, Josling (2011) noted that the formation of RTAs would promote flows of knowledge and technology between member countries, particularly from highly competitive agricultural sectors in some member countries to agricultural sectors in other member countries. This exposure to foreign knowledge and technology could generate supplementary incentives for domestic firms in the agricultural sector to invest in upgrading their production technologies and practices and realize the spillover effects. Alternatively, the formation of an RTA could lessen the incentives of domestic firms in the agricultural sector of importing member countries to implement technology and productivity upgrading policies. These implications could arguably occur since RTA-induced increases in imports would raise the market competition levels and, consequently, would lead to reductions in the price-to-cost margins. This situation could reduce the market share of domestic firms and the expected returns from technology and productivity upgrading investments, and from innovation activities in general (Aghion and Howitt, 1998; Funk, 2003; Ghazalian, 2012). RTA-induced increases in exporting activities would expose exporting firms in the agricultural sector of member countries to a more intense market competition in foreign regional agricultural markets, but also to new production technologies and practices. These exposures could potentially stimulate these exporting firms to upgrade their production technologies and productivity levels to further enhance their competitiveness in foreign regional markets and to realize the spillover effects. This argument is consistent with the seminal study on endogenous growth theory of Grossman and Helpman (1991) which identifies the positive effects of increases in exporting activities on innovation activities. Finally, the formation of a regional trading bloc generates larger effective agricultural markets for the exporting agricultural sectors of member countries. These larger agricultural markets could improve the feasibility of investments to upgrade agricultural technology and productivity. Lileeva and Trefler (2010) initially identified equivalent potential effects where larger effective regional markets would enhance the feasibility of investments in innovation activities. The analytical literature has paid little attention to adjustments in agricultural technology and productivity, which are typically associated with shifts in supply curves, when examining the effects of RTAs on agricultural trade and welfare through the conventional frameworks. This paper contributes to the literature by analyzing the implications of RTA-induced adjustments in agricultural technology and productivity for the effects of RTAs on agricultural trade and welfare. It investigates the relationship between RTAs and agricultural technology and productivity in the context of Viner’s (1950) conventional partial equilibrium framework with perfectly elastic foreign supply schedules faced by the importing member country. It also examines this relationship in the context of Pomfret’s (1986) extended partial equilibrium framework depicting upward-sloping foreign supply schedules for the importing member country. This paper shows changes in the initial benefits and losses from RTAs and depicts their redistributions following the RTA-induced adjustments in agricultural technology and productivity in the importing and exporting member countries. It is important to underscore the relevant study by Anania and McCalla (1995) that examined the implications of some domestic and trade policies, which are commonly used in developing countries, for the distribution of benefits from agricultural technology improvements. Using a partial equilibrium framework, Anania and McCalla (1995) identified different cases where policy interventions increase, reduce, or do not impact the overall benefits from agricultural technology improvements. Yet, in all cases, the distribution of benefits from agricultural technology improvements is found to be different with policy interventions.",3

It has more than 3.5 million sheep (3.7% of the EU total in 2009) [a] that totally produce more than 300,000 MT of milk. This quantity corresponds to about 4% of total world production (Istat, 2011; FAO, 2011; Eurostat 2011) and the sheep milk is processed into different types of cheese. Sardinia produces approximately 50–60 thousand MT of cheese a year, manufactured by more than 50 dairy factories, about half of which are cooperatives. More than half of the cheese produced is Pecorino Romano (PR), one of the most important sheep cheeses in the world. An average of 29,100 MT of PR a year was produced between 2000 and 2009 (Consorzio per la tutela del formaggio Pecorino Romano, 2011). Approximately 70% of PR production is exported (18,500 MT on average a year between 2000 and 2009), with 80% to 85% of the export going to the USA. As Sardinia is the largest supplier of PR to the USA, Sardinian PR represents about 70% of the volume of the US sheep cheese market (FAS-USDA, 2011). Some processing firms are also exporters. They export their own cheese and what they buy from other dairies. The US PR market is currently experiencing its worst crisis in years. This is due to a decline in domestic demand and fierce price competition from US cow milk cheese (Idda et al., 2010a). US imports of sheep milk cheese decreased dramatically between 2005 and 2009, from 26,000 MT to less than 20,000 MT (a fall of 24.3%). Imports from Sardinia fell from 18,200 MT to 13,100 MT (a fall of 28.3%). The average cheese prices peaked at $10.70 a kilo in November 2008, started deceasing in 2009, and fell to $6.62 a kilo in June 2010, a drop of 26.9% when compared to the average price in 2008. Effects of the crisis in the US market were immediately felt in Sardinia. The dairy industry paid Sardinian breeders 20% less for their milk in 2010 than they did in 2008.Sardinian sheep farms operate with low profit margins (Idda et al., 2010b). As a result, if prices were to fall for a prolonged period, many of them would have to go out of business. This would have a serious impact on productivity and the Sardinian economy in general, as well as on externalities and public goods produced by sheep farming in each farm, such as protecting the environment and the landscape, and preserving the vitality of rural communities and the lifestyle of their inhabitants. Hence, it is of value to see whether the profitability of the Sardinian milk cheese industry can be improved. Given the central role played by the cheese producers – both private firms and cooperatives produce and export cheese – it may be useful to focus on them. This paper aims to evaluate technical efficiency in the Sardinian sheep dairy processing sector. A stochastic frontier analysis approach was used on a panel data from 36 sheep dairy processors over the period 2004–2009, in order to assess whether there are some margins for technical improvements in productivity, given the present state of technology. In other words, our analysis was focused on estimating whether sheep dairy processors could improve their productivity by using their available resources more efficiently, without considering the prices of outputs and inputs. Particular attention was paid to determine the input–output elasticities, the role of inefficiency in explaining different levels of productivity in different firms, and the effects of a number of particular variables on inefficiency. A comparative analysis of private firms and cooperatives was also carried out, in order to establish if there were differences in the technology they used and/or their efficiency in using inputs.",8

During 2000–10, investment in fixed assets in CIS countries increased by 150 percent in terms of real prices, in Romania by 122% and in Bulgaria by 66%. In comparison, fixed asset investment in EU-27 countries averaged an 18% increase over the same period. In Russia, this investment reached US $290 billion, with the agro-industrial sector accounting for 4%. Over 2008–11, the annual investment in Russian agriculture was about US $12 billion, in Ukraine $2 billion, in Belarus $2 billion, in Kazakhstan $620 million and in Romania $940 million (in 2009) (RosStat 2012, UkrStat 2012, BelStat 2012, KazStat 2012, Romania Stat 2012, EuroStat 2012b). Many international companies compete in this market and submit projects for potential implementation. In Russian agriculture, international and joint domestic-international companies accounted for 6.5% of investments over 2009–10 (RosStat 2012). Every year, Israeli companies are involved in dozens of tenders for agro-industrial projects in various CIS and EE countries for the industries of poultry, dairy and pork production, fish farming, vegetable greenhouses, orchards, fruit packing houses and oilseed products. In order to win tenders, companies invest heavily in the development of economic models and business plans in accordance with accepted criteria, government guidelines and banking standards. The objectives of this study are three-fold: To describe the market situation for agro-industrial projects in the studied countries from the viewpoint of project developers. To propose a method of project evaluation using profit sensitivity to risk analysis, in conjunction with evaluation by financial performance criteria. To evaluate agro-industrial projects developed in Israel according to these criteria, and to analyze ranking consistency by different criteria. A number of studies evaluating agricultural profitability in CIS and EE countries have been published in recent years. In the 1990’s, most Russian companies considered the agricultural sector to be unprofitable and interest from foreign investors was limited. During this period, the Russian government sharply curtailed investment in the agricultural sector and large farm enterprises faced severe financial difficulties (Visser et al. 2012). Voigt and Hockmann (2008) found that from 1993–2003, there was little evidence documenting sustainable growth in Russian agriculture, and no significant transition progress was revealed. Agricultural production was rather industrialized but operated with decreasing returns to scale. After 1991, agricultural systems in CIS and EE countries underwent major institutional changes. In the largest countries – Russia, Ukraine, and Kazakhstan – 23 million hectares of arable land was excluded from production by the mid-2000’s (Lioubimtseva and Henebry 2012). These losses in production capacity were not accompanied by an adequate improvement in management and technology. Liefert and Liefert (2012) addressed issues of agricultural productivity in Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan in this period of economic transition, and studied the effects of modern technology and management techniques on improving agricultural productivity and maximizing profits. They found that the majority of large agricultural enterprises remained technologically backward and chronically unprofitable, despite their industrial nature and vertical integration. Nevertheless, these large agricultural holdings played a large part in production for the large CIS countries in the end of 2000’s. They were responsible for approximately 15% of total agricultural production in Russia, accounted for 66% of Kazakh grain marketed domestically and abroad, and cultivated 10% of the total farmland in Ukraine (Wandel et al. 2011). Welfare of small farmers in many CIS and EE countries depended mostly on the market price for their output in environments where agricultural policy provided minimal support. These farmers could suffer from price heterogeneity even after controlling for product heterogeneity, as it is shown by Sauer et al. (2012) in analyzing the dairy sector of Armenia, Moldova and Ukraine. Voicilas (2011) cites high risk, weak profitability and institutional failures (slow pace of privatization, negligible reforms and high taxation) as the main reasons for the minimal place of Romanian agriculture in foreign direct investment. In 2008, only 1% of foreign investment was in agriculture, although that sector employed 30% of the total workers in the country. In the literature on project evaluation, the choice of modeling tools and criteria has an important place. Production scheduling, sales planning, and cash budgeting are integrated in spreadsheet models through linking procedures, allowing for the development of an effective business plan (Chien and Cunningham 2000). For industrial agricultural projects, the dynamics of the growing process in crop industries and of herd/flock movement can be entered into a bio-economic model spreadsheet, in which the output of the biological and production processing modules serves as an input to an economic (cash flow) module. Bio-economic framework developed as an Excel-based representation allowed for an evaluation of profit and resource management at a project/farm business level (Zhang and Wilhelm 2011, Kuehne et al. 2012). The problem of criteria in project evaluation was studied by Parfenova (2009) who discussed socio-economic criteria for industrial agricultural projects aimed at regional economic growth and improving general living standards. Mansurov (2011) proposed different criteria for competitive evaluation of industrial agricultural companies by decision-makers such as project initiators, business owners and government organizations. The latter are particularly interested in increased tax revenue and in tools for solving social problems. The methodological aspects of project evaluation, particularly the determination of the discount rate for cash flows, was analyzed by Bevzelyuk (2008). Many of these studies incorporate the issue of risk in project evaluation. Strashko (2010) analyzed issues of business planning in relation to agro-industrial projects, specifically the need for risk, technical and financial analysis during the project evaluation. Hockmann et al. (2011) studied the influence of risk, expressed as variation in production and prices, on agricultural development and production growth in one of the regions of central Russia. The dual nature of risk in agriculture that follows from output and price uncertainty was analyzed by Ben-Zion et al. (2005), in the context of analyzing the difficulty in hedging agricultural production. On the other side, large-scale agro-industrial projects allow for export diversification in CIS countries, by replacing raw materials (mainly grain) with finished products. This enables the reduction of risk introduced by price volatility in the world market (Shepotylo 2012; Ksenofontov et al. 2012). This brief review highlights the importance and specific details used for evaluating agro-industrial sector investment projects in the studied countries – the role of social factors, participation of multiple decision-makers, and exposure to multiple risk factors. However, practical examination of various evaluation methods for agro-industrial projects is not thoroughly presented in current economic literature. In particular, it is of great interest to compare result consistency of evaluations performed with different criteria and methods. Such examination is important, both for project developers and for customers interested in seeing multi-criteria investment project evaluation. In Russia, for example, with its technological and economic stratification in the agricultural sector, there are no mechanisms for harmonizing the interests of key decision-makers in regards to the evaluation of projected agribusiness projects and their solvency (Zaharov 2006; Kalugina 2011; Vasina 2012). The results of this study are based on data collected by the author in the course of more than fifteen years of work for Israeli companies on economic modeling and business planning for agro-industrial projects.",
1.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,15 May 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-7532-1-2,Capital accumulation with and without land market liberalization: beyond the “Win‐Win” situation,December 2013,George Vachadze,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Food prices, which almost doubled between 2006 and 2008, had a major impact on the perception of food insecurity. Rising food prices hit hard to the balance of payments of many food importing countries. In order to insure themselves, those countries started to acquire farmland under their control. Reports from the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) estimate that during the last decade tens of millions of acres of farmland has been acquired by countries where the consumption of agricultural commodities far exceeds the production (see Von Braun and Meinzen‐Dick ([16]) for more details). Food‐importing countries with land and water constraints but rich in oil resources, such as the Gulf States, or countries with large populations and food security concerns, such as China, Japan, India, and South Korea, are seeking opportunities to produce food and biofuel crops overseas (see Borras et al. ([3]) for more details). Land acquisitions are occurring mainly in developing countries like Brazil, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Madagascar, Pakistan, Philippines, Uganda, Sudan and others, where production costs are relatively low and where land and water resources are more abundant than in the investor nation (see Vidal ([15]), Cotula et al. ([5]), and Allen ([1]), for more details). Many powerful international institutions, such as The World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the US Millennium Challenge Corporation, are actively advising national governments in developing countries to allow a large‐scale acquisition of domestic land by foreigner investors (see Li ([11]) and World Bank ([17]) among others). These international institutions argue that a large‐scale land acquisition is a way to reduce poverty through transfer of technology and technical know‐how from developed to developing countries and improve the overall efficiency in the agricultural sector in general. While the robust empirical evidence about the impact of foreign land ownership on economic growth is lacking, many developing countries have already simplified their land ownership laws for foreign firms and governments.a The speed of land acquisition has provoked opposition from farmers’ organizations, human rights groups, and other social movements as they raise concerns that foreign land ownership can have a negative impact on poor local people, who risk losing access to and control over the land on which they depend too much.b In addition, unrestricted foreign land ownership could cause a spike in property prices so that citizens of the low and middle class are never able to afford land again.c In the present paper, I take a small step toward reconciling two conflicting views about land market liberalization: one is a “win‐win” view, typically encouraged by the World Bank and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, and the other “win‐lose” (win for rich and lose for poor) view, usually supported by numerous non‐profit organizations such as La Via Campesina, the Oakland Institute, GRAIN, Food First, and many others (See for example Nierenberg and Pollack ([13])). To this end, I analyze a general equilibrium model within which I can investigate the effects of land market liberalization on the dynamics of capital accumulation and on the well‐being of a nation. The world economy consists of identical countries that differ in their levels of agricultural sector productivity and the initial capital stock. The model is set up in such a way that, in the absence of land market liberalization, a country with a relatively more productive agricultural sector converges monotonically to a unique steady state and achieves higher capital stock, higher wage income, higher consumption, and higher welfare in general.d This result can be tempting to conclude that poor countries will benefit from the land market liberalization if such liberalization comes with the transfer of more efficient agricultural technology. In this paper I demonstrate that, as a result of land market liberalization, the unique steady state can lose its stability property and two asymptotically stable steady states come in existence. The unique steady state can become unstable because, with the integrated land markets, the land price in different countries must move together. This creates a disadvantage for relatively poor countries because of low income elasticity of agricultural demand. The land market will crowd out domestic investment in capital and will create a negative spillover for next generations. That is to say, a low aggregate investment in capital lowers the income of the next generations of the same country, creating a downward spiral of low‐income/low‐investment in capital. The opposite force will operate in a relatively rich country which because of land market liberalization will face relatively low land prices. This will create an upward spiral of high‐income/high‐investment in capital. As a result, a “win‐win” outcome is not necessarily guaranteed through the land market liberalization even if such liberalization comes with the improvement of agricultural sector productivity in the relatively poor country. The paper is organized as follows. Section The model introduces the model with a simple, analytically tractable structure, which is capable of capturing the effect of the land market integration on the dynamics of capital accumulation. Section The autarky case demonstrates the existence and uniqueness of an interior steady state and show its stability property under rational expectations dynamics. Section Two country model considers the world economy in which foreign land ownership is allowed and the productivity of agricultural sector is equalized. In such a set‐up, I show that the foreign land ownership right can cause the long‐run divergence of otherwise symmetric economies. Section Conclusions summarizes results and concludes.",1

However, European governments have been very reluctant to adopt radical approaches to solve such problems (Rootes, [2012]; Hisschemöller and Sioziou, [2013]). In this context, bottom-up measures have emerged in several countries with a view to promoting awareness campaigns and practical action aimed at environmental sustainability (Caracciolo and Lombardi, [2012]). By their very nature, such measures are set up by individuals who offer their time and resources to start up collective action initiatives at the local level. This has major implications for the theory of public goods. Indeed, no ""rational selfish"" individual would be willing to contribute to the production of a public good even when, in a condition of cooperation with other individuals, this contribution would entail a reciprocal benefit (Liebe et al. [2011]). This assumption, known as the “zero contribution thesis”, has been contradicted by some theoretical and empirical cases (Olson, [1965]; Ostrom, [1991]; Gibson et al. [2005]; Ostrom, [2010]; Sayfang [2010]). However, the production of a public good entails the non-excludability of individuals from (direct or indirect) use of the good itself, also for individuals who do not contribute to supplying the good. This clearly provides an incentive to rely on the contribution of others and use the good as a free rider. When such a situation occurs, it is referred to as a social dilemma (Olson, [1965]; Dawes et al. [1986]; Ostrom, [2000]). A social dilemma may be defined by a situation where each member of a group gains a better payoff if he/she pursues his/her personal interest but, at the same time, everyone benefits from the fact that all members of that group aim at a common interest. Better and more sustainable management of common resources is achieved when the rules concerning the use of common resources are defined by involving economic subjects who are in a situation of interdependence (Ostrom, [2000]; Ostrom [2010]; Ostrom and Walker [2003]). The social norms that arise as a result of interactions aim to reduce the problem of free-riding, since they are based on relations of reciprocity and trust (Ostrom, [2010]). This assumption is a core idea in the theory of public goods and collective actions. Following this line of reasoning, social/personal norms and the consequent behavior of individuals involved in collective action assume a key role in ensuring sustainable use of such goods, achieving significant, long-lasting success. Such success is assured by the rules put in place in virtue of a reciprocal consensus within the community (Berkes, [1987]). This is why, in order to achieve a collective action with high payoffs, it is necessary that individuals share social norms of cooperation. However, individuals show different willingness to start reciprocity and then collective action. More precisely, as illustrated by Ostrom ([2000]), collective action may be initiated thanks to the presence of conditional cooperators. Therefore, individuals “who are willing to initiate cooperative action when they estimate others will reciprocate and to repeat these actions as long as a sufficient proportion of the others involved reciprocate” (Ostrom, [2000] - p. 142). Put differently, when some individuals initiate cooperation, others learn to trust them and are more willing to adopt reciprocity themselves, leading to higher levels of cooperation. Conditional cooperators are thus the source of relatively high levels of contribution in the management of common resources. From here it emerges that social dilemma and trust in other people’s cooperation represents the most important determinants that affect collective action. Several types of collective action have relevance to natural resource management. To the best of our knowledge, scholars have restricted their studies only to long-surviving cooperation systems, like use and governance of forests (Agrawal and Goyal, [2001]; Antinori and Bray, [2005]; Gibson et al. [2005]), irrigation systems (Meinzen-Dick et al. [2002]; Fujiie et al. [2005]) and food community (Migliore et al. [2014], [2015]). The existence of different types of individuals allows the assumption that among economic actors some are able to contribute to the management of common resources. To understand whether conditions to generate collective action exist, dilemma concern and trust in other people’s cooperation are not sufficient predictors of such behavior. The present study aims to ascertain what determinants most affect farmers’ willingness to contribute to common resources. The hypothesis underlying the study is that an altruistic behavioral approach, using psychological constructs, could be useful to predict the individual’s decision in sharing cooperation norms. Cooperative behavior is more likely when economic actors are aware of the consequences and aware of the responsibility of their action on others, in a context featuring social dilemma and trust in other people. Among public goods, an important role may be played by biomass production in an agro-energy chain. The empirical study was conducted in an area in the province of Avellino (southern Italy), most affected by soil erosion problems. The main crop in the area is currently wheat. The study focused on the willingness of farmers to contribute to the public good through biomass production. The biomass crop suggested was Arundo donax (Giant Reed); it was chosen because of its high biomass productive efficiency, its ability to significantly mitigate soil erosion risk (it is a multi-year crop), and for its capacity to yield an income comparable to wheat. Participants in the proposed, though hypothetical, agro-energy chain were informed of the positive environmental effects of producing the crop in question: increased production of agro-energy means a reduction in pollution emissions (Kotchen and Moore, [2007]); and contributes to mitigate soil erosion risk. About 175 face-to-face questionnaires were administered to farmers in September-November 2013. Schwartz’s norm-activation model (NAM) variables were collected (Schwartz, [1977]; Schwartz and Howard, [1980]). A principal component analysis was performed on NAM variables, allowing identification of five psychological constructs namely: social dilemma, awareness of responsibility, personal norms, trust in other people’s cooperation and awareness of consequences. Factorial scores of the above constructs, as well as some farmers’ and farm characteristics, were implemented in a Tobit model in which the dependent variable was the amount of land stated by farmers potentially involved in giant reed cultivation. Four out of five psychological constructs proved statistically significant with the expected sign, showing that an altruistic behavioral approach, by using psychological constructs, is useful to predict the individual’s decision to adopt cooperation norms. The paper is organized as follows: in section Norm activation model of pro-social behavior we review the theoretical framework for describing farmers’ motivational attitudes toward participation. In section Methods we describe the data and the empirical model, while results of the econometric model are presented in section Results and discussion. Conclusions follow, including some important caveats and limitations.",6
2.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,25 October 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-014-0017-y,"The adoption of technologies, management practices, and production systems in U.S. milk production",December 2014,Jeffrey Gillespie,Richard Nehring,Isaac Sitienei,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Over the past two decades, the U.S. dairy industry has experienced significant structural change that has been accompanied by increases in the adoption of productivity-influencing technologies, management practices, and production systems (TMPPS). A number of factors can be attributed to changes in TMPPS usage by dairy farmers, including the capacity of some TMPPS to allow for realization of benefits associated with economies of size and/or improved efficiency, as well as changing consumer tastes and preferences for milk produced under specific production systems. The research presented in this paper adds to past literature on dairy technology adoption by analyzing the drivers that have influenced the use of TMPPS in the U.S. dairy industry, estimating new 2010 aggregate adoption estimates for these TMPPS, and analyzing the adoption diffusion of these TMPPS over the past two decades. There have been large changes in numbers of dairy farms, total milk production, and milk production per cow in the U.S. over the past 20-years. From 1991 to 2010, total milk production increased by 30%, the number of farms decreased by 66%, and milk production on a per-cow basis increased by 42%, showing significant changes in the industry structure and productivity over the period. Clearly, average farm size increased along with cow productivity. A major contributor to this structural change has been the adoption of TMPPS that have allowed for greater economies of size and increased cow productivity. Farmers generally adopt a TMPPS if it serves to increase farm profit and fits within the farm's resource constraints. In deciding whether to adopt a TMPPS, the farmer must consider whether it would change output quantity, output price, and/or cost of production. For example, use of recombinant bovine somatotropin (rbST) serves to increase milk produced per cow, but in areas where non-rbST premium milk prices are provided, a lower effective price per unit is received for milk produced under the technology. Furthermore, adoption would serve to alter production costs. In addition to the costs and returns associated with a TMPPS, farmers must consider whether adoption can occur given land, labor, capital, and credit constraints. For example, adoption of a pasture-based system may not fit within the farm's resource constraints if insufficient land is available for grazing or the land is in a higher-value use. A number of studies have addressed factors influencing the adoption of various combinations of TMPPS in dairy production, most using limited dependent variable models to assess factors influencing usage. Table 1 describes each TMPPS and provides a brief summary of previous work for each. The most recent comprehensive study addressing TMPPS usage in U.S. dairy production was Khanal et al. ([2010]). The present study differs from theirs in several important ways. First, they analyzed 11 TMPPS; we analyze a fuller set, 19. Second, their analysis used mean comparison tests to compare usage on the basis of five farm and farmer demographic drivers, while we use multivariate analysis (logit) to analyze usage with 16 drivers, including farm, farmer demographic, and regional variables. Thus, we were able to fully account for the influence of adoption drivers used in the logit regression models. Third, their analysis focused on adoption drivers in 2000 and 2005 while ours focuses on the more recent 2010 data. Fourth, our analysis uses the full set of USDA Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) and Farm Costs and Returns Survey (FCRS) data, dairy versions, since 1993 to examine aggregate adoption over a 17-year period. Though this period is not sufficient to examine full diffusion of most technologies from introduction to equilibrium, it provides insight into TMPPS use patterns over an extensive period of diffusion. The analysis of technology adoption and its determinants in agriculture has a rich history. In an early classic analysis of the technology adoption process, Griliches ([1957]) examined the diffusion of hybrid corn in the U.S., showing that technology diffusion followed an S-shaped, logistic curve from introduction to equilibrium. This shape implies that adoption diffusion starts off rather slowly, speeds up, and eventually levels out. He further showed strong influences of region on adoption rates, suggesting that identical adoption diffusion curves do not exist under all conditions. Cochrane ([1958]) discussed the agricultural treadmill, addressing how early technology adopters generally benefit the most economically, with late adopters being forced to either adopt or exit production. The analysis of technology adoption in agriculture increased throughout the 1960s and 1970s. By 1985, Feder et al. ([1985]) had reviewed the extensive literature on technology adoption in developing countries, discussing the major adoption drivers. The literature addressing technology adoption in agriculture has expanded since then, with a large body of work conducted on adoption determinants, the extent of which will not be fully discussed here. A substantial amount of this work has dealt with the U.S. dairy industry, much of which is discussed within this paper with respect to each of the TMPPS. In this paper, in accordance with Feder et al. ([1985]), we use the term, ""aggregate adoption"" to refer to the portion of U.S. producers using each TMPPS. Adoption diffusion, on the other hand, refers to the ""process of spread of a new (TMPPS)"" (Feder et al., [1985]), in our case throughout the U.S. We categorize the major TMPPS used in U.S. dairy production as computerized and/or automated technologies, breeding and/or biological technologies, management practices, and production systems. Each TMPPS analyzed in this study is described and discussed in Table 1. Computerized and/or automated technologies refer to technologies that utilize computer hardware and software to enhance the efficient use of resources and/or provide information to the farmer. These technologies included in our analysis are Computerized Feed Delivery System, Computerized Milking System, On-farm Computer to Manage Dairy Records, Accessing the Internet for Dairy Information, Automatic Take-offs for Milking Units, and Holding Pen with an Udder Washer. Breeding and/or biological technologies refer to biological advances that result in greater reproductive and/or production efficiency. These technologies included in our analysis are Artificial Insemination, Sexed Semen, Embryo Transfer, and rbST. Management practices refer to methods farmers use to impact productivity, with or without the use of a specific technology. Management practices included in our analysis are Regularly Scheduled Veterinary Services, Use of a Nutritionist to Design Feed Mixes or Purchase Feed, Keeping Individual Cow Production Records, Forward Purchasing of Inputs, and Negotiating Price Discounts for Dairy Inputs. Production systems differ if switching from one to another involves a fundamental change in the way the farm is managed on a daily basis. Production systems included in our analysis are Milk Cows Three or More Times per Day, Use of a Dairy Parlor, Pasture-based Milk Production, Organic Milk Production, and Controlling the Breeding and/or Calving Season. Note that use of our selected TMPPS does not necessarily increase production or efficiency. For example, pasture-based systems generally require more land and less variable input per unit of milk relative to conventional systems, while producing less milk per cow. Pruitt et al. ([2012]) similarly categorized TMPPS for U.S. cow-calf farms, without separating the technologies into subcategories.",10
2.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,01 October 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-014-0016-z,Crop substitution behavior among food crop farmers in Ghana: an efficient adaptation to climate change or costly stagnation in traditional agricultural production system?,December 2014,Zakaria A Issahaku,Keshav L Maharjan,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Climate is one of the most important inputs in agricultural production system. The hard truth that the world is getting hotter and drier is of a major concern to many a developing country dependent on agriculture as their main livelihood source. Low precipitation and increased frequency of extreme events such as floods and droughts can reduce crop yields and increase risks in agricultural production in many countries located in the lower latitudes. In Ghana, agriculture is largely rain-fed, and the vagaries of the weather determine agricultural productivity. Farmers usually respond to reduction in crop yield by putting more land into cultivation. It is therefore no wonder that yield levels of major food crops are significantly lower than their potential levels, indicating a potential of raising outputs of major food crops through crop productivity growth. Cassava, maize, sorghum, rice and yam have yield gaps of 57.5%, 40%, 33.33%, 40% and 38%, respectively (MOFA [2007]). Increasing agricultural growth by land expansion may not be sustainable because farmers are not only limited by plot size in their possession but also difficulties associated with managing large tracts of land under cultivation including labor availability and loss of forest cover. Increasing production of major staple crops can be enhanced by utilizing the land more intensively thereby closing these crop yield gaps (Breisinger et al. [2009]). Crop intensification is an option mainly for commercial farmers, since they are more likely to be linked to national markets and international agribusinesses and be able to invest in agricultural technologies. Smallholders in developing countries do not have much access to agricultural inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides and improved seeds. Besides crop intensification, agriculture production growth could also be reached using sustainable agriculture technologies which are extensively promoted by international development agencies and research centers (Branca et al. [2013]; Garrity et al. [2010]). It is imperative to note that adopting intensive farming and other farm practices is not free from the adverse effects of changing climate. More recent literature points to the adverse impact of changing climate on crop productivity. A review of climate impact literature on various crops by Knox et al. ([2012]) indicates that yields of cassava, sorghum, millet and maize will decrease in West Africa through adverse effects of climate change. Warming and drying exacerbate stresses in crop plants, potentially leading to catastrophic yield reductions: It reduces water availability for irrigation; it also reduces soil fertility through increased oxidation of soil organic carbon; and it also increases incidence of pests, diseases and weeds. Sagoe ([2006]) used crop simulation model to analyze climate change impact on root crops in Ghana and the results indicate reductions in yields of cassava and cocoyam under all projected climate scenarios. Analysis of projected climate change impact in Ghana's initial communication to Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) also indicates reductions in yields of maize in the transition zone, located between the forest and the savanna ecological zones in Ghana (GEPA [2001]). The afore-mentioned analyses and other similar studies are based on crop simulation models which show relationship between environmental variables including climate and the growth of crop plants. The effect of climate on crop yield may be more complex than just mere climate-crop plant growth relationship. Other factors can reverse an otherwise positive or negative effect of climate on crop yield. The failure to take into account the role of non-environmental variables denoting farm or farmer characteristics and/or management practices by farmers may undermine the use of crop simulation models in climate research. Further, research on the impact of climate change on agricultural production has mainly focused on the effect of climate and its variability on individual crops, while the potential for adapting to climate change through crop substitution has received less attention. Crop switching has not generally been captured by the climate change. Based on national survey data, this paper intends to extend this line of analysis by using the production function approach, which considers and incorporates some socioeconomic variables in analyzing climate impact not only on crop yield, but also on farmers' planting decisions. Analysis of this nature is intuitive because food farmers especially in developing countries may not respond to price/profit incentive but rather higher yield or output. This therefore makes necessary it to investigate the alignment of yield-maximizing behavior of food crop farmers with planting decisions. In the next section, a review of some adaptive responses to adverse on-farm conditions by farmers is carried out.

Alcohol consumption is a public health priority. Following for example Wakabayashi ([2013]) and Corrao et al. ([2000]), a regular but moderate consumption of alcohol in general can have a positive effect on health by increasing the level of HDL cholesterol and reducing the risk of heart and vascular diseases, though other studies do not report positive health effects of low or moderate alcohol consumption (Estruch et al. [2014], WHO [2007]). The discussion is complex and still ongoing. However, there is consensus that excessive alcohol consumption can be detrimental to health in that it can lead to liver cancer, liver disease, higher blood pressure, stroke, or mental decline (Rehn et al. [2001]; Schwartz et al. [2013]; Sabia et al. [2014]). In addition, excessive alcohol consumption can also have negative psychological and behavioral consequences. It can lead to higher rates of crime or violence (Jacobs and Steyn [2013]; Fergusson et al. [2013]) and have negative economic effects, leading to substantial higher state costs (Sacks et al. [2013]). Policy measures have been shown to reduce alcohol consumption and to be a cost effective health care intervention (Xuan et al. [2013]; Doran et al. [2013]). Nevertheless, alcohol taxation and its effectiveness is still a controversial discussion point in Switzerland and other European countries (for an overview of the different alcohol policy regulations in Europe see e.g., FOPH, [2014a]). While total alcohol consumption in Switzerland has been decreasing slightly since 1990, with a current per capita consumption of about 8.5 liters of pure alcohol per year (SAB [2013]), excessive forms of alcohol drinking like binge drinking have been increasing, especially among young people (FOPH [2013]; Annaheim and Gmel [2004]). Therefore, Switzerland is currently debating a tightening of alcohol legislation. While wine is excluded from the alcohol tax, beer and spirits are heavily taxed. The current legislation has the purpose of a positive health effect on one hand and a fiscal benefit on the other, with annual tax revenue of about 440 million Swiss francs (FDF [2009]). In order to assess the effect of a new tax on consumption, especially in the case of heavy drinkers, the estimation of price elasticities is crucial. However, price policies may be superfluous if changing income level affects consumption (Aepli and Finger [2013]; Gallet [2010]). Therefore, an estimation of income elasticities as a supplement to price elasticities is necessary. An additional tax burden to reduce light or moderate drinkers’ consumption levels may not be desirable with respect not only to social aspects but also concerning health effects, depending on which assumptions are made with respect to the health effects of low or moderate alcohol consumption. In the case of heavy drinkers it is clear that a reduction in consumption would reduce public health costs and decrease social problems. To address the question of how price and income affect demand for alcoholic beverages in Switzerland, we estimate final demand price and income elasticities separately for light, moderate, and heavy drinking households based on a repeated cross-sectional household expenditure survey. We combine several recently used methods into one demand system, expecting that price and income responses are not constant among the three segments. Switzerland is a particularly interesting case due to its comparatively high purchasing power. Findings from the Swiss case can also be transferred to a considerable extent to other European countries. Elasticity estimates based on household data are scarce. Most studies rely on time-series data (Gallet [2007]), which limits the ability to estimate elasticities for different household segments. Furthermore, most studies did not investigate possible substitution effects between alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages. Our study contributes to filling this gap and allows a more detailed understanding of alcohol demand with respect to the demand response of different household segments. We apply a two-stage quadratic almost ideal demand system (QUAIDS) (Banks et al. [1997] [for application see e.g., Abdulai [2002]; Jithitikulchai [2011]). It uses cross-sectional data from the Swiss household expenditure survey from 2000 to 2009, which contains data from more than 34,000 households. Final demand elasticities are estimated for food, beverages, and other products and services at the first stage and for wine, beer, spirits, and several non-alcoholic beverages at the second stage. Due to a high zero consumption for some product groups, we modified the QUAIDS using Shonkwiler and Yen’s approach ([1999]) (for application see e.g., Thiele [2008]; Tafere et al. [2010]) and corrected for possible heteroscedasticity by applying a parametric bootstrap. We received missing price data by using the method recently proposed by Majumder et al. ([2012]), further developed by Aepli and Finger ([2013]), and by introducing a variable for seasonality and trend applied by Aepli and Kuhlgatz ([2014]) for the same expenditure survey. Furthermore, we corrected for endogeneity of the expenditure variable in the model by using the augmented regression technique. Heeb et al. ([2003]) analyzed the effect in Switzerland of a price reduction on spirits in 1999. The reduction was due to a tariff reduction under the WTO agreement and they focused on heavy drinkers using a longitudinal survey. Overall, spirits are rated as inelastic, whereas low volume drinkers are more elastic than high volume drinkers are. This would mean that taxes should reduce light or moderate drinkers’ level of consumption more than the heavy drinkers’ levels (Manning et al. [1995]). Kuo et al. ([2003]) used the same period as Heeb et al. ([2003]) with the price reduction due to the WTO agreement to estimate demand reaction to the price decrease. They found that young people in particular responded with higher demand, whereas people aged 60 or older did not respond at all to the price change. The paper is structured as follows. In Section Theoretical framework and two-stage budgeting, we describe the theoretical framework and the two-stage budgeting system, and in Section Data description and price computation, we present the descriptive statistics and indicate how price data are generated. Section Estimation procedure and elasticity calculation summarizes the estimation procedure and the elasticity calculation. The income and price responses are discussed in Section Results and discussion, while Section Conclusions and policy implications concludes.",6

Rice provides 20% of agricultural gross domestic product, 40% of calorie and 25% of protein requirements in the Nepalese diet from cereals (MoAC 2010a). In spite of this, rice yield in Nepal is 2.9 t ha-1, which is lower than that of neighboring countries (India-3.5 t ha-1, Bangladesh-4.4 t ha-1, China-6.6 t ha-1), and the world average (4.2 t ha-1) (FAOSTAT 2012). In addition, there is high (50%) disparity between potential and national average rice yield in this country. One of the reasons for this is poor access to quality seeds by farmers, which is evident from the poor seed replacement rate (SRR)a. The recommended SRR for self-pollinated crops including rice is 25% but its SRR was only 8.7% in Nepal in 2010. This means only 8.7% of the total rice area received quality seed in that year, and the rice seed required for the remaining area was supplied from informal sources such as rice grain reserved from previous season’s harvest or local exchange of rice seed with neighbours (SQCC 2011). Also, the share of the government corporation also known as ‘National Seed Company’ in rice seed supply in 2010 was only 17%, and rest of the seed was supplied through development projects, farmers’ groups, cooperatives, and agrovets–small traders supplying agricultural inputs (SQCC 2011; Pokhrel 2012). The involvement of private companies in rice seed supply is quite low (<5%), which might be due to low profit margin and high fluctuation of rice seed demand in the market (Almekinders et al. 1994; Lal et al. 2009; SQCC 2011). In Nepal, rice is grown from Tarai (from 70 m to 650 m above mean sea level-amsl) to hills (up to 3,050 m amsl-the highest rice growing altitude in the world), with the dominance of small farmers (average land holding 0.8 ha per household with 50% of households have <0.5 ha) (CBS, 2003). Also, variation exists across the production plots of the same household in terms of irrigation facility and soil characteristics (MoAC 2010a). To address opportunities and constraints associated with the above-mentioned variations together with climate and market factors, farmers tend to diversify their rice varietal portfolio using both modern (those developed from research organisations) varieties and local landraces (Gauchan et al. 2005; Khanal & Maharjan 2013). This demands a mechanism that supplies a wide range of rice varieties to farmers in a cost effective way. From the 1990s, government and Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) started facilitating farmers’ groups and cooperatives (also called as community-based seed producer organizations-CBSPOs) in rice seed production and marketing through action research, and development projects (Lal et al. 2009; Witcombe et al. 2010). Government statistics show that 146 registered CBSPOs with 3,500 members (households) were involved in rice seed production in 2009. The majority of these registered CBSPOs (80%) are from the Tarai region, the food basket of Nepal, contributing 70% of the total rice produced in the country (MoAC 2010b). The CBSPOs have also been promoted in other countries of Asia and Africa to contribute in the local seed supply of various food crops including rice (David 2004; Bishaw & van Gastel 2008; Srinivas et al. 2010). It is believed that CBSPOs could produce and market rice seed in a cost effective way because these activities are handled by farmers at local levels. Also, farmers are in a better position than other actors such as government agencies and private companies to select appropriate rice varieties suitable for local niches due to their experience in rice farming and informal networks (Almekinders et al. 1994). In spite of the great potential of CBSPOs in supplying seeds of different rice varieties at local level, it is not clear how small farmers could increase their participation in marketing (Almekinders et al. 1994; Setimela et al. 2004; Pokhrel 2012). Very few studies have been published on this issue (David 2004; FAO 2010; Srinivas et al. 2010; Witcombe et al. 2010), and the focus of these studies is on the ability of CBSPOs to cover marketing (processing, storage and distribution) costs and provide additional benefits to their members (farmers) using estimated seed production data. These studies might have limited policy implications as the estimated production data would be less likely to represent the actual volume of seed sold by households in the market. This is because in developing countries the cereal seed industry is in an early development stage, and farmers tend to sell part of their agricultural produce in the market and the remaining output is consumed at home, and/or exchanged with neighbours as seed or grain (Amekinders & Louwaars 1999). Since rice seed production is carried out at household level and marketing through their organization, household characteristics could play a vital role in farmers’ performance in rice seed marketing. This article intends to measure the impact of households’ socio-economic factors on rice seed marketing.",4

[2012]). Since the introduction of voluntary measures in Regulations 2078/92 and 2080/92, the protection of natural resources and the quality of the environment have been addressed in all agricultural policy reforms and now form the core of the Rural Development Program (RDP) of the European Union. These linkages were strengthened by the 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Reform. The provision of environmental goods is addressed by both CAP pillars, cross-compliance belonging to the first pillar and the second axis of RDP measures belonging to the pillar II. Cross-compliance is based on a set of environmental rules as a condition for receiving Single Farm Payments (SFPs). Since environmental concerns represent the main justification to maintaining the payments (Hodge [2012]), increasing focus has been given to the effectiveness of the environmental measures of the CAP. One of the main issues is a joint design of agri-environmental schemes (AES) in order to improve the provision of environmental goods (Bartolini et al. [2012]). In fact, cross-compliance rules have been set as the baseline for the implementation and quantification of agri-environmental payments, which in turn require additional environmental recommendations (Scheele [2008]). As a result, cross-compliance provides an overall minimum environmental quality standard and prevents the fragmentary and uneven provision of environmental goods by AES (Juntti [2012]). Since Agenda 2000, a greater amount of the RDP budget has been allocated to AES in order to encourage farmers to adopt environmentally friendly practices. However, in spite of a relatively high AES budget allocation (about 2.5 billion Euros of EU funds per year), both the scientific literature and policy evaluation reports have reported weaknesses in the design, implementation and evaluation phases of AES (Oréade-Bréche [2005]; Purvis et al. [2009]). Recently the European Court of Auditors ([2011]) criticised 1) the low level of targeting of AES, 2) the low linkage between incentive systems and the environmental benefits provided, and 3) the weaknesses of the current evaluation and monitoring systems in measuring environmental benefits and in the additionality measuring. The objective of this paper is to analyse the provision of environmental goods through agricultural activities and investigate the determinants of this provision, highlighting the relevance of the Common Agricultural Policy. This aim is pursued firstly by quantifying an environmental quality indicator based on the concept of High Nature Value (HNV) farmland and, secondly by testing Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) techniques and spatial econometric models. Where an HNV farmland indicator is used as a proxy of changes in the maintenance of natural and semi-natural systems, spatial econometric models lead to a better formulation of causality when distribution is affected by spatial heterogeneities and associations (Brady and Irwin [2011]). We made an empirical analysis of Tuscany region. The Region has a heterogeneous distribution of habitats (Mücher et al., [2009]) and agricultural systems, due to the varying orography, climatic and market conditions. The main novelties of this paper are represented by the HNV index developed for the ex-post analysis of Tuscany and the correction of the results by adding a spatial pattern. The remaining paper is structured as follows. In the next section the concept of HNV and the indicators applied are reviewed, then the methodology applied is presented and the results are discussed. Finally, in the last section the conclusions of the research are presented.",9

Agriculture in most African economies is on smallholder basis. In sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and the Pacific, the agriculture-dependent population is over 60%, while in Latin America and high-income economies the proportions are estimated at 18% and 4%, respectively (World Bank [2006]). Most of the smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa are confronted with multifaceted challenges. These problems require several interventions such as institutional reforms that facilitate efficient rural service delivery, development of markets, creation of physical infrastructure, and government policies that are supportive while ensuring a stable and conducive political environment. Smallholder farmers require systems that are responsive to their needs: access to markets, market information, market intelligence and effective farmer organization as the agricultural sector in developing countries transforms towards commercialization. According to Pingali et al. ([2005]), smallholder farmers in most developing economies find it difficult to participate in markets because of numerous constraints and barriers. These are mostly reflected in the hidden costs that make it difficult to access input and output markets. Transaction costs are the embodiment of access barriers to market participation for most resource-poor smallholders (Delgado [1999]; Holloway et al. [2000]). A fundamental transaction cost these farmers face is the cost of obtaining information (Shepherd [1997]). Though neoclassical economists essentially assume that information is costless, this assumption does not match reality, especially in developing countries (Stiglitz [1988]). The fact that information is not costless has important implications for contracts and transactions, as has been pointed out in work pioneered by Coase ([1937]) and later expanded in Coase ([1960]). Commercialization studies such as Goetz ([1992]), Key et al. ([2000]) and Makhura et al. ([2001]) have identified high transaction costs as one of the key reasons for smallholder farmers’ failure to participate in markets. Most are located in remote areas with poor transport, market infrastructure and lack of reliable information on markets and potential exchange partners. In some instances, these transaction costs are so high that markets can be said to be ‘missing’ (Omamo [1998]; Key et al. [2000]). The adoption and use of multi-stakeholder platform (MSP) in most recent times has the potential to address the high transaction cost incurred by smallholder farmers with regard to market information. The three most targeted regions in Ghana for most agricultural development projects are Northern, Upper East and Upper West Regions. The regions are inundated with high levels of food insecurity and poverty due to over-reliance on rain-fed agriculture under low farm input conditions. About half of the population of the area face annual food deficit and are net buyers of food (GSS [2008]). Nearly 80 percent of the population depends on subsistence agriculture with very low productivity and low farm income (MoFA [2010]). Several programmes have been designed over the years especially in the rice sector to address the food insecurity and poverty levels in northern Ghana. One of the major interventions was the Multinational NERICA Rice Dissemination Project which sought to contribute to poverty reduction and food security in Ghana through capacity building, technology transfer and production support. The Commercial Development of Farmer Based Organization (CDFO) of the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) Programme was an intervention in addressing one of the objectives of the Food and Agriculture Sector Development Policy II (FASDEP II). The objective was to enhance increase competitiveness and integration of farmers into domestic and international markets. To overcome the market constraints of producers, farmers were organized into Farmer-Based Organization (FBO) to access credit and engage in bulk purchase and group marketing to lower the transaction cost they incur in marketing. Agricultural Business Centres (ABCs) were established to enable farmers to access market information on prices, standards and advisory services. The other component of the MCA program sought to strengthen input delivery systems and financial institutions that advances credit to farmers. The intervention however failed to use the integrated approach such as innovation platform to address the marketing problems of the farmers. Most of these interventions fail the test of sustainability after the completion of the entire project. In an attempt to address the weak linkages among the rice value chain actors as well as increase in rice production in Ghana, the Africa Rice Center (AfricaRice) in collaboration with the Savanna Agricultural Research Institute of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR-SARI) established two Multi-Stakeholder Platforms (MSP) in two rice development hubsa in northern Ghana. The Multi-Stakeholder Platform establishment was used to facilitate open communication and collaboration among various actors within the value chain to promote collective resource management. The platform serves as a point of entry, operationalization, validation and dissemination of agricultural technologies. Sustainable development of the rice sector and the rice value chain through an MSP approach prompts key stakeholders to identify and prioritize their needs, concerns, constraints, and vision for key activities and interventions. They also act as a governing entity that coordinates decision-making at local, regional, and national levels regarding rice sector development in the long run. The MSP was also intended to assist farmers overcome their production, marketing and post-production challenges in the regions. In northern Ghana, the MSP for the rice sector consists of researchers, producers, processors, traders, financial institutions, input dealers, tractor operators and policy makers. The platform brings together all the necessary stakeholders of the rice sector to dialogue on ways of increasing rice production to enhance food security with Savanna Agricultural Research Institute providing the backstopping. Introduction, operationalization, validation and dissemination of all rice development programmes in the region occurs on the platform. All the various actors play a significant role in ensuring a boost in the rice sector as well as strengthening of the rice value chain. Most established platforms are confronted with some challenges which include meeting and sustaining participants’ interest, effective participation and collaboration, conflict resolution and collective action. Despite the benefits of the platform especially in transforming the rice value chain system, it is critical to identify the potential factors that are likely to influence farmers’ willingness to participate in such a platform as well as the constraints associated with participation. Currently, there is no documented evidence of the factors and constraints limiting farmers’ willingness to participate on innovative platforms especially in the study area. It is against this backdrop that the present study attempts to fill the gap in knowledge. The documented factors and constraints will serve as the basis for addressing the sustainability issues regarding the intervention. The study contributes significantly to the scanty literature on MSP and also serve as a guide for future implementation of similar platforms in other parts of Africa. Finally, facilitators of MSP and rice development programmes will benefit from the knowledge generated by the study.",31

Consequently, the development of policies that target increasing agricultural productivity is the governments’ typical domestic reaction to the challenge of reducing poverty and increasing food security in rural areas. While the adoption and dissemination of innovative farming practices eventually contribute to improvements in productivity and income (Awotide et al. [2013]), effective resource use and a well-organized farm management are expected to boost their sustainability (Karimov [2012]). In this respect, education is an essential factor that plays a key role, both in increasing the efficiency of resource utilization and in bettering the organization of farm. Welch ([1970]) states that education is a strong complement of most of the factors of production utilized in crop production. A recent macro study by Reimers and Klasen (2013) finds that education positively impacts agricultural productivity worldwide. At the micro level, many studies, including Mathijs and Vranken ([2001]), Alene and Hassan et al. ([2003]), and Assadullah and Rahman ([2009]), find a positive relationship between farmer education and efficiency. Other studies such as Llewellyn and Williams ([1996]) and Chirwa ([2007]), however, do not observe any significant connections. Hence, the prevailing literature is rather indecisive, which suggests a need for further research. This study investigates the issue by analyzing survey data from Uzbekistan, which is a cotton producing transition country. In general, the support of agriculture in transition economies has entered a new phase, with large-scale structural adjustment programs that focus on agricultural transformations. Specific reforms included land tenure policies and farm restructuring, which have been extensively reviewed in the literature (Liefert and Liefert [2012]). In this period, access to improved agricultural knowledge has become a priority because rural inhabitants who are not knowledgeable enough in farm production started obtaining agricultural land. New market mechanisms also required the acquiring of new sets of skills to run farms efficiently. In these regards, donor financed agricultural development programs stressed farmer supported educational programs and the establishment of extension services. To some extent, domestic rural policies also included launching agricultural training programs and improving the role of agricultural advisory service organizations. In other words, educating farmers to be efficient and productive under changing environment has become the primary concern for all. Few efficiency analyses in the case of Central Asian (CA) countries (Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Kyrgyzstan) have been conducted. One such work is by Tashrifov ([2005]), who estimated the technical efficiency (TE) of cotton producing regions in Tajikistan. While this study found production inefficiencies among the cotton regions of the country, it exercised regional aggregate data that might not carry valuable evidence for efficiency differentials at the farm level. This work aims to fill the gap in the literature and contribute to the ongoing policy discussion with regards to improving resource use efficiency. The specific objectives of the article are threefold: a) to evaluate the TE of cotton producers using the theoretically consistent stochastic frontier model (SFM); b) to investigate the significance of some of the farm related factors that are believed to influence the households’ input use in cotton production, and c) to re-examine impact of knowledge indicators on resource use efficiency. Cotton continues to be the number one agricultural crop in Uzbekistan; it is considered a strategic commodity because of its standing as a source of rural employment and foreign exchange (Rudenko [2008]). The country produces approximately 3.5 million metric tons of raw cotton and roughly 1.0–1.2 million metric tons of cotton fibre per annum. While these figures are relatively low, when compared with the ones achieved during the Soviet period, Uzbekistan is still considered a major world cotton producer and exporter (USDA [2012]). Cotton production in the country is under state control. Hence, everything related to cotton has a national significance and priority. Achieving higher yields is a major concern for those involved in the entire cotton value chain. The primary burden of the crop, however, is still on the shoulders of farmers, who must meet annual production targets (state quotas). According to the contract between a farmer and the state, a farmer is committed to market 100% of the harvest obtained from the leased land to the state cotton ginneries (Aminova and Abdullayev [2009]) at predetermined prices. In return, the state’s semi-controlled organizations supply subsidized inputs through an extensive credit program. Since the price of the cotton is fixed (there is small price change depending on the quality), farmer can achieve higher margins only by increasing yields and efficiently using input resources. However, yield numbers at the country level illustrate that cotton production has decreased since independence (Guadagni et al. [2005]; USDA [2012]). This decline is believed, in part, due to the inefficient use of resources. Because the official statistics do not include resource use data, it is difficult to acquire accurate information about the intensity of resource utilization in cotton production. However, some reports discuss the over- or under-utilization of inputs. For example, according to ScanAgri Sweden AB for the ADB ([2008]), raw cotton produced per kilogram of fertilizer decreased from 11 kg to 8.8 kg between 1995 and 2005 (ADB [2008]). Moreover, raw cotton in terms of per kilogram of fuel dropped by 1.2 kg over the same period. While these numbers are low when compared to other countries with analogous climate conditions, the cost of producing cotton is high. In this regard, the strengthening of the efficiency of cotton production is one of the key objectives of the government of Uzbekistan. The study enlightens this issue in the context of frontier efficiency analysis by looking at some of the factors that are assumed to influence cotton production. It particularly stresses the role of knowledge indicators in efficiency improvements and empirically examines their significance. Overall, the study provides some interesting findings for the international audience by discussing the case of a transition country located in the CA.",10

For that purpose, it is necessary to promote self-motivated behaviour to raise the awareness of various aspects of food-related behaviour. The policy framework that stimulates self-motivating behaviour will play an increasingly important role as civil society progresses toward a greater number self-motivated citizens. In this context, the Basic Law on Food Education was established in Japan to take advantage of this trend. After a long discussion of whether the state should intervene in personal life, the Basic Law on Food Education was enacted in 2005 in Japan and aims to enhance national awareness of matters related to food and nutrition and to eventually improve behaviours related to food and dietary aspects in daily life Maff ([2010]). Basically, although behaviours associated with food and health are personal matters in which the state should not intervene, it has been said that self-motivating measures that aim to enhance health awareness have been increasing in importance amid the deterioration of many aspects of health in every industrial society. This is a common issue facing these countries. The focus of education on food differs from one country to another due to differences in issues of health, food security, and dietary heritage, including local foods and communal integrity because food has a connection with many aspects of life (McMichael [2000]). Therefore, food education involves a wide range of generations, from children to the elderly, and also involves a wide range of concerns such as the awareness of various aspects of food, health, the environment, and the local community. In this regard, food education is not limited to education in schools, but includes the realm of adult education, which tries to transform the framework of behaviour of adults over time (Mezirow [1997]; [2003]). Nevertheless, in the arena of agricultural economics, food education issues have not been fully addressed despite intensive studies on food consumption and issues of food safety. Education has externality because education of the public enhances economic efficiency, which benefits the whole society (Arai [1995]). Food education has the same effect. This is because an increase in food awareness improves people’s health and results in a reduction in medical costs and food waste, which eventually benefits the entire society through better resource allocation. A self-motivating policy framework, however, often ends up with merely setting goals without any concrete results. In this respect, to ensure the effectiveness of a self-motivating framework it is necessary to enlarge the domain of self-motivating behaviour. This is also necessary from the aspects of financial constraints that the public sector commonly faces and of the maturation of a civil society. Thus, the authors believe that it is necessary to explore the factors that determine the willingness of people to take part in volunteering to offer food education in connection with attainment of policy goals under a self-motivating policy framework. Although care should be taken not to expect too much from volunteers, in order to reduce administrative costs and promote the progress of a self-motivated civil society this point should be clarified. Although a simple questionnaire survey was conducted to better understand the national awareness of food education issues by central and prefectural governments at the time of enactment of the law (Cabinet Office [2007a]; Kanagawa Prefecture [2007]) and studies regarding specific food-related issues have been conducted in many countries, to our knowledge, there has been no full-scale research on the awareness of food education and willingness of individuals to volunteer to offer food education. In this paper, those who volunteer are understood to be people who undertake economic behaviour that intentionally accompanies externality. We approach the issue by the following steps. First, based on a literature review, we present conceptual and empirical models for volunteer behaviour. Second, based on a questionnaire survey of 3,000 residents in Matsudo, an urban municipality that comprises an extended metropolitan area, we quantitatively explored what and how inhabitants’ attitudes are connected with daily food-related behaviour and also estimated a willingness determinant model for participation as a food education volunteer taking into account the complementary role among generations. Finally, we give policy recommendations for a more participatory way of conducting a food education program. In reviewing the literature on food education topics that covered a wide range of aspects, we could find very few studies on food education and volunteering per se although food choices and food and nutrition policies have been widely examined from economic viewpoints (Evenson [1981]; Blaylock et al. [1999]; Kenkel and Manning [1999]). Studies that we reviewed dealt with aspects related to food education and consciousness of food itself, such as food safety, food and health, waste of food and environmental issues regarding food in relation to the community. First, as for food education issues, Edwards and Hartwell ([2002]) examined primary school children’s attitudes toward and knowledge of fruits and vegetables from the viewpoint of a balanced diet. Pivarnik et al. ([2009]) statistically examined knowledge of food safety and food safety education among high school teachers and supported the need for a food safety education program. Roe and Teisl ([2007]) investigated consumer reaction to labeling of genetically modified foods. Heslop et al. ([2007]) examined the behaviour of single working mothers in performing food-related household tasks. Scott et al. ([2009]) performed a statistical examination of outcomes of a safety education program for consumers on practices in using fresh produce and concluded that the food safety education program was effective in teaching consumers. von Normann ([2009]) described the increasing importance of food education at school based on results of an empirical examination of the impact on food patterns in German children based on lifestyle and knowledge of food. Lautenschlager and Smith ([2007]) examined the effects of community gardens on dietary behaviour of youth and found that garden programs had a positive impact on food choices, knowledge of nutrition and cooking skills among youth. In relation to the aspect of environmental and community issues, Chappell and LaValle ([2011]) focused on the relationship between food security and biodiversity and argued that the two things are not mutually exclusive by using alternative agricultural practices. Griffin et al. ([2009]) estimated food waste across an entire local community. DeLind ([2011]) explored the effectiveness of contextual analysis of local food movements. Kerton and Sinclair ([2010]) focused on the significance of consumer participation in local organic agriculture and the learning experienced through that participation as a way of transformative learning advocated by Mezirow ([1997, 2003]). Hughner et al. ([2007]) pointed out that demographics and beliefs of organic food consumers were more heterogeneous than generally perceived. Kemp et al. ([2010]) examined the ‘food miles’ concept from the revealed preference survey of UK consumers and found that consumers respected this concept much less than expected. Iyer and Kashyap ([2007]) explored the positive conditions for consumer participatory recycling and noted that the provision of incentives and information was effective in increasing participation. Now, turning to health issues, McGinnis and Meyers ([1999]) discussed nutrition and health policy by focusing on the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and drew on broad policy interventions. Robinson and Smith ([2003]) investigated the connection between health conscious consumers, body mass index (BMI), and attitudes about sustainably produced food and found that health conscious consumers were more likely to be female, older, more educated, earn a higher income, be more active, and have a healthier BMI than those who were not health conscious consumers. Cash et al. ([2005]) investigated possible health benefits of “thin subsidies”, consumption subsidies for healthier foods, in the United States. Walsh and Nelson ([2010]) found the continuing influence of parents on adolescents’ dietary behaviour by investigating the link between diet and health from a questionnaire survey of adolescents in Northern Ireland and recommended practical nutritional education for balanced dietary behaviour. Chang and Nayga ([2011]) highlighted the connection between mothers’ nutritional label use and children’s obesity and noted that mothers’ nutritional label use leads to a lower probability of children becoming overweight. Visschers et al. ([2013]) conducted a cluster analysis of nutrition information usage and health and nutrition interests and identified four segments with different demographics. Twiss et al. ([2003]) focused on the role of community gardens to enhance public health in improving the quality of life, which is supported by local leadership and volunteers. This topic is also connected with a community building effect. Second, we could not find studies on volunteers who provide food education, so we reviewed studies on volunteers in general, which seem to be classified roughly into two categories: motives or recruitment issues and issues of effects. First, with respect to motives, Allison et al. ([2002]) statistically examined motives of volunteers in the community by comparison of two kinds of data sources and predicted the frequency of volunteering. Bussell and Forbes ([2001]) mentioned that those who are well educated, female and over the age of 50 are more likely to volunteer. Callow ([2004]) explored the motives for volunteering among retirees and found that the heterogeneous nature of senior citizens should be considered for volunteer recruitment. Thus, the profile of pro-volunteer citizens has been clarified, although, on the other hand, heterogeneity of the pool of volunteers should be borne in mind. Freeman ([1997]) revealed that the standard explanation of the labour supply for volunteering accounted for a minor part of volunteer behaviour and that volunteering is a ‘conscience good’, which is something that people feel morally obligated to do when asked, but which they would just as soon let someone else do. Handy et al. ([2000]) developed the net-cost theory that hypothesized that the public perception of volunteering will be based on the perception of the net cost incurred by the individual and empirically verified this hypothesis from a cross-cultural perspective. This net-cost theory provided suggestions in building our conceptual framework below. As to studies that evaluated the effects of volunteering, Brown ([1999]) assessed the dollar value of volunteer activity in the U.S and concluded that the overall value was understated when the gains accruing to volunteers themselves were included. Handy and Srinivasan ([2004]) evaluated the economic value of the net benefits of hospital volunteers and found a quite high value for every dollar spent. Hager and Brudney ([2005]) explored the measure of net benefit that takes into account both benefits and challenges of a volunteer program. Mook et al. ([2005]) examined an accounting paradigm that considers the value of volunteer contributions. Bowman ([2009]) applied microeconomic theory to the evaluation of volunteering and pointed out that the positive externalities that volunteers generate to society as a whole were not well calculated. In short, we can say that evaluation of the economic value of volunteers is worthwhile although an exact evaluation of the entire value of volunteering is difficult due to positive externalities. With respect to food education in a Japanese context, Adachi ([2008]) urged the necessity for nutrition education from a holistic perspective on food and nutrition. Mah ([2010]) examined food education in Japan from the perspective of decentralized public health governance. Kimura ([2011]) discussed issues of food education in Japan from the viewpoint of privatized and gendered food knowledge. Ohe ([2012]) examined the educational function of agriculture. Earlier Ohe ([2011]) evaluated the educational function of dairy farming with an economic framework as a process of internalization of a positive externality. To summarize, there is extensive literature mentioning that participatory and educational programs are effective tools to raise food-related consciousness among people. Nevertheless, it should be noted that no study dealt with the willingness to become a food education volunteer either at the conceptual or empirical level from an economic point of view.",1
2.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,04 July 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-014-0005-2,"Farm types and their economic characterization in complex agro-ecosystems for informed extension intervention: study from coastal West Bengal, India",December 2014,Rupak Goswami,Soumitra Chatterjee,Binoy Prasad,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Adoption of new technologies in agriculture is of central interest to both academicians and policy makers since this is directly related to the efficiency of an agricultural research and extension system (Bozeman [2000]). Higher adoption ensures higher return on investment in research and development and creates a cycle of production-led impact on economy and rural livelihoods. Unfortunately, there are numerous examples of technologies with great potential that have not been accepted by farmers, especially the smallholders of the developing countries. Quite often, these technologies do not fit well into heterogeneous smallholder systems, which need specific technological solutions. Such inherent variability often influences farmers’ response to various technologies that aim at improving farm productivity and natural resource management (Lal et al. [2001]; Emtage and Suh [2005]). Unfortunately, both in agricultural and social sciences, complexity and diversity has been under-perceived and undervalued resulting in their neglect, under-estimation and exclusion from government statistics and policy framework (Chambers et al. [1989]). The archetypal Green Revolution technologies and ‘transfer-of-technology’ paradigm has also historically failed to cater to the needs of these diverse resource-poor agro-ecosystems in the developing countries (Pender and Hazell [2001]). Extension offered blanket recommendation for wide geographical areas and was largely used as a deterministic ‘dart gun’ (Roling [1988]), i.e. ‘take the technology and transfer it to farmers’. The heterogeneity of the farming systems for which different technologies are needed, has been ruefully ignored. Thus, study of farm typology is of practical interest for precise and effective technological interventions. Farm typology study recognizes that farmers are not a monolithic group and face differential constraints in their farming decisions depending on the resources available to them and their lifestyle (Soule [2001]). Ellis ([1993]) observes that small farmers are always and everywhere typified by internal variations along many lines. Although every farm and farmer is unique in nature, they can be clustered into roughly homogeneous groups. Developing a typology constitutes an essential step in any realistic evaluation of constraints and opportunities that farmers face and helps forwarding appropriate technological solutions, policy interventions (Ganpat and Bekele [2001], Timothy [1994]; Vanclay [2005]), and comprehensive environmental assessment (Andersen et al. [2009]). Moreover, typology studies are of paramount importance for understanding the factors that explain the adoption and/or rejection of new technologies (Kostrowicki [1977]; Mahapatra and Mitchell [2001]). The heterogeneity of farming systems are created by a host of biophysical (e.g. climate, soil fertility, slope etc.) and socio-economic (e.g. preferences, prices, production objectives etc.) factors (Ojiem et al. [2006]). Researchers have examined factors such as farm resources such as cash and labor (Tittonell et al. [2007]), infrastructure such as agency and markets (Tittonell et al. [2006]), management practices (Tittonell et al. [2005]) and technological level (Gómez-Limón et al. [2007]). Few others have used string of factors together to explain the heterogeneity of farming systems (Ojiem et al. [2006]; Bidogeza et al. [2009]; Guto et al. [2010]; Tittonell et al. [2010]; Rowe et al. [2006]). The selection of factors that define farm typology varies greatly from study to study and may be governed by the purpose of research. For example, farm typologies were used to study appropriate fertilizer application (Tittonell et al. [2006]), resource use efficiency (Zingore [2007]; Tittonell et al. [2007]), water use efficiency (Senthilkumar et al. 2009), or overall classification of farm types (Bidogeza et al. [2009]), IPM (Leeson et al. [1999]) and may sometimes be crop specific in nature (Mwijage et al. [2009]; Reckling [2011]). Most of the farm typology study has focused on socio-economic and agro-ecological factors for classification of farms. Economic factors have been less used, especially in small-scale studies, for classifying farms (USDA, ERS [2000]; Briggeman et al. [2007]; Andersen [2009]). With economic characterization of farms as the objective at hand, the present study assumes that classification of farms based on economic returns from farm enterprises, along with other related non-economic factors, will give more effective insights into the farm type identification. Indian farmers are heterogeneous in terms of agro-ecology and resource endowments and the transfer of appropriate technology requires careful targeting. This problem is exacerbated in complex-diverse-risk-prone coastal agro-ecosystems of the country covering approximately 10 Mha cultivated area, which is characterized by a host of bio-physical and socio-economic constraints coupled with diversity in livelihoods. At present, agricultural research is based on primarily 15 agro-climatic zones and 127 sub-regions based on comprehensive research review of states (Khanna [1989]). Socio-economic and structural factors are not reflected in such classifications. Economists classify farmers based on landholdings, which is not comprehensive enough for classifying complex farming systems. Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) used several factors for classification of farming systems, but the bases were more discussion-based with limited statistical applications, perhaps due to functional purpose of the classification (Sanjeev et al. [2010]). At the micro level, classification of farmers might be of practical use for localized technological solutions and extension support. During the height of farming system research and extension paradigm, conceptualization of recommendation domain wanted to address this issue. A recommendation domain is a group of farmers whose circumstances are similar enough that they are eligible for the same recommendation (Harrington and Trip [1984]). This led to informed decisions in part of technology managers and higher rate of technology integration in smallholder systems. Classification of farming situation by the farmers has also been suggested by some authors (Conroy and Sutherland [2004]; Goswami et al. [2012]). However, these were more project-based and were hardly mainstreamed in the national research and extension systems in the developing countries (Frankenberger et al. [1989]), India being no exception. Participatory research is not mainstreamed in National Agricultural Research System in India and state-owned monolithic extension system is not prepared to deal with the need of small farms in diverse ecosystems (Glendenning et al. [2010]). This leads to poor adoption of technology and large yield gap (Aggarwal et al. [2008]). Extension support and policy intervention also suffers due to lack of informed decision by public extension. Although there has been experimentation with reorganized and decentralized systems of technology assessment and refinement and revitalized public extension systems, development of sound analytical tools for targeting extension has remained undermined till date. A sound methodology for profiling farm typologies will help in rapid transfer of appropriate technology, precise extension support and development of policy environment sensitive to immense diversity of smallholder farms in coastal saline India. Macro-economic perspective on this systematic problem leads us to the examination of efficiency in agricultural research and extension system. Ruttan and Hayami ([1984]) cites the shortcomings of ‘induced innovation’ model (Hayami and Ruttan [1981]) that considers factor prices and user demand to induce the development of appropriate technology and the widely cited ‘diffusion of innovations’ theory (Rogers [1962], [1995]) that assumes diffusion to have taken place in an institutional vacuum. Unlike the neoclassical theory in economics, New Institutional Economics recognized the importance of institutions in explaining uneven performance of economies (North [1997]) and suggested that this type of analysis can lead to the necessary institutional developments vis-à-vis technical developments generated by R&D systems (Kydd [2002]). Within the extension science literature, responses could be traced in the form of Agricultural Knowledge and Information System (AKIS) concept (Engel [1995]) that sees agricultural innovation as a function of multi-stakeholder process. Roling ([1988]) departed from Rogers’ theory towards a precise technological targeting and drew on the marketing research tradition (Kotler [1986]) for the same. Increasing focus on the role of institutions in differential economic growth has now added new dimension to the study of technology transfer and appropriate technology (Hall and Yoganand [2004]; Radulovic [2005]). New Institutional Economics (NIE) that makes explicit considerations of institutional arrangement and institutional environment (North [1997]; Williamson [1990]), are now frequently drawn on in the literature on efficient extension mechanisms (that reduces transaction cost and enhances economic efficiency) (Birner and Anderson [2007]; Kherallah and Kirsten [2002]). However, the application of NIE was mostly focused on the budgetary constraints and institutional evolution, markets, and institutional development (Pal et al. [2003]). Methodology for identification of farm types for precise technological intervention and policy support, if mainstreamed, may be beneficial to the institutional arrangement that reduces transaction cost in smallholder agricultural production by providing appropriate technology to the smallholders rapidly. This is even more important in the regime of open economy where smallholders will have to be served with less transaction cost for long-term economic and environmental sustainability. The present study was undertaken to identify the predominant farm types in coastal agro-ecosystem of India and to characterize them by some important socio-economic indicators. The article demonstrates the methodology of farm typology study when farming systems are heterogeneous and in need of appropriate technology for agricultural sustainability.",40

From 2006 to 2013, the FAO international food price index increased by 42 percent in real terms on average, with price of meats, dairy products, cereals, oils and sugars increasing by 31, 59, 60, 47 and 3.6 percent, respectively (FAO [2013]). The literature on the implications of food-price shocks has focused mainly on the economic dimensions of the crisis. For instance, Ivanic and Martin ([2008]) estimated the effect of the 2005/2007 food-price shock in 9 developing countries to be a 2.7-3 percent increase in the overall poverty rate. Yet an evaluation of the nutritional impacts of food-price shocks remains central to any understanding of their full implications. When faced with a sharp decline in real incomes, households may be forced to alter their consumption and dietary habits, substituting expensive food items with cheaper ones or even reducing their consumption outright. Even though these substitutions may provide a feasible mechanism to escape hunger and cope with price shocks, they may be problematic as they would mask a more serious trade-off between nutritious food and cheap food especially when undertaken in the absence of adequate knowledge and understanding of their nutritional implications. Indeed, poor households may already be consuming the cheapest foods and varieties, such as grains, with very little room left for substitutions aimed at mitigating the deleterious nutritional effects of food-price increases (Jensen & Miller [2008]). This may increase the risk of malnutrition and nutrient deficiencies which, in addition for being an immediate health burden, may also impact labor productivity in the short-run and school attendance and performance in the long-run (Behrman [1993]). Despite the overwhelming impact that high food prices may have, it remains a challenge to estimate their effect on consumers’ nutritional well-being in developing countries due to data limitations and the lack of research in this area especially in the Middle East. (Jensen & Miller [2008]) examined the effects of the higher food prices recorded in 2005/2006 on the consumption and nutrition of the urban poor in two Chinese provinces, and theirs results showed that households did not experience significant reductions in caloric intake due to substitution between food items and government interventions. However, using changes in caloric intake as a sole indicator of households’ nutritional status has been subject to criticism because of its sensitivity to climate and geographic changes (Cole & Neumayer [2006]), and because high-energy diets are not necessarily nutritious and healthy (Bowman [2006]). An appropriate evaluation requires more representative and comprehensive indicators such as the changes in consumption of essential micronutrients. Recently, Ecker and Qaim ([2011]) attempted to quantify the nutritional effects of food-price shocks in Malawi and evaluated the effectiveness of both income and price-related policies to improve nutrition, finding evidence in favor of the former. To date, there has been no study exploring the implications of food price increases on malnutrition in Middle Eastern countries, and our paper intends to fill in this gap. This paper follows Ecker and Qaim’s general framework to investigate the impact of the 2004/2008 food-price shock on the consumption of major food commodities and malnutrition in Lebanon, using the changes in macro/micronutrient intakes as a key indicator of the risk of malnutrition. We apply the Almost Ideal Demand System (AIDS) on a sample of 7,431 households, drawn from a national household survey conducted in 2004, to estimate food demand and nutrient elasticities, and quantify the effects of food price-price increases on various macro and micronutrients’ intake levels. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 'Food security in Lebanon' reviews the food security situation in Lebanon; Section 'Methods' describes the data and empirical strategy; Section 'Empirical model' presents the results and discusses them, and Section 'Results and discussion' concludes.",4

2.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,03 January 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-7532-2-1,Price relations between international rice markets,December 2014,Adam John,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The world rice market is seen as a thin market which is used to explain its volatile nature (Siamwalla and Haykin, 1983; Gibson, 1994; Wailes, 2002; Nielsen, 2003; Wailes, 2005; Headey, 2011; and Rapsomanikis, 2011). Two explanations are usually given for why it is a thin market. Firstly, it has been pointed out that the proportion of world rice production traded internationally represents just seven percent of the market (Wailes, 2005; Headey, 2011). In such an event, prices do not reflect the supply and demand conditions of the market (Tomek and Robinson, 1990), it increases search costs and can lead to excessive price volatility (Anderson et al. 2007). The second argument given is that international rice markets have a low level of substitution (Petzel and Monke, 1980; Siamwalla and Haykin, 1983, 1985; Cramer et al. 1993; Jayne, 1993; Chan, 1997, Wailes, 2005; Dawe, 2008) which fragments the world market into even smaller unrelated markets and makes it harder to discover price information (Jayne, 1993). Due to the latter argument, one would expect price relations between international rice markets to be weak with little price transmission taking place across different geographical rice markets. The behavior of international rice prices and trade, however, would suggest that rice markets must be related to some extent, at least in contemporary times. Firstly, the huge surge in international rice prices in 2007-2008 was felt worldwide which transmitted over to most Asian, African and Latin American domestic markets (Demeke et al. 2011). Secondly, major rice exporting nations are competing in some of the same markets, particularly in Africa and parts of Latin Americaa. The aim of this study is to test to what extent international rice markets are related to each other by measuring price transmission using the monthly export rice prices of five major markets taken from FAO’s Global Information and Early Warning System database. The prices are specified into a vector auto regression (VAR) model and the results are interpreted using Granger and Toda-Yamamoto causality tests as well as generalized impulse response functions (IRF). The causality tests are used to verify whether price transmission exists between several major rice export markets from Asia and the Americas. Furthermore, generalized impulse response functions are simulated to provide information on the magnitude and persistence of the price transmission which takes place between international rice markets. Understanding the extent of price relations between international rice markets gives an indication of how well the world rice market functions and even whether it is appropriate to view international rice markets as a single market. It also gives an idea of how competitive exporting countries are and since the causality tests can indicate the direction of price transmission, the testing procedure can also provide an insight into whether there are certain markets which act as price leaders. Rice exporting nations are often reported to distort their export prices in order to stabilize their own domestic markets (Dorosh, 2009; Gilbert and Morgan, 2010; Timmer, 2010; Dawe and Slayton, 2011; Demeke, et al. et al. 2011; Headey, 2011). Headey (2011) and Gilbert (2013) both believe such behavior played a major role in the huge price hikes seen in international rice prices and more recently, the perceived unreliability of international rice markets has led to the promotion of rice self sufficiency polices in many traditional rice importing countries under the guise of national food security (Stage and Rekve, 1998; Chand, 2006; Xiufang and Dwyer, 2008; Seck et al. 2010; Demeke et al. 2011). A problem with these policies is that they are expected to make the world rice market even thinner and therefore more volatile (Jayne (1993; Wailes, 2005). If export prices are found to be related then it would suggest that exporting nations are to some extent responsive to the market’s price movements and therefore not as price distortive as perceived. The study not only tests for the existence of price transmission between international rice markets but also the direction of price transmission. The direction is also of interest as this information can provide further insights such as whether there exists a suitable reference price for the world rice price. International organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) tend to use the Thai export FOB price as a proxy for the world rice price which is sensible since Thailand is traditionally the largest rice exporter. The estimation procedure of this study also allows for testing whether the Thai price is a suitable proxy or whether international rice prices are too isolated and fragmented for there to be a credible world rice price.",10

Tadesse,Bekele A. Shiferaw,Olaf Erenstein,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"There has been much enthusiasm for, and investigations of, the potential benefits of weather index insurance for agricultural risk transfer and mitigation in low income economies (Skees et al.
1999; Turvey 2001; Mahul 2001; Hess and Syroka 2005; World Bank 2005, 2011; Barnett et al. 2008; Carter 2009; IFAD and WFP 2010; Suarez and Linnerooth-Bayer 2010; Shee and Turvey 2012; Cole et al. 2013). Underlying this interest are the widespread welfare losses that arise from large scale covariate weather risks, particularly in low income countries where market imperfections limit effective risk transfer instruments. Smallholders face poverty traps and subsistence consumption constraints, making it difficult to mobilize savings to cope with weather shocks. Climate change exacerbates extreme weather events, further undermining the livelihoods of smallholders who typically depend on rain-fed agriculture (IPCC 2007; Barnett et al. 2008; Barr et al. 2010). In addition to these general welfare and climate considerations, there is an economic interest in weather insurance: its potential to overcome the chronic problems of moral hazard, adverse selection and other forms of asymmetric information that affect credit and insurance markets in rural economies along with low administrative costs and ease in handling claims for indemnities. Weather index insurance payments are triggered by a single and easily observable and verifiable parameter (index) such as rainfall measurements or temperature records common to a particular village or region – which implies that individuals will not have the opportunity or incentive to manipulate records (Skees et al. 1999; Mahul 2001; Turvey 2001; Osgood et al. 2007; Miranda and Farrin 2012). In addition, most forms of moral hazard problems can be eliminated, monitoring costs are reduced, and because the payout is made in reference to the exogenously constructed index, often losses at the farm level do not have to be observed or verified, leading to more efficient and timely processing and payment of claims. These are key potential advantages of weather index insurance over traditional crop insurance schemes, but many pilot projects show that significant improvements in product design and implementation strategies are still needed, especially to enhance demand and uptake. Weather index insurance policy holders (households in a particular locality) will typically receive a payout if rainfall (and/or other weather variable) recorded at a representative weather station during the crop growing season is below the agreed threshold level (trigger point or strike value) (Skees et al. 1999; Turvey 2001; Mahul 2001). This assumes that the ‘representative’ stationFootnote 1 also captures the covariate risks faced by villagers, and that these covariate risks are common. This, of course, is rarely the case in field conditions, implying that there may be households in a particular village with measureable volumetric loss who may not receive any payouts because the weather data recorded at the weather station is considered enough to support crop production (Barnett et al. 2008; Skees et al. 1999). This is referred to as basis risk and is most prominent in areas where climate variability is high (e.g. semi-arid areas or rain shadows near a mountain range). A common assumption and perhaps quite problematic to crop insurance design is the reliance on a single weather station representing an area of 20–25 km radius (Gommes and Gobel 2013). Households and villages within this radius are expected to have homogenous topography and farming systems. However, this simplified assumption of homogeneity of farming systems in index development is problematic for countries with variable topography, soil conditions and more diverse agro-ecologies (Gommes and Gobel 2013). On the other hand, indices such as area yield index (Mahul et al. 2012) developed based on historical average yields for a given area and vegetation index (Turvey and Mclaurin 2012) developed using satellite images have important limitations. For example, average yields may not work when the production conditions are heterogeneous or satellite-based vegetation cover may not differentiate different stresses. However, recent advances in satellite technologies are believed to correct these imperfections (Barrett et al. 2012; Leblois and Quirion 2011) although its cost-effectiveness, correlation with the underlying production risk and ability to discriminate different crops will need to be tested. Despite continued pilot testing of weather index insurance products in low income countries, its actual uptake has been far below expectations (Giné and Yang 2009; Binswanger-Mkhize 2012; Cole et al. 2013). The high price (premium) and lack of trust in the index and its ability to properly predict the risk of loss as well as the credibility of the insurance providers are key factors negatively influencing the demand for weather index insurance (Brans et al. 2010; Cole et al. 2013). Clarke (2011) shows that the low demand for weather index insurance by poor farmers is a rational response to basis risk. For higher uptake, weather index insurance should be cheaper than the current risk management practices of smallholders, such as reliance on social networks and self-insurance mechanisms by owning assets (Binswanger-Mkhize 2012). Others argue that promoting access to productive assets (e.g. land), credit, improved seeds, better agronomic practices and rural infrastructure are the key factors for the poor to build their own capital to self-insure in case of disaster. It is however difficult for the poor to build capital for climate risk management and risk transfers (insurance) in the short run as current consumption competes with future savings. Insurance and credit instruments for smallholders may need to be seen as essential complements rather than substitutes for risk-reducing and profitable technological innovations. This is particularly relevant as technological solutions per se will be inadequate in managing production risks caused by severe climate shocks and extreme events expected under progressive climate change. In this paper, we review experiences in piloting weather index insurance products and examine how weather index insurance could contribute to managing drought risk in smallholder agriculture. We provide insights based on a review of literature, including case examples of weather index insurance pilots in Africa (particularly Ethiopia, Kenya, and Malawi). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents an overview of the traditional drought risk management strategies in smallholder agriculture as a backdrop for weather index insurance instruments, including moral hazard and adverse selection problems of traditional crop insurance; Section 3 summarizes conceptual issues around weather index insurance, its development and implementation challenges; in Section 4, we summarize weather index insurance pilots in three African countries and draw lessons and highlight challenges; in Section 5, we look into the prospects of interlinking insurance with credit or safety nets to stimulate wider uptake and discuss the implications for designing weather index insurance at different levels (macro, meso, and micro), before we conclude in the final section with some suggestions on the way forward.",55

Various studies have described the increasing diversification in farm activities across Europe, including agri-tourism, care farming, educational activities, biomass production, direct marketing, nature and landscape management, and quality food production (see e.g. Revel et al., 2002; Winter and Turner, 2003; Chaplin et al., 2004). Multifunctional agriculture has developed as a result of a number of wider societal and political transformation processes that have influenced scientific and policy approaches in different ways amongst countries and disciplines (Renting et al.,
2009). European agriculture and rural areas are facing multiple socio-economic changes, including a transition from an agriculture-based to a service-based economy. In fact, the image and perception of agriculture and rurality have changed. Farming and rurality are no longer associated with conditions of decline and exclusion, but are perceived as extremely positive realities because of their environmental, social and cultural value (Casini, 2002). Research about new categories of activities carried out by farms, the decision-making processes of farmers, and the economic results achieved by “taking advantage of the attributes of rurality for economic aims” (Basile and Cecchi, 2001) has become complex because of the many functions now attributed to agriculture. In this context of ongoing evolution, Green Care in AgricultureFootnote 1 offers an important connection point between farm activities and these efforts to maintain or promote people’s social, physical, mental, and educational well-being (Haubenhofer et al.,
2010). Green Care in Agriculture has been defined as “the utilization of agricultural farms, the animals, the plants, the garden, the forest, and the landscape as a base for promoting human mental and physical health, as well as quality of life, for a variety of client groups” (Memorandum of Understanding of COST866 Green Care in Agriculture, in Dessein and Bock, 2010 p.11). In particular, Green Care embraces the use of farming practices to promote many social goals, such as the rehabilitation, education and care of disadvantaged people, the integration of people with “low contractual capacity” (i.e. those with intellectual and physical disabilities or drug addiction, convicts, and migrants) and the support of specific target groups in rural areas such as children (kindergarten farms) and the elderly. Green Care is one of the new kinds of activities and services offered by a growing number of farms throughout Europe (eg. Di lacovo and O’ Connor 2009; Van der Ploeg and Marsden, 2008; Wiskerke, 2009) and for this reason it is interesting to investigate the costs and benefits of these activities for farmers and society as a whole. In this context of using farms as settings for social services, our paper presents a study of a new social farming initiative: kindergarten farms or nursery-school farms, which are educational childcare facilities in a farm setting for children from 1 to 3 years old. Besides their important function of caring for children, kindergarten farms can also shape future generations’ eating habits and attitudes to farming. Children learn to appreciate and respect nature and agriculture; they learn about a healthy diet, and the link between agricultural products and food, and come to appreciate the social function of farmers. This is a crucial aspect of care farming in general, as it educates current and future consumers about sustainable production and consumption, an indispensable part of building sustainable food systems (FAO, 2014). Kindergarten farms offer a number of benefits. While school trips to farms enable children to learn specific information about agriculture, the environment, and nutrition (Canavari et al. 2011), youngsters may experience them as an unusual and exceptional event that has no connection with their daily life and world (Montari, 2001). Instead, day to day experience of a working farm has a much more profound impact on children. Moreover, kindergarten farms meet the need for more childcare facilities in marginal areas with low population density, such as mountainous or highly rural zones. These activities also afford a new way to achieve economic diversification, to supplement the incomes of rural people, to promote female entrepreneurship and to help rural women reconcile work and motherhood (Bertolino et al.,
2012). Kindergarten farms are a phenomenon that is spreading rapidly in Northern Europe, especially in Germany. In Italy, specifically in such regions as Veneto, Piemonte, Trentino, Friuli and the Marche, over one hundred initiatives have already been established. The spread of kindergartens farms has been more successful in the regions where policy makers have passed laws to regulate accreditation and other details (Rete Rurale Nazionale 2007‐2013- Task Force Pari Opportunità e Giovani 2009). This study focuses on the main characteristics of kindergarten farms, and examines the value of potential synergies between the worlds of agriculture and education. We look at entrepreneurial models, economic results, types of farming location, and the role of the public decision-maker. Moreover, the study proposes to use the Business Model Canvas (BMC) as a tool for analysing multifunctional farming enterprises. Several studies illustrate how the BMC can be particularly useful in classifying an enterprise and analysing its performance, though they also highlight some interpretative limitations inherent in this approach (Lambert and Davidson, 2013; George and Bock, 2011; Zott et al., 2011; Baden-Fuller and Morgan, 2010; DaSilva and Trkman, 2014; Teece, 2010; Morris et al., 2005; Shafer et al., 2005). In particular, George and Bock (2011) highlight the heterogeneity of the fields of application but criticize the absence of links between research theme, methodologies and findings. Lambert and Davidson (2013), in their literature review on business models, underline some research fields (business and management, information systems and biotechnology) where BMC can be successfully applied. In this context, our study tests the usefulness of the BMC tool for research on agricultural green care.",15

Econometrics models are always based on assumptions, not always testable or falsifiable. In this framework, identification deals with the relationship between the assumptions of an econometric model and the possibility of answering or not, an empirical question using that model. In applied economics the identification problem is a major challenge in many situations. An emblematic is the estimation of the supply and demand equations. Faced for the first time back in the late ’20s (Wright 1928), the identification problem is still very modern and debated (Roberts and Schlenker 2013). A century of research on this topic has lead scholars to propose a myriad of approaches including the use of instrumental variables, the adoption of recursive structures, or the imposition of inequality constraints. The present note aims at reviewing the status of art of identification in applied economics with particular emphasis to agricultural economics. The remainder of the note is as follows: section two summarizes the identification problem providing several definitions, the subsequent paragraph reviews the solutions that have been proposed in a century of research, and finally we conclude with final remarks1.",2
3.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,22 September 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-015-0041-6,Farmers’ self-reported value of cooperative membership: evidence from heterogeneous business and organization structures,December 2015,Eeva Alho,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Innovations in the forms of producer organizations have emerged over recent decades (van Bekkum and Bijman 2006; Hendrikse and Bijman 2002). The relaxation of restrictions on the residual claims of agricultural cooperatives has been a response to the competitive pressures (Chaddad and Cook 2004). Meat production, in particular, has undergone major structural changes in Europe. The pig meat market is highly integrated, both in production and in the processing industry (Pyykkönen et al. 2012). The consolidation process has led to producer cooperatives adopting hybrid business structures, meaning the transformation of cooperatives towards investor-owned firms (IOF), when the cooperatives establish limited liability companies (Bijman et al. 2012). This process is typically motivated by the need to attract risk capital. Cooperatives are owned and controlled by the patrons. Member ownership and control imply that the choice of the organizational form reflects the decisions taken by the members based on their perception of which structure brings them the most value. Heterogeneity in agricultural producer organizations leads to the question of which factors constitute benefits for the members in modern farmers’ cooperatives. Our research strategy was to distinguish preferences at the level of cooperative types without going into farmer-level differences and individual-specific factors that produce differences in preferences. The focus on cooperative types in this paper addresses the topical question of how cooperatives have to change in terms of their member satisfaction and benefit delivery strategies when their cooperative structures change. We utilized a farmer questionnaire to examine the value of agricultural cooperative membership to Finnish milk and meat producers. The survey data, including 682 Finnish agricultural producers in the livestock sector, enabled an analysis of the relationship between the subjective value of cooperative membership and farmer-specific variables. We were also interested in whether the self-reported significance of cooperative benefits to farmers is related to vertically integrated structures. Differences in responses were analyzed with respect to three organization types: marketing, supply, and hybrid cooperatives. Varying the degree of vertical integration means that a member of either of the first two cooperative types is positioned differently from a member of the other cooperative type. Moreover, moving further from dairy marketing and supply cooperative types to a hybrid reflects the structural shift from traditional cooperative forms towards IOF-like structures. With traditional forms, we refer to the definition of ownership rights in Chaddad and Iliopoulos (2013), in which a traditional cooperative is characterized by residual return rights assigned to member-patrons, ownership is related to patronage, voting rights are non-proportional, and the residual claim is not transferable. The following literature review discusses the relevant background theories and empirical evidence and builds the research hypotheses. The paper proceeds by presenting the survey data and the methods. The results section presents the survey findings on the perceptions of membership benefits among farmers and the ordered probit analysis of the effect of background variables, after which the final section concludes and discusses the managerial implications. The existence of cooperatives is traditionally explained as substituting for market failures, serving as a market channel, and in the agricultural sector in particular, bringing countervailing power to farmers (Sykuta and Cook 2001; Hendrikse and Bijman 2002). By organizing market access through a cooperative, farmers are able to benefit from lower costs than they would face by bargaining independently with buyers (Staatz 1987). Transaction cost factors are also present in modern agriculture, which may explain the importance of producer cooperatives in the European food supply chain (Valentinov 2007). Transaction costs are affected by uncertainty, the frequency of transactions, and asset specificity (Williamson 1989; Ménard 2004). Due to its perishability, a dairy farmer is dependent on the frequent and timely collection of milk from the farm, whereas meat is more flexible as a production type (Masten 2000). The obligation of dairy cooperatives to collect all of the milk produced is a valuable membership benefit that economizes on transaction costs and protects specific assets. Consequently, we hypothesized that in our sample, the dairy producers would place greater significance on the cooperative as a stable market channel than the meat producers (hypothesis 1). Large producers may be more dependent on the cooperative as a market channel due to larger asset specificity and potentially large contracting costs if they have to negotiate with several buyers. On the other hand, large producers may have more options due to their better bargaining position and reduced contracting costs for the buyer. In this light, large producers can be hypothesized to be less dependent on a particular cooperative buyer, as Chechin et al. (2013) point out. For small producers, the cooperative offers a safe transaction relationship, and they gain from an improved bargaining position. As the investments in asset specificity and the bargaining power explanations lead to contradicting predictions on the relationship between farm size and the perceived value of a cooperative buyer, we only built a hypothesis on the bargaining power being relatively more valued by small than large producers (hypothesis 2). Empirical evidence indicates that transaction costs influence farmers’ decisions to join and deliver their production to a cooperative. Pascucci et al. (2012) observed that the dependency of farmers on cooperatives increases in relation to the size of their total assets. Their finding suggests that commitment to delivering to a cooperative may strengthen among those farmers who invest a considerable amount in their own production. According to Hernández-Espallardo et al. (2013), satisfying farmer members is crucial to the survival of agricultural marketing cooperatives. They observed the perceived transaction costs to be a more important factor in creating member satisfaction than the producer price. According to Hansmann (1988), an organizational form emerges that minimizes the transaction costs, and ownership costs explain why ownership rights are assigned to particular patrons. In this framework, the emergence of non-traditional organization models of farmer-owner cooperatives is a result of minimizing of the costs of ownership. Evidence from the field indicates that producer organizations typically aim at finding a model that retains the cooperative form and ideology but enables access to non-member equity capital (van Bekkum and Bijman 2006). Gaining access to growth capital from investors has for many been the decisive factor in departing from the traditional cooperative structure (Chaddad and Iliopoulos 2013). The polar opposite to the traditional cooperative in the typology of Chaddad and Cook (2004) is the transformation into an IOF. The majority of farmer respondents in the survey of Alsemgeest and Smit (2012) perceived profit maximization as the goal currently strived for by agricultural businesses, whereas the provision of competitive services to farmers and improving farm profitability, which were voiced as the main goals, were not in the business focus. While milk producer cooperatives in Finland represent the traditional cooperative organizational form, i.e., their organization conforms to the cooperative principles of equal treatment of members, equal voting rights, and unallocated capital (Nilsson et al. 2009), large meat cooperatives have adopted vertically integrated hybrid structures in which ownership and control rights are separated from patronage (Pyykkönen et al. 2012). The role of the meat cooperatives is exclusively to exercise ownership and control rights in the stock exchange listed processing and marketing company. We expected the members of meat cooperatives to value the price and capital benefits more highly than the members of dairy cooperatives (hypothesis 3).",20

The case of durum wheat in Italy,December 2015,Francesco Diotallevi,Emanuele Blasi,Silvio Franco,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The latest Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, the fifth since 1992, has become operational from January 2014. The future of European agriculture has been long debated; now we need to get definite answers (De Castro 2006; Garzon, 2006; De Castro et al., 2012). During CAP negotiations, the EU Parliament reiterated its role in the co-decision process, and asked the Council to be more flexible on still “open” issues. However, at the same time, national governments have opposed renegotiating the terms of the latest compromises. Many meetings took place in Brussels, late in 2013, focusing entirely on the ultimate definition of the new CAP. Although the CAP has been approved, the debate is still going on about greening, which is unanimously believed to be one of the real novelties of this policy reform. Greening has its origins in the European Commission communication of 18 November 2010, in which the need to strengthen the environmental effectiveness of the CAP was greatly emphasised. The European Union had already felt this need since the last programming: in this sense, European rural policy programs, within the context of the second pillar of the CAP, were established in each EU Member State in accordance with these specific outlines, for the funding period 2007-2013 (Adinolfi et al., 2011; Karelakis et al., 2013). The greening component of direct payments aims at supporting environmental commitments throughout the EU, by means of introducing additional payments for public goods (e.g., subtraction of CO2, soil protection, water drainage and quality). These payments are mandatory for Member States (MS) and available to all farmers who voluntarily respect the required environmental commitments. The commitments are relatively easy to apply, as they consist in a kind of “reinforced” cross-compliance. In this perspective, greening arises as remuneration for the production of public goods, in line with the aim of the Europe 2020 Strategy. The debate on this issue, in particular on its implementation, is very intense (Cooper et al., 2009; Garrod, 2009; Hart and Baldock, 2011). The present research estimates the possible effects of the greening instrument of the new CAP. In particular, it evaluates the impact of this measure in different Italian areas that are specialized in the durum wheat cultivation. More specifically, the following research questions are defined: 1. What are the greening influences on the durum wheat sector in Italy? 2. Can the same policy criteria achieve comparable outcomes in areas with a wide structural and climatic heterogeneity? In this sense, the paper may be viewed as an interesting empirical exercise, and it also finds similarities with quantitative and qualitative studies implemented in various contexts (e.g., Heinrich, 2012; Westhoek et al., 2012; Brown and Jones, 2013; Chatellier and Guyomard 2013; Czekaj et al. 2013; Vanni and Cardillo 2013a; Cimino et al., 2014). The authors believe that the qualitative considerations expressed on the compromise reached by the EU Council of Agriculture can be summarised and evaluated only through quantitative application, providing a measure of the net effect that the measures will cause in very different productive and climatic contexts (Povellato, 2012). Being Italy one of the leading durum wheat producers in the EU, as well as a substantial user of raw durum wheat for transformation into products (semolina and, above all, pasta) which represent a major component of traditional Italian food exports, the assessment of the consequences for the durum wheat sector is of particular interest. EU interventions for durum wheat have always been associated with and strongly oriented towards “traditional” production areas. However, with the new reform, the direct support will completely change. Consequently, there is an urgent need to understand how firms working in these production systems can keep maintaining their activity and the present working levels.",8

Therefore, they invest in quality plans by choosing the appropriate QAS, in correspondence with the challenges and threats posed in the external environment by market conditions and public policy measures. Because agricultural production and marketing generate a large number of hazards for consumers and the natural environment, the expansion of QMS implementation is a crucial issue for public authorities, which are interested in the consumers’ health, the quality of life and the agricultural competitiveness. If farm and food businesses are not willing to implement a QMS, the public authorities encourage them properly or oblige them to meet the minimum quality requirements (Segerson 1999; Larsson et al. 2013). If the farm and food businesses implement a QMS and choose the proper QAS as a strategic choice – namely, in correspondence with the conditions prevalent in the market – the gradually increased interest in certified products in the market can motivate businesses to implement a QMS on a gradually increasing basis, leading to a multiplication of certification efforts in agriculture and food and to a diffusion of certification. However, in the case of unfavourable market conditions and of a State-induced implementation of QMS, the conditions cannot be considered favourable for the diffusion of certification, since farm and food businesses’ decisions are determined by public intervention. Thus, it is not easy for businesses to respond effectively to the course of events in the market, as this may be done indirectly, which may lead the agricultural competitiveness to weaken and market opportunities to be lost. In such a case, the diffusion of certification depends more on a continuation or amplification of the State’s proper interventions (Segerson 1999; Hattam et al. 2012; Larsson et al. 2013). Since the quality of the finished food depends substantially on the quality of the primary agricultural products, some studies have dealt with the adoption and implementation of QMS decisions in agriculture and each of them identified a number of determinants of such decisions (Karipidis et al. 2009; Asfaw et al. 2010a, b; Masakure et al. 2011; Muriithi et al. 2011; Kersting and Wollni 2012; Karipidis and Tselempis 2014; Soltani et al. 2014; Veldstra et al. 2014). These studies analyse the adoption/non-adoption and implementation/non-implementation decisions focusing mostly on factors of the internal business environment, adding also, in some cases, one or more factors from the market and/or policy. The present paper goes beyond these issues. It focuses on certified farm businesses and explores the impact of factors of the external business environment on farmers’ decisions, combining the management decision model proposed by Johnson and Scholes (1999) with the idea of Veldstra et al. (2014), who separate organic production decisions into two components. More specifically, the aim of this study is to investigate whether the implementation of a QMS and the pursuit of certain QAS are chosen by farm businesses as responses to market conditions, and thus can be considered part of a ‘market-driven’ approach. We separate the certified farmers’ decisions into two components: QMS implementation and QAS selection. In addition to this, the study incorporates the public policy factors that can contribute, directly or indirectly, to quality improvements in order to identify their impact and thus help public authorities to know the effectiveness of the different quality-related policy measures. The study focuses on fruit and vegetable producers as the first players in the supply chain, because these enterprises are characterised by intensive use of agrochemicals generating a high risk for consumers’ health and the natural environment, making the implementation of a QMS a more crucial choice than for other farm enterprises. The fact that Mediterranean fruit and vegetable production constitutes a significant trading sector of the European food market, which imposes certain quality certification requirements (Kalaitzis et al. 2007), makes certification also a significant strategic choice for farm businesses. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section presents the research hypotheses, followed by a presentation of the discrete choice model and the specialisation of two discrete choice models (for the implementation of the QMS and for the choice of QAS). The third section presents the models’ estimation, results for each model and discussion. The conclusions and suggestions for future research are offered in the last section.",3
3.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,15 April 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-015-0030-9,"Socioeconomic determinants of organic cotton adoption in Benin, West Africa",December 2015,Epiphane Sodjinou,Laurent C Glin,Jonas Hinvi,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Cotton plays a significant economic role for many countries of West Africa. Indeed, in addition to its contribution to the GDP and to total merchandise exports (from 25% to 45%), this sector represents more than half the income for roughly two millions of households in West Africa (Baffes 2007; Moseley and Gray 2008). Despite this economic importance, cotton is a controversial crop, which is at the centre of debates on globalization, structural adjustments, food security, biotechnology, agricultural subsidies, poverty alleviation, and sustainable development (Moseley and Gray 2008). In particular, Benin is among the countries most dependent on cotton (Gergely 2009). In fact, cotton accounts for 40% of foreign exchange earnings, employs 45% of rural households, and provides income to more than one third of the population (MAEP 2011). Accordingly, the Government of Benin gave a significant place to this sector in its development strategy as a tool for poverty alleviation. For long, the cotton sector was governed by a parastatal company called SONAPRA (Société Nationale pour la Promotion Agricole) which had the monopoly over most of the commercial roles relating to cotton production, such as purchase and distribution of seeds and fertilizers as well as pesticides, direct purchasing of cotton from the farmer, and determination of price (Kütting 2004). But, since the beginning of the 1990s the sector has undergone some reforms including the privatization of input supply, introduction of private ginners and creation of interprofessional bodies to take over the sector management, through a highly regulated system precluding competition among ginners (Gergely 2009). However, during the last three years the new institutional arrangement collapsed due to a number of crises that resulted in distrust and mistrust between the government and the private stakeholders (Glin 2014). Despite all the upheavals and changes experienced by the sector, the method of production of conventional cotton has remained virtually unchanged with a strong use of synthetic chemical inputs. Indeed, in order to obtain high quality and competitive cotton fiber on international market, producers are encouraged to use extensively mineral fertilizers and synthesis chemical pesticides. This was particularly encouraged by structural adjustments and neoliberal policies that stressed agricultural intensification as a strategy to achieve food security and poverty alleviation (Glin et al. 2012). In addition to official chemical inputs, other pesticides banned in Benin, including lindane and dieldrin, are smuggled from Nigeria and illegally used in cotton production (Pazou et al. 2006a). Many of these official or illegally used chemical products have adverse effects on environment and both the human and animal health. For instance in 2000, 147 persons were poisoned by cotton pesticides of which 10 fatalities (OBEPAB 2002). In certain localities, the cotton farms are located near rivers and pesticides could “distribute among the river ecosystem components, such as water and sediment, and accumulate in biota” (Pazou et al. 2006b). This context came together with international developments (e.g., the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development) targeting environmental issues and created a favorable situation for alternatives to the conventional farming system (Glin et al. 2012). Taking advantage of this context, OBEPAB (Organisation Béninoise pour la Promotion de l’Agriculture Biologique) with the support of international and national networks introduced organic cotton production in Benin in the mid-1990s as an alternative to address the above mentioned problems. Currently, other organizations including Helvetas Swiss Intercooperation-Benin are active in the organic cotton sector in Benin. The organic cotton relies only on ecological processes and the use of natural resources. It could increase the income of poor farmers through higher sales prices. One important requirement of the organic production is the certification, which entails a regular and effective control and auditing of the production and processing practices to verify and ensure the traceability of the organic products and the compliance with the international organic standard. The cost of certifying smallholdings of organic farmers, particularly in developing countries, favors certification at the level of farmer groups or cooperatives, instead of individual farmers (Glin et al. 2013: 549, see also Lockie et al. 2006; Ton et al. 2007). In West Africa, where rural livelihoods are particularly vulnerable, organic cotton is expected to contribute not only to poverty reduction but also to strengthen households’ resilience (Glin et al. 2013). Furthermore, given its ability to improve soil fertility (soil structure, biological activity, etc.), the risk of loss of production is relatively low in organic farming (Hulsebusch et al. 2007). Besides, several studies proved that organic cotton is more profitable than conventional cotton (e.g., Gbesso 2000; Pacini et al. 2002; Matthess et al. 2005; Eyhorn et al. 2007), provides benefits regarding biodiversity (Hole et al.
2005) and climate protection (Skinner et al.
2014). However, the development of organic cotton has some drawbacks, including the structural difficulties (both actual and perceived) of doing business in sub-Saharan Africa; lack of transport or difficulties to transport organic fertilizer, a shortage of export oriented knowledge (Ferrigno et al. 2005). Furthermore, the development of organic cotton in most sub-Saharan African countries is enhanced by projects funded by Western donors (Ferrigno et al. 2005; Justus 2009). Despite these shortcomings, the production of organic cotton has experienced significant growth over the past decade, moving from 185.2 tons during the 2002–2003 agricultural campaign to 824.3 tons in 2011–2012, representing an annual increase of about 34.5% (Figure 1)a. Currently around 2,500 farmers are engaged in organic cotton production, gaining approximately USD 600,000 as export value for Benin economy. Moreover, during the last five years the organic cotton chain is undergoing a progressive transformation from an experimental, small-scale and donor-dependent initiative towards a market-oriented, large-scale and self-financing transnational commodity network (Glin et al. 2012). The growth of the organic cotton sector eventually convinced the Government to target organic cotton in Benin’s Agriculture Sector Development Plan (MAEP 2011). Over the past two agricultural campaigns, the Government through SONAPRA (a state owned company) was also engaged in the marketing of the organic cotton. 
Trends of organic cotton production in Benin (OBEPAB, 1996–2012).
 Unfortunately, like in most developing countries, very few data are available on organic farming in Benin and West Africa (Kristiansen et al.
2006). In particular, there are very few studies that investigated farmers’ decisions to adopt organic cotton in West Africa. Thus, this study aims to contribute to the understanding of factors underlying farmers’ decision to adopt organic cotton, based on empirical data collected from producers of the Centre and the Northern parts of Benin. In other words, the objective of this study is to assess institutional and socioeconomic factors influencing the adoption of organic cotton in Benin. The identification of factors promoting or hinder the adoption of organic cotton can help to better define policy options and strategies for further dissemination of this type of cotton farming. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The second section, related to data and methods, begins with the description of the sampling and data collection techniques, and then outlines the analytical framework. The results and discussion section (section 3) starts with a descriptive analysis of data collected on conventional and organic cotton producers, and ends with the results of the probit model, interpreted, and discussed in three sub-sections. The fourth section concludes and provides the policy implications of our findings.",27

The case of entomology-based venture creation,December 2015,Stefano Pascucci,Domenico Dentoni,Dimitrios Mitsopoulos,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The global population is growing rapidly and it is likely to reach 9 billion by roughly the middle of this century (United Nations 2014). It is also predicted that more than 7.5 billion inhabitants will be in the less developed countries while the population of the least developed countries is projected to reach 1.7 billion (United Nations 2014). At the same time the world population is increasingly urbanizing. United Nations predictions indicate that about 70% of the population to be living in cities by 2050 (United Nations 2014). This rapid urbanization triggers a growing consumption of meat which for developing countries represents the most concentrated source of vitamins and minerals (Tilman et al. 2001). In addition to that, the growing wealth in developed countries as well as emerging economies, such as China, increases the purchase power of the consumers and thus pushing for a greater demand of processed food from meat, fish and dairy (Tilman et al. 2001). The market globalization triggers even more the consumption of meat products and decreases the types of consumed food products (Yen 2009). Moreover still an important percentage of world population do not have access to sufficient proteins (sometimes reaching extreme hunger levels), and even more people suffer from a form of micronutrient malnourishment (Barrett 2010). Against this background, food and feed from insects appears a promising way to cope with the abovementioned issues (DeFoliart 1997). Insects nowadays are already a major or secondary source of protein elsewhere in the world (i.e. Asia, Africa, Australia and South America). In these areas insects have been a valuable and integral part of the human diet for hundreds of years (DeFoliart 1999) For many countries insects also significantly contribute to the local economies (DeFoliart 1999). In recent years attention for insects as new source of food ingredients has raised also in industrialised (Western) countries (Pascucci and de-Magistris 2013). Many concerns have been raised as well, due to regulatory, cultural and psychological barriers to create and develop an entomology-based food and feed industry (Derkzen et al. 2010). However, despite the scepticism of many stakeholders, several start-ups are trying to step in this industry, thus facing all kind of challenges from both a regulatory and marketing point of view. The co-existence of regulatory and marketing challenges makes the venture creation process a unique case, a kind of “perfect storm” of business venturing in the context of agri-food sector, thus calling for specific attention of both academics and practitioners. In this paper we focus particularly on “how to create a vivid, profit making entomology-based company” in industrialized country context, rather than on general cultural and psychological issues related to insect consumption. In order to answer this research question we first start discussing the issue of new venture creation and radical innovation in the agri-food sector, since eating insects can be perceived as radically innovative in developed countries. We then analyse in more details, what are the main challenges when it comes to setting up a new venture dealing with a radically innovative product, particularly in terms of trust and cooperation within the entrepreneurial team. Based on this conceptual approach we have set-up a “venture creation game experiment” with two entrepreneurs of an European start-up company in the sector of entomology-based food products. In this way we have been able to highlight the main challenges and opportunities of such a business, and namely the role of trust and cooperation. We provide indications for other entrepreneurs and academic scholars who are dealing with venture creation and radical innovation, especially in the agri-food sector. While consumer acceptance remains the dominant (background) strategic issue for an entomology-based start-up company, our results indicate that trust and cooperation between business partners is one of the main challenges for the success of a start-up dealing with a radical innovation.",6

It is a cycle, where in order to compete and grow, an innovative company must act in a technological, technical, policy, and management environment that allows an innovative approach, whereas market conditions must also be ensured. The increase of consumers’ awareness towards environmental concerns, as well as other social and governmental pressures claim the development of new products with less environmental impact by manufacturers (Bocken et al. 2011). To achieve environmental sustainability and do not neglect goals related to economic growth, innovation in green products can be a key factor for companies (Dangelico and Pujari 2010). The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines eco-innovation as “the development of products (goods and services), processes, marketing methods, organizational structure, and new or improved institutional arrangements, which, intentionally or not, contribute to a reduction of environmental burdens in comparison with alternative practices “(Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD 2009). Considering that consumers depend on companies to access the supply for their needs and the growth of this new concept, the research question of this paper arises: From the point of view of consumers and producers, what is the perspective of an eco-innovation market for the food sector in Brazil? The main focus of this paper is to analyse the production and consumption of eco-innovative food in Brazil. The analysis of the production and supply-side aims to identify main motivations for eco-innovation, trends and characteristics of this market using in-depth interviews. These results, combined with the findings from the demand-side, will contribute to increase comprehension about this expanding market in an emerging country. Considering that sustainable consumption is a recent subject in Brazil, identifying the main characteristics of this market will benefit companies of the food sector, both industry and retailing. It is also important to emphasize that Brazil is one of the major food producer and exporter worldwide although the mass scale production is main production pattern. The analysis of the consumer-side aims at investigating conscious consumption behaviour of food in Brazil, specifically, to verify the relationship among personal values, attitudes towards the environment and technology, and attitudes and consumer behaviour towards eco-innovative food. This second phase integrates an exploratory and descriptive phase with consumers. Attitudes represent a disposition to respond favourably or unfavourably to an object, person, institution or event (Ajzen 1988). Values are related to social norms (or behaviour rules), and reflect an internal reference to what has been considered good, beneficial, important, desirable. It has been stated by the literature a great impact of cultural values on consumers’ attitudes towards food consumption (Thøgersen and Beckmann 1997). In addition, personal values affect (usually positively) people’s environmental behaviour, purchase intention and behaviour towards ecological food, e.g. organic food (Grunert 1993; Grunert and Juhl 1995; Hopper and Mccarl 1991; Schwartz 1992). The food sector is a good example for studying the integration between innovation and sustainability for several reasons. Traditionally, the food sector has been oriented towards commodities’ production, however, improvement of quality and efficiency in the process are among the main features for increasing values for the sector. Finally, increasing integration in the food chain emphasizes the relevance of studying “from production to consumption”. Innovation is driven by a greater operational efficiency, but also boosted by the final user’s demand, whose concern with food safety, health, animal welfare, environmental issues has increased (Grunert et al. 2005). Considering the Schumpeterian concept, an innovation needs to be commercially feasible, therefore, the understanding of the end consumer is an important component when analysing industry. Consumers’ perception is an important driver to determine how agents from the food chain can persevere in the market. Trends about how consumers value food products are an important contribution to develop the strategy of food companies (Grunert et al. 1993). In Brazil, the food sector comprises 32,000 companies and employs 1.63 million workers (Brazilian Food Industry Association ABIA 2014). Therefore, for the adoption of a new way of production, and to aggregate environmental sustainability and innovation (and eco-innovation), it is necessary to integrate the chain to ensure the provision of adequate raw materials (production), food processing and supply (food and packaging industry) to reach the consumers who are increasingly more aware in relation to the health and convenience. Furthermore, the environmental impact and the level of emissions from the food sector are considered high (Demirel and Kesidou 2011). This article is structured as follows, after this introduction, in section 2 the theoretical background is described, section 3 explains the method employed, followed by section 4, where the main results are described and discussed. In section 5, the main conclusions are drawn. Eco-innovation is the technological and organizational innovation related to the implementation of the sustainable development (Faucheux et al. 2006). Applying and assimilating innovation and sustainability in business management are crucial to achieve sustainability main objectives (social, economic and environmental) (Korhonen 2001). Eco-innovation is also conceptualized as a redefinition of innovation, such as the types of innovation defined by OECD (product, process and organizational) that are useful, but not enough for studying issues of sustainable development embedded in innovation (Rennings 2000). Eco-innovations hold specific features, such as the importance of creating links and positive trade-offs between the attribute of environmental protection and other critical factors of competitive products and services, such as style, design, price and performance. Furthermore, eco-innovations that succeed are highly dependent on greater participation of stakeholders in their development. Accordingly, they tend to emerge from cooperation between different entities, in addition to the constitution of partnerships among public sector, academia and private sector (Carrillo-Hermosilla et al. 2010). Companies are considered as the main source of social and environmental problems in society. Therefore, more restrictive regulatory policies must be developed by governmental and non-governmental organizations to regulate business companies (Azzone and Noci 1998; Schaltegger and Wagner 2011). Eco-innovation has become an important strategic tool for achieving sustainable development, not only for its potential to reduce environmental impact, but also for improving competitiveness of firms and countries that eco-innovate (Chang 2011; Kesidou and Demirel 2012). Beyond the importance of including environmental concepts in corporate strategy, environmental awareness of consumers is also a relevant variable for production and consumption of environmental friendly products (Horbach 2008). Although eco-innovations can be of lower acceptance (Halila and Rundquist 2011), the start for developing, producing and marketing a new green product is also related to its potential to succeed in the market (Dangelico and Pujari 2010). The perception of value of consumers about the insertion of environmental issues in the development of products is a critical issue. Adoption and diffusion of environmental innovative products depends on consumer’s evaluation (Oltra and Jean 2009). Within this context, values  and consumer’s attitudes can influence on the purchase of eco-innovative food. Consumer’s concern towards ethical, social and environmental issues, but at the same time their demand for varied and affordable food, provides an important and relevant opportunity for further research on the relationship between specific attitudes towards eco-innovative food (AtEco) and its direct antecedent, i.e., attitudes towards the environment and nature (AtEnviro). Additionally, it is reasonable to infer that attitudes towards technology (AtTechno), that reveals consumer perceptions about the prevailing type of food supply in Western societies, e.g., industrial food production systems, should also influence (possibly negative) on consumer’s attitudes towards eco-innovative food. Elsewhere, it is of great importance to incorporate the study of consumer values (collective and individual) for analysing consumer’s attitudes, once values are the main antecedents of attitudes, and allows the creation of the hierarchical value-attitudes model. Due to the profound impact of personal values on food consumption (Thøgersen and Beckmann 1997), their possible influence on conscious purchase of eco-innovative food is the starting point in the phase of the study with consumers. The model in Figure 1 first assumes direct causal relationships between: a) egalitarian values of consumers and their attitudes towards environment and nature (“Collectivism - AttEnviro”); and b) self-promoting values and attitudes towards technological progress (“Individualism - AttTechno”). 
The conceptual values-attitudes model.
 Understanding how these attitudes influence conscious purchase of eco-innovative products is particularly important from the strategic point of view for companies when developing new products, as it reflects the contradictory impact of the influence of consumers’ pro-technological and pro-environment attitudes in relation to consumption of these foods. Preliminary studies indicate the validity of this model (Krystallis et al. 2012; Perrea et al. 2014), what motivates the research of the same model in the Brazilian context. Therefore, for surviving in the market, producers and sellers must produce products with aggregated value for consumers, in a way that they perceive that it is worthwhile to pay an extra premium price, which is higher than conventional products due to its higher production costs (Grunert et al. 1993). The existence of a potential market willing to pay for an innovation is the main condition to invest in an innovation (Dosi 1988). Considering uncertainty as a particular characteristic of innovation, a multi-perspective study, analysing consumers and companies, can be of great importance to the sector. Understand how consumer values and attitudes affect consumption behaviour may reduce uncertainty, and understand the potential acceptance of a product, can reduce risks related to eco-innovators. In addition, interaction between the main actors is expected due to the systemic nature of innovation and can be a key factor for companies to adapt its activities to the given environmental conditions (Asheim and Gertler 2005; Ettlie 1983; Fagerberg 2005). Finally, Azzone and Noci (1998) highlight the role of the government to develop new campaigns, aiming at improving environmental and social awareness. To justify financial investments and to turn feasible to implement innovative environmental solutions, it is important that market awareness arises. The method applied in this research is described in the next section.",8

Fat content, tenderness, appearance, juiciness, are just some of the characteristics that most of the consumers take into account when purchasing pork, apart from the price. Despite this fact, most of the studies about the U.S. pork industry have been carried out considering aggregate commodity prices, and treating the pork product as a non-differentiated good. Against this background, the objective of this paper is to investigate if the existence of product differentiation could be a source of asymmetric price co-movements between certain pork cuts at the retail level. Preference for specific cuts implies that consumers have different marginal willingness to pay for these different pork products. Consequently, their response might be different when prices change. Simultaneously, retailers/wholesalers can price discriminate based on the different attributes of the commodity. This means that sellers might adopt different pricing strategies, depending on the cut, when market conditions change. Conclusively, estimating price dependence while considering pork as a non-differentiated product, would ignore differential responses. Empirical results may not capture the actual pricing behavior. Price asymmetry has been an important topic in agricultural and food economics over a long period of time, since it may be an indicator of market inefficiency. As such, it attracts the attention of economists and policy-makers. Boyd and Brorsen (1988) tested for asymmetry in price adjustments and the speed of price adjustments in the pork marketing channel. Results show that wholesale prices respond symmetrically to farm price decreases and increases. Additionally, there was no significant difference between retailers’ response to wholesale price increases and their response to wholesale price decreases. Goodwin and Harper (2000) used a threshold co-integration model that permits asymmetric adjustment to positive and negative price shocks. Their results reveal important asymmetries. Price adjustment patterns are unidirectional, and information tends to flow from farm, to wholesale, to retail markets. In our study, we empirically estimate retail price dependence between different pork cuts, utilizing the statistical tool of copulas. Copulas offer an alternative way to analyse price co-movements, particularly during extreme market events. Copulas are quite popular in finance and risk management since the late 1990s, but only recently have gained momentum in agricultural economics. Emmanouilides et al. (2013), assessed price dependence in the olive oil market of the Mediterranean (Greece, Spain, and Italy). Reboredo (2012) examined co-movement between international food (corn, soya beans and wheat) and oil prices. Regarding the pork industry, (Qiu and Goodwin 2012) estimated asymmetric price transmission in the hog supply chain using copulas (case of vertical transmission). Their results indicate evidence of symmetry and asymmetry. For the farm to wholesale and wholesale to retail marketing chains, shocks in one market would transfer to the other market. For the farm to retail case, retail prices do not respond to price reduction in farm level prices. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no published work which has examined retail price co-movements between different pork cuts with the use of copulas. The present work is structured as follows: Section “Methods” contains the theoretical framework. Section “Results and Discussion” presents the empirical models and the results. Section “Conclusions” offers conclusions.",5

With a case study based approach authors look at factors determining enduring supply chain relationships. One of the most interesting result is that suppliers are attracted by the supply chain under study due to external economic conditions such as price uncertainty. Moreover, suppliers benefit of a premium price and relationship quality. A second team of researchers explores a radical innovation in the food and feed industry. Their article “The perfect storm of business venturing? The case of entomology-based venture creation”, authors Stefano Pascucci, Domenico Dentoni and Dimitrios Mitsopoulos, takes the reader to the issue of how to create a profit making entomology-based company. Authors first discuss a new venture creation in the agrifood sector. They then analyze the challenges of doing that in presence of a radical innovation. Implementing a venture creation game experiment authors highlight challenges and opportunities of such a business underlying the crucial role of trust and cooperation. Moving geographically and in perspective, Marilia B Bossle, Marcia D de Barcellos and Luciana M Vieira analyze the production and consumption of eco-innovation food in Brazil. In “Eco-innovative Food in Brazil: Perceptions from producers and consumers”, authors focus on both supply and demand sides in depth to see companies’ motivation to adopt eco-innovation strategies, and consumers’ perception. Results add empirical evidence on how values and general attitudes influence behavior towards eco-innovative food in the Brazilian food consumption context. In “Who likes it sparkling? An empirical analysis of Prosecco consumers’ profile”, authors Laura Onofri, Vasco Boatto and Andrea Dal Bianco shift on the concept of certification of quality in a specific Region of Italy where Prosecco wine is produced. This wine can be certified as Controlled Denomination of Origin (CDO) and Controlled and Guaranteed Denomination of Origin (CGDO). The two certifications require different effort due to diverse quality standards, being CGDO stricter than CDO. However, most consumers seem not to make any difference between the two. For that reason authors made a study to elicit the preferences of consumers buying Prosecco in an attempt to understand how to add value to quality certification effort. A probit model was implemented on a large sample of homescan data. A second team of Italian reasearchers explores the social embeddedness of a specific food community network. In “Alternative food networks as a way to embed mountain agriculture in the urban market: the case of Trentino”, authors Emanuele Blasi, Clara Cicatiello, Barbara Pancino and Silvio Franco explore the mechanisms to deliver environmental and recreational value of peri-urban agriculture to the city. The role of traditional agriculture in peri-urban context risks to be replaced by non-agricultural and post-productive activities. So, farms re-organize themselves to move forward a multifunctional approach. One of the multifunctionality is the creation of alternative food network. The analysis is conducted in Trentino, Italy. The main result is the reinforcement of a link between the mountains and the city. Consumers’ attitudes toward these practices are already very positive, thanks to their strong territorial identity. Results are in line with many other studies where it is shown the value creation of alternative food networks and their role in terms of social embeddedness.",4
3.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,29 January 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-014-0024-z,Case study analysis on supplier commitment to added value agri-food supply chains in New Zealand,December 2015,Nic J Lees,Peter Nuthall,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The New Zealand economy is highly dependent on agri-food exports and is unique among the world’s developed economies in that nearly two thirds of exports come from the agricultural sector. For example, Denmark and the Netherlands are the nearest comparable developed economies with significant agri-food export sectors, yet their agri-food exports represent only around 20% of these countries’ total exports. The most significant of New Zealand’s agri-food exports are dairy and red meat products. The dairy sector generated US$ 10.7 billion in export earnings in 2013, representing 28 per cent of total merchandise export value; while the red meat sector generated US$ 4.2 billion in export earnings (Statistics New Zealand 2013). New Zealand’s efficient pasture based production system and small population provide a low cost competitive advantage in the export of high quality meat and dairy products. This dependence, however, makes New Zealand vulnerable to changes in foreign government’s policies and consumer demand in the importing countries, as well as competition from other low cost agri-food exporters. New Zealand has traditionally relied on this low cost competitive advantage (Porter 1998) and focused on improving productivity and efficiency to preserve its position as one of the world’s most efficient agricultural producers. This is now becoming more difficult to maintain with rising production costs and regulatory constraints on agricultural intensification. Because of this, many people are questioning if New Zealand still has a sustainable long-term, low cost competitive advantage. The alternative to maintaining this low cost position would be focusing, instead, on increasing the value of the product (Porter 1985b). This would require a fundamental shift in the focus of New Zealand agriculture. Instead of an emphasis on efficient farm production and increasing scale, the focus would need to be on meeting the needs of selected high value consumers. These consumers are demanding greater variety and quality in the food they eat. They require a consistent year-round supply of high quality, safe food (Fischer et al. 2009; Van der Vorst 2000). They also want food that aligns with their own personal values, which includes credence attributes such as environmental sustainability, animal welfare and fair trade, as well as local and organic production. Meeting these consumer demands is difficult within the constraints of New Zealand’s pasture based agricultural production system, where production volume and product specifications are highly dependent on climate. This leads to a fundamental question. Should New Zealand agriculture continue to focus on low cost, efficient production systems? Or, should it focus instead on developing higher value products, with innovative production systems that can deliver a consistent year-round supply of high quality, safe food and also address consumers’ concerns for animal welfare and environmental stewardship? This change would be a significant challenge for the relationships in the supply chain. The New Zealand agricultural sector has traditionally relied on short-term spot market exchange relationships (McLeod et al. 2011). While these are efficient for large volumes of undifferentiated products they are less effective in meeting consumer needs for differentiated products (Sonka 2003). In a spot market transaction there is little information flow. Information flow is important with differentiated products where credence quality attributes, such as animal welfare are not visible in the physical product at purchase or, even, after consumption (Nelson 1970; Dyer and Singh 1998). Therefore, to meet these consumer needs the New Zealand agricultural industry would need to move away from relying predominantly on a traditional commodity model with short-term, competitive, spot market relationships to a partnership model with increased supply chain commitment involving long-term contracts and to delivering of high quality products to meet customer demands (Fischer et al. 2009). This would require suppliers who are willing to commit to meeting higher product specifications while working with less flexible delivery schedules. It would mean moving from a competitive model to a partnership model (Dwyer et al. 1987; Jae-Nam and Young-Gul 1999; Srinivasan et al. 2011). These partnerships are relationships based on mutual trust, openess, and where the responsibility, authority and decision-making are shared more evenly and there is often an agreement between the parties to share both risks and benefits. (UK Audit Commission 2012; Lambert et al. 1996). In one of a number of reports on the New Zealand red meat sector it was identified that the sector was dominated by commodity supply chains as opposed to differentiated value chains (McLeod et al. 2011). These authors indicated that to address the industry’s problems there needed to be greater trust between processors and suppliers and incentives needed to aligned so that one sector did not profit at the expense of the other. There is, currently, little research on what influences farmers to commit to long-term supply chain partnerships. There is significant descriptive research on the characteristics of supply chain partnerships but little explanatory research. This research aims to address this. New Zealand exports a high proportion of its agri-food products and, despite significant diversification, still relies on a small number of key markets. China has recently become New Zealand’s largest market for dairy products. Over the last 20 years China has moved from being the 31st largest export destination for New Zealand dairy products to the first. This market continues to grow strongly due to rising incomes and urbanisation in China. In contrast, the majority of lamb and venison is exported to the European Union (though China has recently become the largest market for sheep-meat outside of the European Union) (Table 1). Lamb benefits from being counter-seasonal to the European Union domestic supply and 40 per cent is exported by sea freight as chilled cuts. New Zealand has preferential market access for lamb to Europe, with a tariff-free quota of 228,254 tonnes. Venison is supplied into the European Union market primarily in the Northern Hemisphere autumn during the traditional game season, with Germany, the largest single market, taking 40 per cent of total venison exports (Statistics New Zealand 2013). The United States is the main market for New Zealand beef receiving forty per cent of exports with much of it destined for further processing into ground beef. While dairy production is primarily pasture based there is increasing use of supplementary feeding and irrigation to reduce the impact of climate and to increase production. In contrast, New Zealand meat production is primarily produced on un-irrigated pastures with little use of supplements. This enables low cost, year-round outdoor grazing that produces natural, high quality meat products. It also means that production is highly seasonal with significant variation due to the climate (McLeod et al. 2011; Bensemann et al. 2011). Changes in pasture supply, driven by variations in temperature and rainfall play an important role in supply chain dynamics, affecting price, quality and timing of supply (Bensemann et al. 2011).

This is to be based upon multi-level governance (Committee of the Regions 2009) and expansion of the LEADER method, especially in order to implement community-led local development (CLLD) and multi-fund strategies (European Commission's Directorates General AGRI, EMPL, MARE and REGIO 2013, European Union 2013:357–359). In Italy the Regionsa are responsible for implementing these policies through their own programming and for integrating them using other policy tools. Many Regions had already recognised agricultural districts under the Italian law of 2001b. that empowered them to identify Districts in Agriculturec. (DAs) in the form of rural or quality agro-food districts. At the time of its introduction, that law aimed to boost agricultural modernisation, following the new deal promoted by Agenda 2000. Today, with the new programming cycle of European structural policies and common agricultural policy, the important question is, how useful are the DAs and how can they be inserted into the new regional programming framework in order to implement rural development programmes? Despite many studies into regional experiences of DAsd., organic knowledge is still lacking about implementation of the law on a national level, which is still ongoing. Indeed, researching on a national scale has proved very complex for three reasons: i) DAs have become very different “things” in each regional interpretation, so it is difficult to make comparisons among them; ii) DAs are still an open chapter of economic and agricultural research, because of the particular theoretical framework that has been adopted in Italy; iii) the theoretical and legal frameworks are still not fully integrated (Musotti 2001b). We have addressed these difficulties by reconstructing the legislative situation stratified over a twenty-year period – the ‘reconstructive reading’ according to Albisinni (2010) - and by using a fresh approach. Our research aims to create the conditions for comparing experiences which have arisen in concurrence with very different regulatory frameworks and political contexts. Our article also tries to recreate an updated geographical mapping of the phenomenon at national level and seeks to outline the main economic attributes assumed by DAs. On the basis of our findings we offer our initial thoughts on the potential and weaknesses of future use of DAs in the coming programming period 2014–2020. Although this article focuses on Italian agricultural, quality agro-food, supply-chain and rural districts, the issue is placed in the context of international socio-economic literature on the subject. The research may thereby be of more general interest, firstly because clusters and industrial districts are widespread at global level in the agricultural sector and also because of the original approach used for analysing regional policies. Some different instruments, similar to DAs even if not derived from a ‘district’ concept, exist in other European countries, as mentioned below. Agglomerations of companies closely interconnected, specialised and co-located in a specific place have been the subject of empirical observations and researches over many years and in many countries. The earlier Marshallian Industrial District (MIDs) notion originated what is nowadays considered the core of the theoretical framework for explaining their persistence and diffusion: external economies and “industrial atmosphere” (Becattini et al. 2009). Though they have changed over time, they have been noted because of their success as well as, sometimes, for the excellent reputation of some product-place associations and specialisations, for example the “Prosciutto di Parma”. According to Becattini et al. (2009) and Porter and Ketels (2009), clusters and MIDs are neither synonyms nor concepts conceived in same scientific context or with reference to identical economic and societal environments, although they have “common roots”. Coming from a business strategy approach (Porter 1998) to understand the determinants of competition, Porter and Ketels (2009) define clusters as “geographic agglomerations of companies, suppliers and service providers, and associated institutions in a particular field, linked by externalities and complementarities of various type” (2009:172). These authors consider them “by design, a broader concept and a more general one” (2009:182) than MIDs, which are instead considered as “one type of a cluster”. Conversely, Becattini’s MIDs are defined as “socio-territorial entities characterised by the active presence of both a community of people and a population of firms in one naturally and historically bounded area with a dominant industrial activity” (Pyke et al. 1990, cit. in Porter and Ketels 2009:172). Becattini adds, however, that “the population of firms and the related market institutions are only one, though central, part of it” (Becattini et al. 2009: xviii) and consequently clusters are considered only the industrial core of a more complex district process. For the purpose of this paper, it is worth underlining one significant difference and some essential, common key points. While the concept of MIDs is strictly related to industrial manufacturing sectors as well as to a system of small-medium enterprises, the notion of cluster is “by design” recognised in any production or services sector (Porter 1998). So agricultural clusters are identified in rural regions, are studied with the same methodological approach and are involved in identical considerations about their role in the value chain and about public policies (Porter 2003; Porter et al. 2004; Feser and Isserman A. 2009). Instead, justifying the translation of the MID concept to agriculture has required great efforts on the part of Italian researchers, as discussed below. In any case, both converge on these issues: i) the core of the theoretical framework rests on a few basic conceptual nodes: the proximity (spatial dimension) of companies and institutions, interrelated in vertical, horizontal and diagonal ways, allows for better organisation of the value chain (business dimension); more added value is provided by a special local mix of externalities resulting from (in MID terminology) industrial atmosphere or (in cluster terminology) business environment (socio-economic dimension); ii) both put at the core of their conceptual construction the strategic function of the relationships between companies, local institutions in a wide sense, and the governance mechanisms for better management of those relationships; at the same time both recognise the twofold presence of an internal (local) network as well as of an external network, each playing an important role in the district process (network and organising dimension); iii) both are positively correlated with local development processes and not only to the growth of the enterprises involved; iv) for both, researchers have addressed policy recommendations aimed at supporting their growth and the development of the place/region where they are located (policy dimension). So, clusters and MIDs are recognised in many countries which have introduced specific policies. In the discussion of the results we analyse how these basic components work together in the Italian regional patterns. Porter (2003) survey on economic performance of U.S. regions claims that regional development policies have to be particularly attuned to traded clusters because of their capability to support higher wages but also because they drive local employment and affect regional economic performances. On the other hand, Feser and Isserman A. (2009) found that rural clusters play an important role in the national value chain. They maintained that public policies should support these clusters, not only to sustain rural development but also to achieve an overall goal of regional and national economic development. Still focusing on rural regions in the U.S., Porter et al. (2004) state the importance of “cluster thinking” in rural economic development, remarking that policy has to be set at local and regional level because of the heterogeneity of rural areas and that community-based planning is needed. A “cluster-based approach” is thought essential for involving the private sector, and an “overarching organisational structure” for economic development is deemed helpful to coordinate and drive the process. However, they note, the role of institutions in a wider sense in the process of economic development in rural areas requires further research to be better understood. In many European countries cluster policies - including industrial district policies - have existed since the 90s. They have been addressed to systems of small and medium enterprises in various production sectors, as well as to networks in the cluster, either for developing them or sometimes for using a “cluster lens” to boost other instruments e.g. for innovation processes or regional development. An Oxford Research (2008) found it difficult to identify a clear pattern among the 27 countries investigated. The complex nature of a cluster entails that cluster policies are complex too, given their multiple dimensions and the multiple actors involved in the process of programming and implementing the policies. An important reason for this is that the structural policies of the European Union have come to be delivered through multi-level governance processes involving both local actors and, vertically, more distant subjects and administration levels. Meanwhile, principles of subsidiarity and proportionalitye. were entering the political and legal systems and processes of decentralisation towards the most peripheral levels of administration were occurring in many countries, Italy included. Borràs and Tsagdis (2008) recognised five types of cluster policy, ranging from three top-down types that aim to create clusters from scratch (‘creationist’) or to support them without encompassing a bottom-up process (‘narrow’ and ‘top-down’), to the two more complex types: the ‘evolutionary’ one that considers clusters tend to evolve in a cumulative and gradual way and policy is embedded in the network which shapes the direction of these changing dynamics, and the ‘network’ policy. The latter is based on multi-level governance because it recognises that the role of public authorities is inscribed into a relationship between private and public actors in the territory where they try to solve problems collectively. ‘Network’ policy is confident not only regarding success by public authorities but also the strength of the network. In European rural areas some other policies have been implemented that involve the concepts of cluster and districts, in their approaches based on the concept of network, territorial value and governance, and their focus on innovation in the rural environment. In this paper we consider only policies for qualifying agriculture and agro-food products and on LEADERf. programmes and methods. Although not cluster-specific, these policies have played a specific role in the integrated mix of main policies implemented in those areas, especially with reference to the rural districts and the quality agro-food districts which have developed in Italy, as further discussed below. Stemming from the 1988 reform of structural funds, several LEADER programmes have developed continuously, undergoing various adjustments and growing in importance in the scope of rural policies, until they became integrated in rural development programmes in the past and in the current period. This was done without changing the basic methodological principle to which the specific ‘LEADER added value’ is attributed: bottom-up approach, territorial and integrated approach to rural development, public-private partnership in local action groups (LAGs), territorial networking and transnational cooperation to stimulate rural innovation processes. In other words, LEADER is a “network policy” in the sense that it looks at different types of networks with a multi-purpose intent. Firstly, at the ‘social’ network, which addresses the intangible factor of development through reinforcing the sense of local identity of the rural population, as well as the external image of the territory. This boosts marketing of local products (Ray 1998), because in LEADER a thread connects the sociological entity ‘community’ and the geographical entity ‘territory’ “that can be linked with an identifiable cultural heritage and identity” (Lee et al. 2005:275), as can the socio-economic entity ‘social capital’. Secondly, the ‘horizontal’ network, as Murdoch (2000) put it, “linked to more general and also non-agricultural processes”, which aims at integrated development of rural economy in a defined area. Thirdly, the ‘vertical’ network, which links actors of a specific area because of their involvement in the agro-food sector (Murdoch 2000). Governance is therefore a fundamental process for the success of this policy, which has often attracted criticism about its capability to concretely and effectively achieve the prefigured added value (European Court of Auditors 2010). For several years voluntary certification schemes have been in use in Europeg. offering protected status to foodstuffs with a certified local identity. This is a mechanism for adding value to such foods, thereby aiding local economies and supporting to some extent rural development (Tregear et al. 2007). In these policies too, it is the role of network and governance that is interesting for our purposes. Regarding the designation of origin supply chains (filière) Perrier-Cornet and Sylvander (2000) focus, firstly, on the development of collective strategies through coordination by filière actors in various ways. The aim of these strategies is to gain a collective, competitive advantage linked to a specific place and shared ways of working and traditions. This advantage depends on quality territorial revenue (Pecqueur 2001; Mollard 2001). Secondly, they discuss the more complex territorial strategies developed using various mixes of sectorial and territorial governance related to different degrees of territorial anchorage of the supply chains. The overlap seems self-evident between the two types of European policies directed at farms and agro-food business supply chains, which sometimes may be spatially concentrated in local systems, if not coinciding with a recognised district. Sforzi and Mancini (2012), however, suggest it is worth bearing in mind the difference between a ‘simple’ localised agro-food system (Courlet and Pecqueur 1992) and a district, which implies a socioeconomic process (local community involvement) that is not present in the former. Finally, worth mentioning is comparative research (Pacciani and Toccaceli 2014; Toccaceli 2014) into some case studies in several European member states, seeking to identify methodological analogies between DAs and other instruments developed to manage rural governance. This found considerable similarities with the French contrat de Pays (Toccaceli 2012:28) and the functioning of the collectivités territoriales (Rouger 2014), as well as with other systems in Belgium (Collignon 2014) and LEADER-based experiences in Spain (Gallego Moreno 2014). In Italy the MID notion began to be applied to the agricultural sphere from the end of the ‘80s, as a result of contamination between industrial and agricultural economists (Angeli 2000), in a context both of visible change in agricultural structure and of progressive differentiation of production in the countryside. Meanwhile, European rural development policy started to be formulated with the European Commission’s communication “The Future of Rural Society” (Commission of the European Communities 1988). In Italy, Iacoponi (1990) beganh. by putting the question as simply an extension to agriculture of the Marshallian district concept re-elaborated by Becattini (1987, 1989) for Italian industrial districts. However, the debate soon became an occasion for rethinking (and disputing) the comparison between “two opposite economic paradigms*i.” (Iacoponi 1990; Cecchi 1992; Becattini 2000 and Becattini 2001; Iacoponi 2001): the neoclassical and the districtual. As a result, the “systemic” stream of economic agricultural thought was revisited, deriving from the “territorial” approach (De Benedictis 2000; De Filippis 2000, Fabiani 2000; Angeli 2000; Musotti 2001a) observing that “the reality was beginning to escape the theory*” (Favia 2000). But only some agricultural economists were willing to welcome the ‘district’ paradigm, so limited but essential contributions referring to the notion of agricultural district were produced. Iacoponi (2001) considered the paradigm of the industrial district proposed by Becattini to be composed of two core concepts, interacting dynamically in the local district system: the production-organisational (typically Marshallian) and the socio-economic (typically Becattinian). Such an artificial separation is useful in neatly clarifying the different notions of districts in agriculture: the agro-industrial district and the agricultural district, both related to the production-organisational approach (Iacoponi 1990, Cecchi 1992); and the rural district that better reflects the socio-economic approach (Romano 2000; Iacoponi 2002). Iacoponi based his assessment of the compatibility between industrial and agro-industrial districts on a theoretical elaboration aimed at reconnecting the company-oriented economic approach typical of economic agrarian tradition, with the “contribution of the modern theory of the firm and developing it in such a direction as to include production systems organised at the local level*” (1990:711). According to an integrated vision of agriculture (Casati 1988) he took into account the overall production structures of agriculture and observed that only few farms are autonomous from an organisational point of view (1990). All the others are integrated either into the general economic system of the territory, or into the agro-industrial system. In the latter case, depending on the agribusiness structure, integration can be either at the level of the local system of enterprises (agricultural district), or at the level of product market (supply-chain integration), or at the level of the local system of firms and product markets (agro-industrial district). As an example of agro-industrial district Iacoponi cited the case of Parmigiano Reggiano. Cecchi accepted Iacoponi’s idea and elaborated it with more attention to the farms’ territorial value. He therefore argued that: “The designation of agricultural district has to be found in the centrality of agricultural production: that is, it must be able to identify local agriculture as the “engine” of a district; so even in the presence of agro-industrial activities, the latter exists and thrives because it represents a processing of local agricultural products*” (1992:96). As an example of agricultural district he cited the Chianti wine district. He then goes on to provide a definition of agro-industrial district, which is when “the main distinguishing element is represented by the fact that the processing industry will use mainly agricultural products from outside the district itself*” (1992:97). The example referred to is the Po milk chain, which (evolving from an agricultural district) transforms milk mainly from external sources. The rural district is analysed in relation to the various forms of socio-economic organisation that can characterise local systems in the countryside (Montresor 2000; Romano 2000; Forleo 2000). This covers not only areas where agricultural production is prevalent, but also local systems of rural development or peri-urban areas where production differentiation has not occurred (Cecchi 2000) or agro-districts and, lastly, rural districts. Cecchi described patterns of farm integration into the overall system of the territory, where the development of economic organisation solutions has enhanced the contextual knowledge and the capabilities of cooperation and social integration of local actors. He therefore distinguished “the districts of the areas of agricultural specialisation from those of rural local systems*” (2000:125). Consequently, rather than connect the rural to the Marshallian district, according to the basic principles set out by Becattini (2000), Cecchi uses the “district approach” to separate social processes from economic ones. He thus highlights their specific contribution to and support of production differentiation of the countryside and sees the consolidation of the rural economy as having a plurality of economic activities rather than a predominance of agriculture. On this basis, he asserts that the possibility of identifying rural districts rather than agro-industrial districts is “more likely”, although it is not easy to “perceive” a rural district because of the greater “physical distance between people and businesses” (2000:128). He thereby underlines how the spatial concept of proximity is changeable in the rural context and very different from the industrial one, especially in relation to MIDs. Iacoponi, on the other hand, states that “the hypothesis that rural development is a local, sustainable, integrated and endogenous development leads us to the concept of the rural district, which is derived from the concept of industrial district (Becattini 1987; Bellandi 1987) and agro-industrial district (Iacoponi 1990; Fanfani and Montresor 1998; Cecchi 1992; Favia 1992).*” (2002:74). Following Becattini’s approach, he distinguishes firmly the notion of rural district from the weaker notion of a geographically significant network, because the first “is a strengthening and intensification of relations historically settled in the territory thanks to agriculture and activities related to them*” (2000:76). In fact, he notes that the main character of a rural district is the ability to provide districtual synergies for the economic activities of small and medium enterprises which have a sporadic presence in the territory, where “the community market and the atmosphere of the rural district can perform the miracle of integrating the ‘missing branches’ of the local economy.*” (2002:75–76), So Iacoponi highlights the basic socio-economic engine of the rural district. Both scholars wrote taking as reference the case of the rural district of Maremma (Pacciani 1997; Pacciani 2002a and Pacciani 2003; Belletti and Marescotti 2004 and Belletti and Marescotti 2010; Pacciani and Toccaceli 2010; Toccaceli 2012) promoted by Pacciani in 1996. Pacciani bypassed the scientific debate to enter the experimental and operational dimension oriented towards planning and implementation of the rural district, in its first prototypal form. His approach was independent of the idea of “transposing” the notion of industrial district to agriculture. Rather, he reworked and combined certain elements in the political and cultural debate of the ‘90s, including the gradual strengthening of European rural development policy and local development support (De Rita and Bonomi 1998) to be pursued through specific instruments of negotiated planning (CNEL 1999; De Meo and Nardone 2002). Pacciani’s contribution (Pacciani 2002b) is particularly significant because he suggested a conceptual link between the rural district and LEADER, just as strong as (if not stronger than) the one with Marshallian industrial districts. For the economists mentioned above, it is self-evident that the overlap of the concepts of local and rural development in the notion of rural district is strictly linked to all the new functions of agriculture (economic, environmental and socio-cultural). Later both Quality Agro-Food Districts (DAQ) and Rural Districts (DIRU) came to be considered a positive response to the rapid development of globalisation (Tinacci Mossello 2002) which is pushing for the relocation of many industrial districts (Corò and Grandinetti 1999). DAs, by contrast, as a “nemesis of history” (especially quality agro-food districts, see De Rosa and De Vincenzo 2002:14), react by putting in place a strategy deeper rooted in the territory, conducted by enhancing typical products and multi-functionality of agriculture. Pacciani defines the rural district of Maremma “a complete implementation of the Cork Declaration*”, introducing it into the agrarian-economic debate as a “development model and method of governance*” in rural areas (Pacciani 2003:48). In this sense, the rural district was also taken into account by the government. With his formulation, Pacciani offers a response to the policy issues raised by Iacoponi and Cecchi. Iacoponi (1990) believes that the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) should strengthen existing districts and encourage the growth of those new ones. Cecchi considers that regulatory measures will be perceived differently, as if through “filters”, in different places and this implies the existence of a local demand for policies that should find a “strong political mediation, implemented on the basis of territorial articulation” (1992:88). The issue of how such mediation may legitimately be conducted, although noted, was left open while in practice the rural district as a “method of governance” was already providing some local responses. In 2001 the economic debate was bypassed by government intervention placing the DAs in the context of legislation regarding modernisation of agriculturej.. This regarded DAs as new tools for increasing competitiveness of the primary sector according to European guidelines for reviewing the CAP and rural development policy. Because of its pragmatic aim, the government only partially followed indications arising from the scientific debate, rather considering pilot experiences autonomously occurring in Maremma and Piedmont (Toccaceli 2012). The government was particularly driven by the progressive intertwining of legislation on industrial districts and negotiated planning, whose applicability was extended to all sectors, including agriculture, thus opening the door to district legislation in that sector (Albisinni 2010, 2011a and Albisinni 2011b). In the legal rationale, in fact, the DAs – and particularly the rural districts - were also taking on a second, but not secondary, meaning as tools for supporting local development of rural areas. The news was not welcomed unreservedly by a part of the scientific world. Although extensive preparatory work had been carried out, the final text does not appear to have fully taken it into account and Musotti (2001b) observed that this law would scarcely help in identifying and properly “recognising” the district situation. The controversy highlighted a misconception that was implicit in national law and that was to become increasingly more evident in the regional laws. Economic theory had studied those districts that had formed spontaneously, therefore the law should enable their recognition. Instead, in a ‘creationist’ interpretation – well evident in several regional laws – the DAs were to become subjects to be set up for implementing policies at local level. In this blurry legislative context, the Regions have made and are still making very different choices about timing, as well as about the definition and aims of DAs and the rules of implementation to be adopted. Because DAs refer to a composite regulatory framework that was created over a twenty-year period, a “reconstructive reading” (Albisinni 2010) was needed to evaluate the complexity of the phenomenon and the political intentions behind it. Bearing in mind that interest in DAs in Italy ran parallel to the evolution of European rural development policy, the succession of national regulatory interventions might be seen as falling into three periods, corresponding to different political and economic approaches. (See Table 1). The first period corresponds to the years between the first law on industrial districts in 1991 and the Law of Orientation of 2001. At this stage, the action of the government was inspired by the constant intertwining of the initial scientific debate on industrial districts and the possibility of their extension to agriculture, the progress of the negotiated planning experience (Adornato 2005; Pacciani 2003; Albisinni 2011a) and the acknowledgment of some pilot experiments. The early definition of industrial district (Table 1) well represents the basic components of the scientific notion in the spatial, business and social dimensions. It is limited to the industrial sector and only thanks to the formulation of the local production system notion did it pave the way for the extension of the district into different areas, such as rural, agro-food and fisheries. Similarly, in that period, negotiated planning instruments were being extended to cover agriculture and fisheries, services and tourism. The concept of negotiated planning explains the purpose of the first tools used by the DAs and allows us to appreciate the coherence of the two approaches. At the same time, with negotiated planning, it became evident that the local approach required the establishment of a new kind of governance and specific tools to bring together different levels of public administration and public with private bodies. These tools must have the sole purpose of identifying specific solutions to sustain strategic projects supporting endogenous development and employment. In the wake of these measures, the Law of Orientation in agriculture introduced two distinct definitions for rural and quality agro-food districts, while maintaining a strong link with the basic concept of Local Production Systems (LPS), defined as “the homogeneous productive contexts characterised by both a high concentration of industrial enterprises and the specialisation of business systems”. These LPS “characterised by homogeneous identity from a historical and territorial point of view, arising from integration between agricultural activities and other local activities, as well as the production of goods or services of particular specificity, consistent with traditions and natural and territorial vocations” are qualified as Rural Districts (DIRU). The definition of Quality Agro-food Districts (DAQ), on the other hand, is given to those LPS “even interregional, characterised by significant economic presence and production interrelationship, and by interdependence of farms and agri-food enterprises, and by one or more certified or protected products in compliance with applicable Community or national regulations, or by traditional or typical products”. Without contesting Musotti (2001b), one may observe that these definitions more or less mirror the main terms of the scientific debate. In the second period (2002–2008) Italian law continued to mature intentions and purposes. The first decade of the adoption of districts and negotiated programming tools had responded to the objective of increasing employment by supporting endogenous local development processes. In the next period, attention reverted to focussing primarily on support for districtual firms in their processes of innovation, rationalisation of production, supply chain and internationalisation. So in the 2006 finance law the definition of ‘district’ was revised and reworked in terms of “free association of undertakings*”. This new approach opened the way to a season of measures aimed at expanding the range of administrative, fiscal and credit incentives and benefits in favour of district enterprises, finally assimilating and equalising all the different types (and also industrial and agricultural districts) in this new notion. It is worth underlining that this is the sole, albeit important, new feature. In moving from the former to the latter definition of district, the government changed political approach, placing more emphasis on the role of entrepreneurial and private initiative than on that of the State. Nonetheless, political discussion about districts changed much more than did the legal approach. In fact the legal definition of production district included – albeit unnecessarily - explicit reference to the two principles of subsidiarity, thereby reconfirming the reciprocity as well as the cooperation necessary between private and public initiatives. In other words, the introduction of this new definition was justified more by general political aims than by a new economic policy stance. Moving forward in the wake of the political approach above, the third period - in 2008 - saw the first regulation of business networks, which were defined as free aggregations of “single production centres” having the network contract as a specific tool. The network is an important element of the wider category of “institution” and is a basic node in the district conceptual framework very significant for the policy approach (Borràs and Tsagdis 2008), from a scientific point of view. It may therefore be considered a more focused tool for strengthening the formation of the business network, spontaneously created by firms, thanks to face-to-face interaction, or informal deals or private contracts. Instead, in the political approach, this intervention is deemed the right way of meeting the need for a simpler and faster tool than the district, recognising the changing requirements of mature industrial districts that have significantly changed their relationship with their territory and the local dimension, because companies have adopted delocalisation strategies to better compete in the global market. Rather, DAs and networks should be considered different but integrable instruments. Over time the government has reformulated several different notions of district in its successive acts without repealing the preceding ones. The Regions are thus able to choose from these notions or mix them according to their own aims and approaches and nowadays they have become a tangled stratification of multiple definitions. In fact, each Region has regulated the DAs differently (Toccaceli 2012: 58), often creating a path towards the formula deemed best for its objectives through subsequent interventions designed to respond to multiple pressures - either the changing economic and political scene, or precise requests from the territories concerned to create a specific district or in order to respond swiftly to the flurry of initiatives from the government. For example, following the 2006 Finance Law, ten Regions have enacted laws on DAs, either introducing them from scratch or adapting existing rules to create the conditions for access to new benefits introduced, so as to ensure maximum support to businesses in the Region. Moreover the Regions, far beyond the simple “implementation” of national provisions, have generated a lot of new types of district, e.g. the “supply chain districts” introduced by Lombardy. Consequently, the overall picture is a heterogeneous image, changing over time, which well reflects the constant and fervent work of the Regions, unceasing and still ongoing, so it is not easy to order such a miscellany. Therefore, in order to compare regional patterns, it was first of all necessary to identify a truly common concept of DA, highlighting the economic mechanisms actually involved, but taking a different approach than the political and juridical ones.",8

During 2008, the disease rapidly spread to 97 local government areas in Nigeria, and recently, in 2014 the disease resurfaced in Lagos and Rivers State of Nigeria (Obi et al. 2009; Okpukpara, 2015). The spread is exacerbated in Nigeria because of long porous borders and informal livestock movement across it, especially at border markets, resulting in illegal movement of poultry and poultry products into Nigeria. The bird flu outbreak caused a loss of approximately 890000 birds through deaths and stamping out as in mid-June 2006 (the cost for the recent outbreak in 2014 is yet to be estimated). At an average farm gate price of about N700 per bird, the farm gate value of the birds lost was about N 617 million (or US$ 4.8 million). These figures are based on official estimates, and are believed to be under estimated because the actual poultry population wiped out in rural areas remains unknown (Avian Influenza Controlled Project (AICP) (2014)). Since its emergence, bird flu H5N1 strain has attracted considerable public and media attention because the virus has shown to be capable of causing fatal disease in humans, through mutation of the virus into a strain capable of sustained human-to-human transmission. However, the greatest impact to date has been on the highly diverse poultry industries in affected areas in Nigeria. In response to this, policies against bird flu have so far focused on implementing prevention, control, and eradication measures in poultry industry. Until recently, significantly less emphasis has been placed on understanding producers’ behavioral factors that may alter their knowledge, attitudes, and practices of disease prevention and control measures. Understanding the factors affecting behavior is important because in disease control setting conditions required to achieve the efficient outcome are often absent due to information problems resulting in market failures and/or coordination failures (Narrod et al. 2010, Jeong et al. 2014). Due to stochastic forces and often complex interactions among players in the poultry value chains, it is not always clear to regulatory decision makers how to intervene optimally, particularly to ensure that poor producers participate in efforts to reduce the risk of a disease. There have been numerous attempts to investigate KAP levels for bird flu on the general population (Fielding et al. 2005; Olsen et al. 2005; UNICEF-Georgia, 2007; Suphunnakul and Maton 2009; Di Giuseppe et al. 2008; Leslie et al. 2008) and on target groups (UNICEF-Myanmar, 2006; Leggat et al. 2007; Ameji, et al. 2012). An examination of the methodologies adopted by these studies is helpful in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of various statistical tools that accommodate different types of research questions. Most of the studies described above differed in terms of the statistical methods used in their analyses. Some studies only utilized t tests to identify significant differences in KAP scores between interest groups (Mahmoodabad et al. 2008; Ly et al. 2007; Xiang et al. 2010; Liebenehem et al. 2009; Negro-Calduch, et al. 2013). Some studies created binary KAP variables by categorizing KAP levels into groups (often negative and positive groups) (Kumar and Popat 2010; Leggat et al. 2007; Lau et al. 2007; Fielding et al. 2005); these studies restricted the scope of their analyses because regression coefficients could not capture the full variation in KAP levels or in factors that influence those scores. Some other authors limited the KAP indices to two or three points and hence did not capture as much variation in dependent variables and may not have fully measured the respondents’ KAP (Imai et al. 2005; Mahmoodabad et al. 2008; Fielding et al. 2005; Tiongco et al. 2012). Leslie et al. (2008) improved the precision of their indices by weighting the responses to questions used in each index based on each question’s importance in determining superior knowledge, attitudes, and practices on bird flu. An examination of past KAP studies shows that the most effective methodologies used categorical KAP indices, conduct multivariate regressions to identify, and control for multiple influencing factors. Additionally, the results of previous KAP studies on animal diseases suggest that it is important to control for socioeconomic classes, regional factors, rural and urban settings as well as previous experience with animal diseases. This study considered these variables, in addition to information about beliefs and practices surrounding the management of sick or dead birds. This study is based on primary data collected through a household survey in 2010 and 2014 described in the Methods section. The findings of this study will help policy-makers to formulate effective strategies to prevent and control disease outbreaks through identifying the factors responsible for knowledge, attitude, and practice of disease control. The approach taken in this study is adapted from the theoretical frameworks developed by Huang (1993) and Jolly et al. (2009). Their models for economic analysis and decision making take into consideration the psychological, social, and other non-economic factors that guide decision-makers’ behavior. Huang’s (1993) approach assumed that individual’s perceptions were formulated from available information, knowledge, experiences as well as personal, social and cultural backgrounds. Jolly et al. (2009) extends Huang’s approach and assumes that individual’s perception about the problem affects knowledge and awareness, and in turn develops an attitude that will promote action to minimize risks. In this study, we assume that individual’s perception about disease spread in the village is influenced by socioeconomic, regional and demographic factors as well as his knowledge and beliefs about highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), before any action is taken to minimize risks.",

4.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,03 November 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-016-0067-4,"An analysis of price and volatility transmission in butter, palm oil and crude oil markets",December 2016,Dennis Bergmann,Declan O’Connor,Andreas Thümmel,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Recent changes to the common agricultural policy (CAP) saw a shift to greater market orientation for the EU dairy industry with the aim of bringing EU dairy prices more in line with World prices, which were historically significantly lower than EU prices. At the same time, price variability has sharply increased. Prices for EU butter increased from 209 EUR per 100 kg (=290 USD) in January 2009 to a high of 424 EUR (=608 USD) in July 2011 before falling back to 241 EUR (=306 USD) in May 2012. After this trough, butter prices started to rise again with a peak of 421 EUR (=565 USD) in September 2013, followed by a trough of 283 EUR (=311 USD) in December 2015. This shows that price variability has become a serious problem for farmers, processors and consumers with a need for appropriate risk management tools to cope with this increased variability. While this issue has been addressed by both the private market and at EU policy level, the issue of price variability remains. The establishment of EU dairy futures by the Eurex was a positive development—however, liquidity and uptake remain low. Likewise implementation of the “Milk Package”,Footnote 1 while welcome, has had limited effect. While a certain degree of price variation is desirable, as it provides price signals of changing market conditions, extremely high prices can lead to product substitution, while extremely low prices cause financial problems and ultimately threaten solvency (Keane and O’Connor 2009). In addition, stable prices are usually preferred by farmers, processors and consumers because they provide increased planning security. To be effective, risk management tools must consider which factors drive dairy commodity prices. Given the reorientation of recent policy in the EU, the law of one price (LOP)Footnote 2 should hold if there are no, or low, market barriers to trade. This implies that there should be spatial price transmission between EU and World dairy commodity prices in more recent times, although these transmission effects might not be perfect as barriers are still not sufficiently low for full, short-term price transmission. Besides any alignment of price levels, there can be also an alignment of price volatility. The studies of Bergmann et al. (2015) and O’Connor and Keane (2011) showed that volatility of EU dairy commodities has sharply increased and is historically high. In addition, O’Connor and Keane (2011) showed that EU price volatility is now more aligned with World price volatility for butter and skimmed milk powder (SMP). While these studies quantify volatility, they do not account for any transmission effects between EU and World price volatility which might exist. Given the recent volatile nature of dairy commodity prices, there exists a perceived threat that these commodities may be replaced by cheaper substitutes. This is underlined in FAO and OECD (2011a) which states “Under very high prices, demand may retreat and dairy ingredients can be replaced by cheaper substitutes in food manufacturing”. This statement suggests that there might not only be spatial transmission effects among different regions but also between dairy commodities and substitutes, such as vegetable oils for butter. This substitution effect is reported in Keane and O’Connor (2009). However, there may be limits to this, especially in the short-term, because of the large investment required in product reformulation. The relationship between crude oil, as a proxy for energy costs, and agricultural commodities (and dairy commodities in particular) has received attention in recent times. As stated by Baffes (2011), “any analysis of non-energy commodity markets cannot be undertaken in isolation to developments in energy markets”. This is underlined by the study of Huchet-Bourdon (2011), who found that butter and whole milk powder agricultural products had prices that most closely correlated with crude oil price over the last decade. In that study, the authors assume that this relationship might be due to the direct effect of crude oil price on agricultural commodity prices, through transportation and production costs. Another reason might be the increasing use of agricultural commodities for the production of biofuel, which provides a new link between oil and agricultural commodities. This points to relationships between crude oil, dairy products and vegetable oils, which are used for biofuel production (e.g. palm oil)—the latter also being considered a substitute for dairy products. In addition to these direct price links, there is the global concern that volatile energy prices may stimulate agricultural price volatility (Gardebroek and Hernandez 2013). Price transmission studies involving dairy commodities are rare. Most of these studies focus on price transmission along the supply chain. Chavas and Mehta (2004) used a reduced form model to analyse transmission effects between wholesale and retail butter prices. Capps and Sherwell (2007) found asymmetric price transmission between farm and retail milk prices in seven cities in the USA. Asymmetric price transmission from farm gate milk prices to retail prices for a variety of dairy products in Spain was reported in Serra and Goodwin (2003). Vertical transmission effects between wholesale and small dairy producers’ prices in Panama were analysed in Acosta and Alberto (2014). Spatial transmission between EU butter and SMP wholesale prices for four different EU member states was studied by O’Connor (2006), who found transmission between these member states. In a recent study, Acosta et al. (2014) found that there is evidence for price transmission from global prices to domestic markets for milk prices using an (asymmetric) error correction model. However, none of these studies investigated whether there was transmission in both prices and volatility between EU and World dairy prices, or between dairy prices and prices of substitutes, or crude oil. In contrast, research analysing price transmission between oil and agricultural commodities has received much attention in recent times. This growing interest is mainly triggered by the recent expansion in biofuel production. However, findings in the literature are not conclusive. For example, the study of Zhang et al. (2009) found that there is no long-run relationship between fuel prices and agricultural commodity prices. Gardebroek & Hernandez (2013) used multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models and found that there is volatility transmission from corn to ethanol for the US market, but not the converse. They did not find spilloverFootnote 3 from oil to corn and concluded that there is no evidence that volatility in energy markets stimulated corn markets. Spillover effects from corn to ethanol markets were found in the study of Trujillo-Barrera et al. (2012) using futures prices. In contrast to the study of Gardebroek and Hernandez (2013), they also found spillover effects from oil to corn and ethanol markets. These results support the study of Wu et al. (2010), who also found spillover between oil and corn using futures prices. Using a stochastic volatility model, Du et al. (2011) reported volatility spillover from oil, corn and wheat markets using futures prices post 2006. Serra (2011) used a semiparametric GARCH model to analyse spillover effects between oil, ethanol and sugar prices in Brazil. Results of this study indicated strong volatility links between these prices. In a more recent study, Nazlioglu et al. (2013) found volatility transmission between oil and selected agricultural commodities post the commodity crisis of 2008, using a causality in variance test developed by Hafner and Herwartz (2006). Transmission effects between oil, ethanol and corn prices in China were analysed by Wu and Shiping (2013). They found evidence for transmission from oil to ethanol and corn prices. Besides the studies mentioned above, which focus on the relationship between oil and agricultural commodities acting as main inputs for biofuel, there are studies which directly analyse the relationship between oil and food prices. For example, Huchet-Bourdon (2011) found increasing correlation between oil and agricultural commodities, including butter and whole milk powder. This paper analyses which factors affect butter prices and butter price volatility and thus provides the basis for the development of appropriate risk management tools. It contributes to the literature in three ways. Firstly, transmission effects in prices and volatility between EU and World butter prices are studied in light of the recent greater market orientation of EU dairy policy. This is further expanded by analysing transmission effects between butter, crude oil and palm oil prices. This analysis perfectly fits the growing interest in the literature focusing on the potential links between oil and agricultural commodities, which act as the main input for biofuels, given that an increasing share of palm oil is used for biofuel production. Lastly, the role of palm oil as a substitute for butter is investigated. Figure 1 summarizes the relationships explored in this research. Potential links between butter, palm oil and crude oil Answering these questions will have important implications for policy makers and industry participants. If there is transmission between EU and World butter prices, dairy policies need to be considered and modelled in a global context. In addition, if there is transmission from crude oil or palm oil prices to dairy commodities, these relationships should be considered when contemplating future dairy policies. A greater understanding of these relationships may also raise interesting possibilities for dairy industry participants who, for example, may wish to hedge their exposure to more volatile dairy commodities by engaging in the established futures markets for the non-dairy commodities considered in this study.Footnote 4
 To investigate these questions, the analysis is divided into two periods (before and after the CAP Luxembourg agreementFootnote 5). Vector autoregression (VAR) models are used to account for price transmission effects. Use of a VAR model is common practice as, for example, John (2014) uses used this type of model to test for spatial transmission effects between Asian and American rice prices. To account for volatility dynamics and potential volatility transmission, the VAR model is further combined with a multivariate BEKK (Baba, Engle, Kroner and Kraft) model.Footnote 6 The combination of the VAR model with the BEKK model is, for example, used in the studies of Gardebroek and Hernandez (2013), Zhang et al. (2009), Mensi et al. (2014) and Wu and Shiping (2013). This paper is organized as follows. The following section gives a definition of price and volatility transmission. Following this, a description of the butter and palm oil markets is presented along with an overview of their relationship to each other, as well as their relationship to crude oil. The subsequent section describes the methodology and data used. Thereafter, the results are presented, followed by the conclusion. Both price and price volatility transmission are concepts used to analyse the relationships between prices, e.g. prices for the same commodity at different locations, or the prices of different commodities. However, price transmission implies transmission from the conditional mean (first moment of a time series), while price volatility transmission implies transmission from the conditional variance (second moment of a time series) (Assefa et al. 2016). According to Assefa et al. (2016), this implies that “Price transmission deals more generally with the relationship between the predictable “portions” of prices, whereas price volatility transmission deals with the relationship between the unpredictable portions of prices”. Price volatility transmission can also be defined as the degree to which price uncertainty in one market affects price uncertainty in the others (Apergis and Rezitis 2003). The relationship between price and price volatility transmission is further illustrated by a simple hypothetical example. For this, an arbitrary price series, e.g. a Local price, is considered. It is further assumed that there is price and volatility transmission from a World price to the Local price. The World price itself is not modelled in this example and assumed to be exogenous. From a modelling point of view, the Local price is a time series which, in general, is a sequence of distributions. This implies that the price at any point in time is a distribution. This can be seen in panel a of Fig. 2. Price transmission now implies that the location or mean of this price distribution is affected by another price series. This is illustrated in panel b, which shows the conditional mean or expectation of the Local price distribution. It is now assumed that, in the second period, World prices riseFootnote 7 and transmit to the Local price. As a consequence, the conditional mean of the Local price increases in the second period (panel b). The effect of this conditional mean increase can be seen in panel a, where it is shown that the location of the price distribution has changed from the first period to the second. Volatility transmission, on the other hand, implies that the width of this distribution is affected by another series. To illustrate this, the conditional variance of the Local price is shown in panel c. Now, it is assumed that there is a shock in World marketsFootnote 8 in the third period and that this uncertainty transmits to the Local price. Thus, the conditional variance in panel c rises in the third period. The effect of this increase on the price distribution is shown in panel a, where it can be seen that the width of the price distribution in the third period widens. Lastly, it should be noted that the actual price might deviate from the conditional mean. Panel a shows one possible path of the actual price for the example above. Relationship between price and price volatility transmission (a–c) Figure 2 shows how price and price volatility transmission are related. It also illustrates that in order to fully understand the dynamics of a price series, both price, and price volatility transmission, from possible explanatory series, must be analysed. Global butter production, including butter oil, increased by about 17.5 % from 2007 to 2012 with an annual global production of about 10 million tonnes in 2012, as can be seen in Fig. 3. This was mainly driven by increased production in India, while production in the EU, the second largest producer, remained relatively flat during this period. Figure 4, which shows global butter trade for the period 2007 to 2012, highlights the market share of New Zealand, the EU and the USA. In general, world markets for butter are considered thin, with approximately 9 % of world output traded on global markets. New Zealand is the largest exporter of butter, accounting for approximately 52 % of World trade, with the EU being the second largest exporter, with about 14 %. In addition, the five major exporters (New Zealand, EU, Belarus, Australia, and the USA) account for about 86 % of World trade (International Dairy Federation 2014). Global butter production from 2005 to 2013. Source: International Dairy Federation (2014) Global butter trade from 2005 to 2013. Source: International Dairy Federation (2014) Agricultural policies play an import role within the dairy industry. The EU dairy industry, for example, is subject to the CAP. In the past, the CAP focused on maintaining adequate and stable prices for particular dairy commodities, such as butter and SMP. In turn, it was expected that the enhanced returns from these commodities would be transmitted to the farm gate price for milk. This aim was mainly achieved by purchasing to intervention stores, setting production quotas, export refunds, import tariffs and subsidized consumption. These measures resulted in isolating EU dairy commodity prices from lower and more volatile World prices. However, more recent changes to the CAP, and in particular the Luxembourg 2003 agreement, resulted in a greater market orientation with a lower level of price support (intervention buying,Footnote 9 import tariffs and export refunds) for EU dairy commodities. To compensate for the resultant losses, the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) was introduced to provide income support at farm level. In addition, the supply quota, introduced in 1984, expired in 2015. This aim of bringing EU dairy prices more in line with World prices was observed in O’Connor and Keane (2011) who reported a convergence of volatility between EU and World dairy commodity prices. A more comprehensive discussion of the CAP policy changes can be found in Keane and O’ Connor (2015). Given the volatile and relatively high prices of butter, palm oil can serve as a cheaper substitute. Palm oil is a versatile vegetable oil and, with a share of more than 30 % of global vegetable oil production, it is also the most produced vegetable oil (USDA 2014). Figure 5 shows that global production of palm oil almost doubled from 2000 to 2010. This trend further continued with an estimated production of about 56 million tonnes in 2013, with Indonesia and Malaysia being the two most important producers, with a share of about 85 % (USDA 2014). Although this expansion is mainly driven by increased use of palm oil for cooking, and within the food industry in general, estimates show that about 9 % of global palm oil production will be used within the biodiesel industry by 2021 (FAO and OECD 2012). In addition, Sanders et al. (2014) pointed out that changes in health-related regulations and standards for food on “trans fats have led food companies to switch to using palm oil in production”. Global production and use of palm oil. Source: WWF Global production of biofuels has increased almost sixfold from 2000 to 2011, as can be seen in Fig. 6, while global crude oil production remained relatively flat, as can be seen in Fig. 7. The USA is by far the largest producer of ethanol, with a share of about 60 % of global production in 2011. In contrast, Europe is the major producer in the biodiesel sector, accounting for about 44 % of global production in 2011 (based on EIA data). Global biofuel production. Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) Global crude oil production. Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) The expansion of biofuel production is mainly driven by policy decisions in the USA and the EU, as well as other countries, like Brazil. For example, in the USA, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 set targets for the amount of biofuel that producers need to mix with conventional fuels. These targets were further extended under Section 202 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, which sets a target of 36 million gallons of fuel from renewable sources by 2022. In the EU, Directive 2009/28/EC of the European Parliament, and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources, states “a mandatory 10 % minimum target to be achieved by all Member States for the share of biofuels in transport petrol and diesel consumption by 2020”. More recent developments, like the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament, and of the Council amending Directive 98/70/EC relating to the quality of petrol and diesel fuels, does not change this target, but addresses sustainability criteria for the production of biofuels. The effects of these EU biofuel policies on palm oil were analysed by Gerasimchuk and Koh (2013). They concluded that, despite rapeseed being the main feedstock for biodiesel production within the EU, palm oil imports will increase by 40 % from 2012 to 2020, if no policy changes occur. Listori and Esposti (2012) mentioned a number of different types of price transmission effects involving agricultural commodity prices. In this paper, three of these are considered for the study of butter prices, namely spatial transmission, cross-commodity price transmission and transmission from non-agricultural to agricultural commodities.Footnote 10
 Firstly, spatial transmission effects between World and EU butter prices are analysed, given the recent greater market orientation of the CAP. The underlying economic justification for this analysis is spatial arbitrage (Listori and Esposti 2012). For the case of butter markets, this means that when World prices rises, arbitrageurs will start to buy butter in the EU and sell on the World market.Footnote 11 This will, in turn, increase EU prices. Secondly, transmission between cross-commodity prices, in particular between butter and palm oil prices, is studied. This type of transmission is mainly driven by the substitutability of butter and palm oil, as both are sources of fat (Listori and Esposti 2012). Frank (2008) reported high cross-elasticity between butter and margarine which can be produced using palm oil. Given this, a priori, one would expect that an increase of butter prices will increase the demand for palm oil which will, in turn, increase palm oil prices, and vice versa (Frank 2008). Figure 8 illustrates this, where the initial budget constraint is marked by BC0. The optimal initial bundle is marked by A. This is where the indifference curve I1 intercepts the budget constraint BC0 and represents the optimal choice of quantities for butter and palm oil. If the butter price rises, and palm oil prices remain constant, consumers will buy less butter, given their current income constraint. As a result, the budget constraint changes to BC1. The new optimal bundle now changes to point B, meaning the demand for butter decreases and the demand for palm oil increases, given the butter price increase.Footnote 12 Given this increased palm oil demand, palm oil prices should increase, implying transmission from butter to palm oil prices. Effect of a butter price increase on palm oil. Source: Adapted from Frank (2008) Thirdly, transmission from crude oil to butter and palm oil prices is considered in this paper. According to Nazlioglu et al. (2013), three linkages and explanations for this relationship can be found: (i) oil as production cost, (ii) biofuels, and (iii) co-movement with agricultural commodities, due to investment fund activity.Footnote 13
 Fertilizers are one of the major inputs into dairy farming, accounting for approximately 12.5 % of operating farm expenditure (DairyNZ 2013). Fertilizer production, in general, is considered a high, energy-intensive process as, for example, nitrogen-based fertilizers are made primarily from natural gas. This is confirmed by the studies of Baffes (2007) and Baffes (2011), in which high pass-through from energy indices, for example, crude oil to fertilizer indices, is found. In addition, processing milk to butter also requires significant energy input. This suggests that a direct relationship between butter and crude oil is to be expected. In addition, transportation costs for butter and dairy commodities are mainly influenced by oil costs, thus further strengthening the relationship between butter and crude oil. This argument was used to explain correlation effects between crude oil and agricultural commodities, and, in particular, butter, in the study of Huchet-Bourdon (2011). Fertilizers are also major inputs for the production of palm oil (Mohd and Mohd 2009), providing a direct link between crude oil prices and palm oil prices. During periods of high prices for crude oil biofuel, and biodiesel in particular, have become alternative substitutes for crude oil. While the use of palm oil for biodiesel production is still relatively small, this new economic relationship might give rise to transmission effects between crude oil and palm oil. Despite these theoretical links, findings of previous studies investigating the relationship between crude oil and palm oil are contradictory. Yu et al. (2006) and Campiche et al. (2007) found that there was no co-integration relationship between crude oil and palm oil for data up to 2007. Weak dependence between the growth rates of palm oil and crude oil prices were found in a more recent study, using futures prices and extreme value theory (Chuangchid et al. 2012). However, Amna and Fatimah (2009) found that there was co-integration between oil and palm oil prices, for the period from 1983 to 2008.",19
4.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,26 October 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-016-0066-5,Demand relationships in orange exports to Russia: a differential demand system approach focusing on Egypt,December 2016,Assem Abu Hatab,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Fuelled by an increase in real disposable incomes over the past two decades and the growing tendency among domestic consumers to maintain healthier diets, the demand for fresh fruit and vegetables among Russian consumers has grown significantly in recent years (Honkanen and Voldnes 2006; Kolchevnikova 2010; Hamza 2015). With a share of around 7 % of the fruit market, oranges are the second most popular citrus fruit in Russia (Ilyina 2011). The Russian orange market depends entirely on imports since oranges are not grown domestically, with the country having the largest share (around 12 %) of world orange imports (GRC 2012). Between 1996 and 2014, Russia’s orange imports have grown by an average of 4.6 % annually, rising from 257.5 thousand tons to around 469 thousand tons (WITS 2016). Egypt, the world’s sixth largest producer and second largest exporter of oranges, has always been one of the main orange suppliers to the Russian market (Hamza 2014). Particularly since 2001, Russia’s orange imports from Egypt have increased substantially, skyrocketing from about 8 thousand tons in 2001 to 76 thousand tons in 2003 (Fig. 1). Between 2004 and 2010, the quantity of Russian orange imports from Egypt practically doubled, rising from 110 thousand tons to almost 219 thousand tons. Despite the socio-political unrest in Egypt in 2011, which adversely impacted its foreign trade sector, Egypt’s orange exports to Russia have shown relative resilience and have generally continued to grow in the period after 2011 (Fig. 1). Russian orange imports from Egypt, 1996–2015. Source: World Bank, WITS (2015) Generally, this very strong performance of Egyptian orange exports on the Russian market can be attributed to the special attention that Egyptian agricultural policies have paid to the development of the orange supply chain at all levels. Such attention is motivated by the very significant contribution made by oranges to the country’s fruit production (one third of total fruit production) and exports (around 10 % of total agricultural exports worldwide) (Hamida 2012; WITS 2016). Furthermore, the promotion of orange exports to Russia has always been an objective of Egypt’s agricultural export development strategies aimed at diversifying the map of the country’s agricultural exports and reducing its dependency on a limited number of EU and Arab markets. Moreover, the importance of Russia as a target market for Egyptian orange exports has recently increased. Abu Hatab and Nsanimana (2016) indicate that “political proximity” between Egypt and Russia in recent years has revitalised their bilateral agricultural trade relations significantly. Thanks to several trade agreements being signed by the two countries to promote a greater level of trade liberalisation, bilateral agricultural trade has grown from USD 85 million in 1996 to about USD 2.2 billion in 2014, making Russia a major trading partner of Egypt (Parker 2015; WITS 2016). In this context and given Egypt’s position in the global orange market, oranges have repeatedly been cited by Egyptian agricultural trade policymakers as an area in which the country could benefit from these improved bilateral agricultural trade relations with Russia and secure a greater foothold in the Russian market for imported oranges. In addition to these recent improvements in Egypt-Russia bilateral agricultural trade, the recent embargos imposed by Russia on agrifood imports from several destinations, including the EU in 2014 and Turkey in 2015, opened up another opportunity for the promotion of Egyptian orange exports to Russia (Hamza 2014). According to Abu Hatab and Nsanimana (2016), these two embargos have created a supply gap of about 25 % in the Russian market, providing export opportunities to Egypt and other orange suppliers to fill the resulting import void. Although it is too early to assess the impacts of these embargos on Egyptian orange exports to Russia, Fig. 1 shows that there has been an increase of around 11 % in the quantity of Egyptian oranges exported to Russia in 2015 in comparison with the preceding year. To assess the competitiveness of Egyptian oranges and explore the export opportunities that the Russian market may offer Egyptian oranges, the present study used a source-differentiated approach within a Rotterdam import allocation model to analyse the Russian demand for imported oranges from Egypt and other major suppliers during the period 1996–2014. This paper contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, especially in light of the above developments in Egyptian-Russian bilateral agricultural trade relations as well as the structural changes in the Russian market for imported oranges following the imposed import bans, the subject covered by this paper is very timely and its results could be useful to Egyptian agricultural trade policymakers in the development of informed strategies for the promotion of orange exports to Russia. Second, a closer look at the existing literature on the foreign demand for Egyptian agricultural exports shows that the majority of previous studies have ignored horticultural commodities in favour of other agrifood commodity groups, despite the fact that horticultural commodities are progressively making up an important proportion of Egyptian agricultural exports. Third, previous related empirical studies mainly focus on the EU, USA, and Arab markets, while few studies have so far investigated the demand for Egyptian agricultural exports in Russia and other Eastern European countries. This paper therefore attempts to fill this void in the literature by providing empirical evidence based on the analysis of the Russian demand for imported oranges from major suppliers including Egypt. The next section in this paper provides a brief assessment of the competitiveness of Egyptian orange exports on the Russian market. This is followed by a presentation of the econometric model and a description of the data and their sources. The econometric results and the estimated demand elasticities are presented thereafter followed by a discussion of the results and concluding remarks. Several studies have shown that Egyptian oranges enjoy greater competitiveness factors relative to their rivals on the Russian market (Soliman and Bassiony 2012; Soliman 2013; Torayeh 2013; Hamza 2015). A recent USDA report by Hamza (2015) points out that Egyptian oranges traditionally enjoy a set of characteristics that include favourable production conditions, low labour costs and well-established supply chains, which collectively enhance their competitiveness on the Russian market. Specifically in terms of production capacity, recent statistics from MALR (2015) point out that oranges comprise almost half of the total area under fruit cultivation in Egypt. Egyptian orange production increased from 1.6 million tons in 1996 to around 3 million tons in 2014, recording an average annual growth rate of 3.6 % (FAOSTAT 2016). It is worth mentioning that Egypt produces a wide range of orange varieties, including Baladi (domestic), Sukkari (the sweet orange), Valencia, blood orange and Navel. However, both Valencia and Navel varieties represent the major export varieties, whereas other varieties are mainly consumed domestically (MALR 2013). With respect to product quality and consumer preferences, Rudolf (2015) shows that despite the fact that other competitors (e.g. Turkey and Greece) have a more favourable geographical position with regard to their proximity to the Russian market, the competitiveness of Egyptian oranges on the Russian market relies primarily on their quality and price. Soliman (2013) assessed the competitiveness of Egyptian fresh oranges in a number of European markets, including Russia, using the global value chain analysis approach (GVCA) based on interviews with buyers and key stakeholders in these markets. His results suggest that Egyptian oranges are perceived to be of higher quality than oranges from Turkey and Morocco. Moreover, unlike many other competing countries and due to favourable climatic conditions, Egyptian Valencia oranges do not normally experience the “re-greening phenomenon” which breaks down the colour dyes that give oranges their normal colour, causing a greenish tint, i.e. the reappearance of chlorophyll in mature oranges (Abu Hatab and Nsanimana 2016). Increased health concerns among consumers in Russian and other importing markets and fears of the use of chemicals to re-colour oranges therefore result in a high demand for Egyptian oranges on the Russian market. With regard to export prices, Hassan et al. (2010) compared the export prices of Egyptian oranges with the export prices of other Mediterranean competitors, namely Spain, Israel, Morocco and Turkey. They concluded that Egyptian export prices of oranges are on average approximately 26 % lower than the export prices of these competitors. Furthermore, using annual time series data covering the period 1981–2010, Soliman (2013) found that the average farm prices of Egyptian oranges have usually been lower than the corresponding average world price and that the export price of Egyptian oranges is lowest compared with the prices of traditional competitors such as Morocco, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey. The lower prices of Egyptian oranges further enhance their competitiveness in cost-conscious and heterogeneous markets such as the Russian market. Another important factor that gives Egyptian oranges a competitive edge on the Russian market comes from their early harvest compared to other major producers in the region, thus allowing Egyptian oranges an export season from mid-November to the end of August (Hamza 2015). To develop a clearer picture of the Russian market for imported oranges, Fig. 2 portrays the distribution of major orange suppliers to Russia during the period 1996–2014. With an average import budget share of about 22.3 %, Morocco tops the list of major orange suppliers to the Russian market. Egypt ranks second, with an average expenditure share of 20.8 %. South Africa comes third (18.5 %) followed by Turkey (15.4 %), while Greece and Argentina lag behind with average budget shares of around 7 and 5 %, respectively. Collectively, these six countries supplied the Russian market on average with nearly 89 % of its total orange imports during the period 1996–2014. The empirical analyses in this paper therefore focused on these orange suppliers. Russian orange imports by the major country of origin, average 1996–2014. Source: World Bank, WITS (2016) A closer look at Fig. 3, particularly in the years after 2000, reveals that the budget shares of these major orange suppliers to Russia have experienced dramatic changes over time. For instance, Morocco’s budget share declined from about 49 % in 2000 to just 5.4 % in 2014. Albeit from a much lower starting point, Egypt’s budget share has, in contrast, increased substantially, from nearly 3 % in 2001 to around 44 % in 2014. In particular, Egypt’s share largely surpassed that of other major orange suppliers to Russia during the period 2007–2014, averaging roughly 40 %. With respect to the budget shares of other suppliers, Fig. 3 shows that they have been largely unchanged, with minor increases and decreases over the period 2000–2014. Trends in the budget share of major orange suppliers to the Russian market, 1996–2014. Source: World Bank, WITS (2015) To undertake an empirical assessment of the competitiveness of Egyptian oranges, the economic literature suggests that several approaches based on trade data can be used to measure international competitiveness. Originally, the concept of revealed comparative advantage (RCA) was introduced by Balassa (1965). Balassa’s RCA index states that a given country has a comparative advantage (disadvantage) in a commodity when the commodity’s exports market size in terms of its total exports market size is greater (less) than the commodity’s world exports market size in terms of the world total exports market size, i.e. when the value of the index is greater (less) than unity (Abu Hatab and Romstad, 2014). Due to criticisms of Balassa’s RCA index (e.g. Laursen 2015 and Leromain and Orefice 2014), Vollrath (1991) introduced three alternative indexes to measure a country’s RCA. The first index is the relative trade advantage (RTAad), which is calculated as the difference between relative export advantage (or Balassa’s RCA index) (RXAad) and relative import advantage (RMAad): where and While X
ad represents the exports of commodity d by country a, X
na represents the exports of all commodities, excluding commodity d, by country a; X
dr is the exports of commodity d by the rest of the world, excluding country a; X
nr is the exports of all commodities, excluding commodity d, by all countries in the world excluding country a; M
ad represents the imports of commodity d by country a; M
na represents the imports of all commodities, excluding commodity d, by country a; M
dr is the imports of commodity d by the rest of the world; and M
nr is the imports of all commodities, excluding commodity d, by all countries in the world excluding country a. The second index introduced by Vollrath is the natural logarithm of the relative export advantage (lnRXAad), while the third measure is the revealed competitiveness RCad defined as follows: Vollrath (1991) points out that positive (negative) values of lnRXA, RTA and RC indicate a revealed competitive advantage (disadvantage). The results of Vollrath’s indices of revealed competitive advantage for Egypt and other major suppliers of oranges to Russia are summarised in Table 1. As an average of the period 1996–2014, the results indicated that Egypt had the highest relative export advantage index (Balassa’s RCA index) value, implying a greater revealed comparative advantage in the export of oranges in comparison to other competitors on the Russian market. However, the results suggested that Egypt’s RXA for oranges has been fluctuating over the years. Morocco’s orange RXA has shown a decreasing trend, declining from 34.9 in 1996 to around 5.8 in 2014, implying a reduction in orange competitiveness. With respect to other suppliers, namely South Africa, Turkey and Greece, the results showed that their orange RXAs have improved steadily, although at slower rates and with less vibrations in comparison to Egypt. The values of orange RXA for Argentina and Turkey showed that they significantly lag behind other orange exporters to Russia in terms of revealed comparative advantage. The results of the natural logarithm of the relative export advantage and the revealed competitiveness indices in Table 1 further confirmed Egypt’s strong export advantage and competitiveness in comparison to other orange suppliers to Russia. In particular, the results of the revealed competitiveness index revealed that Morocco ranks first with an index value of 15.04, followed by Egypt 12.72, South Africa 6.15, Turkey 4.02, Greece 3.98 and lastly Argentina 2.76. As an overall analysis of the results of Vollrath’s indices during the period 1996–2014, it could be concluded that there are competitiveness gains for the majority of orange suppliers to Russia, albeit to varying degrees. Egypt seemed to be the country that has achieved remarkable improvements in the comparative advantage and competitiveness of its orange exports. Alternatively, there was a loss of competitiveness in Morocco and an obvious lack of comparative advantage of Argentinian orange exports in relation to other exporters, while the values of the indices in certain years are below zero.",3

Haile,Jan Brockhaus,Matthias Kalkuhl,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Food insecurity remains to be a critical challenge to the world’s poor today. According to recent estimates by the Food and Agriculture organization (FAO), one in nine people in the world and about a quarter of those in Sub-Saharan Africa are unable to meet their dietary energy requirements in 2014–2015 (FAO 2015). The focus of this study is not food insecurity and hunger per se. It instead addresses one major component of food security, that is, food production. Although a range of factors influence global food security (FAO 1996), food production plays a major role (Parry et al. 2009). In this paper, we seek to analyze the extent to which production of staple crops in major producer countries can respond to changes in output and input prices. Our focus is on production of the world’s principal staple crops, namely wheat, rice, maize, and corn. These crops are crucial for the fight against global food insecurity since they are major sources of food in several parts of the world, comprising three quarters of the food calories in global food production. Maize, wheat, and rice, respectively, are the three largest cereal crops cultivated around the world. According to data from FAO (2012), they make up more than 75 and 85 % of global cereal area and production in 2010, respectively. Our analysis focuses on data from 11 major crop producer countries for the 1991–2013 period. Our study countries account for greater than 90 % of global production for soybeans, above 60 % for each of wheat and maize, and nearly half of the global rice production during this period. Given this backdrop, we develop a short-term acreage response model for the aforementioned key staple crops for major producing countries. In general, agricultural producers respond to own and competing output prices, input prices, price volatility, and other variables (Chavas and Holt 1990; Coyle 1993). Some variables such as rainfall and unexpected policy changes may not be available before planting. Thus, our estimations include the most important variables that are observable about 3 months before the planting season starts. Producers respond to prices and other factors in terms of their land allocation for different crops at planting time (Just and Pope 2001). Since harvest prices are not realized at the time of planting, producers rely on their price expectations for their production decisions. Depending on the crop calendars of each country, we use planting time cash prices and futures prices in order to proxy producers’ expectations in the respective acreage response models. These prices contain more recent price information for producers, and they are also closer to the previous harvest period, conveying possibly new information about the future supply situation. Besides own and competing crop prices, we include fertilizer prices, oil prices, and other variables that are relevant for the specific country. Because global agricultural markets exhibit high frequency volatility, an annual model would do little to capture intra-annual price dynamics and shocks. Thus, we develop an econometric model that enables us to forecast the cultivated area of each crop using intra-annual data. To this end, we develop country- and crop-specific acreage response models. This allows us to account for the large heterogeneity in the countries’ agricultural, political, and economic systems in a country-specific model specification. While a panel data fixed effects model also enables to capture time invariant heterogeneity across countries, it only yields average effect sizes of the variables of interests on acreage. Forecasting acreage before the start of planting is crucial for several reasons. First, it serves as an indication of how much food will be available in the subsequent harvest season in the respective countries and for the respective crops. The selected countries in our acreage forecasting models are major players in the global food market, as are the four crops key staple crops in many countries. In other words, forecasting the amount of area allocated to these crops in these countries can be a sound signal to availability of food (a shortfall or an excess) in the international market. This has significant implications for global food security situations, in particular in food deficit (food importing) countries. For a given yield per hectare of land, forecasting acreage is an important first step in understanding and forecasting the entire production of the major crops. Second, the crop acreage elasticities indicate the extent to which food production (through acreage adjustments) responds to scarcity. Having country-specific estimates, the findings inform which countries can respond to prices more strongly. Third, it provides key information for input and crop protection supply industries to adapt their productions accordingly. Our short-term models are validated using historical data. As will be discussed later, in nearly all cases our estimations have the expected directional changes, and the estimated confidence intervals provide an additional risk assessment of the likely range of area allocation.",11

A good example is markets for “credence goods” or goods with characteristics that are difficult or impossible for consumers to observe even after purchase and use (Darby and Karni 1973). Credence goods included goods such as organic food, fair trade goods, energy-efficient appliances, automobile repairs, and medical services. The information asymmetries inherent in credence goods have typically led economists to conclude these markets require well-defined quality standards and third-party verification that producers are meeting those standards. Nonetheless, many producers of credence goods appear to be opting out of certification. This suggests the information problems certification is intended to solve are often being dealt with effectively by market participants. How? Previous research makes clear that producers and consumers of organic food, to use one example, draw on a complex set of motives and employ significant trust when deciding whether to seek organic certification or purchase certified organic food. Might these other motives help explain the puzzling use of certification standards? The goal of this paper is to model how producers’ motives and consumers’ trust (in both producers’ claims and certification standards) affect the production of credence goods and the decision to certify them. There have been few attempts to develop a theoretical framework to think about how producers’ motivation and relationships with consumers affect certification, and this paper begins to fill that gap. I find the degree to which a consumer trusts the producer of a credence good and the certification standard that governs it and the degree to which the producer is motivated to produce a good of a certain quality both have important effects on certification-based regulation. Darby and Karni (1973) observed that credence goods “arise whenever a good is utilized either in combination with other goods or uncertain properties to produce measurable output or in a production process in which output, at least in a subjective sense, is stochastic, or where both occur.” In addition, the quality of the output “cannot be evaluated in normal use” and “the assessment of [the good’s] value requires additional costly information.” Credence goods, by definition, involve an information asymmetry that creates tricky decisions for both the consumer and the producer. Caswell and Mojduszka (1996) succinctly summarize the problem: Economic models of quality hit a dead end when they come to discussion of credence attributes or goods because information is so imperfect that these markets for quality simply do not function well. The reason the markets for credence goods do not function well is because there are strong incentives for fraud (Darby and Karni 1973; Emons 1997; Dulleck and Kerschbamer 2006). In the context of organic food, for example,Footnote 1 there is likely to be a price premium for organic at the same time that conventional production costs are lower. A producer who grows food conventionally could falsely claim organic status, enjoy the lower production costs, and still collect the organic price premium. Producers, then, have a dominant strategy to claim organic status whether or not the food was actually produced according to organic standards. Often, the benefits of short-run opportunistic behavior are overshadowed by the long-run costs of developing a bad reputation. However, reputation alone cannot solve the credence good problem because consumers will not usually know if they have been cheated (Caswell and Mojduszka 1996; McCluskey 2000; Ward et al. 2004). Recognizing producers’ incentives to mislead, and faced with an inability to verify producer claims, consumers should be unwilling to pay a price premium for organic food. As Akerlof (1970) noted, in a market where the quality of goods can be misrepresented, “[t]he presence of people in the market who are willing to offer inferior goods tends to drive the market out of existence.” In short, consumers have a problem determining the quality of credence goods, producers have a problem convincing consumers that the goods have credence characteristics and are priced appropriately, and as a result, there appears to be a substantial risk that markets will fail and exchange will be thwarted. Therefore, theory suggests that institutions such as third-party standards and certification, liability regimes, and verifiability rules must be used to solve the credence good problem and allow a market for items such as organic food to exist (Caswell and Padberg 1992; McCluskey 2000; Giannakas 2002). As McCluskey (2000) shows, when a third party can monitor a producer’s organic practices less expensively than a consumer could, and when the probability is sufficiently high that the monitoring is accurate, then, and only then, can a market for organic food exist. Giannakas (2002) claims, “In fact, labeling based on third-party certification is the only feasible alternative to circumventing supply-side failures of markets for organic food since, in its absence, organic food suppliers are not capable of signaling the nature of their product.” The basic story that emerges from the academic and trade literature is that producers of credence goods will seek certification if the benefits of regulation exceed the costs (Golan et al. 2001; McCluskey 2000). In the case of organic food, a producer should only seek third-party certification if the organic price premium justifies the cost of certification and compliance. This argument is compelling but fails to fully explain why it is common for sellers to produce a good with credence qualities without employing third-party certification. For example, there are many farmers who grow food using organic practices but eschew organic certification. While accurate statistics are difficult to find, some studies suggest that close to half of organic producers may be non-certified. In a study of organic producers in California, Guthman (2001) noted finding that over half of organic producers do not bother to seek certification. Similarly, a study of organic farming in Texas by Constance et al. (2008) found that about 40 % of organic farmers surveyed were not certified. In developing nations, the proportion of farmers who grow organically but do not become certified may be much higher than that in the USA (Cáceres 2005). Theory does not do a very good job explaining why producers would include expensive credence qualities in their goods but not seek the price premium that usually comes with certification. Differences in the costs of producing credence qualities can only partially explain this behavior. The apparent proliferation of non-certified credence goods can only be understood by recognizing that producers’ decisions about how to produce and whether to seek certification are more complicated than merely comparing revenue and costs. Empirical studies of organic farms have found there to be many factors, beyond profit, that motivate producers to add credence qualities to their goods (see Kallas et al. (2009) for an excellent summary). These “non-economic” factors include environmental concerns, health risks, soil quality, demographics, lifestyle, and ideology (Hall and Mogyorody 2001; Kallas et al. 2009). Further complicating things, many producers who choose to use some organic methods may have a variety of reasons, in addition to certification costs and potential price premiums, which drive their decision whether to become certified. These include relationships and trust with consumers (Constance et al. 2008), red tape and paperwork (Cáceres 2005), and community involvement and civic engagement (Munasib and Jordan 2011). In short, the empirical literature has many excellent studies that demonstrate producers consider more than profit when deciding whether to include credence qualities and seek certification. The literature also shows that certification is not the only way market participants overcome the asymmetric information problems posed by credence goods. These studies point to the need for a theoretic framework to think about the mechanism by which producer motives alter the decision to produce and certify credence goods. This paper is a first attempt at such a framework. The model finds the standard result—that certification is optimal for a producer whenever the difference in price between a certified and non-certified good is large enough to cover the cost of certification—to be true only in the limited case when the consumer trusts the certification regime but does not trust the producer. However, when the consumer trusts the producer and/or does not trust the certification standards, then a producer, even one who is producing a good with credence qualities, is likely to seek certification in a much narrower set of circumstances.",5

With an estimated world population of nine billion by 2050, consumption of wheat is expected to increase by 60 % (United Nations 2013; FAO 2012). This will require that annual wheat yield genetic gains rise from the present level of below 1 % to at least 1.6 % (FAO 2012). Such yield gains can only be achieved via sustainable research and breedingFootnote 2 investments. Due to its complex genome, difficulties with hybridization, and regulatory barriers to introduce genetically modified wheat, private investment in wheat has been lagging in most countries. As a result, wheat research/breeding has been receiving substantial public funding support in many countries, however, this support has been on decline throughout the world. To ensure sustainable wheat research/breeding efforts, some countries already privatized wheat breeding and many are contemplating privatization to encourage innovation in the industry. This study will analyze the impact of market liberalization and subsequent privatization of research and breeding on the innovative capacity of the Brazil’s wheat seed sector. The existing literature on market liberalizationFootnote 3 in Brazil is generally concerned about the quantitative impact on poverty, prices, and trade volumes (Edwards 1993; Patel and Cassel 2003; Helfand 2003). Unlike the existing studies, we analyze the situation within the context of the impact on innovation and employ a qualitative analysis. While some believe that a real-life story cannot be used to test a theory and to generalize, properly conducted qualitative studies can serve as valuable inputs into building a grounded theory (Strauss and Corbin 1990; Piore 2006) as well as better highlight the far-reaching implications of government policies and offer useful policy advice. The implications of structural reforms in the wheat market, including the privatization of wheat breeding and the changing roles of various institutions, are not well understood and are too broad, complex and unstructured for a quantitative study, thus reinforcing the vigour of qualitative analysis in researching the issue under consideration. In this study the analysis of secondary data is combined with expert interviews. The authors have interviewed 12 wheat breeders/scientists including five interviewees with more than 20 years of experience whose wheat research/breeding programs experienced first-hand the outcomes of liberalization. Brazil can serve as an excellent case study to provide lessons for countries contemplating liberalization of agricultural markets. Brazil’s privatization movement exemplifies how government intervention and liberalization can affect the wheat breeding industry in myriad ways, from R&D to yields, quality, and adaptation. For decades, the government tightly controlled Brazil’s wheat industry. Very strong protection of the domestic industry between 1985 and 1990 contributed to a significant expansion of wheat production with domestic production surpassing imports for the first time since 1961. Following the end of the military dictatorship in 1985, and subsequent democratization, the wheat market was opened up in the early 1990s. However, the opening of the market was not accompanied by public policies to support key stakeholders throughout the transition, and production declined steadily over subsequent years. Brazil, a country that witnessed a substantial increase in wheat production in 1985–1990, quickly returned to its pre-1985 production levels with wheat imports significantly exceeding domestic production of wheat in most years following liberalization. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 highlights historical developments on the wheat market prior to liberalization and establishment of the private breeding industry. Section 3 provides a brief literature survey on the link between liberalization and innovation. Section 4 discusses the method of assessment. Section 5 presents the results and discussion. The final section concludes the analysis and draws a number of lessons for countries contemplating liberalization and privatization of crop research/breeding.",10

Food security is defined as the situation when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for a healthy and active life (FAO 1996). At a global level, the number of people suffering from hunger and poverty exceeds one billion, which represents one-seventh of the world’s population (FAO 2009). As for the situation in Mexico, in 2010 the proportion of population that suffered from any level of food insecurity was 44.3 %. In particular, 19.5 % of the Mexican population reported experiencing very low food insecurity, 14.0 % moderate food insecurity, and 10.8 % severe food insecurity. In terms of the number of persons, 49.9 million people in Mexico were experiencing some degree of food insecurity in 2010 (Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de la Política de Desarrollo Social CONEVAL 2011a). In 2008, the proportion of Mexican population under moderate food insecurity and severe food insecurity was 12.8 % and 8.9 %, respectively. This means that the two most severe levels of food insecurity in Mexico increased from 2008 to 2010 (Consejo Nacional de Evaluación de la Política de Desarrollo Social CONEVAL 2011a). Food security is an essential dimension of household welfare and an important subject whether viewed globally, within a nation, a state, or in local communities (Bickel et al. 2000). Negative consequences of food insecurity have been documented extensively. Ramsey et al. (2011) found that children in food-insecure households may be at risk of poor health, developmental or behavioral problems. Likewise, Jyoti et al. (2005) provide strong empirical evidence that food insecurity is linked to nutritional and non-nutritional developmental consequences for children, in particular, academic performance and social skills are found to be affected by food insecurity. Cook et al. (2006) found that household food insecurity is positively associated with fair/poor health and hospitalizations in young children. Moreover, Carmichael et al. (2007) suggest that increased risks of certain birth defects may be included among the negative consequences of food insecurity. Food insecurity is one of the most important public health challenges. To fight food insecurity and its associated consequences requires an understanding of the determinants of food insecurity (Gundersen and Garasky 2012). Despite the fact that food insecurity and hunger are consequences of constrained financial resources, the usual income and poverty measurements do not provide clear information about food security. Evidence supported by analysis of food security data indicates that many low-income households seem to be food secure, while a small proportion of non-poor households appear to be food insecure (Bickel et al. 2000). Likely reasons for such findings include variations in household decisions about how to handle competing demands for limited resources, as well as geographic patterns of relative costs and availability of food and other basic necessities. In other words, the food security measure provides independent, more specific information on this dimension of welfare than the measure that can be inferred from using only income data (Bickel et al. 2000). If food insecurity was completely determined by other measures of constrained resources, poverty for example, establishing a measurement of food insecurity would be irrelevant. However, research has shown that income-based measures and other measures of well-being are not necessarily highly correlated with food insecurity and hunger (Gundersen 2008). As pointed out by Bickel et al. (2000), monitoring food security can be useful to identify and understand this basic welfare aspect and to recognize population subgroups or regions with particularly severe conditions. Therefore, determining the food security status of the households comprising the community can provide a tool for assessment and planning of governmental programs and policies aimed to enhance food security and reduce hunger. The main objective of this research is to identify social-demographic factors that determine the level of food insecurity in Mexico. In other words, vulnerable groups in terms of food security are to be identified. The initial hypothesis of this research is that rural households with less educated and native head of household will be more prone to be food insecure. The classification of food security households is achieved through the use of the newly established Mexican Food Security Scale (EMSA, Spanish acronym) and a nationally representative dataset containing detailed household —and individual-level information. Until the authors knowledge, despite the demonstrated validity of the food security scale, there is no available study that has utilized food security scales to identify the socio-demographic factors that determine household food (in) security at a national level in Mexico. This study precisely address that gap in the existing literature. It is important to notice that a clear understanding of the factors that determine (or are correlated with) food insecurity can improve the design of future agricultural and development policies aimed to promote household food security and child nutrition in Mexico. During the last decade a renewed interest in the concept of food insecurity at the household level has emerged (González et al. 2008). As recent experience suggests, household food insecurity and its severity can be measured through simple and short questionnaires, allowing to collect valuable information with low cost and low respondent burden (González et al. 2008). The literature has established socioeconomic and demographic factors associated with food insecurity in the United States. Among the groups of people that are found more likely to be food insecure are: households headed by an African American person, Hispanic households, a non-married person, a divorced or separated person, a renter, younger persons, and less educated persons. Moreover, households with children are more likely to be food insecure than households without children. In previous studies, the aforementioned characteristics are generally positively associated with food insecurity (Gundersen, Kreider, and Pepper 2011). However, these authors also recognize that an important factor is the amount of money available to a household, which in some cases is included in estimation methods as income normalized by the poverty line. Similarly, Hager et al. (2010) reports that in the United States, black or Hispanic households with single parents, young children, and incomes below the federal poverty line were identified to have increased risk for food insecurity in 2008. Evidence support that household questionnaires to collect food security information has been successfully applied in the United States, and they can be applicable in other countries, with appropriate linguistic and cultural conversions, reflecting the characteristic patterns of perception and response within the sampled population (Bickel et al. 2000). As for the performance of this type of measures of food insecurity in developing countries, Melgar-Quiñonez et al. (2006) examined the association between food insecurity, determined by a modified version of the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module, and total daily per capita consumption —measured as household expenditures— in Bolivia, Burkina Faso, and the Philippines. Daily per capita food expenditure, which represented over 60 % of the total household consumption, as well as expenditures on specific food groups correlated with food insecurity both as a continuous Food Insecurity Score and as a tri-categorical food insecurity status variable. The authors found that food secure households have significantly higher total daily per capita food expenditures as well as expenditures on animal source foods, vegetables, and fats and oils than moderately and severely food-insecure households. Another example of household food security questionnaire is González et al. (2008). The authors developed a 14-item questionnaire to measure household food insecurity in urban Costa Rica. Likewise, Pérez-Escamilla et al. (2004) validated a food security scale in Brazil. They also reported that food security is strongly associated with the likelihood of daily consumption of fruit, non-root/tuber vegetables, and meat. In other words, the authors found a negative association between food insecurity and the probability of daily consumption of fruits, vegetables and animal protein. Other studies that have successfully validated the household food security scale, as a measure to identify the actual magnitude and severity of food security, in a development setting include: Álvarez et al. (2006) that conducted a study in Antioquia, Colombia; as well as Gulliford, Mahabir, and Rocke (2004) that studied food security in a Caribbean community, among others. In 2008, the Latin American and Caribbean Food Security Scale (ELCSA) was part of the opinion survey “Barómetro de las Américas”. This survey was applied to a sample of 1511 households in Mexico. It was representative at a national scale and for four geographic regions. It was found a 52 % of food insecure level (30 % Very Low Food Insecurity, 13 % Moderate Food Insecurity, 9 % Severe Food Insecurity) (FAO, 2012). All these experiences offer evidence that the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module is able to discriminate between households at different levels of food insecurity status in diverse developing world settings. Also, these studies show that the adapted questionnaire is a valid measurement of household food insecurity. Further, they observe that this is a simple and quick method to apply in a household setting. Related to a validation of the scale in Mexico, Melgar-Quiñonez et al. (2005) conducted a study to validate a version of the Food Security Survey (FSS), used by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in communities located in Sierra de Manantlán, Jalisco –western Mexico-. The FSS was modified to fit the Mexican context. Namely, the questionnaire was translated to Spanish and the questions were reworded in a way that they were unambiguously understood by locals. Moreover, the authors recorded a 24-h diet recall as nutritional assessment in every interviewed household; this metric was compared to the food security survey outcome. The modified FSS was validated in correlation with a household food inventory and the household dietary variety. They found that food insecurity was associated with low dietary variety. In particular, food insecurity was inversely correlated with the number of food items in the household, animal source foods, dairy products, fruits, and vegetables. The authors concluded that the FSS is a useful tool for monitoring food insecurity in rural regions of Jalisco, Mexico. Moreover, Pérez-Escamilla, Paras, and Hromi-Fiedler (2008) tested the validity of the ELCSA in a representative public opinion survey in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. ELCSA contained 16 items and used a reference period of 3 months. In both experiences with ELCSA, the authors conclude that using a food security scale, such as ELCSA is a valid tool for assessing household food insecurity in Mexico. One of the few studies on the subject that used food expenditures data and food security in Mexico is Carrasco et al. (2010). Following the hypothesis that households with higher degree of food insecurity are expected to have less varied diets than food secure households they conducted a correspondence analysis, finding a slight association between food security and a more varied diet, measured through food expenditure in households.",51

The rural agricultural marketing system in developing countries fails to adjust and fully respond to changes in the market in terms of quality and quantity (Jayne et al., 2010). As in many countries and regions in sub-Saharan Africa, the marketing system in the rural highlands of Ethiopia does not perform well due to several challenges (Gabre-Madhin, 2001). The poor economic conditions, the imperfect input and product markets, the large number of smallholders, the high transaction costs in searching buyers, the lack of private sector investment in processing and agri-business and the poor coordination among actors in the agrifood supply chain are cited as the factors that restrain the performance of food supply chains in developing countries (Dorward et al., 22007; Gabre-Madhin, 2001). Institutions for market information, standardizing, grading and labeling, and contract enforcement are also weak, which further undermines the performance of the agricultural marketing system. Poor road and communication infrastructure, thin input and output markets, underdeveloped monetary systems are further claimed to affect the rural areas in Africa (Dorward et al., 2007). Theory and empirical evidence suggest that vertical coordination (VC) can foster the development of smallholder agriculture through the provision of inputs and technology, and the mitigation of transaction costs (Williamson, 1979; Swinnen and Maertens, 2007). Empirical evidence from Eastern Europe, Africa and Latin-America suggests that contracts offer credit, inputs, better prices and extension services which enable growers to be productive and secure better economic benefits (e.g., Minten et al., 2007; Dries et al., 2009; Maertens et al., 2011). Also cooperatives can facilitate the access of smallholder farmers to farm resources, especially for poor farmers. They facilitate access to credit and reap the benefit of significant support from state and other development partners (Key and Runsten, 1999; Bijman and Hu, 2011). Cooperatives can also help empower farmers in terms of collective ownership of farm investment and processing technology (Hendrikse and Bijman, 2002). Marketing cooperatives are also found influencing smallholders’ commercialization behavior in Ethiopia and having poverty impact in Rwanda though the results indicate better benefits to larger farmers (Bernard et al. 2008; Francesconi and Nico 2010; Verhofstadt and Maertens, 2014). Researchers and policy-makers are optimistic about the observed increased VC in food supply chains as it can contribute to the transformation of traditional agricultural practices towards modern supply chains (Abebaw and Haile, 2013). However, the impact of VC on the performance of smallholder farms remains controversial. Empirical evidence from organic coffee producers in Uganda, tomato producers in Senegal, and apple and green onion producers in China have indicated positive income gains of contract-farming (Maertens and Swinnen, 2009; Miyata et al., 2009; Bolwig et al., 2010). The observed increase in smallholders’ income is attributed to buyers’ commitment for the supply of inputs, technology and extension services; which enables farmers to increase productivity. In China and Uganda farmers under a contracting scheme were found to be efficient as they received extension skills to manage inputs, feed, labor, and capital (Miyata et al., 2009; Bolwig et al. 2010). Furthermore, contract farming leads to better quality produce and premium prices, resulting in larger economic benefits for farmers. Contracting also may reduce transaction costs, and leads to more efficient transactions in food supply chains (Miyata et al., 2009). Furthermore, contracts may channel capital/financial support to farmers to ease expansion of firms (Simmons et al., 2005; Dries et al., 2009). Spillover effects may also contribute to the productivity of smallholder farmers in various developing countries (Schipmann and Qaim, 2010). In cases where farmers fail to access contracts due to their small size, processors and rural development agencies sometimes supply credit and inputs via cooperatives (Abebaw and Haile 2013; Bernard et al., 2008). Cooperatives or farmers’ organizations generally pool resources to facilitate access to specific assets, reduce information asymmetries, empower smallholders in the market, and facilitate organized support from credit and technology suppliers (Bernard et al., 2008; Bijman and Hendrikse, 2003; Bijman and Hu, 2011; Blandon et al., 2009). Cooperatives also lower transactions costs for providing extension services and information (Masakure and Henson, 2005), and facilitate the adoption of new technologies (Nwankwo et al., 2009; Abebaw and Haile 2013). Despite its wide application in developing countries, contracts are sometimes criticized for exploiting farmers (Singh, 2002). Unequal power relations between contractors and contracted producers can lead to contract conditions in favor of large-scale companies and to the exploitation of farmers. Furthermore, contracts are also accused of eroding the autonomy/flexibility of farmers in making farm decisions (Gillespie and Eidman, 1998; Key, 2004). A much debated issue is the exclusion of the poorest farmers and the smallest farms from contract farming schemes. High administrative costs of contracting with a large number of small producers foster contracting with larger farms. Asset-poor farmers may face difficulties in complying with processor/retailer specific standards and requirements, resulting in the exclusion of poor farmers from contract-farming schemes (Weatherspoon and Reardon, 2003). However, producer-induced organizations such as cooperatives help tackle the exclusion of smallholders and offer significant economic benefits to smallholders (Staal et al., 1997; Takane, 2004; Bijman and Hu, 2011).
 Most of the literature on VC and its impact on farm performance and farmer wellbeing deals with so-called high-value or modern food supply chains, including export chains and chains dominated by large international supermarkets or other forms of foreign direct investment. The impact of VC mechanisms (contracts and marketing cooperatives altogether in contrast to spot markets) in local food supply chains in developing countries especially in the Ethiopian context remains underexplored though the challenges in the traditional domestic markets in the African context are well studied (Dorward et al., 2006). Comparative studies on the impact of hybrids, contracts and marketing cooperatives viz. spot market transactions are scare. In this paper, we analyze the impact of participation of honey producers in the Northern highlands of Ethiopia in contracts and cooperatives on their performance and household income. We, thus contribute to the literature on VC by providing evidence from local food chains and provide insights that can inform governmental and development organizations on the realization of pro-poor growth through institutional innovations such as contracts and marketing cooperatives in supply chains in partnership with the private sector. The practice of beekeeping in Ethiopia is integrated with crop farming and animal husbandry at household level. It is part of the integrated household extension program targeted to diversify household livelihood and income (Egziabher et al. 2013; Legesse, 2014). CSA (2013) reported that there were nearly 5.21 million beehives in Ethiopia, producing 45,100 tons of honey, of which about 38 % was for household consumption, 58 % for the market and the rest for wage payment. Production of honey grows every year; for eg. It grows from 24,000 tons in 1993 to 45,100 tons in 2012. In terms of honey production, the country is ranked 9th in the world which may offer an advantage to capitalize on the subsector (FAO 2015). Honey export has increased from 1.5 tons in 2000, 275 tons in 2010 and more than 730 tons in 2012 (Legesse, 2014). Honey production and marketing in Ethiopia is largely at household level and on spot market bases. However recently, production cooperatives, marketing cooperatives and contract base transactions in the honey subsector are emerging to offer producers with required inputs, technology, market information and market access thereby reducing transaction costs. However, this paper is limited to the impact of contracts and marketing cooperatives on the income of honey producing households in Tigray, Northern Ethiopia. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section two the honey production and marketing system in Ethiopia is briefly reviewed. In the third section the study site is presented and data collection procedures are explained. In the fourth section the coordination mechanisms and performance of honey producers are discussed based on descriptive statistics. The econometric methods and estimation procedures are explained in the fifth section, and econometric results are discussed in the sixth section. The last section ends the paper with conclusions and implications.",15
4.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,12 March 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-016-0052-y,Market structure and coherence of international cooperation: the case of the dairy sector in Malawi,December 2016,Cesar Revoredo-Giha,Alan Renwick,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Supply chains in disarray have been identified in the economic literature as a barrier to growth for the agricultural sector (e.g., Gorton and White 2007). In addition, they can also be a constraint on the achievement of food security in a country, because less than the optimal amount will be produced with a given level of resources (therefore affecting the availability of food) and at higher prices (worsening accessibility and affordability of food). There are various reasons for the malfunctioning of supply chains and in many cases there is an issue of path dependency. For example, this can be seen in the case of industries born from import substitution experiences (e.g., see Baer 1972 for a review of the Latin American case and Mytelka 1989, for the African case) or the corollary of those emerging from structural reforms such as in the case of the transition economies (e.g., Gow and Swinnen 1998; Gorton et al. 2006). The consequence of these changes include, amongst others, supply chains that are plagued with problems of inefficiency, high transaction costs and unbalanced power distribution along the marketing chain (which can lead to important welfare implications for each of the supply chain participants). Cooperation from international donors can potentially help overcome some of these problems in a number of waysincluding the identification of problems (e.g., value chain analyses); knowledge transfer that aids innovation and; the provision of credit to supply chain stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the coherence between the market structure of a productive sector or supply chain and the support received from multiple donors, particularly when the latter is not coordinated. In this case, the efforts from multiple donors can pull the sector in different directions either neutralising the progress of the sector or slowing it down. The dairy sector of Malawi is chosen to highlight these issues. Although Malawi is a small country, the Malawian dairy sector is an interesting case to study, because it has similar characteristics to the the dairy sectors of several Sub-Saharan Africa countries (Kurwijila and Bennett 2011) such as: the predominance of smallholding production; the existence of a formal supply chain that markets processed products (e.g., pasteurised milk); an informal sector that markets unprocessed products directly to poor consumers and; a processing sector (part of the formal supply chain) with significant idle capacity. In addition, Malawi has the lowest per-capita consumption of milk in Africa, estimated at 4.7 kg/capita/year compared to an African average of 15 kg/capita/year (Imani Development Consultants 2004; CYE Consult 2009). In this context, different international donors, in apparently uncoordinated efforts, cooperate with the country, in two contrasting ways. On the one hand there is support for improving the formal supply chain through such activities as engaging in knowledge transfer and supplying micro credit. On the other hand, local supply chains are being encouraged through the donation of capital goods to dairy producer cooperatives in order to create local supply chains that can serve consumers directly with pasteurised milk instead of selling the milk to processors. This paper discusses why, given the structure of the formal dairy sector, the two cooperation strategies are actually conflicting and ex-ante coordination of plans amongst donors would be desirable. Furthermore, the paper discusses why the underlying market structure is key in determining the optimal strategy to follow. On the one hand, if the sector is not perfectly competitive, then efforts aimed at strengthening the different stages of the formal supply chain (such as improving the efficiency of farmers) might fail in the longer run due to a lack of incentives (e.g., Alston et al. 1997). Under this situation, the strategy of creating local dairy supply chains might be appropriate in order to “discipline” the formal sector, forcing it to expand the production of processed milk, reduce dairy product prices and increase the demand for milk. On the other hand, if the formal sector is competitive but inefficient, the strategy of creating short dairy chains worsens the situation by further reducing the amount of milk available to processors, increasing their idle capacity and average costs. The paper begins by providing background information on the Malawian dairy sector from production through to consumption, including a description of the cooperation work undertaken by the major donors in Malawi. Then, the methods are presented, starting with a brief explanation of why the two cooperation strategies discussed in the previous section may clash. This is followed by the presentation of the approach used to examine the presence of market power in the Malawian dairy sector. The next section, results and discussion, presents the estimation of market power and discusses the implications of the findings. Finally, some conclusions are drawn.",5
4.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,27 February 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-016-0051-z,Determinants of agricultural technology adoption under partial population awareness: the case of pigeonpea in Malawi,December 2016,Franklin Simtowe,Solomon Asfaw,Tsedeke Abate,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Technology adoption studies are mainly focused on estimating adoption rates and understanding the relationship between technology adoption, its intensity and relevant socioeconomic, and policy variables. While such studies are quite useful in explaining some of the bottlenecks to technology adoption, they yield biased estimates of both adoption rates as well as determinants of adoption when applied to a population that is not fully aware of the technology. This is because although awareness is an important precondition for adoption to occur, farmer knowledge of the improved varieties is neither random nor universal and may suffer from selection bias. This fact also suggests that the relationship between awareness and adoption cannot be linearly specified. Indeed Diagne and Demont (2007) empirically show that when a technology is new and the target population is not universally exposed to it, the observed sample adoption rate is not a consistent estimator of the true population adoption rate. It suffers from what is known as “nonexposure”Footnote 1 bias and it yields inconsistent and biased estimates of population adoption rates even when based on a randomly selected sample. Diagne and Demont (2007) show why taking the adoption rates within the subsample of farmers exposed to the technology does not address the selection bias problem and why such population estimates are not consistent estimates of the true population adoption rate even if the sample is random. Such estimates may underestimate or overestimate the true population adoption rate. In fact, the sample adoption rate among the exposed is likely to overestimate the true population adoption rate because of a positive population selection bias by which the subpopulation most likely to adopt gets exposed first. In this paper we provide a micro-perspective of the potential adoption rates and the determinants of adoption of improved pigeonpea varieties among farmers from southern Malawi. Given the low levels of awareness of improved pigeonpea varieties we do not expect high adoption rates by farmers randomly sampled for this study. Moreover, the interest in this paper is to assess the potential for adoption (potential demand) of these technologies by the farmers once they get fully exposed to them and once other exogenous factors are taken into account. Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) is one of the most versatile and multipurpose dryland legume crops with enormous potential for wide adoption by the farming communities in the semi-arid tropics as a cash as well as food crop. Originated from India and moved to Africa about 4,000 years ago, it is one of the many grain legumes being cultivated in Malawi where pigeonpea farmers consume up to 70 % of the total production, and sell about 30 % of it to generate cash income Orr et al. (2013). Pigeonpea ranks as the third most important legume crop after groundnut and beans in the period of 1991–2009 in Malawi. The 78,000 tons of pigeonpea produced per year, accounted for 23 % of Malawi’s total legume production (Simtowe et al. 2009). Pigeonpea is widely grown as an intercrop with maize in southern Malawi, but it is mainly grown as a boundary marker in northern Malawi. Although known for its soil fertility enhancement attributes, Snapp et al. (2002) report that farmers are primarily interested in pigeonpea as a market crop and as a weed suppression agent and that soil fertility benefits are secondary. As expressed by Orr et al. (2015) Malawi was formerly the world’s largest exporter of pigeonpea but its share in the world market has fallen because of yield losses from Fusarium wilt. Pigeonpea exports from Malawi reach Mumbai, India before the Indian harvest in October, when prices are highest. Exports comprise both dry grain and de-hulled and split grain (Tur dhal). India’s imports of pigeonpea are projected to reach 636,000 tonnes by 2020 (Abate et al., 2012), providing Malawian growers an opportunity to increase exports. The Malawi government policy on pigeonpea aims at promoting the production, consumption and marketing of pigeonpea for food security, income and soil fertility improvement. It is meant to be grown as either an intercrop in the maize farming systems or as a pure stand Malawi Government (2006). To achieve this goal, the government has established a strong pigeonpea improvement program aimed at breeding and disseminating improved pigeonpea varieties. In collaboration with the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and other national partners, a number of improved pigeonpea varieties have been developed and released as a way of improving pigeonpea productivity and competitiveness in Malawi. Two long duration (ICP 9145 and ICEAP 00040) and two short duration (ICPL 93027 and ICPL 87105) varieties were released for wider cultivation. Each of the released varieties has economically important traits that make it attractive to smallholder farmers. ICP 9145 (released in 1987) and ICEAP 00040 (released in 2000) are resistant to Fusarium wilt and harbour high on farm yield potential of up to 1.9 tons/ha (Høgh-jensen et al. 2007). The short duration varieties are less tolerant to Fusarium wilt but have an added advantage in that they can be consumed as grain as well as a vegetable. Their capacity to mature early also makes them more suited for the semi-arid regions and provides an opportunity for double cropping in regions with long or bimodal rainfall seasons. However, the improved varieties have not been widely disseminated and are not widely known and adopted by the farming communities. Consistent with this expression, Freeman et al. (2002) report that although new pigeonpea technologies are available, their dismal adoption by the farming community in Malawi has been due to the lack of knowledge about their existence. The continued use of local and inferior varieties has led to the low pigeonpea yields of around 500 kg per hectare. Efforts to improve the diffusion of improved pigeonpea varieties are widely seen as panacea to the widely acknowledged problems of low rates of adoption. Moreover, beyond the lack of awareness, there are other constraints to the adoption of improved pigeonpea varieties that have not been fully understood and addressed for adoption to take place. We follow Diagne and Demont (2007) to address this problem by employing a programme evaluation methodology based on counterfactual outcomes to provide unbiased estimators of the rate of adoption and the factors affecting adoption. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Pigeonpea production and utilization in Malawi discusses pigeonpea production and significance while the data and analytical methodology are described in Methods.

Food prices are an important aspect of food security (Swinnen and Squicciarini 2012; Pinstrup-Andersen 2009) and especially for the poor (Dawe and Timmer 2012). The 2008 food price crisis re-awakened interest in the drivers of food prices and there is now a voluminous amount of literature on the drivers and consequences of food price volatility (see for example Abbott et al. 2009; Mitchell 2008; Ivanic and Martin 2008; Headey and Fan 2008; Kamgnia 2011; Ulimwengu and Ramadan 2009). The drivers of food prices have been variously reported as increased reliance on bio-fuels (Ajanovic 2011; Rosegrant 2008; Mitchell 2008), climate induced supply rigidities in some major agricultural countries (Baffes et al. 2015; Fischer et al. 1995; Rosenzweig and Parry 1994); and increasing demand pressure due to an expanding global population (Dyson 1996), among others. However, our understanding of the drivers of food prices especially in the developing world is still limited. In Uganda discussions have majorly concentrated on the consequences of the high food prices (Benson et al. 2008; Matovu and Twimukye 2009; Ulimwengu and Ramadan 2009). Only a scanty amount of literature has focused on the drivers of food prices in Uganda (see for example Dillon and Barrett 2013; Haggblade and Dewina 2010). This paper, therefore, contributes to a better understanding of the drivers of food prices in Uganda. In particular, the paper offers novel insights into the role of energy and climatic shocks in Ugandan food price processes using a formal approach and in a single empirical framework. Uganda presents an interesting case study for the examination of the drivers of food prices in developing agrarian economies. First, agriculture is the dominant sector but majority of poor households are net buyers of food (Simler 2010; Benson et al. 2008). Therefore food prices have important welfare effects for the people (Simler 2010; Wodon and Zaman 2010; Ulimwengu and Ramadan 2009). Second, agricultural sector is still predominantly dependant on the vagaries of the weather and therefore climatic shocks are likely to play a major role in the performance of the agricultural sector (Mwaura and Okoboi 2014) with implications for food prices. Third, historical trends suggest that global food prices follow international oil prices with possible pass through effects to domestic prices (Fig. 1). The evolution of world and domestic food and energy Literature has identified three channels through which energy price shocks affect food prices: first, energy prices affect the cost of farm inputs including inorganic fertilizer and fuel for farm machinery (Gilbert 2010; Dillon and Barrett 2013); second, the increased production of bio-fuels may have implications for food production and prices due to reallocation of agricultural resources to fuel production (de Gorter et al. 2013; Dillon and Barrett 2013; Mitchell 2008; Rosegrant 2008); third, energy prices can drive up transport costs, which in turn affect the costs of food transportation and distribution (Dillon and Barrett 2013; Gilbert 2010; Badiane and Shively 1998; Mitchell 2008; Benson et al. 2008). Against this background, this paper investigates the drivers of food prices in Uganda, highlighting the importance of climate and energy shocks. The unique feature of this paper is threefold: first; we estimate three vector error correction models – two for the food markets (domestic and external) and one for the energy sector; second we account for climatic shocks and seasonality effects; third we examine these issues in a single equation framework that exploits cointergration techniques and general-to-specific modelling. Results indicate that energy prices are important food price drivers in the long run. In addition, temperature shocks have a bigger short run effects on food prices than rainfall shocks. Other important drivers of food prices include exchange rates, international food prices and demand factors. These findings contribute to a growing strand of literature that offers deeper insights into the national level drivers of food prices. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section two presents the theoretical framework; section three presents the estimation strategy and data; section four provides the results; finally section five concludes.",17

In Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Asia and the Pacific, the agriculture-dependent population is over 60 %, while in Latin America and high income economies the proportions are estimated to be around 18 % and 4 %, respectively (World Bank, 2006). Therefore, the agricultural sector is vital for bringing about economic growth and development, overcoming poverty and enhancing food security. However, the aforementioned potentials of the agricultural sector could only be achieved through an increase in productivity of smallholder farmers as emphasised in the 2008 World Development Report. Thus, boosting agricultural productivity has been an issue of paramount importance to development institutions across the globe and in order to achieve this, the use of technological improvements have played a key role (Maertens and Barrett, 2013). Agricultural innovations also play a significant role in fighting poverty, lowering per unit costs of production (Kassie et al. 2011), boosting rural incomes and reducing hunger (Maertens and Barrett, 2013). Based on the success stories that emanated from the Green Revolution in Asia, efforts to increase agricultural productivity in Africa have been directed towards the adoption of improved agricultural innovations. It is believed that improved agricultural technology adoption, such as using improved seed varieties, could inspire the changeover from the presently low productivity, peasant, and subsistence farming to commercial farming (which is able to produce surpluses). Improved agricultural technology adoption has the potential to deepen the market share of agricultural output through which the smallholder farmers’ resource use and output diversification decisions could be guided increasingly by their objective of profit maximization. Thus, leading to an emphasis on the importance of purchased inputs and a reduction in the use of non-traded inputs — boosting the growth of specialized commercial farming units (Omiti et al. 2009) in developing countries. This emphasis in turn will boost competition in the market, lower marketing and processing costs and lead to a decrease in real food price (Jayne et al. 2005). In Nigeria for instance, due to the fact that rice is the most important staple food crop, the government prioritized the development and dissemination of IRVs (e.g. NERICA 1, 2 and 8, Faro 52, 54 etc.) and provision of adequate seed in a timely manner and at affordable prices to rice farmers (Awotide et al. 2013). These improved varieties offer new opportunities for farmers because of their unique characteristics, such as shorter period of growth, higher yield and greater tolerance to major stresses, increased protein contents and tasting better than the traditional cultivars/varieties. The adoption of these improved varieties is very vital, in view of the fact that it is becoming more obvious that traditional subsistence smallholding farming systems can no longer meet the needs and expectation of an ever-increasing population of Nigeria. Evidence abounds in the literature on the positive impact of IRVs adoption on productivity, poverty reduction and welfare (Mendola, 2007; Diagne et al., 2009; Dontsop-Nguezet et al. 2011; Awotide et al. 2012), however, it is also recorded that in Nigeria despite the adoption of improved varieties and the consequent positive impact on productivity, poverty among farmers is still highly endemic and the rural areas are still characterised by deplorable living conditions. The World Bank (2007) posited that one important route to reduce poverty in rural areas is to enhance the market participation of smallholder rural farmers, as this can increase the net returns to agricultural production. For smallholder agriculture to achieve sustainable increase in productivity and improvement in farm profit, intensification and commercialisation are fundamental. However, evidence suggests that currently smallholder farmers do not often participate in staple food markets and their overall market share is still very low (Jayne et al. 2005). For instance, Jayne et al. (2005) found that top 2 % of commercial farmers sold about 50 % of the maize marketed in Kenya, Mozambique and Zambia. Ellis (2005) also showed that farmers in semi-arid areas of Africa are able to market only a very low proportion of their output. Therefore, these facts raise some vital questions that this study intends to answer. For instance, what are the factors that influence the intensity of IRVs adoption? What are those socio-economic/demographic characteristics of farmers that determine their participation in output markets and, what is the likely subsequent effect of market participation on rice farmers’ welfare in Nigeria? Many studies have been conducted to assess the determinants and intensity of agricultural technology adoption (Adesina and Seidi, 1995; Adesina, 1996; Awotide et al. 2012) and its impact on welfare and poverty reduction (Diagne and Demont, 2007; Diagne et al. 2009; Wu et al. 2010; Awotide et al. 2011; Dontsop-Nguezet et al. 2011; Amare et al. 2012). These studies underline the positive impact of adoption of improved (seed) varieties on household livelihoods. However, studies that have analysed the relationship between improved agricultural technology adoption, market participation and overall welfare among the rural farming households is still very scarce in the literature. This study intends to identify the physical and socioeconomic factors that affect the intensity of adoption of IRVs, to examine the determinants of market participation and then to analyse the subsequent effect of market participation on rice farmers’ welfare in Nigeria. Through the results that emanated from this study, the policy makers would be informed on why there has been an increase in rice yield without a proportionate improvement in the welfare of rural farming households. In addition, it will also shed light on the socio-economic variables that influence market participation, which can help in the development of policies that would assist farmers to shift from subsistence farming to commercial production. The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows: section two presents research methods used in this study, section three and four are concerned with results and discussion and the last section is devoted to conclusions and policy recommendations.",86

Perfect transmission of price shocks occurs when changes in prices at a given level of the chain are fully and instantaneously transmitted to the other stages. Therefore, if price increases are more rapidly and completely transmitted through the supply chain than price decrease, then, possible consumer welfare loss may exist (Meyer and von Cramon-Taubadel 2004; Vavra and Goodwin 2005). Among the possible factors that may explain the presence of asymmetries in price transmission along a food chain, many authors suggest the exercise of market power at the processing and retailing stage (Peltzman 2000; Lloyd et al. 2006). Pasta is a strategic product in the Italian agro-food industry since Italy has the peculiarity of being, at the same time, the main producer and consumer of pasta. During the last several years, wheat-pasta chains have been strongly affected by some changes. For example, CAP reforms in the durum wheat sector have progressively reduced government intervention in the market. Furthermore, starting in the spring of 2007 until March 2008, durum wheat prices have increased sharply causing important costs increases for the semolina and pasta maker stages. Finally, a case of anticompetitive practices against pasta makers was identified and sanctioned by the Italian Antitrust Authority for the period between October 2006 and, at least, March 2008 (Antitrust 2009). Specifically, based on Antitrust sentence Italian pasta makers (about 90 % of all firms in the Italian market) and two Industrial Unions of Italian pasta makers have put into practice a restrictive-competition accord aimed at harmonizing increases in the sale price for semolina dry pasta that applies to the retail sector. Research on evaluating competition policy has grown rapidly in the last 10–20 years with a number of surveys in which critical overviews of the methodology are used to evaluate the effectiveness of Competition Authority decisions (Davies and Ormosi 2010; Davies 2010; Bergman 2008; Werden 2008). Only recently, since the spring of 2006, the Italian Competition Authority (ICA) started paying attention to the evaluation of the impact of its decisions, by establishing a new unit in charge of this task (Sabbatini 2008). The estimation of the effects of Competition Authority intervention is usually realized by analyzing the price variations and by estimating the margins, consumer surplus and, recently, total welfare (Sabbatini 2008; Aguzzoni 2011). Few studies on ICA decisions reveal that in some cases the investigation and the fines produce beneficial deterrent effects on firms’ behavior such as in “baby milk” case (Sabbatini 2008), while in other cases, differently from what was expected by policy makers and consumers associations, the authority intervention does not produce price decreases as in the Italian pay-toll highways refueling market (Aguzzoni 2011). In our idea, the pricing behavior of Italian pasta makers might presumably be scrutinized by investigating on how producers have transmitted semolina price variations into pasta price. A useful way to analyze pasta makers’ behavior, before and after antitrust sentence, is to investigate whether and how the mechanism of the transmission price, specifically the pasta producer price adjustment process to semolina price variations, was changed with antitrust decision. Our goal is to investigate whether antitrust intervention has produced some substantial effects in the Italian pasta market by restoring a state of appreciable competition among firms in terms of price transmission.",8
4.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,22 January 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-016-0045-x,Impact of trade liberalization and world price changes in Bangladesh: a computable general equilibrium analysis,December 2016,Mohammad Jahangir Alam,Jeroen Buysse,Guido Van Huylenbroeck,Male,Male,Male,Male,"There are many policy debates in Bangladesh whether the country needs to further liberalize its trade, especially after the food commodity price surges during 2007–2008 and the one going on currently, or to go back to a policy of protecting the domestic sectors from foreign competition. Although the country has made much progress in the liberalization of its’ trade there is still room to further reduce the protection level. But, the 2007–2008 and the ongoing price surges have initiated the debate especially because the world market supply was found to be unstable making prices more volatile. This may make the country more vulnerable, lead to severe food insecurity both at national and household level, and hence decreases household welfare and could deepened the poverty . It is not unlikely that such price increases happen again in future as a result of the inherent risk in agricultural production, which may be potentially exacerbated by increasing volatility due to climate changes and other relevant factors associated with the commodity price volatility. As the entire population depends on rice for a large share of their calorie intake, food security becomes for the most part analogous to ‘rice security’. Therefore, food security and poverty reduction are the top priorities of development policy since colonial time in Bangladesh. Several studies (Dorosh 2001; Ivanic and Martin 2007) show that domestic (Bangladesh) market liberalization for inputs and outputs, along with agricultural trade liberalization (import and export) at the border has led to higher productivity, stabilized Bangladesh’s overall food security, and reduced real prices of agricultural commodities. But this does not take away the existing concern that an unstable international supply or a distortion in the export policies of major exporting countries can have detrimental effect for a net food importing country such as Bangladesh. Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model has been used for a very diverse set of policy questions in Bangladesh with results at the macro, sectoral and household level poverty, income and welfare. Marzia (2004) models the effects of trade on women groups differentiated based on the socio-economic characteristics and has used a gendered social accounting matrix and CGE model for calibrating different trade policy scenarios. The author highlights the role of trade on women and compares the results with Zambia. The main result of this study is that trade liberalization rose female wages and employment in a labour abundant country like Bangladesh but it is not beneficial for women in a natural-resource abundant country like Zambia. There are very few studies that have evaluated the impact of trade liberalization in the Bangladesh economy such as Annabi et al. (2006), Hoque (2006), Khondker and Raihan (2004), Noman (2002), Ahmed (2001) etc. Most of these studies focused on the macroeconomic perspective rather than distributional aspects such as income, welfare. Khondker and Raihan (2004) presented that full trade liberalization would generate negative consequences for the macro-economy as well as for the welfare and poverty status of the households in Bangladesh. On the contrary, Mujeri and Khondker (2002) found that globalization efforts in Bangladesh are generally pro-poor, although the gains accrue more to the well-off households while the extremely poor households benefit less. Marzia and Adrian (2000) have analyzed the effect of trade on women’s wages and jobs, household work and leisure. This paper developed a model with not only the sectors of the market economy but also with social reproduction and leisure activities for men and women separately. The model simulated the effects of changes in trade policies and capital flows on a gender basis. However, the results are very diverse and yield contradiction. Therefore, these diverse results call for a re-examination of the issue. The plausible reasons for the variations of results from different scenarios are the level of sectoral disaggregation, chosen elasticity values, the assumptions made in the factor markets and in the macro constraints. Furthermore, the impact of policies may be different depending on the adjustment path of the economy over time. The contribution of the paper to the large literature are two folds. First, the present study focuses rather disaggregated level household income and welfare in where the experiment of partial liberalization been considered. Our work is different than the existing literature in the sense that the authors in existing literature considered full liberalization and focused mainly at the macro level in where our study considered partial liberalization and focused macro and household level consequences. Second, our study simulated the world price changes to quantity the impacts also at the income and welfare of different households in Bangladesh and compared both the scenarios. To our knowledge, there is no study quantified the commodity price shock using computable general equilibrium model in the case of Bangladesh, although there are few studies that examined the impact of world prices changes in Mozambique, Uganda etc. (Arndt et. al. 2008; Benson et al. 2008). So, the present study is also an attempt to fill this gap. Given this backdrop our aim is to estimate the impact of freer trade and of world food commodity price increases using a single country CGE model. So, our research questions are –what are the consequences of further trade liberalization (50 % tariff-cut for all imported commodities) and world agricultural commodity prices changes (25 % increases of world market prices of import food commodities) on the macro (GDP, imports, exports, investment, government consumption, private consumption), sectoral (focus on rice sectors, activity output, output price, aggregate value-added, factor prices) and household levels (income, consumption and the welfare) in Bangladesh? The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the methodology which is then followed by a brief explanation of the Bangladesh social accounting matrix of 2005, the main features of the database and the elasticity values used for model calibration in section 3. The scenarios, results and the discussions of the study are presented in section 4. The last section concludes and spots the limitations of the calibrated model and potential improvements for future research. Some complementary Tables are included in the Appendix for the interested readers.",2

Those sensorial elements bind inseparably the taste of a wine to a unique grape-growing area, thus becoming a source of distinctness almost unbeatable, to the extent that it is supported by appropriate communication and brand management policies. The research of biodiversity is a process of knowledge development, both the existing and the new one, about the soil and the grape, from the technical production point of view, and about the sensorial needs of the target market, from a commercial point of view. This process is carried out by identifying, attracting, and reconfiguring the knowledge about the grape biodiversity: it is an information flow management, both internal and external the firm boundaries, together with the relevant supply network’s actors, such as biological analysis laboratories, research institutes, and grape growers. The dynamic capabilities can support this process; on the other hand, the information flow with external actors is managed through relationships. For this reasons, the purpose of the paper is to analyze how the winery’s dynamic capabilities, needed to exploit the biodiversity, are influenced by the dyadic relationship with the grape grower, in particular by some specific features regarding the organizational culture and the relational approach. The dynamic capabilities allow the firm to recognize the changing environment and, placing between business and environment, enable firm resources to dynamically adapt to changing environmental characteristics (Teece et al. 1997). According to the competence-based view (Teece et al. 1997), the innovative behavior of some companies aimed at finding distinctive features from their competitors, which can generate a differentiation strategy, arises from the ability to introduce continuously product and process innovations. In dynamic and high-intensity competition contexts, the dynamic behavior can be explained if the business holds skills with equally dynamic nature. Organizations, and new governance mechanisms are taking place more and more in the field of innovation and valorisation of the agri-food sector (Cembalo 2015); the agri-food chain performances are affected by the way the stakeholders are involved in the chains and by the way of coordinating the relationships among the actors (Carbone 2017). The relational approach (Håkansson and Ford 2002) analyzes the dynamic capabilities of the actors in the wine supply network involved in seeking for biodiversity, by means of studying the concepts of strategic orientation, relational approach, and inter-firm learning within a network system of relationships (Silvestri et al. 2016; Contò et al. 2016). Some authors highlighted the relevant role of a relational perspective on the management of wine tourism systems, underlining the necessity for the development of boards, networks, constellations, and flows (Festa et al. 2015; Georgiou and Vrontis 2013). In this network, several actors are involved, such as the wineries and the grape growers, which allow the firm to attract and to share the resources needed to survive (Fiocca 2014). The approach based on the analysis of the relationships between firms is relatively recent in the studies of the wine industry. However, the agricultural economist is trying to expand the study on the supply chain to the analysis of relationships between the companies in this sector, borrowing methods from different economic sectors (Cafaggi and Iamiceli 2010). The paper focuses on the abovementioned features, as enablers of the dynamic capabilities in buyer–supplier relationships, which can influence the knowledge transfer among businesses within a dyadic buyer–supplier relationship. Then, originality of this paper can be found in the new field of investigating in the wine sector: far from being exhaustive, it can shed some light on this topic, since there are few studies regarding the role of the dyadic buyer–supplier relationship. The remainder of this paper is as follows: after the definition of the theoretical framework and hypothesis, materials and methods are presented in detail by defining the investigated sector, the data collection, and the measures validation. Then, the results are shown and discussed; the conclusions section gives insight by drawing implications for researchers and practitioners. Management studies have several theoretical approaches that are not in conflict with each other but tend to converge and complete: this is certainly the case for the convergence between the dynamic capabilities and the network theories. The first one derives from the studies of Itami and Roehl (1987) which identify in the invisible asset mobilization, one of the ways for achieving the competitive advantage; on the other hand, most of the resources, which build the abovementioned invisible asset, are not those the firm already has but those which lie in the context in which they work. In this perspective, the ability to attract the external resources, to put them into their intangible assets, generates a distinctive high-level competence, often superior to any other distinctive competency in the company (Barney 1991). The intangible resources can be distinguished in knowledge and trust resources: the former support the firm development by continuously generating new knowledge, acting on people’s involvement, on the firm culture and identity; the second, generate and consolidate the company’s position on the market and produce economically appreciable consequences such as customer loyalty and customer retention. From this assumption, it arises the firm needs to identify the external relevant resources, to attract and to reconfigure them, within the operating structure, into new distinctive knowledge. Therefore, the relationships represent the way of connecting with external actors that have significant resources for the firm and the attraction vector of such resources within the firm. Thus, the firm’s ability to achieve and to keep the competitive advantage is strongly related to its position in the business network and to the capabilities of effective relationship management with the network’s actors. For these reasons, the paper bases the analysis on different, even if complementary, theoretical approaches. Competences are meant as a system based on knowledge (Grant 1996) made up of expertise and technical systems, the management system and the system of values in the role of creation and supervision of such knowledge (Teece et al. 1997; Leonard Barton 1992). Firm intangible resources and capabilities that dynamically enable organizations to adapt their resources to the evolution of the environment are an element of diversity among firms (Prahalad and Hamel 1990). The creation of value comes up from the effective use of dynamic capabilities, which depend fundamentally by three processes: learning, integration, and reconfiguration of resources. The skills have to be able to coordinate the business resources in order to finalize them in a coherent way for the competitive advantage achievement. They can be meant as integrated subsets of resources that allow the firm to realize distinctive activities. The resources, however, are firm-specific and show a more static nature: it is often appropriate to integrate them with external technological, financial, and marketing assets (Fuentes-Lombardo et al. 2014). The capability in integrating the external and internal assets has a dynamic nature since the market’s evolution implies a continuous change of resources and ways of their using (Verona 2014). The dynamic capabilities are based on very high levels of sensitivity, experience, and willingness to engage profoundly on the company’s business. They allow resources to be not depleted in terms of value and ability to get a competitive advantage, not so much because of their inadequacy in absolute terms, as for the fact that environmental changes can reduce their effectiveness and hence make them no longer fit to support the firm in the relationship with the environment (sector / market) which in the meantime changes. Supply chains with resources in disarray can also be a constraint on the achievement of food security and so affecting the availability and affordability of food (Revoredo-Giha and Renwick 2016). The dynamic capabilities should lead to the resource reconfiguration: this process assures the business management logic changing for a learning path that will allow wider evolution. The interaction with the actors in the belonging network affects and increases the dynamic capabilities, thus stimulating the management to break the interpretive schemes and the ritualization in decision-making and implementing process of a strategy able to face effectively the market complexity (Barile 2009). This distinctive skill system has an intrinsic form of endogenous inertia that can turn into equally distinctive rigidity (Leonard Barton 1992; Verona 2014). The generation of competitive advantage in dynamic contexts brings the skills to exercise constantly learning ability: the dynamic behavior of some wine firms is explicable with their ability to adopt a managerial logic of seeking for distinctive features concerning the technology and the market. The research-starting assumption is that the interaction between the winery and the grape grower encloses a wide range of distinctive dynamic capabilities of both the players involved, from which can arise the biodiversity, the quality, and the most recognizable and inimitable elements of wine. The identification of these dynamic capabilities and the understanding of the elements they are affected by can be useful in the decision-making process underlying the activities of research, development, and innovation aimed at biodiversity. The enhancement of grape’s biodiversity, interpreted according to the relational perspective, can be realized in the last phase of value creation process, by selling a certified high-quality wine: the grape’s biodiversity gives added value to the consumer in sensorial and hedonistic terms, thus generating competitive advantage for the wineries of a specific area (Pinder 2011). The creating value based on biodiversity is a phased process in which knowledge circulates and is filtered and transferred by different actors of the network (winery, grape grower, research laboratories, etc.) through the exchange of resources and competencies. The starting point of this process lies in the relationship management between the upstream supply chain firms (wineries, grape growers, research institutes, other suppliers). The wineries’ marketing strategy chances to achieve the consumer trust are enclosed in the ability of developing relationships in order to create the conditions to access to intangible resources of the other players in the network, to combine them harmoniously with their own, to occupy the most convenient location within the network, then to acquire a competitive advantage, which is defensible in the new economic environments due to globalization of markets (Contò et al. 2015; Stoddard and Clopton 2015; Tudisca et al. 2013). Studies on the topic (Fiore et al., 2017; Vrontis et al. 2011; Vrontis and Papasolomou 2007) demonstrate that critical points in wineries are cultivation varieties, production methods, and know-how-related factors. A clear strategic path should forecast the product building, marketing strategies, focused targeting, differentiation, perception management-based branding, and country-of-origin image development. Resources are improved with the dynamic capabilities and, in turn, are the basis of the distinctive skills that are developed and activated with the relationships within the network (Fiocca 2014). From the relational point of view, any market structure is the result of a continuous flow of interaction and mutual adaptation between the actors which generates a complex network made up of actors and interdependencies between these resources and their activities. Some authors (Cantù et al. 2013) consider the economic relationships between the actors in the network not only in terms of competition, but also in terms of “business networking” in which companies compete in changing the structure of the network through a continuous interactive process. The relationships within the networks have been developed to create a market differential (a concept that goes beyond the concepts of competitive advantage and key success factors), through the use of the resources of a business, that affects its location into a network. Every business relationship has both elements of competition and cooperation. The competitive advantage can result from the cooperation with suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders, and cooperation can be a means of strengthening the position of an enterprise network, also gaining a higher position than its competitors (Cantù et al. 2013). So we can suppose that the quality of wineries’ offer can depend on the transfer abilities (each other buyer–supplier) at the research and development stage and on the problem solving abilities (Håkansson and Ford 2002) of suppliers in transforming those requirements into solution proposals. The problem solving abilities is a central element for the wineries, that is, the interaction with grape growers able to identify and fully understand their needs, as well as to insert and translate those needs into their offerings quickly. The needs referred to in the relationship between the winery and nursery are primarily the phenotypic characteristics of the selected clones, the phonological elements, and the qualitative characters (yield of juice, sugar content, anthocyanin, polyphenols, then aroma particularity). The other needs are related to the production and logistic problems. Regarding transfer abilities, wineries refer to the grape grower ability to convey new information for their customers. This ability is closely linked with sale managers’ in-depth knowledge of the winery production process enhanced by frequent visits and by joint research and development. What, in the dyadic buyer–supplier relationship between the winery and the grape grower, affects the dynamic capabilities of wineries engaged in seeking biodiversity? From the analysis of theoretical framework about the relational approach comes the hypothesis we intend to verify: Hp1. The relational approach adopted by the winery toward the grape grower affects positively the problem solving and transfer abilities According to eminent scholars, the strategic orientation is concerned with the decisions that businesses make to achieve superior performance: so, the strategic orientation defines the broad outlines for the firm’s strategy (Slater et al. 2006). The strategy should allow the firm to connect and align with its target market. The strategic orientation is then interpretable as the way the firm is connected to the competitive environment and oriented to the market. There are several conceptualizations (Celuch et al. 2002) of market orientation in the literature, among which two main perspectives emerge: market orientation as culture (Narver and Slater 1990) and as behavior (Kohli and Jaworski 1990). Narver and Slater (1990) define market orientation as the organizational culture that most effectively and efficiently creates the necessary behaviors for the creation of superior value for buyers and, thus, continuous superior performance for the business. They suggest that market orientation is expressed by three behavioral components: customer orientation, competitor orientation, and inter-functional coordination. From the behavioral point of view, Kohli and Jaworski (1990) define market orientation as the organization of wide information acquisition, dissemination, and responsiveness to market intelligence. From the cultural point of view (Khin et al. 2012; Conto et al. 2014), the concept of customer orientation highlights the importance of customer for the firms’ performance in many aspects including new product development. Narver and Slater (1990) define customer orientation as the firm’s sufficient understanding of its target buyers in order to be able to create superior value for them continuously. According to several studies emerging by the literature (e.g., Hurley and Hult 1998; Paladino 2007; Theoharakis and Hooley 2008), there is a positive relationship between customer orientation and innovation and the latter has to be combined with tradition (Vrontis et al. 2016; Viassone et al. 2016): customer orientation affects positively innovation because a better understanding of customer needs by means of customer orientation allows the firms to offer new and superior products that satisfy customers. The concept of competitor orientation, according to Narver and Slater (1990) is linked to the capacity of understanding the short-term strengths and weaknesses and long-term capabilities and strategies of key potential competitors. Some authors (Rossi et al. 2012) by means of a survey administrated to 180 Italian companies demonstrated it emerges the need to implement strategies towards achieving sustainable competitive advantage. Parallel to customer orientation, it emerges by the literature a significant relationship between competitor orientation and innovativeness (Hurley and Hult 1998; Augusto and Coelho 2009; Paladino 2007). Within the theoretical framework on the concept of strategic orientation, we believe that Hp2. A homogeneous organisational culture in strategic orientation (Narver and Slater 1990), meant as the common language and shared usual behaviour that facilitate the interaction (Camuffo and Grandinetti 2011), can positively affect the inter-firm learning, which represents one of the fundamental processes for the dynamic capabilities generation.
 The inter-firm learning concept is referred, in the academic literature, to the access and employ of critical information or capabilities from a business partner through collaboration (Kale et al. 2000). Some scholars analyzed the role of the strategic alliances on the inter-firm learning (Inkpen 2000; Kale et al. 2000; Simonin 2004). Some others focused on the role of the network relationships on knowledge sharing and transferring (Spekman et al. 2002; Dyer and Hatch 2004, 2006; Hult et al. 2004; Wagner and Buko 2005) and on the supplier’s standpoint in getting new knowledge from the customer (Modi and Mabert 2007; Håkansson and Ford 2002). We did not find studies in the academic literature on the influence of the organizational culture on the inter-firm learning. There is a wide and intense academic debate on the organizational culture topic as it is considered crucial both for operational and strategic activities. In strategic terms, it is considered as drivers of competitive advantage (Xiaoming and Junchen 2012) since it affects the endogenous organizational development (Denison and Spreitzer 1991), the effectiveness of the operational structure (Gregory et al. 2009; Zheng et al. 2010), and the financial performance (Barney 1991). The organizational culture can also become a driver of competitive advantage even in inter-organizational cooperation. (Noorderhaven et al. 2002; Wang and Li 2007; Xiao and Tsui 2007). An organizational culture that promotes and facilitates the cooperation is important to establish inter-organizational relationships long-term: the cultural elements are relevant in the process of cooperation and co-creation of value (Kanter 1994; Laskowska-Rutkowska 2009). No previous research on the organizational culture influence on problem solving and transfer abilities within a buyer–supplier business relationship have been found. According to the Competing Values Framework, there are different models of organizational culture based on two independent dimensions: the structure and strategic focus (Gregory et al. 2009). The differences between the models can be identified by these two dimensions and identified according to the following cultural characteristics: strategy, flexibility/technology, organization, and management style (Morgan 2007). Depending on the preeminence of cultural characteristics, organizations show different organizational culture models. Basing on this theoretical background, we expect the organizational culture is positively associated with the inter-firm learning, thus also with problem solving and transfer abilities. Hence: Hp3. The organizational culture is positively correlated with the Inter-Firm learning Hp4. The organizational culture is positively correlated with the problem solving abilities Hp5. The organizational culture is positively correlated with the Transfer Abilities The paper analyzes, among the different elements that could affect the customer–supplier relationship, the strategic orientation as it represents a mental approach of the management and adopts both in formulating decisions and in managing interactions with the relevant actors. A fundamental communication element for an effective knowledge exchange through the interaction is represented by a common meta-language that facilitates this information flow. For this reason, it seems helpful to analyze how the elements of this common meta-language, such as the strategic orientation and the organizational culture, influences the dynamic features of the interaction, such as the inter-firm learning, the problem solving abilities, and the transfer abilities, by which the information exchange and knowledge configuration are implemented to create value.",2

Quality, healthiness, and nutritional values of meals are some of the determinants of food demand (Jang and Olson 2010). Thereby, several scholars support the idea that both processors and retailers need detailed information about the use of raw materials and the compliance to specific production norms, to certify the quality of their products (Reardon et al. 2003; Mac Donald et al. 2004; Mènard 2004; Bertazzoli et al. 2011). Since smooth and transparent supply chain relationships are one of the pre-condition for market competitiveness and farms profitability (Jang and Olson 2010; Jarzebowski et al. 2013; Morales et al. 2013), contract farming represents an effective tool to trace and promote high-quality productions in food sector (Cembalo et al. 2014b; Carillo 2016). Contract farming is considered decisive to foster primary production, where small farms operating in oligopsony environmental markets are the prevalent setting Drescher and Maurer 1999; Kularatna et al. 2001; Bogetoft and Olsen 2002; Kirstem and Sartorius 2002; Barret et al. 2012; Bellemare 2012). Benefits for smallholders are generally associated with the mitigation of market risks and the prevention of market failures, such as access to credit, new markets, innovative technologies, and technical services (Grosh 1994; Key and Runsten 1999). Based on these reasons, the diffusion of such contracts is often considered a good strategy for value creation in rural economies. Italian dry pasta sector reveals an increment in the use of contract farming (Zanni and Viaggi 2012; Solazzo et al. 2015; Carillo 2016). This sector shows a polarized structure: a few large international companies that hold the majority of market share, and a plurality of small and artisanal firms that operate in specific market niches. Since dry pasta market is saturated and has few opportunities for innovation, product differentiation takes place through the adoption of particular varieties of grains (e.g., traditional, local) and/or specific schemes of certified quality (e.g., organic). For instance, some Italian firms have launched pasta produced by using 100% Italian grains semolina, often by recovering traditional local varieties. By contract farming, firms guarantee the use of raw materials that are qualitatively and quantitatively appropriate to their productive standards. A reasonable number of studies have been devoted in Italy to this topic (Bertazzoli et al. 2011; Zanni and Viaggi 2012; Solazzo et al. 2015; Carillo 2016), but none of these, to the best of our knowledge, focused on the economic benefits for farms. The current paper aims to fill this gap by verifying whether farms vertically coordinated, when compared with non-coordinated ones, gain benefits in terms of higher selling price, cost reduction or overall profitability. A propensity score matching (PSM) model was implemented to estimate the average effect of vertical coordination using a representative sample of Italian durum wheat producers. PSM method allows reducing the estimations bias resulting from directly comparing two groups, namely vertically and non-vertically integrated. To illustrate, if we had ignored farm characteristics related to the outcomes, we would have not been able to assign the differences found in economic performance indexes only to the effect of vertical coordination. To search for unbiased estimations, several robustness tests were undertaken to ensure that the identification strategy selected was not compromised by other factors, such as heterogeneity deriving from unobserved farm characteristics. Main results provide evidence that a coordination premium for vertically coordinated farms arises. This premium transits through differences in gross sales, gross margin and overall profitability, while costs and yields of production remain unchanged. Based on these findings, it is possible to assess that coordinated farms benefit of high market prices and, then, vertical coordination improves their bargaining power. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows: In the “Vertical coordination in the food sector—literature review” section empirical literature on vertical coordination in agri-food sector is described, while methodology and data employed are discussed in the “Methods” section. The “Results” section presents results of the propensity scores matching model. The “Discussion and conclusions” section is dedicated to discussions and some concluding remarks. During recent years, commercial transactions in the agri-food sector are growingly regulated through contracts that coordinate different stages of the supply chain (Mac-Donald and Korb 2008; Jang and Olson 2010; Chen and Yu 2013). To illustrate, some works demonstrate that in 2005, 41% of US agricultural production value was sold by contract farming (MacDonald and Korb 2008; Jang and Olson 2010). Sales subscribed by contract farming amounted for 28% over the total production value in 1991, whereas in 1969, the same ratio was only 11% (Mac-Donald and Korb 2008). More specifically, some US sectors used to get provisions from the spot markets (e.g., wheat, oilseeds, pork meat, and tobacco) noticeably increased the use of contracts in the period 1991–2005. In the cases of wheat and pork meat, the percentages of total production value sold through vertical coordination contracts increased noticeably from 5.9 to 7.5% and from 11 to 65.6% (Jang and Olson 2010). European countries report similar increments, mainly in the field of vegetables and livestock products. In Germany, the percentages of chicken meat traded by contracts over total sales, in the decade 1991–2002, increased from 3.6 to 5.1%. In Italy, this share passed from 0.1 to 9.3%; in Spain, it went from 13.1 to 25.4%; in France from 6.7 to 17.7; in the Netherlands from 5.2 to 9.4%; and in the UK from 11.2 to 30.6% (Jang and Olson 2010). This phenomenon is due to diverse factors that are both exogenous (climate change, global economic crisis, EU balance) and endogenous (e.g., evolution of food demand, growing oligopolistic concentration of food distribution) to specific markets (e.g., Bertazzoli et al. 2011). Specifically, modern food demand is highly conditioned by the quality and the nutritional value of products (e.g., Jang and Olson 2010). Consequently, food-processing companies need detailed information concerning key elements of their raw materials, aiming at guaranteeing the quality of products and the certification of production processes (Reardon et al. 2003; Mac Donald et al. 2004; Mènard 2004). Therefore, smooth and transparent supply chain relationships are considered as preconditions for market competitiveness and profitability (Jang and Olson 2010; Jarzebowski et al. 2013) and coordination contracts represent effective tools to trace and promote high-quality productions (Bertazzoli et al. 2011; Morales et al. 2013). From a theoretical point of view, the institutionalist approach explains the choice of autonomous companies to adopt coordination mechanism, starting from imperfections in the transmission of information. In the presence of opportunistic behaviors and limited rationality of the agents, the mechanisms that regulate information transmission are characterized by making incomplete spot contracts (Akerlof 1970; Stiglitz 1987; Hart and Moore 1990; Williamson 1996; Mènard 2004). According to this approach, the more these factors are relevant, the more transaction costs increase (usage costs of the market) and the company is incentivized to seek stable forms of coordination, up to the full coordination one (hierarchical/proprietary integration). In particular, as for the issue of quality, buyers and retailers often have different criteria to evaluate the quality of a good exchanged in the market; unless a social interaction takes place bringing to a shared agreement (Stiglitz 1987). Then, contracts represent a peculiar modality of market transaction suited for goods whose quality features are not easily detectable. This modality allows buyers to transmit buyer—specific product attributes information and to get secondary information from producers, concerning production methods, inputs of production, etc. In the case of relationships between agriculture and food industry and/or big retail channels, contract farming represents the legal form commonly used to realize the coordination. This kind of contract normally defines in some detail both production techniques and inputs that farmers have to comply to. Many empirical works have analyzed contract farming, but they are almost exclusively focused on less-developed countries. The literature can be divided into two major strands: Some authors have preferred the study of the decisional process that leads to subscribe the agreements, highlighting which characteristics, attitudes, and motivations are able to promote stable relationships among stakeholders (Drescher and Maurer 1999; Kularatna et al. 2001; Bogetoft and Olsen 2002; Kirstem and Sartorius 2002; Vetter and Karantinimis 2002; Key and McBride 2003; Sykuta and Parcell 2003; Key 2004; Mènard and Valceschini 2005; Key and MacDonald 2006; Boessen et al. 2010). Other scholars focused their studies on analysis of the effects, deriving from cooperation, on the efficiency, profitability, and competitiveness of the supply chain (Wang and Jaenicke 2006; Hendrikse 2007; Miyata et al. 2009; Jarzebowski et al. 2013). From a regional point of view, as already said, most of these works addressed the pros and cons of vertical coordination mainly in rural areas of developing countries, and more precisely, they analyzed whether vertical coordination might improve the livelihood conditions of small holder farmers and if it would be useful to trigger a virtuous development in the rural areas of these countries. To illustrate, a meta-narrative approach was used by Barret et al. (2012) to make a comparative analysis of case studies carried out in five low-income countries (Ghana, India, Madagascar, Mozambique, and Nicaragua). Authors found that the well-being of farmers is generally increased by the participation to contract farming. Miyata et al. (2009), analyzing apple and onion farmers of a province in China, found that those applying contract farming showed higher income. A contingent-evaluation experiment carried out on various farm types and crops in six regions of Madagascar demonstrated that the increase of 1% in the probability to participate to contract farming has a direct effect on farmers’ income of more than 0.5% (Bellemare 2012). Narayanan (2014) carried out an impact evaluation of vertical coordination in some supply chain in southern India. Results showed that participation profits were heterogeneous, depending on (i) the sector (higher for papaya and chicken meat), on (ii) contract scheme, and on (iii) farm type. Narayanan (2014) also performs a profit (coming from coordination) decomposition (loss) exercise: incomes realized by coordinated farmers are high enough to compensate higher costs due to the cultivation contracts. Chang et al. (2006) evaluated a program launched in Taiwan in 2005 to support the subscription to marketing contracts in the rice sector. Authors highlight that farms involved show, on average, greater returns (11%), lower production costs (13%) and that the combination of these dimensions results in a plus in the gross product margins (about 50%). Finally, other Indian studies, concerning the same topic (Tripathi et al. 2005; Singh 2007; Gulati et al. 2008), demonstrate both higher costs and returns associated to cultivation contracts, with the latter caused by increased yields, higher prices, as well as by reduction of transaction costs (for specialized warehouses, transportation, marketing). In European countries, few studies were conducted on this topic. Jarzebowski et al. (2013) analyze the cereals industry in Poland: Authors show that a higher vertical integration (whether downstream or upstream) of the food firms has a positive effect on their efficiency. Despite the strong interest shown by Italian scholars on this issue, there are not empirical studies carried out in Italy assessing if and at what extent there are real economic advantages for farms in participating to such contracts. This is probably due to the lack of statistical data and reliable information, as well as some methodological challenges, related to estimation of the causal impact. Indeed, contract farming are not subscribed randomly by farms but may depend on a set of both noticeable and latent producers and farms characteristics (competence of the entrepreneurs, risk aversion, technical skills, networks embeddedness, etc.) (Barret et al. 2012; Carillo 2016). Our contribution faces explicitly all these issues, analyzing empirically the role of vertical coordination in improving the economic performances of Italian farms.",13
5.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,23 September 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-017-0087-8,The effect of EU 2006 sugar regime reform on vertical price transmission,December 2017,Maurizio Aragrande,Mauro Bruni,Roberto Esposti,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Price transmission measures how the price variation of a good in a market is transmitted to derived goods in other markets. The transmission varies vertically along the supply chain, horizontally among spatially linked markets, or among the markets of substitute products. The relevant point within the sugar industry is how sugar price variations are transmitted downstream to the price of sugar for consumption or goods containing sugar. Sugar beet processors play a special role in the implementation of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) which directly targets industrial products (sugar and its derivatives) to sustain sugar beet producers. The functioning of sugar CMO has been frequently questioned because of its potential influence on competition and sugar companies’ strategies. It might lead to the creation or strengthening of market power of processing companies to the detriment of the downstream stages of the supply chain and consumers, thus reducing consumer’s surplus (OECD 2007). Upstream the supply chain, the exertion of market power might theoretically hit beet producers (e.g. in case industrial oligopsony with market power occurs), thus reducing the effectiveness of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) measures on the setting of sugar beet price. Consumer welfare and policy effectiveness are the main social and economic concerns related to the exertion of market power within the sugar supply chain. The empirical assessment of market power is a complex issue which has raised a multiplicity of investigation methods until recently. Digal and Ahmadi-Esfahani (Digal and Ahmadi-Esfahani, 2002) trace back that complexity to the Structure-Conduct-Performance (SCP) paradigm, the New Empirical Industrial Organisation (NEIO) approach and time series approach. The Bain’s SCP paradigm (Bain, 1951) establishes a straight relationship between industry concentration and firms’ strategies, and consequently between strategies and market performance. Performance refers to market efficiency in resource allocation, which would increase in perfect markets to the detriment of firms’ profit (and vice-versa in imperfect markets). SCP paradigm has been criticised according to a variety of reasons. Among these, the assumption of industry structure as an exogeneous variable is relevant here, simply because feedback of performance and/or conduct toward the structure may exist. If the latter occurs, the typical SCP causal link would be reversed as the structure would be a result of the conduct. This entails a conceptual problem, which, in a typical SCP model, structure and performance would be logically endogenous. For example, if one accepts the Lerner index and the Herfindal index as measures of firm performance and market structure respectively, they both would be endogenous and simultaneously determined, thus “making it impossible to infer the direction of causality between market structure and performance” (Sheldon and Sperling, 2003, p. 91). Higher profits may depend from other factors than market power, namely firm efficiency to name just one (Digal and Ahmadi-Esfahani, 2002, p. 562). Further concerns are about the direct observability of price-cost margins and whether high profits (i.e. firm performance) should be associated with good or bad market performance (Bresnahan 1989, p. 1013), thus questioning the effect of concentration on consumer welfare. NEIO studies put forward some conceptual and operational differences with respect to SCP. Starting from the assumption that firm conduct has to be observed in its economic and structural environment, NEIO studies focus on the conduct of firms within a particular industry. In this context, firm conduct is not assumed a priori, but empirically tested (e.g. via conjectural models about firm behaviour under different competitive assumptions). The same method goes for price-cost margins which are not measured but instead they are derived from microeconomic models of supply and demand of the industry (Bresnahan, 1989; Sheldon and Sperling, 2003). The time series approach allows for the analysis of price movements between markets which are vertically linked along the supply chain (vertical price transmission, VPT) or spatially related (horizontal price transmission), or between the markets of related products. Data required to run time series models, that are market prices occurring in the markets, are relatively easy to find and make these models easier than typical SCP and NEIO ones (Digal and Ahmadi-Esfahani, 2002, p. 563) and this data availability probably explains their diffusion. VPT studies are based on the assumption that firms can avoid to transmit price variations (e.g. decreases) from upstream to downstream levels or vice versa, and increase their profits consequently (firm performance). The analysis of price movements results in elasticity coefficients which assess price symmetry or asymmetry in speed and/or magnitude, nature and direction (Meyer and Von Cramon-Taubadel, 2004). Peltzman’s work (Peltzman, 2000) gave VPT studies a strong impulse, as the same methodology was applied to a wide range of product categories (agro-food products in particular) revealing that asymmetries in price transmission are often the rule rather than the exception in real markets. Once VPT is assessed, the issue goes back to whether market power can be simply inferred from the existence of asymmetries via industry concentration (as the SCP paradigm suggests) or not. Empirical evidence is mixed and it does not allow for simple generalisations about the causes of price asymmetries (Meyer and Von Cramon-Taubadel, 2004; Vavra and Goodwin 2005, Cavicchioli, 2010). VPT studies provide a variety of explanations to asymmetries that go beyond market power, and this clearly emerges even from the analysis of a restricted sample of literature. Within the VPT framework, the argument of firm/industry costs holds a central place among the causes of asymmetries. More specifically, different hypotheses about return to scale (e.g. increasing) may give reason of weak price transmission as firms, for example, can offset the increase of input price by way of increased efficiency (Bettendorf and Verboven, 2000; McCorriston et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2006). Transaction cost may affect price transmission in different ways. On the supply side, menu costs may prevent retailers from changing selling price despite variations of input prices or inflation (Ball and Mankiw, 1994); the organisation of stock management procedure (i.e. first-in-first-out and last-in-first-out of the stock) may determine time lags in price transmission (Reagan and Weitzman, 1982; Wohlgenant, 1985). Kimmel (Kimmel, 2009) develops practical reasoning about the process that lead firms to react to decrease/increase of input price, mixing considerations about cost structure, transaction cost which are implicit in the decision-making process regarding output level (e.g. via contracts, advertising), expectations, and the inherent time lag of decision making itself. On the demand side, transaction cost may also be effective if consumer search cost in oligopoly appears (Chavas and Mehta, 2001, p. 1; Sheldon and Sperling, 2003, p. 103). Modification of the macroeconomic framework started an interesting stream of studies which puts price transmission in relation with inflation and commodities price hikes (Bukeviciute et al., 2009), and with taxation (Bonnet and Réquillart, 2013). Supply and demand functions’ shape may also influence price transmission elasticity (Kinnucan and Forker, 1987; Azzam, 1999; Xia, 2009). A peculiar case in this chapter is the effect of food crises on price transmission. In such a context, falling demand or falling supply determines certain situations, which combines with imperfect information (e.g. food scare) and the pre-existing structure of the sectors involved (Aragrande and Canali, 2017). Edging toward the focus of this paper, changes of the institutional framework (e.g. CAP measures such as decoupling, quota, price floor; retail policy) have also been studied because of their effect on price transmission (Ferrucci et al., 2010; Bolotova and Novakocic, 2012; Cacchiarelli et al., 2016). Finally, we would like to make two last remarks about methodology. In the effort of shedding light on the reasons behind price asymmetries, Bakucs, Falkowski, and Fertő developed a meta-analysis of price transmission studies within the agro-food sector (Bakucs et al., 2014). This is an innovative perspective in this field and it revealed the relation of some “sets of factors” (e.g. farm sector structure, retail regulation, public support, etc.) with symmetric or asymmetric farm-retail price transmission in relation to country and/or product specifications. Last but not least, part of this debate is around the methods to test price transmission, which is inexorably evolving since decades. Aiming at classifying the types of asymmetries and the methods used to assess them, Frey and Manera conclude that each model fits better to detect some types of asymmetries and, in turn, each type of asymmetry is better caught by specific models (Frey and Manera, 2007). In 2012 the Commission’s Directorate-General for Agriculture and Rural Development (DG AGRI) commissioned a studyFootnote 1 to assess, among others, the influence of the 2006 reform of the EU sugar regime on: The price transmission within the sugar sector The industrial concentration and competition in the sector The 2006 reform of the sugar sector is the most recent step of a reforming process, which dates back to the World Trade Organization (WTO) establishment. Differently from previous attempts, this reform established a relevant break in the policy trend, and provided the opportunity to study the effects of the reform on price transmission (an unintended but not less relevant outcome of the reform). In 2011 the European Commission-Directorate General for Agriculture and Rural Development (DG AGRI) launched a study to assess the effects of 2006 sugar reform on price transmission in the European Union (EU) sugar industry. The study took into account the sugar sector situation up to the end of 2011. Starting form sugar industry, VPT was tested toward upstream and downstream sectors (respectively agriculture, and processing industry and retail). Furthermore, the impact of the reform on competition and concentration was tested. The study covered all of the Member States (MS) of the EU, which were grouped in sub-set of relevant countries (e.g. EU-15, NMS-12). Limited availability of data sometimes forced scholars to focus on more limited groups. This paper reports about the result of the study. Its relevance should be ascertained in consideration of the elements listed below: The absence of studies on price transmission in the sugar sector since the 2006 reform, as far as we know The geographical scope, which covers all of the EU Member States (with the sole limitation of availability, completeness and reliability of the existing data series), differently from previous research which was primarily based on simulation (OECD 2007) or focusing on individual Member States (Nolte et al., 2012; Hamulczuk and Szajner, 2015; Varga, 2007; Dejgård and Møller, 2007) The analysis of competition based on original price-cost margins data of sugar industry (an Adjusted Lerner Index modified to preserve industrial sensitive data was calculated) The analysis of concentration of the EU sugar industry (first and second degree) in a wide range of EU countries In the following pages, the “Methods” section explains the methodology adopted to develop the study; the “Results” section introduces the results of the theoretical and empirical analysis; the “Discussion” section discusses some outcomes and limitations of the study; and the “Conclusions” section draws general conclusions.",3

Madau,Roberto Furesi,Pietro Pulina,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The demand for milk and dairy products has grown dramatically throughout the world during the last decade. Consumption has particularly increased in eastern Asia (China in primis), in middle eastern Asia, and in Africa. As regards cow’s milk, Thiele et al. (2013) forecast that milk consumption would increase with an average growth of 12 million tons per annum until 2022, implying that demand will grow from today’s figure of more than 630 million tons to about 750 million tons. However, even if all the analysts agree that demand will increase in the near future, some estimates of the rate of growth in milk and dairy consumption are lower than others over the next 10 years, mostly because they predict a lower increase in Chinese demand (European Commission 2014). The greater part of the additional demand over the last 10 years has been satisfied by European producers, and this will continue to be the case. Indeed, the European Union (EU) is the most important supplier of milk and dairy products in the world market. The EU provides 24% of the world’s supply of fresh cow’s milk (Table 1). The three largest dairy companies (Nestlé, Lactalis, and Danone) operate in Europe. However, they are global companies operating in a dynamic market scenario that is characterized by a high level of mergers and acquisitions throughout the world, and the market is sensitive to price fluctuations (Rabobank 2016). European dairy competitiveness is certainly affected by this market situation. For example, several European producers have delocalized their activity in other Member States, with implications for technological transfer within the EU borders and for competitiveness. Recently, a new context was created for EU milk producers, because in March 2015, the era of milk quotas—which had characterized milk production for some 30 years—officially ended. The abolition of the milk quota system was not unexpected for producers, because it had been scheduled in the Mid-Term Review more than 10 years earlier (Berkum and Helming 2006; Frascarelli 2012; Lips and Rieder 2005; Rama 2013). Since 2004, a transition regime—involving lower support prices, the weaker protection of domestic supply, more authorized deliveries, and other actions—has been in place.Footnote 1 Since 2007, total milk production in Europe has been lower than the approved quotas, and prices have been more variable than before (European Commission, 2012). In 2009, for the first time, world prices fell below the support price, which was the last chance of shelter for European dairy farmers. In 2012, the EU produced a series of new instruments aimed at preparing the sector for this new operating environment and ensuring support for milk producers from 2015 onwards. These measures are contained in the so-called “Milk Package,” which takes a longer-term perspective and aims to orient the strategies for the dairy sector towards the market. All the measures established by the Milk Package will apply until mid-2020, and the European Commission is mandated to monitor the implementation of the Milk Package measures, the effects of their application, and the milk market situation. Several studies have been carried out to assess the impact of the new policy framework on the global dairy market arena. According to the US Dairy Export Council (USDEC), EU milk production will be about 11% higher in 2020 than it was 7 years before (USDEC 2015). The benefits of the growth in supply will be concentrated in six northern European countries: Ireland, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Denmark, and Poland. In the same period, the projected growth of EU dairy export flows is estimated to be about 5–6%. Other studies substantially validate the scenario proposed by USDEC. Jansik et al. (2014) talk about a true “Northern Europe Milk Belt” perspective in the coming years. Bouamra-Mechemache et al. (2008a, 2008b), Chantreuil et al. (2008), Kempen et al. (2011), Réquillart et al. (2008), and Witzke and Tonini (2008) all foresee an increase in the European milk supply of between 2.6 and 5.0%, as well as a price reduction ranging from 5.3 to 10.3%, with respect to the baseline milk quota scenario. The new institutional dairy regime can reinforce the competitive position of European producers in the global arena, as well as re-distributing the milk supply among the European countries. In this scenario, the efficiency and the productivity capacity of producers could play an important role in expanding production and, as a consequence, profitability. This is because the abolition of milk quotas potentially allows producers to expand their production outside the assigned cap, forcing them to use technical inputs efficiently in their operations to expand production. In other words, when there are no quotas in the market, the ability of milk farmers to produce efficiently might become more relevant than it was in the past. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the technical efficiency and factor productivity change of dairy farms in the EU countries in recent years, in order to determine which countries have shown the best performance adaptations since the quota regime was relaxed, and to evaluate the technical conditions for European farmers at the starting point of the new regime. A non-parametric efficiency analysis is applied to aggregate data relating to 22 European countries for 2004–2012, to estimate efficiency measures. The analysis allows us to estimate the role of efficiency in conditioning productivity and to understand how much effect efficiency can have on productivity after the abolition of the milk quotas. The “The empirical model and data” section illustrates the DEA model adopted and the data used.

Health complications of non-communicable diseases are clear indications of inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables (WHO 2002, 2003, 2015; Smith and Eyzaguirre 2007). About 400 g of fruits and vegetables are recommended for consumption per person per day by the World Health Organization (Ruel et al. 2005). However, households in Kenya consume inadequate fruits and vegetables, with the lowest levels reported in the poorest people (Ruel et al. 2005; Ayieko et al. 2008; van der Lans et al. 2012). Urban and rural dwellers in Kenya consume about 147 and 73 kg of vegetables per capita per year, respectively (Onim and Mwaniki 2008). Additionally, about 26% of the household food budget is expended on fruits and vegetables by urban dwellers in Kenya (Ayieko et al. 2008). Vegetable consumption in Kenya is constrained by factors related to demographics, socio-psychological, and food characteristics in addition to government and industrial actions (van der Lans et al. 2012). For instance, more women than men prefer vegetables for consumption (Kimiywe et al. 2007; Vorster et al. 2007). A rise in income increases the quantity of fruits and vegetables consumed per adult equivalent, with a prominent increase in fruits and sweet and Irish potatoes than for vegetables (Ayieko et al. 2008). Van der Lans et al. (2012) confirmed that lower disposable income hinders vegetable intake. Moreover, diversity in vegetable consumption is a necessary condition for a healthy diet, which requires a proper integration of dark, deep yellow, and starchy vegetables as well as tomatoes and beans in household meals (Oniang’o et al. 2003). African indigenous vegetables (AIVs) are sources of high-quality nutrition (Abukutsa 2007). They are easily accessible, inexpensive for poor people, and contain minerals and vitamins in levels exceeding those found in most exotic vegetables (Abukutsa 2007; Odhav et al. 2007; Uusiku et al. 2010; Singh et al. 2013). In this regard, AIVs are anticipated to contribute significantly to the global initiative of WHO in increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables in African countries (Smith and Eyzaguirre 2007). For several decades, AIVs have been consumed in African diets (Smith and Eyzaguirre 2007). Their expansion in production, marketing, and consumption could be attributed to increasing consumer awareness about their health and nutritional benefits (Schippers 2000). High marketing returns have motivated commercialization of AIVs by small-scale farmers, who produce and supply them either individually or collectively in groups (Ngugi et al. 2007; Muhanji et al. 2011; Weinberger et al. 2011). Currently, most food retail outlets sell AIV leaves, and their availability and diversity in high-valued retail outlets such as supermarkets have further induced their consumption in urban areas (Ngugi et al. 2007; Irungu et al. 2008). Changes in lifestyle and availability of cooling-storage facilities have also boosted their consumption levels in urban dwellers (Ruel et al. 2005). Moreover, ethnic background, cultural preferences, inter-marriages, and urbanization are important cultural interactions for enhancing AIV consumption among people from different ethnic origins (Maundu 1997; Kimiywe et al. 2007). A greater proportion of fresh AIV leaves sold in urban markets is supplied from various rural areas at different periods of the year due to variation in production seasons (Ngugi et al. 2007). Thus, availability of fresh leafy AIVs in urban areas is fairly constant across the year (Yang and Keding 2009). Their regular supply in urban markets is also enhanced through irrigation systems, commonly practiced by urban and peri-urban farmers (Yang and Keding 2009). Besides agro-ecological variations, oscillations in AIV production in rural farmers are prompted by a high dependency on rain-fed agriculture (Nekesa and Meso 1997). Significantly, this contributes to supply fluctuations, resulting in a cyclical reduction in the consumption of fresh leafy AIVs, especially in rural dwellers (Smith and Eyzaguirre 2007; Amaza 2009). According to Banwat et al. (2012), seasonal availability influence the consumption of fresh vegetables. Fresh leafy AIVs are usually consumed in large quantities during rainy seasons due to increased diversity and affordable prices (Kimiywe et al. 2007). Even though the supply of fresh vegetables is limited during dry spells, preserved and dried AIV leaves are major sources of nutrition in rural dwellers (Vorster et al. 2007; Yang and Keding 2009). However, nutritional benefits are limited from the consumption of dried rather than fresh leafy AIVs if they are poorly preserved during the drying process (Mibei and Ojijo 2011). More often, AIV leaves accompany starchy food stuff as side dishes (Maundu 1997; Kimiywe et al. 2007; Vorster et al. 2007). Thus, consumption frequency of starch meals could be important in explaining their regularity in household diets. Despite this, AIV consumption depends on household socio-economic variables, vegetable seasonality, retail price, market accessibility, availability of exotic vegetables in food systems, and degree of urbanization (Nekesa and Meso 1997; Yang and Keding 2009). Weinberger and Msuya (2004) revealed that AIV consumption frequency ranges from daily to several times a week during peak seasons and once a week to several times a week during off-peak seasons. Similarly, Amaza (2009) indicated an average AIV consumption frequency of two to three times a week. Strategies for enhancing food security have emphasized on the production of cereal-based crops (Dimara and Skuras 2003; Cavatassi et al. 2011). Even though cereals significantly contribute to dietary energy requirements (Oniang’o et al. 2003; Koenders 2010; Schipmann and Qaim 2010), they contain inadequate levels of micronutrients (Uusiku et al. 2010; Aaron et al. 2012). Consumption of cereals alone could accelerate occurrence of micronutrient-related diseases. Increasing vegetable consumption intensity is acknowledged as a strategic intervention for addressing micronutrient deficiency and reduces risks associated with degenerative diseases (Hughes and Keatinge 2013; Kamga et al. 2013; Birol et al. 2015). Leafy AIVs are superior vegetables with adequate dietary micronutrients (Singh et al. 2012, 2013). However, their consumption levels and frequency are still low to guarantee such benefits (Ruel et al. 2005; Kimiywe et al. 2007; Ngugi et al. 2007). It is from the foregoing that the study evaluated determinants of consumption intensity of leafy AIVs in Kenya. The study provides empirical evidence comparison on how socio-economic variables determine consumption intensity of leafy AIVs in rural and urban dwellers to cater for spatial heterogeneity in the population. Findings from this study could be important in informing policy formulation and implementation as well as vegetable marketers as they strive to increase AIV consumption to fight micronutrient deficiency and degenerative diseases.",29

However, export growth also influences natural resource use and factor allocation. Mega-scale forest exploitation by large exporter countries which results in significant loss of biodiversity and climate change effects has now attracted increasing global attention and scrutiny. If these result in shifting consumer preferences or tighter legal regulations in view of sustainability concerns, substantial repercussions on trade flows and consequently the socio-economic conditions of the exporting countries might follow. Global palm oil production has gained prominence over the past two decades, as it offers a number of competitive advantages over other competing oils, especially its lower cost and being free from trans-fatty acids. Global consumption of palm oil has also increased rapidly in the past decades, owing to its multiple uses both in the food industry as well as non-food sectors, including the biofuel industry. A major share of the total palm oil production in the world comes from Indonesia and Malaysia, the largest producers of palm oil (Table 1). In 2011, palm oil production by Indonesia and Malaysia was respectively around 48 and 38% of global production. These two countries also accounted for 91% of world palm oil export. While exports of palm oil are dominated by two countries, imports are less concentrated. As indicated in Table 1, India and China are the largest importers of crude palm oil in the world, followed by the European Union (EU) where imports are for a number of uses and, in recent years, increasingly for biofuels. The EU has aimed to increase its use of renewable energy from biofuels with one of the potential feedstocks being palm oil. However, it has been argued that the production of “palm oil-based biofuel” and associated conversion of forests and peatlands would cause even higher global emissions than those from the conventional fossil fuels that were supposed to be avoided (Butler 2008). Indonesia’s oil palm growth has also been linked to forest fires that lead to transboundary smoke haze pollution. It is accepted that a large share of oil palm expansion in Indonesia occurred on converted forests and peatlands, however with some controversy on the exact magnitudes. Finally, the impacts of oil palm expansion on the livelihood of local and forest-based indigenous communities further fuel the debate on the socio-environmental sustainability of this development (German et al. 2011). Various agencies have suggested that the EU should impose restrictions on palm oil imports (Butler 2012; EurActive 2013). The Indonesian oil palm industry was reportedly alarmed by the possibility of the EU issuing more stringent sustainability requirements on companies exporting palm oil to EU member states. Any imposition of stricter standards may hamper increased imports of Crude Palm Oil (CPO) as a biodiesel feedstock, particularly from Indonesia (AsiaPulse News 2008; Butler 2008). The EU effort was apparently directed to induce changes in oil palm farming practices, which was seen as a major source of deforestation, peatlands conversion, and climate change impact (Butler 2008). However, after the debate (and campaigns by the major palm oil producing countries), the European Commission (EC) in 2012 agreed to consider palm oil-based biodiesel as sustainable in the sense of the Renewable Energy Directive (Directive 2009/28/EC), if it is certified by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) scheme. The RSPO was founded in 2004 specifically to promote the adoption of credible, global, and sustainability standards among palm oil growers via the engagement of multiple stakeholders and supply chain members. It promotes the use of the RSPO label to support palm oil plantations that have satisfied certain sustainability criteria. The move by the EC may boost the exports of RSPO certified palm oil into Europe, as palm oil may receive favorable treatment over other crop-based biofuels (Butler 2012), but the fraction of certified Indonesian palm oil plantations is still low (Focus 2016). The latest development on the issue is that the European Parliament’s Environment Committee has agreed to support the EC to require companies to measure the amount of “indirect land use change” (ILUC) attributed to biofuel. This was taken despite the strong contention among palm oil exporter countries that the science on the climate impacts of ILUC has been inconclusive as well as the potential repercussions on food prices (Dave 2013). The trade impacts of non-RSPO certified CPO being banned from the EU biofuel sector and additional ILUC constraints possibly reinforced are difficult to assess. In the past, companies have often found ways to circumvent binding restrictions. RSPO certification is only required for the biofuel sector but not for other uses. Given the aforementioned background, this study develops a comparative static, partial equilibrium model of the Indonesian palm oil sector with explicit linkages to key trading partners to appraise the impact on the major enviro-economic variables in Indonesia of a rather modest reduction in demand for Indonesian palm oil in the EU markets due to sustainability restrictions. The paper investigates the effects of this reduction in palm oil imports on Indonesia’s oil palm growth, trade, and environmental impacts. Additionally, the study also considers the impact of a more drastic but rather unlikely scenario where all importers of Indonesia’s palm oil are imposing similar sectoral and trade measures so that import demand from all importers would decline accordingly. Policy and management implications, with special emphasis on the roles of sustainability criteria and certification for palm oil producers, are the main topic for the concluding section of the paper.",7
5.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,21 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-017-0081-1,Predicting minimum tillage adoption among smallholder farmers using micro-level and policy variables,December 2017,Paswel P. Marenya,Menale Kassie,Olaf Erenstein,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Due to dwindling arable land and ongoing unfavourable climatic changes, the need for sustainable intensification of agriculture has gained considerable urgency (The Royal Society 2009). This has increased interest in climate-smart agriculture (CSA), redirecting agricultural development in ways that recognize the present realities of climate change (Lipper et al. 2014). FAO defines CSA as agriculture that sustainably increases productivity, enhances resilience (adaptation), reduces greenhouse gases (GHGs mitigation) where possible and enhances the achievement of national food security and development goals (FAO 2013). This context has generated a growing interest in conservation agriculture whose key agronomic principles are as follows: minimization of soil disturbance; continuous maintenance of soil cover; and crop diversification (by rotations, intercropping or other crop associations) among other practices. Conservation agriculture is thereby posited to conserve soils and in the long run to improve soil properties, conserve moisture, stabilize and even enhance crop yields (Hobbs et al. 2008; FAO 2012). The principles of resource conservation and the envisaged outcomes are consistent with the basic notions of CSA. Around the globe, the adoption of conservation agriculture has been successful on larger farms in Australia, Canada, the USA and Latin America—most notably Brazil and Argentina—whereas in Africa where some evidence of adoption has been offered, these have been largely modest when measured in terms of widespread diffusion, for example in Ghana, India, Pakistan and Bolivia (Ekboir 2010). The productivity and environmental benefits of the minimum- and no-till aspects of conservation agriculture have been variously documented in the literature (Erenstein 2003; Hobbs 2007). Minimum tillage (or no-till) is a seedbed preparation method that involves minimizing the number of tillage operations by making only limited slots for placing the seed, either by using specialized machines (seeders) that open up small furrows in which seed is placed or by manually using ‘jab planters’, hoes or dip sticks to bore holes into which seeds are placed. In such cases, there is minimal soil disturbance since the rest of the field is left untilled. Mulching typically involves retaining crop residues and other plant materials on the surface of the plot to cover as much soil surface as possible. The mulch protects the soil from erosion, sun and wind, and the superficial biomass enhances infiltration and provides nutrition to the biota that aerate the soil. Erenstein (2003) enumerated the beneficial impacts of mulching on soil conservation, soil ecology, crop yields and the environment. If implemented properly, the combination of minimum tillage (or no-till) and mulching can alleviate or even halt soil erosion and lead to water conservation and reduced runoff, groundwater replenishment and enhancement of soil biota. In some cases, yield stabilization and increases have also been observed (Erenstein 1999, 2003). Conservation agriculture for smallholder farmers raises challenging questions regarding its adoption, diffusion and scaling at farm level and beyond. The multiple component technologies that need to be applied simultaneously are one complicating factor. Here, we focus on the subset of minimum tillage combined with mulching (MTM).Footnote 1 MTM is likely to face impediments to adoption associated with the inherent substitution of practices, e.g. seasonal labour scarcities for weeding, given that absence of herbicides can make weed-management more labour-demanding in minimum-tillage systems (Nyamangara et al. 2014). Other constraints relate to the opportunity cost of crop residues for feed rather than mulch (Pannell et al. 2014, Jaleta et al. 2013, 2015), and possible short term yield depression in the initial years of implementing no-till and mulching (Pannell et al. 2014). Smallholders often have short-term planning horizons due to high discount rates and are often unwilling to accept yield penalties for a few years to improve soil conditions and yields in later years (Pannell et al. 2014; Erenstein 2003). The objective of this paper is to examine the contribution of micro-level household and policy variables in conditioning the simultaneous adoptionFootnote 2 of two important conservation agriculture component technologies: minimum tillage combined with mulching (hereinafter, MTM). The first hypothesis we test is that MTM adoption is conditioned by the characteristics of the smallholder farm, particularly its demographic characteristics, plot characteristics and market and credit access. The second hypothesis is that MTM adoption is also conditioned by macro-level policy variables beyond the farm. We therefore include multiple countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi and Tanzania) so as to include country-level policy variables obtained from secondary sources: (1) extension personnel-to-farmer ratios (EFR) and (2) subsidy expenditure as a percentage of agricultural budgets spent on farm input subsidies (SER). Based on the above micro- and macro-level variables, the contribution of this paper to the literature on MTM adoption is as follows: The use of a multi-country dataset allows us to analyse the co-determinants of adoption of MTM across diverse environments. Much of the evidence in the literature is still based on localized cross-sectional surveys (Erenstein and Thorpe 2010; Hobbs 2007) and sometimes on extrapolations from these (Erenstein et al. 2012). The use of multi-country data that spans a north-south gradient in eastern and southern Africa enables us to present MTM adoption evidence from a regional perspective. The results from such a multi-country analysis can facilitate lesson sharing across countries and also sensitize the agricultural development community to the pitfalls of broad generalizations in terms of what works for MTM adoption. This multi-faceted approach is needed to help improve the external validity of adoption evidence on MTM specifically and on conservation agricultureFootnote 3 more broadly. This paper also helps answer an important outstanding question: based on its resource-conserving and cost-reduction advantages (labour and animal draft power) as reported in the literature, can MTM circumvent the adoption challenges faced by other agricultural innovations with regard to smallholders? To try to answer this question, we analyse the predictors of adoption using models that are similar in approach and hypothesis to those used in adoption studies generally. We fill a notable gap in the literature concerning the need to analyse the adoption of component technologies involved in conservation agriculture beyond the micro-level. Some researchers, e.g. Knowler and Bradshaw (2007), have reported that whereas most of the conservation agriculture costs are incurred at the farm level, most of the environmental benefits transcend the farm boundary. This is a factor that brings conservation agriculture adoption into the orbit of policies designed to achieve sustainable agricultural production. Our contribution here is to demonstrate how the adoption of MTM can be predicted from the national-level policy environment. The four study countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania and Malawi) span a north-south gradient in eastern and southern Africa. They were purposively selected for this study and the overarching research-for-development project that collected the data used in this study. The project was implemented by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center in collaboration with national research partners in the four countries. The socioeconomic component of the project collected data based on household surveys intended for use in analysing socio-demographic factors that could be associated with adoption or non-adoption of conservation agriculture-based practices such as MTM. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: the rest of the introductory section outlines the background on the four study countries with focus on policy issues on agricultural extension and subsidies, followed by a brief overview of the history of conservation agriculture and ending with an outline of the possible drivers of MTM adoption and diffusion in each country. The introductory section is followed by a section that offers a detailed description of the sampling and data-collection methods, the variables and the analytical approach frameworks. The ‘Methods’ section is followed by a presentation of the results from a probit estimation using the pooled and individual country samples as well as those from the post-estimation simulations. The final section concludes this paper by summarizing the key findings and stating the policy implications and suggestions for future research. In the eastern and southern Africa (ESA) region, agricultural extension services were somewhat neglected in the years after the 1980s, largely as a consequence of structural adjustment programmes (Rivera and Alex 2004; Pye-Smith 2012). In years since that period, there is now some renewed policy focus on agricultural extension. In 2010 for example, Ethiopia was estimated to be on track to have one of the most favourable ratios of extension-personnel-to-farmer ratios in Africa (projected to rise to 21 per 10,000 in short order (Davis et al. 2010)). This compares favourably with the recommendation in Pye-Smith (2012): a ratio of 33 extension agents for every 10,000 farmers was reported as the minimum ratio needed for an effective extension system. In Kenya, smallholder farmers have traditionally benefited from the government extension system supplemented by commodity-based programmes run by parastatal and private agribusiness corporations and farmer cooperatives. However, government budget allocation for extension services declined from 6% of the annual government budget in the 1980s to only 2% (in real terms) in the years since then (Muyanga and Jayne 2006). A new extension policy is now being implemented (Government of Kenya, 2012), reflecting a re-focus on extension. In Tanzania, like the rest of the study countries, agricultural extension services are provided by the public sector through the Ministry of Agriculture. Recently, the National Agriculture Policy of 2007 stated the government’s intention to increase the number of extension workers by about 15,000 (Daniel 2013). The government extension services also remain the major provider of extension services in Malawi (Masangano and Mthinda 2012). In 2000, a white paper with a bottom-up and participatory focus for planning was published to guide the extension system in the country (Masangano and Mthinda 2012). In recent years, there has been a return of fertilizer subsidies in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) after a period of their absence in the wake of the structural adjustment programmes of the 1980s and 1990s. For example, Malawi spent about 72% of its agricultural budget in 2008/2009 on agricultural input subsidies (Dorward and Chirwa 2010). The subsidized distribution of fertilizer and improved seeds (maize and beans) at 90% subsidy has played a big role in the wider use of these inputs in the country. In 2003, the government of Tanzania reinstated the fertilizer transport subsidy, and this was still operational in 2007 and in 2008 through the National Agricultural Input Voucher Scheme (NAIVs) (Pan and Christiaensen 2011). Although Kenya has a long history of relying on the private sector as a key driver in the fertilizer and seed markets, in 2013, the Kenyan Government introduced a fertilizer subsidy programme administered by the state cereal marketing board. In Ethiopia, the agricultural input sectors are mainly controlled by the state. Since 1994, aiming to reach many poor farmers who do not have cash to pay for inputs (fertilizer and seed), the government has been providing credit guarantees to help lower trade-financing costs and the national extension programme is often the major buyer and distributor of seeds and fertilizer in order to boost supplies of these (Kherallah et al. 2002). The history of conservation agriculture in the four countries suggests that its promotion is variously attributable to agricultural development projects (Milder et al. 2011). The emergence of conservation agriculture as a component of sustainable agriculture in ESA can be traced in the literature to the 1990s. At the 1996 World Food Summit, the Soil Fertility Initiative was launched, followed by the Better Land Husbandry approach. In 1998, a conservation tillage workshop was held in Zimbabwe, and in 2000, the African Conservation Tillage network was formed (Bishop-Sambrook et al. 2004). One of the early efforts to introduce minimum tillage in Ethiopia was done by Sasakawa-Global (SG2000) in South Achefer district (Matsumoto et al. 2004). In Kenya, conservation agriculture has been formally promoted since 1998 under the Kenya Conservation Tillage Initiative (KCTI), and by 2005, KCTI had projects in five districts in the country. The 3rd World Congress on Conservation Agriculture was held in Kenya, and the government (represented by the vice-president of Kenya at that time) expressed its commitment to conservation agriculture in its strategy to revitalize agriculture (ACT 2008 p. 9). Interest in and research on conservation agriculture in Malawi date back to the 1980s at Bunda College (Mloza-Banda 2002). This interest has been sustained over the years, as evidenced by wide-ranging literature such as Munthali et al. (2008) on socioeconomic factors that affect adoption of conservation practices, Ngwira et al. (2013) on the estimated benefits of conservation agriculture for smallholders in terms of economic and biophysical outcomes, Ngwira et al. (2012) on the evaluation of conservation agriculture-based maize-legume intercropping systems and Kaczan et al. (2013) which provides a review of conservation agriculture in Malawi. In Tanzania, Marietha et al. (2011) report on a joint programme in 2004 run by the German Ministry of Agriculture and FAO-supported conservation agriculture practices in Northern Tanzania—one of the earliest concerted efforts to promote conservation agriculture in Tanzania. The project used farmer field schools as entry points for extension and farmer education on conservation agriculture, and the private sector was encouraged to participate by retailing and developing custom hire services for conservation agriculture equipment. At the farm level, an oft-cited advantage of MTM is that it lowers the costs involved in land preparation (Fowler and Rockstrom 2001). For example, reduced tractor and fuel costs have been a major driver of adoption in mechanized large-scale systems, especially if herbicides are available to manage increased weed pressure (Erenstein et al. 2012). There is mixed evidence regarding yield increases due to reduced or minimum tillage (Giller et al. 2009). The evidence on mulching is also mixed, being complicated by the critical trade-offs between mulch, feed and other uses (Jaleta et al. 2013, 2015). In Morocco, Magnan et al. (2012) calculated the opportunity costs of crop residue in no-till systems and found that the shadow value (its value in livestock feeding as opposed to soil mulch) was 25% of the total value of the crop produced during normal rainfall and 75% during drought (when crop residues become most valuable as animal feed). Similarly, a study by Valbuena et al. (2012) comparing conservation agriculture practices in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa showed that the use of crop residues for mulching was most feasible in ‘high-potential areas’ where biomass production levels are likely to be high enough to meet the demands of both livestock and mulching. The implementation of conservation agriculture can represent significant learning costs for farmers who can ill afford extended periods of trial and perhaps error. For resource poor farmers, the financial resources needed for complementary external inputs such as herbicides or fertilizers to implement MTM properly, and the increased labour needed for weed management, can still represent serious challenges if their main resource is family labour. In situations where opportunities for accessing credit or earning cash incomes are limited, and where MTM requires significant commitment of learning time, cash or labour, adoption may prove sluggish (Jack 2013).",15

Micheels,Andreas Boecker,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The number of farmers’ markets has been growing across Canada in the past decade (Dukeshire et al. 2014). A recent study of consumers at farmers’ markets in Toronto, Ontario, found that consumers use farmers’ markets not only to fulfil specific grocery needs but also to support local agricultural firms (Dodds et al. 2013). Hence, sales in Ontario farmers’ markets by primary producers were estimated to be between $385 million and $577 million annually in 2010, up from an estimated $73 million in 1999 (Cummings et al. 1999; Regional Analytics and Planscape 2011). Innovative and entrepreneurial agricultural firms may aspire to improve performance by marketing their production in a manner that takes advantage of these trends. For example, farms in Ontario market their production direct to consumers through not only farmers’ markets but also on-farm markets and roadside stands, community-supported agriculture and boxing schemes, and on- and off-farm events. It is estimated that these additional outlets account for 25% of direct sales while farmers’ markets account for 75% (Schumilas 2010). Given the increased use of direct and alternative marketing channels in Ontario, a greater understanding of the factors that drive current and expected success within these alternative marketing channels seems warranted. The move to direct and alternative markets may signal that firms are not satisfied with current levels of performance achieved through more traditional channels and are therefore searching for other means to improve performance (Levinthal and March 1993; Mount 2012). In the search for new profit opportunities, firms may modify product offerings or production practices to differentiate their production from that of other firms. For smaller firms, innovations in how the product is marketed may be more scale-appropriate and more likely to lead to improved performance (Moser et al. 2011). However, as the number of farmers’ markets has increased (Dukeshire et al. 2014) along with the number of farms selling a portion of their production through farmers markets (Uematsu and Mishra 2011), these farm businesses need to further differentiate themselves from competition for continued success. In this sense, farm-based businesses who have moved into direct and alternative marketing channels may now face greater levels of competition compared to early adopters within these channels. This would suggest that the resources and capabilities that have been important in determining success in other small businesses may now be important in determining success of farm-based direct marketing ventures. However, as these farm businesses often start out as traditional farms, the level of human and relational capital that has been invested in developing resources to identify new opportunities in product or market spaces may be rather limited. As these markets become increasingly competitive, firms that are more quickly able to identify and respond to market needs may have improved performance outcomes. Research across different industries has shown that firms that are aware of opportunities and are able to respond to these opportunities are able to improve performance (Renko et al. 2009; Rauch et al. 2009). However, since firms and their resource endowment, including managerial skill sets, are heterogeneous, firms may develop and employ diverse strategies in the search for profit. For research in this area, this raises the need for addressing the identification of critical resources—managerial skills on the one hand and adaptive strategies on the other—as well as determining the interrelations among them. In the managerial research literature, a number of constructs have been developed and applied empirically to capture the managerial resources that facilitate efficient responses to change. The purpose of this paper is to examine how two of these constructs, market orientation and entrepreneurial orientation, affect the focus of innovation on the farm and the satisfaction with current and expected performance. Recent work in this area examined the role of these constructs and other factors on new product success and the number of marketing channels utilized by direct marketers (Mirzaei et al., 2016). Slater and Narver (1995, pp 67) define market orientation as “the culture that (1) places the highest priority on the profitable creation and maintenance of superior customer value while considering the interests of other key stakeholders; and (2) provides norms for behaviour regarding the organizational development of and responsiveness to market information.” While cultures such as this are important, the delivery of superior value to the customer requires action on the part of the firm. That action may stem from an entrepreneurial orientation, which Lumpkin and Dess (1996, pp. 136) define as “the processes, practices, and decision-making activities that lead to new entry.” The entry described may be entry into new marketing channels or new product markets and may be a response to increasing consumer demand for locally produced products (Adams and Adams 2011; Hu et al. 2012; Gracia 2012; Kim et al. 2014). We developed a survey that measures market orientation, entrepreneurial orientation, and product and marketing innovations of farmers in Ontario over the past 3 years. Product innovations we examine are new products and new packaging of existing products, while marketing innovations include the use of new marketing channels and new promotional strategies as well as changes in pricing. Using the data from the survey, we build a partial least squares structural equation model (PLS-SEM) to determine how these latent variables are interrelated and affect expected future performance and satisfaction with current performance. This work contributes to the literature on performance analysis of agricultural firms marketing their production through direct and alternative market channels by simultaneously examining critical managerial skills and adaptive strategies in their impact on performance. In the sections that follow, we review the prior literature surrounding direct marketing, market orientation, and entrepreneurial orientation. We use this literature to develop hypotheses and a structural model that will be used to test the hypotheses. The “Methods” section outlines the data and methods used in the study. The “Results and discussion” section describes the results of the structural equation model used to test the hypotheses. Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion of the results, the implications of these results to managers and other stakeholders, and an outlook on further research that would address some of the limitations of this study.",9
5.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,12 May 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-017-0078-9,The single farm payment and income risk in Irish farms 2005–2013,December 2017,Edward Knapp,Jason Loughrey,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The European Union has throughout its history, intervened in agricultural markets through the European Common Agricultural Policy (hereinafter “CAP”), which began in 1958 as one of the original core policies of the European Community (EC) (ECPA 2013). Much of this support is directed to farmers as direct payments (DP). These payments are an effort to stabilise and increase farm income while sustaining farm businesses and the agricultural goods and services that they provide. As farmers around the world face climate change and competitive global markets, farm incomes have become increasingly unstable (Di Falco et al. 2014). In this context, it is important to analyse the relationship between DP and the variability of market incomes (i.e. farm incomes excluding the DP) for the Irish case. A well-targeted DP policy can assist those farms which are inherently more vulnerable to high variability in market incomes. At the same time, the DP can incentivize farmers towards riskier behaviour than would otherwise be the case and these unintended consequences must be addressed in any economic analysis of the relationship between DP and farm income variability (Capitanio and Adinolfi 2009). Volatility in Ireland’s agricultural sector has become a key issue for stakeholders across the industry (O’Connor and Keane 2011; O'Donoghue and Hennessy 2015). The rise in farm income volatility is not confined to any one farming system (Hynes and Hennessy 2012). The increased volatility of milk output prices and dairy farm incomes has, however, received the most attention (McDonald et al. 2014; Loughrey et al. 2015). European farmers, researchers and policy makers are preparing for continued price and income volatility into the future (Assefa et al. 2015; El Benni and Finger 2013). This raises a few interesting questions which must be answered if income variability is to be moderated for Irish farmers. Where does the increasing risk in Irish agriculture stem from? What are the implications of a persistently volatile farming environment? Which tools can we utilise to manage and adapt to risk while preserving the sustainability of Irish farms? The purpose of this study is to build towards answers to these vital questions. In particular, we focus our attention on the potential relationship between decoupled farm paymentsFootnote 1 and the variability of market incomes. Decoupled farm payments can reduce the overall farm income variability as these payments provide a more stable income source relative to income gained through market activities (Severini et al. 2016b). This study adds to the body of literature which questions the extent to which the so-called “decoupled payments” are truly decoupled from production decisions (Capitanio and Adinolfi 2009; Femenia et al. 2010; Howley et al. 2012; Finger and Lehmann 2012).Footnote 2
 In the context of the potential relationship between decoupled payments and risk management decisions, Hennessy (1998) concluded in a US study that the term “decoupled” can be misleading as both the wealth effect and the presence of risk aversion can ensure that decoupled payments affect production decisions. Indeed, Finger and Lehmann (2012) found among Swiss farmers that DP have a negative effect on the demand for hail insurance as a risk management strategy. Similarly, Koundouri et al. (2009) found that decoupled payments significantly altered the risk attitude of farmers in Finland after European Union accession. The literature has not always, however, identified a significant relationship between decoupled payments and risk attitudes or risk management decisions (Serra et al. 2011). It is therefore an empirical matter as to whether or not a relationship exists between decoupled payments and farm income risk in a particular context. In investigating the origins of the recent increase in commodity price risk exposure to farmers, there are some explanations including the role of macroeconomic forces (Karali and Power 2013) and monetary policy action and communication (Hayo et al. 2012). In microeconomic theory, the weakness of short-term production and consumption elasticities in responding to economic shocks are cited as contributory factors (Gilbert 2006; Gilbert and Morgan 2010). Food producers are particularly vulnerable to commodity price risk as they must commit resources for the duration of a production cycle whereas consumers may have the opportunity to switch their consumption patterns in the short run (Sandmo 1971; Bellemare 2015). In developed countries, the exposure of consumers to commodity price risk is therefore usually considered less problematic than the exposure of farmer producers. Barrett and Bellemare (2011) have concluded that from a consumer perspective, “the world does not necessarily face a price volatility problem. It faces a high food price problem”. In the next section, we provide some detail on the policy background and in particular the efforts of European policymakers to address farm income variability. We follow this with a description of the theoretical relationship between DP, farm assets and farm income variability. This is followed by an empirical analysis of farm income risk in Ireland from decoupling in 2005 to 2013. The econometric analysis highlights the relationship between European single farm payment subsidies and the market income risk of farmers. While the single farm payment is seen “…as an important cushion against commodity price volatility” (DAFM 2015), the data suggests that high direct subsidy payments are actually associated with higher market income risk. To avoid the negative impacts associated with high farm income variability, producers and policymakers internationally have developed a number of risk management strategies. Research has found that these strategies vary widely in terms of efficacy and may have actually served to increase income risk in the long term. Mishra and Sandretto (2002) examined the variability in net farm income in the USA since the development of farm price and income support programmes in the 1930s and conclude that variability did not fall between the mid-1930s and the end of the twentieth century and that the increase in non-farm income played an important role in reducing overall household income variability. The European Union policy interventions have included a range of incentives including consumption subsidies, intervention prices, price floors, export refunds, import tariffs, quotas for food products, precautionary savings and crop insurance subsidies (Jongeneel et al. 2010; ECPA 2013). One of the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), as provided by Article 39 in the 1957 Treaty of Rome, is “to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, in particular by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture”. Food market stabilisation has been identified as a key to reaching these goals of CAP (ECPA 2013). The CAP expenditures now account for approximately 40% of the European Union budget (European Commission 2016). The CAP policies dampened downside market risk but were found to significantly boost the risk appetites of producers (Serra et al. 2011; Sckokai and Moro 2009). Matthews (2010) concludes that prior to 2005, the CAP successfully insulated EU domestic prices from the volatility of the world market but the price stability interventions became “increasingly intertwined with and dominated by” a motivation to simply transfer income to the EU farm sector. The associated “budget costs” and “environmental criticisms” motivated policymakers towards reforming agricultural policy supports and deciding to largely decouple farm subsidies from production in the 2003 reforms, which became enacted in 2005 (Capitanio and Adinolfi 2009). These reforms essentially involved a replacement of price supports with direct subsidy payments based on historical production. Since DP do not directly affect farmers’ price uncertainty as price supports do, these payments theoretically have a less distorting effect on production and risk decisions (Sckokai and Moro 2009). DP have the potential, however, to increase farmers’ wealth, which tends to slightly increase the risk appetite over the long term (Kazukauskas et al. 2013). Decoupled subsidies ought to reduce income variability as they are more predictable and not dependent on production (Fidrmuc et al. 2013) cited in (Kazukauskas et al. 2013). However, it is this very predictability that makes decoupled payments attractive as collateral to financial institutions (Rizov et al. 2013). This gives farmers the opportunity to increase debt levels and increase production which can ultimately lead to higher income risk. DP also act as a type of income insurance for farmers which crowds out other “natural” risk management strategies such as diversification and may induce less risk averse behaviour (El Benni et al. 2012; Falco et al. 2014). The CAP has undergone numerous reforms and policy regimes since its inception. In a study of the relationship between the European Union policy regime and farm income variability among a subset of arable farms in Germany, Feil et al. (2014) found that farm income variability increased from the mid-1980s onwards and suggested that this could be attributed to “rising price volatility in markets for agricultural commodities” in addition to the relevant policy reforms. Mary (2013) found single farm payments to be less investment distorting than counter-cyclical insurance payments among crop farms in France. In a study by Serra et al. (2011), decoupled payments were found to have negligible effects on risk preferences in the short run among a group of Kansas farmers. Severini et al. (2016a) investigated the farm income variability among Italian farms between 2003 and 2012 and found that income variability increased during this time but with significant differences among farm groups in the levels and evolution of income variability. Severini et al. (2016a) conclude that the increasing level of farm income variability supports the idea of introducing risk management tools within the CAP toolbox. Research suggests that income variability is growing overall but that each source of risk needs to be addressed individually. Farm type, size, and location are major factors in the risk burden that a farm carries, and these elements also impact the farm’s ability to manage risk (Severini et al. 2016b). High levels of income risk or improperly structured subsidy and risk management policies may cause farmers to reduce their provision of social, environmental and economic goods (Capitanio and Adinolfi 2009). Farm families may restrict their consumption impacting negatively on their welfare. Investment may also be reduced, which can hurt productivity in the long term (O'Toole et al. 2014). Fortunately, farmers and policymakers have multiple methods at their disposal to mitigate income risk and the negative consequences associated with it. Although farmers have many ways of managing income risk independently, these strategies may be dependent on factors such as the production system, labour market or financial situation of the individual farm. Government efforts to smooth farm incomes can often be costly and may induce riskier farmer behaviour in the long run. As farm income volatility increases, policies must be structured to effectively manage short run and long run while efficiently utilising limited government funds.",5

As most of Africa’s poor depend largely on agriculture for their livelihoods (IFAD 2011), improving the productivity, profitability, and sustainability of the agricultural sector is argued to be the main pathway out of poverty in the continent (Christiaensen et al. 2011; Asfaw et al. 2012; Dawson et al. 2016). In spite of this fact, agricultural sector growth in Africa has been lagging (Diao et al. 2012). Particularly the agricultural productivity in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) remains stagnant (Tittonell and Giller 2013). Over the past four decades, agricultural productivity growth in SSA averaged only 2.4% while the productivity of the rest of the developing world improved by 4% (Dzanku et al. 2015). Ethiopia is among the countries in this region where agriculture plays a vital role in the economy. In the country, agriculture accounts for 40.2% of GDP, 80% of employment, and 70% of export earnings (UNDP 2015). About 85% of its population live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for necessities and as a source of employment (Negatu et al. 2016). Therefore, the performance of this sector determines the fate of the economy of the country. Nonetheless, smallholder farmers who are illiterate, living on the threshold between subsistence and poverty, dominate the sector. Their production system depends on outdated technologies coupled with lack of access to credit, market information, improved technologies, functioning markets (for inputs, outputs, finance, consumer goods, and services, etc.), and other infrastructure (Gebremedhin et al. 2009; Alene and Hassan 2006; Pender and Gebremedhin 2007). Farmers can overcome those problems by acting cooperatively to obtain collective strength that they do not have individually, and in doing so, they find the pathway out of poverty and powerlessness (Birchall and Simmons 2009; Bibby and Shaw 2005). Hence, they need to get organized and cooperatives are an ideal, member-owned, business organization as it offers the institutional framework through which members control both production and marketing activities (Davis 2008). According to OCDC (2007), cooperatives are the only form of business organization that addresses fully all the economic, democratic, and social dimensions of poverty reductionFootnote 1 simultaneously. Especially, an agricultural cooperative is widely considered as a vital foundation that can help smallholder farmers to overcome the constraints that hinder them from taking advantages of their business as it empowers economically weak farmers by enhancing their collective bargaining power and thereby reduces the risks that they face in the market (Woldu et al. 2013). Most importantly, the role of agricultural cooperatives is very significant in SSA where farms are fragmented over vast and remote rural areas (Wanyama et al. 2009). Several empirical studies show that agricultural cooperatives improve farm productivity through their influence on the adoption of productivity-enhancing technologies (Spielman et al. 2010; Francesconi and Heerink 2011; Abebaw and Haile 2013) and by improving farm productivity (Abate et al. 2014; Francesconi and Ruben 2012). For instance, in Ethiopia, cooperatives are actively involved in the dissemination of agricultural inputs and about 56% of chemical fertilizers were provided by cooperatives in the 2010 production season (Matsumoto and Yamano 2010). Cooperatives can also provide credit services to member farmers that ease production constraints (Tefera et al. 2016). This improvement in agricultural productivity is important for enhancing farmer livelihood, reducing rural poverty, and increasing food security (Shiferaw et al. 2014; Zeng et al. 2015; Asfaw et al. 2012; Kassie et al. 2011; Becerril and Abdulai 2010; Alene et al. 2009; Minten and Barrett 2008; Evenson and Gollin 2003). Several studies also indicate that cooperative membership improves the commercialization behavior of smallholder farmers (Bernard and Spielman 2009; Markelova and Mwangi 2010). Commercialization improves farm productivity and farm income at microlevel, and it improves food security and allocative efficiency at macro level (Timmer 1997). In addition to this, cooperatives can also reduce transaction costs and information asymmetry by strengthening farmers’ negotiation ability (Hellin et al. 2009; Trebbin 2014). This will, in turn, increase the income of farmers (members) through their bargaining power, which increases the price of the product they produced and lowers the costs of purchased inputs. Furthermore, more inclusive cooperatives play a strong social role in improving gender relations and helping women create safe spaces to build their social solidarity and problem-solving capacity, particularly in all-female cooperatives (Baden and Pionetti 2011). Different studies (e.g. Leistritz 2004; Wanyama et al. 2008; Getnet and Anullo 2012; Ito et al. 2012; Verhofstadt and Maertens 2014) also confirm the role of cooperatives in poverty reduction and in improving the livelihood of smallholder farmers. However, there are also cases where collective actions did not improve farmers’ situation (Poulton et al. 2010). Therefore, more research is required to show the role of agricultural cooperatives and to indicate what really works under which conditions. Hence, this paper aims to identify factors that influence farmers’ decisions to join agricultural cooperatives and estimates the impact of agricultural cooperative membership on the welfareFootnote 2 of smallholder farmers of eastern Ethiopia. The present paper contributes to the growing literature on the role of agricultural cooperatives in three major directions. First, we provide insights into the determinants of agricultural cooperative membership. Therefore, this study allows us to draw implications on cooperative inclusiveness. Second, we evaluate the impact of agricultural cooperatives on the welfare of smallholder farmers quantitatively. Third, in our evaluation of these impacts, we examine if agricultural cooperative membership has a heterogeneous impact on wellbeing among its members. Examining the heterogeneous treatment effects of cooperative membership allows to understand how cooperatives can be more effective in improving the wellbeing of rural community (Verhofstadt and Maertens 2014).",54

They belong to the broad category of the so called hybrid institutions where the term hybrid refers to complex organizational forms which many stakeholders performing jointly tasks that neither the market nor the individual firm can achieve. The extremely wide and heterogeneous literature on the topic confirms that economists increasingly acknowledge the efficacy of the concept in analyzing the organization of supply and are challenged by the complexity of these institutions when trying to better understand their role in the organization of different aspects of the economic life (Hobbs 1996; Menard 2004; Oliver 1990; Oliver and Ebers 1998). Since the contributions by Davis and Goldberg and by Malassis (Davis and Goldberg 1958; Goldberg 1968; Malassis 1969), it is widely recognized that in industrial economies the production of food is organized in complex systems where diverse specialized firms interact intensively and progressively modify raw materials, adding intermediate input-ingredient services and anything that increase value to the final consumer. In the last decades, the complexity of the system increased further so that it has been often referred to as the industrialization of agriculture (Fonte and Cucco 2015; Traill 1996). There is general consensus—both among researchers and practitioners—on the idea that in order to market their products to be profitable, agro-food firms increasingly need to be embedded in a network of relationships that goes beyond those of spot markets (Belaya and Hanf 2016; Bouamra-Mechemache et al. 2016; Galizzi and Venturini 1999). However, it is less clear which kind of relationships are better suited for the different tasks to be performed and what are the most effective ways to promote these patterns of relations under different settings. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, it discusses how the functioning and performance of food chains is affected by the way stakeholders are embedded in the chains, by the coordination modes, and by the kind of governance. Second, by depicting a few relevant kinds of agro-food chains, it seeks at showing that, in order to foster their competitiveness and capacity to remunerate all the involved stakeholders, the complexity of supply chains needs to be addressed and understood. As a side goal, the paper aims at contributing to highlight the existence of some drawbacks that may impinge the effectiveness of supply chain and, particularly, the gains that farmers may enjoy in participating to them. In order to reach its goals, the paper extensively draws from different strands of economic literature as well as from the authors’ experience in the field coming from several research projects and consultancies for public agencies on related topics over quite a long time span. The text is organized as follows: The second Section is devoted to shaping the theoretical framework for understanding the role and scope of supply chains as hybrid institutions. This also sets the basic terms and concepts for building the typologies of food supply chains. The section also provides a discussion of the main peculiar features of the agro-food sector that make the concept of supply chain particularly relevant for the sector. The third Section is an attempt to contributing to a first taxonomy of supply chains in the food sector by depicting six different chain typologies, their distinctive features, the possible overlappings, and the strengths and limits of each one. Some concluding remarks are given in the last Section.",30
5.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,03 February 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-017-0072-2,Effects of local institutions on the adoption of agroforestry innovations: evidence of farmer managed natural regeneration and its implications for rural livelihoods in the Sahel,December 2017,Joachim N. Binam,Frank Place,Antoine Kalinganire,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The dry areas of the developing world occupy about 3 billion hectares and are home to 2.5 billion people: 41% of the Earth’s land area and more than one-third of its population. About 16% of this population lives in chronic poverty (Solh and Saxena 2011). Drylands have limited natural resources. They already face serious environmental constraints, which are likely to worsen as a result of climate change. The West African Sahel and dry savannas is one of the five developing-country regions where dryland agriculture faces serious challenges. Dryland agro-ecosystems include a diverse mix of food, fodder and fiber crops; vegetables, rangeland, and pasture species; fruit and fuel-wood trees; medicinal plants; livestock, and fish. Dryland systems are characterized by persistent frequent droughts, water scarcity, rapid population growth, high climatic variability, land degradation and desertification, and widespread poverty. Two of the biggest challenges facing Sahelian countries today are reducing poverty, especially among rural households, and preventing climate shocks by protecting the ecosystems, which provide essential services for a growing population whose survival is dependent to a large extent on a combination of subsistence rain-fed crop farming, and extensive livestock rearing, supplemented with the gathering of agroforestry tree products (AFTPs) including wood, grasses, fruits, leafy vegetables, nuts, and condiments. Connecting the valuation of ecosystem services with the rural poor in the identified countries could make a significant contribution to both these challenges. Most of the population in Sahel consists of smallholder subsistence farmers who produce their own food in less than one hectare (Place et al. 2013). Indeed, as indicated by Sanogo et al. (2016), those farmers critically depend upon local ecosystems for survival and are directly affected by changes in availability of ecosystem goods and services. Thus, the loss of ecosystem services, important for livelihoods and many other ecological and environmental functions, can be devastating for the rural poor in Sahel. A more productive use of natural resources contributes to increasing food security and raising incomes among the rural poor in the Sahel. For example, deforestation has contributed to soil erosion, loss of agricultural productivity, and the scarcity of fuelwood. The loss of wetlands has threatened the availability of water leading to a need to invest in ecosystem services in order to improve people’s resilience (Polak, 2008). By using their land properly, collectively and individually, smallholder farmers can provide valuable services, such as carbon sequestration, water flow, or biodiversity protection. For example, it has been shown according to Weston et al. (2015) that Sahelian parklands resulting from the conversion of forest to agricultural landscapes are important sources of benefits both for rural populations and the landscapes. Indeed, trees from agroforestry parklands can reduce wind speed while increasing soil fertility and air humidity and reduce diseases like fungal attacks (Bayala et al. 2014). Regarding soil properties, recent studies of Sahelian agroforestry parklands have revealed a decrease in soil bulk density and as a consequence, soil under trees displayed higher porosity compared to adjacent open areas (Sanou et al., 2010; quoted by Bayala et al. 2014). Beyond the above mentioned supportive services, trees in the parklands also contribute to the reduction of carbon in the atmosphere by accumulating biomass via photosynthesis. As asserted by Bayala et al. (2014), this process is important for improving soil properties when accumulated biomass is stored in the below-ground compartment as soil carbon. Nevertheless, the improvement in soil fertility parameters by trees has been a controversial issue because trees may have simply grown in spots of higher fertility. Ajayi et al. (2007) and Place (2009) claim that, incentive policies such as subsidies and institutional support for certain soil fertility management options may have a considerable indirect influence in shaping farmers’ decisions on soil fertility replenishment and other sustainable management of common resource strategies. In addition, two decades of research into the management of what economists call common-pool resources suggests that, under the right conditions, local communities can manage shared resources sustainably and successfully. These findings challenge the long-held belief in the “tragedy of commons.” In a recent study, Allen et al. (2012) found that, tragedy is not inevitable when a shared resource is at stake, provided that people communicate. In many places, communities have come together for the sake of the environment and their own long-term well-being. As such, institutions that support ecosystem services can be used as tools to help protect ecosystems and improve rural livelihoods by allowing smallholder farmers to generate income through providing valuable public goods. The systems that support the provision of ecosystem services range from a neighborhood, to a watershed, to a country, to a continent. Managing them effectively requires a set of nested institutions that can encompass some of these multiple scales and interact with each other to create a proper management. To enhance the capacity of farmers in sustaining tree-based production systems, an enabling institutional, technical, and policy environment needs to be promoted. In a recent paper on land tenure and agricultural productivity in Africa, Place (2009) indicates that the adoption of agroforestry is influenced by various factors. Some of them (including climate conditions, household and farm characteristics, and attributes of the particular agroforestry technology) have relatively little to do with policy, while others are directly linked to the existing policy (local formal and informal institutions). Forest policies can inhibit tree growing on farms by regulating harvesting, cutting or sale of tree products and certain tree species. Such protective policies discourage farmers from planting and protecting new trees that emerge. A number of studies provided a description of the functions of some of the major species found in Sahelian parklands indicating that agroforestry tree products (AFTPs) can play three main functions in the household economy of rural communities living in or adjacent to the parkland (Kouyaté 2005; Kalinganire et al. 2007). Firstly, they help to fulfill households’ subsistence and consumption needs in terms of energy and nutrition as well as medical and construction purposes. Secondly, they serve as a safety-net in times of crises (e.g., income shortages due to crop failure) and thirdly, some AFTPs provide regular cash income (Kouyaté 2005; Kalinganire et al. 2007). However, despite the importance of famer managed natural regeneration (FMNR) practices for farmers’ livelihoods the benefits from FMNR have not been studied extensively in the Sahel region. What is mainly missing is an economic quantification and livelihood effects (Haglund et al. 2011; Nyemeck et al. 2015). Furthermore, there has been no systematic study of how such benefits vary across the landscape according to the parklands, or countries. Our paper aims to fill this gap by (1) assessing how the existing local formal and informal institutions affect farmer FMNR practices and, (2) evaluating the benefits of such practices on food production, rural income and caloric intakes and diet. Farmer managed natural regeneration involves regeneration of trees on farms, where farmers are actively involved in manipulating the natural biological regeneration into one that suits them. The types of activities that farmers carry out under FMNR include: thinning of unwanted emergent trees, protection of desired emergent trees from grazing through micro structures or fencing, managing water for young trees, taking action against insects and disease, retention of mature trees so that the rootstock may regenerate more young trees, ploughing practices that preserve emergent trees, and annual care of the regenerated trees. In the drylands, it can be argued that virtually all farmers practice FMNR to some degree (e.g., all farmers will actively thin trees from their fields). It is rather the degree to which it is done which differs considerably. The technical potential for FMNR in the drylands is high throughout almost all dryland areas because no input system is required—just the in situ germplasm (seed and roots) in the soil. Evidence of the active practice of FMNR is most available for the Sahel in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso (Reij et al 2009). But there is also evidence from Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Malawi, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. In two lakes bordering districts in Malawi, it was recently found that although faidherbia seeds are readily available, 70% of all plants established between 2008 and 2010 was through regeneration (some being mediated through livestock) (Glenn 2012). The technical potential for FMNR is related to environmental conditions: in the drier environments, rainfall limitations make it more difficult to regenerate trees in the absence of supplemental watering. The other major limiting factor is the presence of germplasm in the soil. It is well known that the diversity of soil borne tree germplasm varies across sites, although there is no mapping of its variation. Indicators of poor soil borne tree germplasm would be the lack of trees in the landscape and heavily eroded soils. Besides environmental conditions, other factors may limit the technical potential of FMNR. At the household level, adoption analysis was done on the Sahel with a sample of 1000 households involved in the study (Place et al. 2013). Very few factors were found to be significant in explaining the number of new trees regenerating on the farm. The most consistent finding was that FMNR was positively related to the number of mature trees on the plot, which supports the biological explanation of the dependence on existing soil-borne germplasm. It also suggests that farmers with a higher number of mature trees may see the benefits of trees more clearly and thus be keen to establish more. Institutions can broadly be defined as structures and practices of formal and informal rules that regulate social behaviors (Jessop and Nelson 2003, Geraldi 2007). Analyses of socio-ecological factors, such as tree tenure, land and tree property and access rights, as well as benefits sharing from tree resources, provide insight into what Howard and Nabanoga (2007) qualified as the decision-making and power loci of a community. Indeed, as reported by Toulmin et al. (2002), if the institution that creates and enforces tenure regulations is weak, then the regulations no matter how well formulated, may not be enforced or abided by. Hilhorst (2008) argued that these institutions work best when they are adaptive, when rules are clear, enforced and nuanced, when they are legitimized by external organizations, and are faced with slow exogenous change. Yatich et al. (2014) argued further that collaboration between informal and formal institutions is essential for effective resource management. Therefore, an understanding of governance institutions in relation to natural resources is important to better formulate effective pro-ecosystem service policies. Generally, control over access to farmland is in the hands of the lineage that started farming first in the village, personified in the male-head or lineage. The head of the family can grant strangers temporary access to land (secondary right). Pastoralists tend to have a host in the community who will help them to secure their secondary rights to pasture and crop residues as well as rights of passage (Mikulcak, 2011; Leach et al. 2011) (Table 1). Private rights apply on intensively managed lands, but farmers may allow communal access to some tree products. Permanent landholders usually reserve for themselves exclusive tree planting and felling rights, but may encourage tree pruning and gathering of tree products by other community members. Restrictions occur depending on the value of tree species and quantity harvested. Because planting in some extent confers ownership, permanent landholders generally do not authorize tree planting to those with secondary rights. In the semi-arid zone of West Africa, forests, pastures, and fallows are resources that are used by multiple groups (herding cattle, cutting wood, gathering, hunting, and bee keeping) with competing interests. Since colonial times, central government has sought to control access and use of forest lands declared as public lands (Yatich et al. 2014). Some forests were even classified and thus protected. Herd mobility and secured access to strategic resources, such as water and dry season grazing, are critical for pastoralist production systems. Recently, most Sahelian countries have revised their forestry legislation but many basic provisions remain (see Table 2). In principle, the new forest codes go some way towards recognizing customary rights and, in some cases, devolving management of certain forest resources to local populations. In practice, even if farmland technically falls outside forest domain, because rural landholdings are often non-registered, they continue to fall under the state control. Consequently, many restrictions which were originally intended to protect trees are also applied to trees on farms and in fallows, with the result that farmers are prevented from carrying out basic management activities which are crucial in optimizing their land use systems. Many Sahelian countries have undergone an institutional shift within the last decades. Communities in rural areas display a wide diversity of cultures and type of livelihoods pursued. As noted by Hilhorst (2008) there is a juxtaposition of various formal and informal authority structures and laws. The most significant institutions that prevail in the selected countries pertain to customary authorities, village land management commissions, and local conventions (Ouedraogo 2007; Djire and Dicko 2007). Table 3 provides an overview of these institutions and the roles they can play in promoting, managing, and regulating access and use of natural resources. Data used in this study were collected in 2012 from a survey of 1080 households and focus group discussions in four Sahelian countries, namely Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Senegal. Two research questions guided this study: (1) how do the existing local institutions (formal and informal) affect the practice of farmer managed natural regeneration? (2) How does that practice impact on rural livelihoods? Villages were randomly selected in the countries, and within each village, a two-step procedure was used to sample households. Through key informants, all households in a village were listed and identified as having a high or low density of trees on their farms (which proxies for adoption of FMNR). Then a random sample of 10 households in each strata was selected giving sample sizes of 240 for Burkina Faso and Mali; 480 and 120 for the Republic of Niger and Senegal, respectively. Convenience sampling was used to invite respondents into the focus group discussions, basing the selection on the respondents’ knowledge and practice of agroforestry. Local extension agents and enumerators helped to identify appropriate individuals with sufficient knowledge of agroforestry. The household survey collected quantitative data about FMNR practices, including: tree species, number and age; sourcing of tree products (e.g., fruits and fuelwood) from farm and non-farm landscapes; all sales of tree products for the 2011–12 agricultural year; crop and livestock production and sales; income from other activities; and characteristics of households and their land. Household members were also asked qualitative questions to understand their perception of a broad set of benefits, costs, and risks associated with FMNR. One major interest was whether households perceive FMNR to have any additional environmental services, such as improved soil fertility, improved water management; if the regenerated vegetation is perceived as a buffer against shocks; and whether the integration of FMNR helps to reduce overall risks (e.g., variation of production and income). The focus group discussions questionnaire aimed to identify the major benefits from FMNR and how they are distributed across individuals, households, and locations as well as to understand the main constraints in adopting FMNR. In addition, focus group discussions and exchanges with key respondents and experts’ opinion captured the existing institutions governing natural resources in the different villages. These were used to ascertain how they affect the practice of farmer managed natural regeneration. Much of the work of propensity score analysis has focused on cases where the treatment variable is binary. In practice, more than two conditions may be compared. This often happens when we want to estimate the impact of dosage analysis with treatment dosage (Bia and Mattei 2008). Hirano and Imbens (2004) developed an extension to the propensity score method in a setting with a continuous treatment as in the case of this study where the treatment variable (FMNR practice) is a continuous treatment. The analysis of treatment dosage with propensity scores may be generalized in two directions. In the first, one estimates a single scalar propensity score using ordered logistic regression, matches on the scalar propensity score and, proceed in a two-treatment group situation (Joffe and Rosenbaum 1999). In the second direction, one estimates propensity score for each level of treatment dosage (i.e., if there are five treatment conditions defined by differential doses, one estimate five propensity scores for each participant). Propensity scores derived in this fashion are called generalized propensity scores (GPS). This method, originally developed by Imbens (2000), uses the inverse of a particular estimated propensity score as a sampling weight to conduct a multivariate analysis of outcomes. Building on Imbens (2000), Hirano and Imbens (2004) developed a generalization of the binary treatment propensity score and labeled the method a GPS estimator or propensity score with continuous treatments. Thereafter, Bia and Mattei (2008) developed a software program in Stata called gpscore to implement the GPS estimator. The basic idea of the GPS according to Bia and Mattei (2008) is to assume a random sample of size N, indexed by i = 1, 2, … N. For each unit of i in the sample, we observe a p x 1 vector of pretreatment covariates, X

i
; the treatment received, T

i
; and the value of the outcome variable associated with treatment, Y

i
. Using the counterfactual framework (Rubin 1997; Holland 1986), unit i has a set of potential outcomes, defined as, {Y

i
(t)}
t ∈ Γ, i = 1,….., N, where τ is a continuous set of potential treatment values. Under this definition, Hirano and Imbens (2004) refer to {Y

i
(t)}
t ∈ Γ as the unit-level dose-response function, and a dosage analysis is interested in the average dose-response function, μ(t) = E{Y

i
(t)}. According to Hirano and Imbens (2004), {Y

i
(t)}
t ∈ Γ, T

i
, and X

i
, i = 1,…., N, are defined on the common probability space; T

i
 is continuously distributed with respect to the Lebesgue measure on Γ; and Y

i
 = Y

i
(T

i
) is a well-defined random variable. With the preceding, the GPS is defined as the conditional density of the treatment T given the covariates, or the GPS is R = r(T, X), where r(t, x) = f

T|X
(t|x). The GPS has a balancing property similar to the propensity score under the setting of binary treatment. Hirano and Imbens (2004) proved two theorems with respect to the balancing property of GPS: (1) weak un-confoundedness given the GPS and (2) bias removal with GPS. The implementation of the GPS method consists of three steps. Practically, this is the step in which researchers estimate the GPS at a given level of treatment and observed covariates X and then perform the balancing check. Hirano and Imbens (2004) used a flexible parametric approach to estimate the GPS. That is, they assume a normal distribution for the treatment given the covariates: where g(T

i
) is a suitable transformation of the treatment variable. While the parametric model assumes the normal distribution, the actual distribution of treatment dosage T

i
 in the sample may not be normally distributed. To correct for normality, one can do a transformation of T

i
 by taking the logarithm of T

i
 or by applying other transformations. The formula for estimating GPS for each observation based on the estimated regression model is: Next, users need to test the balancing property and whether the GPS balances observed covariates. The balance check observes six steps (Bia and Mattei 2008). In this step, the conditional expectation of the outcome, Y

i
, given T

i
 and R

i
, is modeled as a flexible function of its two arguments. In practice, one can use a quadratic approximation or polynomial approximations of order not higher than three. The quadratic approximation is According to Hirano and Imbens (2004), there is no direct meaning to the estimated coefficients in the selected model, except that testing whether all coefficients involving the GPS are equal to zero can be interpreted as a test of whether the covariates introduce any bias. This last step consists of averaging the estimated regression function over the score function evaluated at the desired level of the treatment. Given the estimated parameters in step 2, researchers can estimate the average potential outcome at treatment level t, which is also known as the dose-response function. This is the final statistic that shows the outcome differences associated with the treatment dosage. The dose-response function is given by: At this stage, one can estimate the dose response functions for user treatment values and use bootstrapping to form standard errors and confidence intervals. The Stata dose response programme (Bia and Mattei 2008) can draw two types of plots to show the final results: one plot shows the dose response function, and the other plot shows the estimated treatment effect function (also known as estimated derivatives). To ascertain the effects of formal and informal institutions on investment in agroforestry through FMNR, the data collected in 2012 from 1080 households in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Senegal, are used. The dependent variable, practice of FMNR, is measured by the density of trees kept and managed by the household on its farmlands. In many observational impact studies involving technology adoption, there is generally a cohort using the technology compared against a control group that did not use the technology. However, FMNR is a complicated technology that does not necessarily fit into two categories. First, virtually all trees in the Sahel are regenerated naturally and it is not always easy to identify the degree to which the regeneration was facilitated by farmers’ practices. Thus, adoption is defined more as the degree of natural regeneration with or without farmer management/assistance. Based on field experience and observations, the household questionnaire was designed to capture four aspects related to two dimensions: (1) knowledge continuum including farmers’ knowledge of FMNR practice and the diversity of the species managed on the farmland as compared to the main species found in the area; and (2) compliance continuum including ownership of at least one farm plot and the number and size of trees kept and managed in the farm. The “degree” of the practice can then be reflected in the tree density (i.e., number per hectare) and age distribution of the trees. Thus, farmers with a high tree density of young trees reflect active FMNR practitioners. Older trees can often be more than 100 years old. Therefore, a good number of the mature trees may have been inherited by the current farmer and do not result from previous FMNR practiced by him or her. Trees may be kept on farm because of an appreciation for the benefits or an inherited way of farming from parents. There may also be unobserved variables at household or plot level that make certain sites more amenable to tree growth. Moreover, divergence between households in inherited and regenerated trees can also result from factors at the community or landscape level. There are several institutional factors that have been identified as limiting the potential for FMNR, such as fire setting, free grazing, and rights and regulations over trees. The use of fire and free grazing systems generate benefits in terms of grass regeneration, clearing of debris, catching wild rodents for food and in the case of free grazing, offering a cheap mechanism for feeding livestock. Thus, it is not easy to find institutional reforms that can accommodate the interests of FMNR with others. However, practices such as controlled fires, rotational grazing (the flip side being rotational exclosure areas), and the promotion of livestock corridors are all options that have been successfully implemented in the drylands. These factors are generally regulated through governing formal and informal structures defined by codes of conduct, norms of behavior and conventions. In this study, we are interested in local conventions (LOCONV) and formal village land management commissions (COFO/CVGT). In addition, a number of covariates are specified to reflect the potential effects of other variables on FMNR. These additional factors that may influence a household’s decision about agroforestry practices are classified into two constructs: household structure and household endowment (access to assets and information). Household structure variables include household size and the number of active members in the household. 
Access to assets provides households with leverage to invest in productive activities and generate more output, which increases their probability of participating in market transactions. Access to assets is an indication of endowment and wealth. In general, well-endowed households tend to experience lower transaction costs and have more flexibility in allocation of resources to market activities (Siziba et al., 2013). Included in this category are production assets including size of arable land, number of livestock owned; transportation assets, captured by ownership of transport equipment such as cart. The total land area may have indirect positive impacts on investment in trees by enabling farmers to generate production surpluses, to overcome credit constraints, where land can be used as collateral for credit (Kabore et al. 1997), and allow them to adopt improved agroforestry technologies that increase productivity of tree products. In other words, the more arable land a household has, the higher the level of output and thus the higher the propensity to practice FMNR. 
Access to information tends to improve decision-making skills and affects the know-how of farmers. The construct proxy representing access to information consists of level of education of the household head, ownership of a cell phone, distance to the main market, and membership of farmer groups. The variable measuring proximity to the main market reflects how far farmers have to travel to reach important sources of information that are located in the nearest town where there are government offices and markets. It is expected that longer distances increase travel time and travel costs, which impact negatively on adoption of agroforestry innovation. Participation in farmer groups increases a household’s awareness of the type of information needed for production and marketing decisions. Many farmer groups also engage in group marketing as well as credit provision to their members. Table 4 gives definitions and summary statistics of the variables used in the analysis.",23

To stay relevant, many producers of farm commodities have been seeking greater involvement in the processing stage of the agri-food value chain by means of joint ownership of cooperatives. However, traditional cooperatives have an inherent equity constraint and thus limited potential for large-scale investments. In response, in the 1990s, farm producers in the Upper Midwest adopted the new generation cooperative (NGC), an organizational form characterized by substantial supply and equity commitments to collectively add value to milk, corn, buckwheat, and other commodities in times of low prices (Harris et al. 1996; Patrie 1998). However, the conversions of several large NGCs in the 2000s revealed the weaknesses and limitations of traditional cooperatives had not been solved (Grashuis and Cook 2018). The struggle of traditional and hybrid cooperatives in the value-added agri-food industry has prompted innovation in cooperative state regulation in the USA to aid the formation and development of farm producer-owned ventures. The first innovation took place in Wyoming, which passed the Wyoming Processing Cooperative Law in 2001 to allow joint ownership by farmers and investors (Hanson 2001).Footnote 1 After Wyoming, similar innovations in cooperative state law appeared in Minnesota (2003),Footnote 2 Iowa (2005),Footnote 3 Tennessee (2005),Footnote 4 Wisconsin (2006),Footnote 5 and Nebraska (2007).Footnote 6 Subsequently, the Uniform Law Commission drafted the Uniform Limited Cooperative Association Act (ULCAA) in 2007 to fill a new niche in the ecosystem of cooperative modes of organization (Dean and Geu 2008). Specifically, the ULCAA facilitated the formation of the limited cooperative association (LCA), a unique hybrid structure with dual ownership by patrons and investors. Utah (2008),Footnote 7 Oklahoma (2009),Footnote 8 the District of Columbia (2010),Footnote 9 Missouri (2011),Footnote 10 Colorado (2012),Footnote 11 Kentucky (2012),Footnote 12 and Vermont (2012)Footnote 13 also passed versions of the ULCAA.Footnote 14 However, examination of the LCA and its current standing in the agri-food industry is nonexistent. It is unknown if the innovations in cooperative state law have facilitated a viable solution to the equity constraint experienced by traditional and hybrid cooperatives. Yet improved knowledge is needed as farmer cooperatives must find equity to make necessary investments in scale and scope economies. Frequently, farmer cooperatives resort to mergers and acquisitions to grow (Merlo 2017), in part in response to various developments in its internal and external environment (Grashuis 2018). The primary purpose of the present article is therefore to examine the current standing of LCAs in the agri-food industry. The research question is as follows: Has the recent innovation in cooperative state law facilitated the formation and development of a viable ownership structure for organized farm producers? The research question is answered in part by business registration data collected in the 13 states in which LCAs or similar producer-owned business entities exist. The nature of the study is exploratory, which implies an emphasis on the formulation of general observations and hypotheses for future research in this open field. This paper contributes to the literature by extending and expanding the ongoing discussion of the future of farmer cooperatives with an exploratory study of the LCA, a novel hybrid structure which facilitates joint ownership by farmers and investors to drive large-scale equity acquisition for business organizations with a cooperative purpose. However, according to business registration data collected from Secretaries of State, the LCA has not yet facilitated the creation of many such organizations in the agri-food industry. As will be discussed in detail in the remainder of this paper, there may exist multiple explanations. For example, there are other legal ownership structures which facilitate better opportunities to improve farmer welfare; the public may oppose the exploitation of the cooperative identity by an entity characterized in part by investor-oriented objectives; potential investors may feel reluctant to invest or retain equity in value-added ventures used by upstream stakeholders; and user-owned and user-controlled organizations may lack crucial resources and capabilities to pursue strategic advantages.",6

This uncertainty has led to calls to maintain agricultural supports, stimulate farm investments, and adopt productivity-enhancing modern technology (Rizov et al. 2013). Consequently, the debate over the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) 2014–2020Footnote 1 began with the report “The CAP towards 2020,” in which the EU attempted to respond to new economic, social, environmental, climate-related, and technological challenges. Because agricultural and, increasingly, environmental interests traditionally dominate the development of the CAP, EU institutions have identified new objectives and policy instruments to improve the socio-economic condition of European farmers (Huang et al. 2010). First, the need to better target support, which would improve the quality of spending and remunerate farmers for the public goods that they provide, led to an innovative DP scheme designed to replace the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) (Westhoek et al. 2013). In addition, Regulation (EU) no. 1307/2013Footnote 2 recognized a strong mandate for each Member State (MS) to manage many aspects related to DPs. In particular, the so-called “national flexibility” offered the opportunity to improve the consistency between national targets and policy decisions to improve the effectiveness of public resource spending (Erjavec et al. 2011; Grant 2010; van Ittersum et al. 2008; Westhoek et al. 2013). In Italy, this task is particularly intricate for the national government because it must carefully manage the effects of the overall reduction of the ceilings for DPs (due to cuts to the Multiannual Financial Framework and the process of external convergence among MSs) and the impact of the internal convergence process. Specifically, policymakers have attempted to reconcile the need to balance the level of payments per hectare among administrative regions, altimetric regions, and agricultural sectors with increased requests for greater FIs in a sector where prices, income volatility, and natural risks are high and profitability levels are, on average, below those in the rest of the economy (Severini and Tantari 2013a). As national decisions directly impact the redistribution of DPs and the profitability of many farms, the main objective of this paper is to analyze the impact of CAP 2013 reform on DPs and income distribution in Italy. From a methodological point of view, the main original and innovative contribution stems from the fact that previous attempts to evaluate the redistributive effect of DPs are mainly based on an ex-post approach (Keeney 2000; Severini and Tantari 2013a, 2013b and 2015); this paper also provides an ex-ante analysis based on a previous attempt to forecast the redistributive effect of the direct payments using the Gini coefficient (G) included in the CAP 2020 Impact Assessment (European Commission 2011). Moreover, the impact of various scenarios of direct payments’ regionalization was estimated ex-ante by scholars (see De Gocht et al. 2013 for all) and European institutions within the prospective studies of “Scenar 2020” (European Commission 2006, 2009). Both reports extensively analyze the distributive implications of various scenarios involving different levels of harmonization of decoupled payments. The paper is organized as follows. The section “Methods” illustrates the theoretical framework related to the redistributive role of direct aids and describes the main elements of the direct payment reform in Italy. The section “Results and discussion” describes the methodology and data used to address the research questions. The section “Conclusions” presents the results and discusses them based on previous empirical evidence from Italy and the EU, then presents the conclusions. Farm subsidies were promoted due to concerns over the chronically low and highly variable incomes of farmers. The key stimulus for legislative action was the disparity between the incomes of farm and nonfarm households (Mishra and Paudel 2011), but ongoing pressures from World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations, criticism of its trade-distorting effects, and consumer concerns regarding the safety and quality of agricultural goods have required the CAP to be continually reformed. In recent years, the most relevant innovation in terms of farm income support tools has been the introduction of decoupled payments by the EU, beginning with the CAP 2003 reform (Moro and Sckokai 2013), which has introduced a new direct payment architecture because the SPS has been replaced by an innovative system of DPs with eight components (three for mandatory and five for optional) (Westhoek et al. 2013). Most direct payment instruments within the agricultural policy have at least the partial objective of income redistribution towards the neediest segments of the farming population (El Benni and Finger 2012). Therefore, to enhance the low average income level, agricultural policy must consider the income differences within the sector. The basis of such an approach is to define the overall redistributive effect of agricultural policy as the difference between the inequality of pre- and post support FIs; consequently, the aid cannot be considered equitable when the absolute level differs between farmers with a similar pre-support income. Maintaining a fair standard of living for the agricultural community and decreasing income disparities depend, indeed, on the distribution of direct aid among farmers. However, agricultural policies, at least those in developed countries, are rarely aligned with such basic ideals of distributional justice. The unequal distribution of economic benefits in the era of price support policies continues to function as an implicit benchmark of a “fair” distribution pattern; nevertheless, allocative policy objectives, which dominated at the beginning of the CAP, have been gradually replaced by distributional policy objectives in CAP reforms (Sinabell et al. 2013). The OECD has identified equity as an operational criterion to evaluate agricultural policies. Indeed, a system of economically viable, midsized, owner-operated family farms contributes more to communities than do systems that are characterized by inequality, large numbers of farm laborers with below-average incomes, and minimal ownership or control of productive assets (Mishra et al. 2009). Howley (2016) asserted that despite their inefficient nature, these payments are indispensable for many farm operators since any elimination of decoupled payments would lead to a significant decline in asset values, which often constitute farmers’ pension funds or their basis for future business expansion. According to Mishra et al. (2009), farm income inequality impacts (1) economic well-being, including the health of farming families; (2) the adoption of farming technology; (3) agricultural productivity; and (4) growth in the agricultural sector. Consequently, if the purpose of farm policy is to raise the incomes of farmers and their standards of living, policy provisions must be reconsidered as changes occur in the farming business, considering that government payments play an important role in decreasing income inequality among farmers in certain regions. However, for many years, the European Commission has expressed concerns regarding the inequitable distribution of farm income support because DPs are highly concentrated (Allanson 2006), which supports the idea that large farms have been the main beneficiaries of CAP support. Consequently, the objective of guaranteeing income stability to reduce poverty and improve the quality of life of rural households is threatened. Eurostat data show that DPs are mainly provided to high-income farms, possibly because increasing the farm income is not the sole consideration that justifies the implementation of direct aid (Sinabell et al. 2013). The role played by agricultural policies in income distribution has been analyzed in various studies. Several studies conducted in Europe have shown that DPs decrease income inequality (Keeney 2000; Severini and Tantari 2013a, 2013b, 2015), but other studies have concluded that government payments increase income concentration (Allanson 2006; Schmid et al. 2006; El Benni and Finger, 2012). Von Witze and Noleppa (2007) highlighted that although small or medium farms should be the targets of DPs, the main beneficiaries of such payments are farms with large cultivated areas. The report on the distribution of direct payments for 2016, which thus includes choices made by MSs within the CAP 2013 reform, highlights that approximately 80% of direct payments are granted to approximately 20% of the largest beneficiaries (in terms of the amount of direct payments). This distribution is mainly driven by the concentration of land and the nature of the support, which is largely area-based. Direct payments are as concentrated as the productive area: 20% of the largest farms in the EU concentrate 80% of the agricultural land and production (European Commission 2017). Moreover, decoupled direct payments linked to land positively influence land rents because only those who own or have rented eligible land can claim public support (Klaiber et al. 2017). Recent evidence confirms that the 2013 CAP reform caused land rental prices to increase relative to pre-reform conditions, and due to this effect, approximately 10.2 billion €/year is expected to be channeled outside the farming sector in the EU in the 2014–2020 period. Such a leakage effect that benefits nonfarming landowners implies further income inequalities among farmers in the EU (Ciaian et al. 2017). Schmid et al. (2006) claimed that, in most cases, DPs do not prevent a relevant share of European farmers from remaining in the poorest decile, and other authors (Allanson and Rocchi 2008; Mishra et al. 2009) confirmed that the distribution of direct aid is largely unequal because high-income farms receive a large share of the payments, as do the wealthiest farm households (Rocchi et al. 2005). Conversely, El Benni and Finger (2012) showed that direct aid can reduce the inequality in the distribution of FIs. Keeney (2000) stated that after the introduction of the McSharry reform, direct aid payments, although they were strongly concentrated, had a redistributive role in Ireland and were able to reduce the unequal effects on market incomes due to the increasing share of DPs in FIs. Thus, without DPs, the concentration of farm income and its unequal distribution across farms might have increased. In that context, the process of liberalizing global agricultural markets has led to an increasing share of farmers who generate negative market incomes, a situation that is unheard of in any other sector (El Benni and Finger 2012). CAP 2013 reform increases flexibility for MSs, which implies the ability to implement the policy according to national needs. Consequently, the government must decide, above all, which optional payments to activate under the new direct payment scheme. The Italian budget for DPs in the 2015–2020 period varies from 3.9 to 3.7 billion €/year. The most important national choices made by the by Italian government are summarized in Table 1. First, Italy extended the so-called “negative list” to include additional business activities that should be excluded from receiving DPs, and the government established certain criteria to identify active farmers (i.e., the beneficiaries of the new direct payment scheme), with flexible requirements for those in mountain areas and selective conditions for those in other areas. Nevertheless, regarding the minimum requirements for receiving DPs, Italy decided not to grant DPs to a farmer when the total amount of payments claimed is less than 250 € (regardless of farm size) in 2015–2016 and less than 300 € after 2017. More interestingly, the Italian government decided to apply the so-called “tunnel” model (TM) for internal convergence instead of the flat rate. This latter model leads to a uniform value of payment entitlements by 2019 (217.64 €/ha). In the tunnel model TM, the mechanism for establishing the values of entitlements depends on two main parameters: the initial unit value (IUV) of payment entitlements and the national unit value (NUV). In 2019, the latter can be simply determined with the following formula: where X is the national ceiling for the basic payment scheme (BPS) for the year 2015, Y is the national ceiling for 2015, P is the national ceiling for the BPS for calendar year 2019, and R is the number of allocated payment entitlements in 2015, excluding those allocated from the national reserve. The value of the payment entitlements that the farmers will receive during 2015–2020 will depend on the IUV, which in turn can be established as follows: where x is the national ceiling for the BPS for the year 2015, y is the amount of the payments for 2014 under the SPS in the MS, A is the payments that the farmer received for 2014, and B is the number of payment entitlements that the farmer is allocated in 2015. In practice, the “value” that is carried forward from 2014 is spread across the “number” of entitlements allocated to the farmer in 2015. This IUV forms the basis of all subsequent convergence calculations for the value of those entitlements for each year of the scheme. All entitlements held under the BPS are subject to convergence effects (Fig. 1). The effects of the tunnel model on the value of entitlements In simple terms, those who hold entitlements with an IUV greater than the national average under the BPS will see the value of their entitlements decrease over the 5 years of the scheme, whereas those with entitlements that have an IUV below 90% of the national average will see the value of their entitlements gradually increase. Those who hold entitlements that have an IUV between 90 and 100% of the national average value will see no change. In addition to the standard level of convergence outlined above, a further test is applied whereby all farmers must achieve a minimum entitlement value of 60% of the national average by 2019. If a farmer does not reach this level under the standard convergence, the value of his entitlements will be increased in equal steps to ensure that it is achieved by 2019. Moreover, the change introduces a “stop-loss mechanism” that reduces losses (no more than 30% of their initial value in 2015) for high entitlement payments. Furthermore, the allocation of national resources across the seven components of direct payments was as follows: the BPS received 58% of resources, greening payment (GR) received 30% of the budget (as established by Reg. 1307/2013), the young farmer payments (YFPs) received 1% of national funds, the voluntary coupled support (VCS) received 11% of funding, and the small farmers scheme (SFS) was activated. It must be noted that even though the GR refers to environmental concerns, the value of this payment in Italy depends on the value of the BPS (due to the application of the tunnel model of internal convergence, i.e., partial convergence of entitlement values). Therefore, since this aid varies based on the value of the entitlements associated with the land, its redistributive effect on farm income must be properly considered. Lastly, the redistributive payment and payment for areas with natural constraints were not activated. Other decisions are reported in Table 1.",17

Cassey,Kwanyoung Lee,Peter R. Tozer,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Labor is an important input into the production and distribution of horticultural commodities and products. In papers such as Richards and Patterson (1998), labor shortages are usually thought of as a pre-harvest problem, and the economic impacts are estimated from models related to harvesting and production. Although labor is necessary for growing and harvesting horticultural commodities, it is also an important input into managing, marketing, processing, packing, transporting, and distributing fresh commodities to market post-harvest. The purpose of this paper is to study the effects of a pre-harvest labor shortage on employment and wages in the post-harvest labor market, the price and quantity sold in output markets, and economic welfare. That the economic consequences of pre-harvest labor shortages on post-harvest labor activities and downstream commodity markets are unknown is an important problem because of the frequency pre-harvest labor shortages are expected to occur in the future (Taylor et al. 2012). We define a labor shortage as the difference between the number of workers willing, able, and available to work and the number of workers desired by producers given the going market wage. Pre-harvest activities are those related to construction, soil preparation, grounds maintenance, farming, production, and harvest. Post-harvest is the time when the bulk of the crop is separated from its parent plant to purchase by a consumer. It is the stage of the process covering the cooling, cleaning, sorting, packing, and transporting of products to consumers. We also include in post-harvest activities those tasks related to management, operations, bookkeeping, marketing, purchasing, and sales. Our partition of tasks into pre-harvest and post-harvest is based on the description and timing of each occupation related to crop support. The partition of tasks is not based on the education or experience of the workers. For example, we classify production workers and the managers of production workers as pre-harvest tasks. To understand the effects of a pre-harvest labor shortage on the post-harvest labor and output commodity markets, we consider an economy that comprises two input markets and two output markets. Both output markets draw employment from each input labor market. The input markets are the pre-harvest and post-harvest labor markets. The output markets we consider are the U.S. pome (apple) and prunus (peach) commodity markets. We choose these industries because of their large total value of fresh production—almost $3.2 billion in 2013—and their geographic spread across the contiguous states—32 for pome and 20 for prunus (USDA-NASS). Therefore, our findings will apply to multiple states as well as being illustrative of the problem to the greater agricultural sector. We also focus on these industries because of their similarities in production and delivery techniques. However, the two industries differ in size, spoilage rates, and in demand characteristics thus allowing us to observe differential impacts from a pre-harvest labor shortage that would be hidden if we considered the fruit sector in aggregate.Footnote 1 We place the two input and two output markets into an equilibrium displacement model. Using estimates from Brady et al. (2016), we shock the model with a 5.4% increase in commodity demand from population growth and also a 7.0% decrease in pre-harvest labor supply. Under a competitive scenario, we estimate wages of pre- and post-harvest labor would need to increase by 6.7% and 3.5% for the markets to clear. Under a scenario where we create a labor shortage by exogenously fixing wages at their pre-shock level, we estimate price increases by about 16% for both pome and prunus compared to the post-shock competitive equilibrium and output decreases by 8.1% for pome and 18.8% for prunus. The deadweight loss associated with the estimated labor shortages are $87.5 million for the pome and prunus output markets combined and $44.1 million for the labor markets combined, measured in 2013 dollars. Yet despite the inefficiency in the economy from the labor shortage, producers’ welfare increases relative to the competitive outcome because the labor-shortage-induced decrease in output is more than made up for by the increased prices obtained by sellers. We then consider how the post-harvest labor shortage will increase commodity-specific spoilage along the transportation network by reducing the amount of production that is able to be sold. This is an important part of the production and delivery process that is missing from most studies. We find the prunus industry is affected by the labor shortage before the pome industry. This differential effect is due to the size of the pome industry in relation to the prunus industry, that prunus spoils 33% more quickly than pome and that the pome industry faces a less price elastic demand. Thus, the pome industry is able to pass higher prices from a labor shortage onto the consumer more readily than the price-sensitive prunus industry. The next section documents that agricultural labor shortages do occur, which means that wages do not fully adjust to shocks competitively. That motivates the design of our model, described in section “A Two Good Equilibrium Displacement Model with Labor,” and our comparative static exercise. We describe the parameters values and data we use in sections “Parameterization and Shocks” and “Data and the Benchmark Economy.” The results, in which we compare the post-shock competitive equilibrium to an outcome where wages are fixed to create a labor shortage, are in section “Results and discussion.”",5

One potential solution to its alleviation is biofortification, i.e., the process of breeding and delivering staple food crops with higher micronutrient content. Biofortified varieties and traditional varieties differ in their micronutrient content while their color, size, texture, and other organoleptic and agronomic attributes are usually similar. Varieties with higher carotenoid content may differ in color, i.e. they are often more yellow. Biofortification could prove to be a cost effective and sustainable strategy, especially in the rural areas of many developing countries where there is high production and consumption of staple crops and where micronutrient deficiency rates are high (Meenakshi et al. 2012; Saltzman et al. 2013). In recent years, several bean, rice and maize varieties with higher micronutrient levels were released in various Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. Moreover, many promising new varieties with even higher levels of micronutrients are in the pipeline for release. Biofortification is increasingly gaining momentum in LAC with some countries such as Brazil and Panama, including them in their public regulations and many others such as Colombia and Honduras considering it as an alternative intervention to strengthen their efforts against micronutrient malnutrition, particularly in rural areas. Despite all these efforts and the improved momentum, there has been relatively little research on evaluating consumer preferences for, and acceptability of, these biofortified varieties by target populations in the region. Guatemala is one of the LAC countries with the highest proportion of population living in rural areas. Most rural Guatemalans are indigenous and have a deep-rooted bean consumption tradition. An average Guatemalan consumes 34 g of beans per day (INE (Instituto Nacional de Estadística) 2006). According to the Micronutrients National Survey carried out by the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance (MSPS) between 2009 and 2010, iron deficiency was an important public health problem, as 24% of the children and 20% of the women in rural areas do not receive sufficient iron in their diets. In general, iron deficiency in rural areas is slightly higher in indigenous communities than in non-indigenous ones (“mestizos”). Given the high bean consumption and high iron deficiency rates especially in rural areas, biofortifying beans with iron could be a promising solution to reduce iron deficiency prevalence in Guatemala. The success of biofortification depends on whether biofortified foods are accepted and consumed by target populations (Meenakshi et al. 2012). Acceptance depends on consumer preferences for various organoleptic characteristics (e.g., taste, color or texture), as well as their relative price perceptions for biofortified foods. This study contributes to the evaluation of consumer preferences for and acceptance of biofortified foods in the Latin American context. In this study, we use similar methods to those used in the African and Asian contexts (see Naico and Lusk 2010; Chowdhury et al. 2011; Meenakshi et al. 2012; Banerji et al. 2013; Oparinde et al. 2016a, b), allowing the comparison of biofortified food acceptance results across regions. Several studies have been conducted in developing countries to investigate consumer acceptance of biofortified foods and the role of information on the nutritional benefits of such foods in driving demand (see for example, Meenakshi et al. 2012 and Banerji et al. 2013 for vitamin A-enriched maize in Zambia and Ghana, respectively; Naico and Lusk 2010 and Chowdhury et al. 2011, for vitamin A-enriched orange sweet potato in Mozambique and Uganda, respectively; Oparinde et al. 2016a for vitamin A-enriched cassava in Nigeria; and Banerji et al. 2015 for iron-enriched pearl millet in India). According to Meenakshi et al. (2012), the impact of information on acceptability that has been studied in the literature is complex to interpret as successful nutrition messaging often requires the repetition of messages. This study aims to examine Guatemalan consumers’ preferences for an iron-enriched bean variety (IB variety) known as “super chiva” (74 ppm of iron) compared to the most popular local bean variety known as “parramos” (50 ppm of iron). The aims of this study are (i) to understand consumer acceptance of the main organoleptic characteristics of an iron-enriched bean variety compared to the traditional one using a sensory evaluation (hedonic scores); (ii) to measure consumer willingness to pay (WTP), i.e., the price premium/discount for the IB variety compared to the local one, and the variation of this premium/discount with consumer-specific socioeconomic characteristics; (iii) to investigate whether nutritional information has an impact on driving demand for biofortified foods in the Latin American (i.e., Guatemalan) context, as has been shown in Africa and Asia; and (iv) to understand the impact of the frequency with which information is given on consumer acceptance. The following section presents the details of the selection criteria for the study site, the sampling design, the elicitation and data collection methods, the information, models, survey, tools and analyses used. The “Results” section describes and summarizes the main results obtained, and the “Conclusions and discussion” section contains a short discussion and the conclusions, including some policy recommendations.",3

Fonta,Safietou Sanfo,Djiby R. Thiam,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"West Africa is generally recognized as one of the regions in the world most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change (CC) but with the least adaptation and mitigation capacities (IPPC 2014). The situation is made worse by the fact that agriculture is the main source of livelihood for more than 60% of the population. However, it is still mainly rain-fed, practiced on relatively fragile soils, with extensive farming, and with very little use of modern inputs and improved farming techniques (Kurukulasuriya and Mendelsohn 2008). By 2030, two thirds of the population in West Africa (i.e., Benin, Togo, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, the Gambia, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Nigeria) are predicted to grow from 320 to 475 million (about 6% of world’s population) [WASCAL 2015]. Although most of the growth is predicted for urban areas, the estimated 48% living and working in rural areas will face the challenge of food insecurity for themselves as well as for the ever increasing urban population. According to the Montpellier Panel (2013), without positive productivity changes, food production systems in West Africa will only be able to meet 13% of the needs in 2050. Under moderate CC and without adaptation, total agricultural production in West Africa will even decline by at least 1.5%. Most of the food demand is satisfied from food imports, which are not cheap. In addition, the food import bills often worsen the current account deficit due to persistent negative trade balance which leads to macroeconomic distortions. It is therefore not surprising that many economists, policy makers, development partners, development finance groups, and research institutions in Africa are now exploring innovative ways that promote climate smart agricultural (CSA) practices. For example, the African Development Bank Group (AfDB), in collaboration with Positive Planet, has taken concrete steps to develop strategies that support institutional and research capacities that promote microfinance innovation in agriculture. In fact, many West African nations have started introducing weather-based agricultural crop insurance schemes in their development visions. These include, for example, Mali and Burkina Faso, which are currently piloting an index-based crop insurance (IBCI), for cotton and maize; Benin for maize; and Senegal for groundnut and maize (Muller 2012). As discussed extensively in the literature on adaptation to risks associated with CC (e.g., Barnett and Mahul 2007; Mahul and Skees 2007; Barnett et al. 2008; Giné et al. 2008; Yang 2009; Giné and Yang 2009; Clarke and Dercon 2009; Mahul and Stutley 2010; IFAD 2011; MCII 2013; Cole et al. 2013; Karlan et al. 2014; CCAFS 2014; Smith and Watts 2014), index-based crop insurance represents a very promising agricultural risk management strategy that farmers may use to mitigate adverse climate hazards and natural catastrophes encountered during farming activities. In many parts of the world, various experiences show that implementation of index-based crop insurance policies have been used to support farmers to limit the losses that natural calamities like droughts, floods, variabilities in rainfall drought, flood, variability in temperature, dry spells, hail, and heat waves might cause to crop yields and household income (Kunreuther 1996; Food and Agricultural Organization 2011; Barnett 2014; Patt et al. 2010). For instance, in Kenya, the mobile technology is being used to support farmers through crop insurance. Insurance claims are triggered by data from local weather stations and are distributed in the form of mobile money. Farmers with land as little as 1 acre can use their assets as collateral for this crop insurance via mobile headsets. The mobile technology has tremendous potential to chart the future expansion of such an innovative crop insurance scheme in the rest of the continent where road accessibility is very limited and weather data precarious, despite the rise of local weather stations in some countries in the continent. Some of the merits of index-based crop insurance are: (i) it minimizes the long-standing contract problems such as moral hazard/hidden action and adverse selection/hidden information as the index read from weather stations is exogenous and cannot be tampered with the intervention of participating farmers (Barnett and Mahul 2007; Barnett et al. 2007; Devereux and Guenther 2009); (ii) in the case of crop damage, it makes faster payouts, which means that farmers will not have to sell assets or depend on emergency food aid to survive during climate shocks (CCAFS 2014); (iii) insured households are more likely to invest on agricultural inputs leading to higher outputs and income per unit of land (Sundar and Ramakrishnan 2013); and (iv) it enhances farmers’ ability to withstand and recover from adversity, therefore strengthening resilience of communities as well as assisting them to get out of the vicious circle of poverty and improve household welfare (World Bank 2005; Berg et al. 2009; De Bock and Gelade 2012; Koloma 2015). However, despite the merits associated with crop insurance schemes, its coverage and uptake in West Africa, as in many other developing countries, remain still low (Muller 2012). For example, in Burkina Faso, it has been observed that less than 10% of farmers have fully enrolled in the ongoing pilot initiatives. Although no consensus has emerged as to why this is so, some of the possible reasons advanced by many crop insurance experts include: (i) difficulties in dealing with climate features, particularly the problem of huge spatiotemporal rainfall variability, which is often used as weather-based index for designing pilots—also called spatial basic risk (Berg et al. 2009; Ibrahim et al. 2014; Fonta et al. 2017); (ii) difficulty to solve the trade-offs between level of protection and cost of insurance premium (Berg et al. 2009; Muller 2012; Koloma 2015); (iii) lack of stakeholders involvement in analyzing insurance products and policies (van Asseldonk et al. 2013; Muller 2012); (iv) poor understanding of the concept of crop insurance, inability to pay premiums, as well as rigid enrolment criteria (van Asseldonk et al. 2013; Planet Guarantee 2014); (v) uncertainty in cash flows as many banks and large microfinance institutions (MFIs) are very reluctant to finance agriculture through small microfinance institutions (MFIs) and cooperatives (Koloma 2015; Planet Guarantee 2015); and finally, (vi) poor understanding of famers’ risk perception in general, their willingness to pay, and the factors that influence their decision to pay such as low level of trust in insurance providers. While these limitations may be specific to West Africa, the general literature on weather index-based insurance highlights other important limitations (see, for example, Smith and Glauber 2012; Mahul and Stutley 2010; Goodwin 2003; Miranda 1991; Jensen and Barrett 2016). First, widespread participation in agricultural insurance requires strong public support through the provision of subsidies. As noted in Smith and Glauber (2012), most crop insurance products would hardly exist in the absence of subsidies. For example, experiences from USA show that subsidies not only allow for participation in agricultural insurance, but they also correct the problem of adverse selection faced by insurance companies (Smith and Glauber 2012). Second, participation in agricultural insurance is driven by the problems of asymmetric information. Both moral hazard (i.e., hidden action by farmers) and adverse selection (i.e., hidden information) affect demand and supply of index-based crop insurance. However, Chambers (1989) and Fafchamps (2010) show that risk sharing might contribute to reducing the problem of moral hazard. For instance, when farmers bear part of the cost that is associated with the loss experienced, they become more cautious about the implications of potential losses that affect their assets. In such circumstances, farmers are usually more willing to take actions that may reduce the probability of occurrence of the insured loss. Third, the problem of basic risk faced by farmers also influences the demand for insurance services. Farmers might experience losses that are not correlated with the insured index. Therefore, despite the real advantages that might be gained in participating in crop insurance, some essential conditions must be met within a country in order for farmers to truly benefit from insurance services. For example, the presence of good and well-functional physical and institutional infrastructures must be present in a country to allow farmers to make their claims and private insurance companies verify their losses. These may include good roads, well-functioning regulatory structures, rules of law, and product delivery mechanisms, among others. Lastly, other minor challenges include wealth and liquidity constraints and religious and cultural beliefs, among others. As reported in Janzen et al. (2013) and Dercon and Christiaensen (2011), poor farmers remain less likely to have the wealth and liquidity that is needed to purchase insurance policies. Jensen and Barrett (2016) highlight the barriers associated with religious and cultural beliefs. For instance, in northern Kenya, insurance schemes that did not comply with Sharia law (Islamic religious law) were not initially well accepted in the region (Jensen and Barrett 2016). Finally, there is also a risk of increased premium payments and also insurers withdrawing support in the face of increasing likelihood of crop failure (Tucker 1997; Mills 2007; Duncan and Myers 2000). These problems, while significant, are not without solutions. For instance, Muller (2012), Fuchs and Wolff (2011), Kapphan (2011), Clarke and Dercon (2009), Barnett et al. (2008), and Barnett and Mahul (2007) emphasized the importance of farmers’ involvement in the initial design and conceptualization of insurance schemes as one way of resolving the challenge of low participation in index insurance by farmers. The main purpose of this paper is therefore to design an improved participatory methodology that could help elicit information on the value placed by farmers in Southwestern Burkina Faso on a new weather index-based crop insurance management initiative. The scheme is a joint initiative of the Planet Finance Group and the Global Index Insurance Facility (GIIF) program of the World Bank. This will help inform the design of appropriate household insurance premiums or levies. A key concept in such an improved participatory methodology is that of the WTP for the pilot initiative. Knowledge of the maximum amount that farmers are WTP for the scheme will help Planet Finance Group, donor agencies, and the Government of Burkina Faso to consider the introduction of subsidies in order to help sustain the pilot initiative in the area and the country. This will be critical for compensating farmers for the loss they experience. The importance of agricultural crop insurance as a risk mitigation strategy to climate change in Burkina Faso was first highlighted in the country’s National Adaptation Plan of Action (NAPA). However, it was the Joint Ministerial Decision N0 2012MAH/MRA/MEDD/MEF/MICA/MASSN/MATD of 2012 that formally set the stage for its operationalization and implementation in the country. However, prior to the decision, the first pilot initiative in the country (i.e., Satellite-based weather index insurance) took off in early 2011 by PlaNet Guarantee which mainly targeted maize and cotton farmers (Planet Guarantee 2014). Similar to many existing crop insurance pilot schemes in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), yield losses are not directly measured in the fields of insured farmers. Rather, they are indirectly assessed through the value of an index (decadal relative evapotranspiration), which is measured through remote sensing approaches (i.e., EARS method) [Muller 2012]. Farmers receive indemnity/compensation whenever relative evapotranspiration falls below 5% of historical long-running decadal relative evapotranspiration data. The threshold for full payment is adjusted depending on areas and crop development period. The payouts are dependent on three specific periods that mimics the different stages of maize production. That is, the first stage that covers 30 days after seeding (1st of July), the second stage that covers 20 days thereafter, and the last stage covering the last 40 days of maize production (in total 90 days). Thus, the payouts that are proportional to the total covered amount for the three subsequent stages are 30%, 20%, and 40%, respectively (van Asseldonk et al. 2013). Insurance premiums are usually tied to credit facilities but, on the average, farmers pay as much as 10.8% of the value of insured inputs plus an insurance tax of 8% (taking it to 18.8%). In 2014, there were over 8281 clients enrolled in the country (PlaNet Guarantee 2015). In order to further expand the experience with new products/crops such as cotton, sorghum, millet, and groundnut and include new technical partners (delivery channels) in various target localities, PlaNet Guarantee felt it was critical to understand farmers’ WTP for the new initiative in Southwestern Burkina Faso, as well as factors that drive the demand for farmers’ uptake. Thus, as part of the effort to support the implementation of the new pilot initiative in Southwestern Burkina Faso, it was decided to carry out a contingent valuation method (CVM) study to capture the willingness to pay (WTP) of farm households in the region. Therefore, this study follows the conceptual framework underlined in McCarter (2003) and Sarris et al. (2006) to study WTP for crop insurance in Morocco and Tanzania, respectively. In doing so, we add new insights to the current literature and describe the extent to which socioeconomic variables, farming practices, and farmers’ behaviors influence WTP for crop insurance in an African context.",26

Livestock is, therefore, an important asset for many Kenyan rural residents. Kenya is experiencing a growing demand for milk and dairy products driven by their strong tradition of including milk in diets, population growth, expanding urbanisation, a rising middle class and export opportunities (Rademaker et al. 2016). The potential of the Kenyan dairy sector to increase production to meet consumer demands of the growing population and enhance livelihood benefits has not gone unnoticed (Vernooij 2016). Although the growing demand for milk products in Kenya is widely recognised, the dairy sector has failed to produce adequate milk to satisfy this demand, mainly due to challenges in dairy farming. These challenges are largely similar across other developing countries and include, among others, the following problems: (1) low productivity driven by limited access to quality and affordable inputs and services, and output markets (Rao et al. 2016b); (2) limited access to input market that heightens the cost of production, further restricting households to low-input-low-output vicious cycle (Rao et al. 2015); (3) remote and scattered location of smallholder dairy households with limited access to reliable infrastructure, which leads to higher transaction costs and presents further challenges in terms of access to input and output markets (Rao et al. 2016a).; (4) inappropriate cattle breeds for dairy production; (5) diseases and low adoption of technologies in the dairy industry (Makoni et al. 2013); and (6) high transaction cost (Kilelu et al. 2016). The dairy hub model is an innovative approach developed to address some of these challenges. Dairy hub is a collective farmer-owned/managed milk bulking and/or chilling business from which farmers may also gain access to other services they need for their daily enterprises (Mutinda et al. 2015). The East Africa Dairy Development project, run by Heifer International and other development partners, has successfully rolled out dairy hubs in Kenya. One of the project objectives is to boost the milk yields and net returns of small-scale farmers in Africa (Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania) (Pyburn and Eerdewijk 2016). Dairy hubs have proven to be potentially strong platforms for improving access to markets, inputs and services for both men and women smallholder dairy farmers alike (Rademaker et al. 2016). Indeed, they are transforming rural regions (Kilelu et al. 2016; Mutinda et al. 2015). Although dairy hubs offer a number of benefits, the rate of participation in these dairy hubs has been slow so far (Omondi et al. 2016). There is limited empirical evidence on the determinants of participation of smallholder dairy farmer in dairy hubs or the effects of this participation on smallholder welfare. A recent study in East Africa by Rao et al. (2016a, b) employed propensity score matching (PSM) for examining the impacts of different marketing strategies adopted by dairy business hubs on dairy and household income. However, a well-known shortcoming of PSM method is its inability to account for unobservable factors, resulting in biased estimates. Muchichu (2014) assessed only the determinants of the adoption of dairy hubs among smallholder farmers in rural Tanzania without considering its impacts, yields or net returns. There is a lack of empirical studies that have evaluated the impact of dairy hubs on smallholder welfare using endogenous switching regression (ESR). The ESR approach accounts for selection bias due to both observed and unobserved heterogeneity. ESR allows the distribution of the endogenous treatment (participation in dairy hubs) and outcomes (net returns and yields) to be specified using a latent factor structure, thereby differentiating between selection on unobservables and selection on observables (Deb and Trivedi 2006). This study aims to bridge the research gap by applying ESR to identify the determinants that influence smallholders’ participation in dairy hubs, as well as investigate the effects of this participation on their welfare.",10

The Government of Thailand has been promoting the importance of organic agriculture since the enforcement of the First National Organic Agricultural Development Strategic Plan (Panyakul and Kongsom 2015). Under this Strategic Plan, policies and programs promoting organic agriculture have been implemented in the country (Kasem and Thapa 2012). Findings of empirical studies in selected areas in Thailand revealed certain significant achievements on the relative change in areas under organic farming over the years (Rattanasuteerakul and Thapa 2010). Despite the Government’s effort, only 34,109.39 ha of land accounting for 0.29% of the total agricultural area in Thailand as of 2013 are devoted to organic farming. Consequently, there are only 9281 organic farms in the country accounting for 0.18% of Thailand’s total agricultural farms. More particularly, the country’s organic vegetable farming covers only 703.33 ha (Panyakul and Kongsom 2015). In developing countries, organic farming is practiced at very low scale while most of the produce are meant for export (Lockie et al. 2006) since their domestic demand is still limited (Gamboni and Moscatelli 2015; Edwardson and Santacoloma 2013; Panmanee and Kongtanajaruanun 2012). Like any business ventures, the sustainable growth of organic farming is significantly influenced by the demand for organic produce. In Thailand, since the domestic demand for organic produce is limited, very small proportion of farmlands is currently being used for organic farming. Understanding the constrained demand for organic produce in the country is therefore crucial for the development and effective implementation of policies that aim to promote organic farming (Sriwaranun et al. 2015; Schleenbecker and Hamm 2013; Sangkumchaliang and Huang 2012). The consumers’ habits of purchasing and utilizing the goods and services explains how they make decisions to fulfill their needs (Parmaeswaran and Ramakrishnan 2013; Blackwell et al. 2006; Kotler 2000). Several factors affect the consumers’ decision to purchase goods, which could be grouped into internal and external (Blackwell et al. 2006). Internal factors are the characteristics of individual consumers, including demographics, resources available at their disposal, motivation, knowledge, and attitude. External factors comprise culture, tradition, religion, as well as formal and informal relationships. However, the factors that influence consumers’ behavior vary from one consumer to the other and from one area to another since the locations, and socio-economic and developmental features also vary from one area to another. Variations that exist among consumers in their capacity to access the resources, income, gender, age, and education, and in accessing information on the products and marketing stimuli such as quality, price, market place, and promotion, also significantly influence their decisions (Parmaeswaran and Ramakrishnan 2013; Blackwell et al. 2006; Kotler 2000). Understanding the roles of psychographic, socio-economic, institutional, and policy factors in influencing the demand for organic foods had been attempted (Van Doorn and Verhoef 2015; Mohamad et al. 2014; Bravo et al. 2013; Nie and Zepeda 2011). Findings from some studies appear consistent but others are contradictory as the studies were carried out in different areas with heterogeneous biophysical, socio-economic, institutional, and political environments. Several studies noted that high income has a positive effect on the consumers’ demand for organic food (e.g. Mohamad et al. 2014; Nie and Zepeda 2011; Roiner-Schobesberger et al. 2008) because consumers with relatively high income could afford to buy organic food, substantially priced higher than conventional food. In some instances (Wandel and Bugge 1997), high income did not influence the consumption of organic food because their inaccessibility affected the ability of some high-income people to purchase such food (Lockie et al. 2006). In some studies, consumption of organic food was also be influenced by consumers’ satisfaction, in terms of the quality (Van Doorn and Verhoef 2015; Ozguven 2012; Hjelmar 2011; Aertsens et al. 2010) confirmed through the labels and/or certifications (Chen 2007), access to organic food stores (Bravo et al. 2013; Chen 2007), availability of variety of organic food (Bravo et al. 2013; Zagata 2012; Aertsens et al. 2010), and above all the price of organic food (Van Doorn and Verhoef 2015; Bravo et al. 2013; Sangkumchaliang and Huang 2012; Aertsens et al. 2010). Although the relatively high-income people have the tendency to buy organic food (Mohamad et al. 2014; Nie and Zepeda 2011) in spite of their higher price compared with the conventional food, this does not mean that these people would by default, buy organic food because these are easily available but because of their premium value in terms of health and environmental benefits. Since health is the most precious asset of any human being, most people would buy organic food as these would keep them healthy (Van Doorn and Verhoef 2015; Lockie et al. 2004). Another factor that contributes to the consumers’ decision to patronize organic food is their perception of and concern about the environmental effects of environment-friendly farming systems (Bravo et al. 2013; Gracia and de Magistris 2008) which could also affect human health either directly or indirectly (Chen 2009). Nonetheless, only a handful of studies aimed at understanding the relationship between consumers’ perception of the effects of organic food on their health have been published, and more so, these are less focused on environmental concerns (Ibitoye et al. 2014; Altarawneh 2013; Kumar and Ali 2011; Briz and Ward 2009). Therefore, policy-oriented research is necessary to find out the specific locations, and socio-economic and institutional factors that influence the consumers’ behavior in purchasing organic food. The question therefore arises on the possible factors that could influence the consumers’ perception of the environmental benefits of organic agriculture, the health benefits of organic vegetables, and consumption of organic vegetables, especially the perceptions of the residents of Bangkok, Thailand. In Thailand, although few studies have been conducted to analyze the consumer’s practice of eating organic food (Sangkumchaliang and Huang 2012) and the consumers’ willingness to buy organic food (Sriwaranun et al. 2015; Panmanee and Kongtanajaruanun 2012), those studies failed to investigate whether or how consumers’ perception of the environmental benefits of organic agriculture and health benefits of organic vegetables could influence their decision to consume organic vegetables. This study therefore makes an attempt to contribute to bridging this knowledge gap by determining the factors that influence the consumers’ perception of the environmental and health benefits, and consumption of organic vegetables. The findings of this study could also serve as useful reference for the development of future policies on the promotion of organic food in general, and organic vegetables in particular, by the decision makers of the Government of Thailand.",7

Hence, the growth and development of the agriculture sector is considered to be the main pathway out of poverty and food insecurity and to have a pro-poor economic development in those areas (Diao et al. 2010; Kassie et al. 2013; Collier and Dercon 2014; Dawson et al. 2016). The agriculture sector is the mainstay of the Ethiopian economy as it accounts for nearly 45% of GDP and employs about 85% of labor forces (Dercon et al. 2012). Despite its strategic role for the country’s economy, the sector is dominated by subsistence and semi-subsistence farming system (Alemu et al. 2006; Anley et al. 2007; Francesconi and Heerink 2011; Teshome et al. 2016). Smallholders own on average less than 1 ha land per holder account for about 95% of land covered by crops on which they produce about 90% of agricultural outputs in the country (CSA, 2014). Moreover, the ever-increasing population of the country is reducing the farm sizes rapidly (Bezu and Holden 2014; Headey et al. 2014). This population growth coupled with a legal restriction on agricultural land market hindered farm expansion that made farms smaller and hiring labor superfluous, which created a significant level of unemployment in the rural part of the country (Bezu and Holden 2014). Hence, there has to be a mechanism to support the livelihood of the agricultural communities and absorb the excess labor in the rural economy. As emphasized by Lanjouw and Lanjouw (2001), the main options available for the unemployed rural community in this scenario are either migration to urban areas or engagement in off-farm activities in rural areas. Actually, smallholder farmers in developing countries rarely rely on a full-time agricultural work; rather, they often maintain a portfolio of activities in which off-farm activities are an important contributions to their well-being (Barrett et al. 2001; Foster and Rosenzweig 2004; Smith et al. 2005; Wouterse and Taylor 2008; Lanjouw and Murgai 2009; Zezza et al. 2009; Davis et al. 2010; Haggblade et al. 2010). Empirical findings consistently show that incomes generated from off-farm activities ease the burden on agriculture as it enables households to have better incomes. Hence, they enhance food security as they manage food consumption fluctuations better than a household without such an activity (de Janvry and Sadoulet 2001; Ruben 2001; Barrett et al. 2001; Babatunde and Qaim 2010; Haggblade et al. 2010; Owusu et al. 2011; Bezu et al. 2012; Hoang et al. 2014; Mishra et al. 2015). Especially when the agricultural production fails due to climate change, pest, deceases, or other shocks, off-farm employment provides a risk management tool to reduce the income variability and will fill the gap that will be created between farm income and household consumption El-Osta et al (2008). By engaging in off-farm employment, farmers also become self-insured (Alasia et al. 2009) and they may invest in a risky but high-returning agricultural business. Off-farm income can also enhance agricultural production by relaxing liquidity and credit constraints to purchase productivity enhancing agricultural technologies such as improved seed, fertilizer, machineries, and hiring labor (Ruben 2001; Lamb 2003; Matshe and Young 2004; Kilic et al. 2009; Oseni and Winter 2009; Anriquez and Daidone 2010). This is particularly true in developing countries where farmers are facing credit constraints (Stampini and Davis 2009). Though there are ample empirical evidences on the impact of off-farm income on adoption of productivity-enhancing agricultural inputs, its impact on farm efficiency is mixed. For example, Mochebelele and Winter-Nelson (2000), Tijani (2006), Haji (2007), Pfeiffer et al. (2009), Bojnec and Ferto (2013), and Babatunde (2013) found a positive significant impact of off-farm income on farm efficiency. There are also cases (such as Goodwin and Mishra (2004), Chang and Wen (2011), and Kilic et al. (2009)) in which participation in off-farm activities has an adverse effect on the agriculture. They argued that if the income from the off-farm activities is more attractive than the agriculture, farmers might give less attention for the agriculture and they might devote more family labor and time for off-farm activities. There are also studies (such as Chavas et al. 2005, Bozoğlu and Ceyhan 2007; Lien et al. 2010, Feng et al. 2010; Chang and Wen 2011) that found no significant association between the two variables. Table 1 summarizes some of the empirical works that examined the role of off-farm activities on technical efficiency. As it can be observed from Table 1, the findings are not consistent. This disagreement between empirical results could be due to the fact that the role of off-farm activities on farm productivity is different from context to context. The other important thing learnt from the above empirical works is that selectivity bias is not addressed in most of the cases; therefore, the reported impact and associated technical efficiency (TE) scores are likely to be biased (Bravo-Ureta et al. 2012; González-Flores et al. 2014). Other studies like Abebe (2014) relied on a single frontier equation for both those who participated in off-farm activities and non-participants without giving due attention for potential differences between the two groups. Hence, unlike previous works, this paper aims to estimate the impact of participation in off-farm activities on TE of smallholder maize producers of eastern Ethiopia by combining propensity score matching with the Greene (2010) model to control for both observed and unobserved heterogeneities. Therefore, the results of this study adds to the existing literature (e.g., Abate et al. 2016; Barrett et al. 2001; Beyene 2008; Feng et al. 2010) through identifying the factors affecting the participation in off-farm activities. As the study evaluates the impact of participation in off-farm activities on the TE of maize producers, the study indicates the relationship between off-farm and on-farm activities and indicates whether there exists trade-off or complementarity between the two income-generating activities.",29

Honfoga,Gervais N’tandou-Bonzitou,Joseph D. Hounhouigan,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"A diversity of foods is available to enhance people’s food security in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), through not only agricultural production and trade but also harvest of wild plants and animals in the nature (FAO/PAR 2010, Assogbadjo et al. 2011). However, this diversity is underutilized today (Dansi et al. 2008) due to the transformations of food systems that are taking place worldwide (Gómez et al., 2013). These transformations evolved from the first to the second food régime, leading to the increasing abandonment of traditional foods and their replacement with introduced/manufactured foods as a result of increased dependence on modern food businesses for food procurement (Atkins and Bowler, 2001). Such a change is being linked with the increasing occurrence in Africa of some food-related non-transmittable diseases (Abegunde et al. 2007). In many African countries, modernizing food habits go with the belief that “foreign is better” (Nzenza 2014). Although that belief is not the sole reason, policies that have silently pushed for such change in food habits over decades have finally created that belief. This is particularly true in Benin where the cotton-biased agricultural policy and investment can be blamed, as it has made food procurement largely dependent on imports, mostly for rice, vegetal oil, and meat and dairy products. For example, the import dependency rateFootnote 1 for rice increased from 34.8% in 1999–2005 to 46.5% in 2005–2013 (FAO/ECOWAS 2015). The annual growth rate of vegetal oil imports (about 18%) is highest among all agricultural products in West Africa, followed by meat, drinks, fruits, and legumes (Hollinger and Staatz 2015). The growing rice imports in Benin could be explained also by the low competitiveness of local rice (Adegbola and Singbo 2005). Indeed, the preference attributes of imported rice—especially cleanness, whiteness, and flavor mostly accruing from industrial processing—are not favorable to local rice (Arinloye 2006). Some macroeconomic variables are overarching explanatory factors. For example, the agricultural sector contribution to GDP decreased from 34% in 1995 to 29.9% in 2008 (MAEP 2010), while high labor prices, climate change, and non-availability of specific fertilizers have made most annual traditional crops become expensive and non-accessible to the poor. As a result, most of these crops have become “underutilized and neglected crops” due to their very low productivity and poor marketing systems (Adegbola et al. 2016, Dansi et al. 2003). Therefore, with increased availability of introduced foods in markets, poor people substitute a diversity of traditional foods with a limited number of introduced foods (Bellon 2010). The opposite trend is also being observed as an expression of the third food régime, where consumer resistance and reaction to processed, manufactured, and fast food is growing (Dawson and Burt 1998, Atkins and Bowler 2001). The third food régime goes with a renewed recognition of the value of traditional foods and the need to restore them in the diets of people not only in the Western countries but also in the developing countries (Bowler 1992). Unlike before the 1980s when fruits and vegetables were present mostly in supermarkets and a few open selling points of Cotonou City (Benin), these foods can be observed today everywhere in urban areas. Yet, they remain expensive and non-accessible to the common citizens. They include a mix of imported fresh foodstuffs and a few imported seed-based locally produced foods. Traditional foods have not yet found enough their way in urban markets. Benin can be considered in the early stage of a country’s food system transformation due to its low income, large share of rural population, high reliance by farmers on their own production, and high incidence of undernourishment (Gómez et al. 2013). Hence, there is a re-evaluation of the value of traditional/local foods. There is increasing research on the value of these foods (especially, e.g., African leafy vegetables in Kenya and Benin), and the need to maintain or reintroduce them in food systems (see, e.g., Achigan Dako et al., 2006, Dansi et al. 2008, Dansi et al. 2003, Dossou-Aminon 2014). For example, “Glassoman” (Crassocephalum spp.), a wild indigenous leafy legume, is rich in proteins and was widely consumed in forest zones of Benin. “Egusi” (Citrullus lanatus, Cucumeropsis manii, Lagenaria spp.), an ancient garden crop, and palm oil (obtained from processing fruits of oil palm—Elaeis guineensis) are rich in vitamins (especially vitamin A) and lipids. Egusi is rich in fat and vitamins A, B1, B2, C, and alpha-tocopherol, a component of vitamin E. It is composed of nearly 50% healthy fats and 30% protein.Footnote 2 Other traditional foods have medicinal values.Footnote 3 Among them in Benin, “Tchayo” (Ocimum gratissimum) is widely recognized to prevent ulcer. In the context of above-mentioned transformations, markets are playing increasing important role, yet their integration with domestic food production areas seems still limited, as well as their positive impact on peoples’ diets. One aspect that has not been addressed by previous food marketing and food policy research in Benin is how the markets function for traditional foods versus introduced foods.Footnote 4 There is a growing feeling that traditional foods are disappearing from diets of urban and rural people due to their decreasing availability resulting from growing urbanization, climate change, and poorly functioning markets (Friedmann and McMichael 1989, Atkins and Bowler 2001, Honfoga et al. 2005). An important way of appraising this market functioning is to assess market integration. This paper examines the differential market integration for traditional foods vs. introduced foods and how this affects food consumption patterns. It draws from findings of the research project entitled “the effects of market integration on the nutritional contributions of traditional foods to the well-being of the rural poor in Africa,” which was implemented from 2010 to 2012 by Bioversity International in collaboration with partner research organizations in Benin (West Africa) and Kenya (East Africa). The first objective of the project was “to assess the relative nutritional benefits and related health outcomes of a diversity of locally produced traditional foods vs. introduced foods among the rural poor with varying degrees of market integration” (Bellon 2010). The market study component analyzes the effects of market integration on the consumption of traditional foods, in order to advise on appropriate policies that would foster greater availability of those foods and adequate changes in food consumption patterns. Regarding food diversity, findings by Bellon et al. (2016) using the project’s database in Benin conclude that “on-farm and market diversities had a significant positive effect on mothers’ dietary diversity, and that there is a positive relationship between on-farm diversity and dietary diversity among mothers. Production for self-consumption and food purchases complement rather than replace each other in their contribution to dietary diversity and thus dietary quality.” These findings imply that dietary diversity/quality is indifferent from a particular food source, be it self-production or market. Enough light was not shed on the issue of disappearance of traditional foods from the diets of people, nor has market integration been clearly referred to. This paper aims to enlighten on the status of market integration, and to know the extent to which it influences direct food substitution dynamics in the diets of rural people in Southern Benin. Rather than the source of procurement only (home/self-production vs. market), the issue at stake here is more about food type (traditional vs. introduced)Footnote 5 and how market integration affects its presence in the diets overtime. Relying on empirical data from the abovementioned market study, this paper aims to understand if market integration really plays a role in food habits in Southern Benin. The following hypotheses are tested: Introduced foods show higher levels of market integration than traditional foods Low levels of market integration among traditional foods contribute to their disappearance in the diets (food consumption frequency and diet composition). The first hypothesis accrues from the observation that introduced foods are traded widely by merchants who move across all types of markets to make such “new foods” available to consumers (Lutz, 1994). Ascending trade flows of introduced foods from Cotonou to rural markets are faster and more regular than the downward flows of traditional foods which are mostly crude and seasonal. The second hypothesis has its theoretical ground in the relation between food availability, food market dynamics, and food consumption patterns (Smith and Haddad 2001; Honfoga and van den Boom 2003). Its practical justification pertains to several reasons. One is the second food régime earlier mentioned (Friedmann and McMichael 1989). Another reason is the growing imported dependency of Benin, most imported foods being the “introduced foods.” However, besides market integration of introduced foods, the limited availability of traditional foods in the markets also explains the disappearance of these foods in the diets in Benin. It is linked to climate change, low availability of farm labor for women who mostly grow traditional foods, and changes in production systems towards monocropping of high-value export crops (cotton, pineapple, cashew nuts, soya beans). Traditional foods are said to be secular indigenous foods that are as old as the culture of people who eat them. The notion of ethnic foods (Cook et al. 1999) goes with them. They are core to ancient, endogenous food habits which were described in terms of the kind of customary and ritualized behavior that underpins the reproduction of a stable society together (Lupton 1996). Indeed, traditional foods played a major role in traditions of different cultures and regions for thousands of years including foods that have been consumed locally and regionally for an extended period (Centre of Research Excellence in Nutrition and Metabolism 2016). Traditional food refers to foods and dishes that are consumed over the long-term duration of civilization and have been passed through generations (Saunders 2010); traditional foods and dishes are traditional in nature, and may have a historic precedent in a national dish, regional cuisine or local cuisine (Kristbergsson and Oliveira 2016). Certain values and norms in eating patterns are symbolic of broader structures in society as a whole and may not be well perceived by outsiders (Goody 1982). On the contrary, introduced foods are quite new and are brought from outside the community or culture. Their introduction into food habits is quite recent, dating back to only a few decades, whereas traditional foods are being consumed by native peoples, since the very beginning of their settling in the area many centuries ago. While traditional foods are mostly locally produced, introduced ones are mostly imported (Popkin 2003). Quite often, introduced foods are manufactured and more industrially processed than traditional foods. However, the frontier between the concepts of traditional and introduced foods is not neat. For example, some non-indigenous foods such as parboiled rice and wheat flour have been introduced into endogenous food habits long ago (since colonization times in Africa) and may be considered as traditional foods although they were mostly imported and consumed by middle- or high-income people. Likewise, “vegetal oil” is considered an introduced food, but it is a “mix” of several types of industrially processed vegetal oils and locally produced groundnut oil, which makes it also closer to a traditional food. Today, they are present in all households. The growing view that traditional foods are disappearing (Nzenza 2014) and are being replaced by introduced foods in the diets witnesses the perceived effects of the second food régime in the USA and Europe, where large industrial capitals began to dominate both sides of the agro-food chain and farm products became inputs to manufactured foods rather than products for final end use (Friedmann and McMichael 1989, p.103; Green and Griffith 2002;  Honfoga et al. 2002). In SSA, environmental disasters (e.g., droughts, floods), forest destruction for agriculture, decreasing soil fertility, and crop failure due to diseases are important threats to traditional foods (Dossou-Aminon et al. 2014). At the heart of economic reasons is the second food regime, which is also present in SSA because of changing cropping and food systems where farmers are abandoning traditional foods for a few selected food and cash crops demanded by multinational food and fiber industries. Indeed, the diversion of farm labor to the production and processing of crops most demanded by Western countries’ markets is also a reason of the disappearance of traditional foods. The increasing dependence of newly independent post-colonial states on imported food grains, such as wheat, from developed countries to feed their burgeoning populations was—and is still being—paid for by the greater production of industrial crops (e.g., cotton) and high-value tropical and temperate food crops, with damaging consequences for traditional, subsistence-oriented agricultural systems (Atkins and Bowler 2001, p.27). In general, weak food distribution system and decreasing income or growing poverty are the main drivers of perverse food substitution, unbalanced diets, and malnutrition in those countries (Atkins and Bowler, 2001, p.118; UNDP-Benin 2011, p.66 & 73). Market integration means the strength of trading networks that link different market outlets, i.e., market-sheds (Bellon 2010). The term market-shed is used to give the sense of a system or network of market flows within a given area (e.g., it is not just a zone with some markets located in it, but rather, it is a trading network with links between market outlets) (Anderson et al. 2010). The related market integration based on travel time is sensed from the observation that good infrastructure favors transportation and speed of trade flows from production centers to assembly and consumer markets, thereby enabling integration within a market-shed (Fafchamps and Gabre-Madhin 2006). Baulch (1997, p. 477) gives the importance of assessing market integration by linking spatial integration of markets, transmission of price signals from urban food deficit to rural food surplus areas, price volatility, specialization of agricultural producers according to long-term comparative advantage, and gains from trade. Therefore, market integration depends on and expresses the nature of physical and economic linkages (particularly market information) that exist between various production-consumption zones for a selected tradable product. The dynamics are reflected by price movements. Therefore, two markets are said to be integrated for a given commodity if prices move together, i.e., price movements tend to behave similarly, reflecting the cost of transferring the product between two regions (Rashid and Minot 2010, Hossain and Verbeke 2010). World Food Programme (2001) made this definition more explicit as it affirmed that when markets are integrated, two conditions exist: (a) price are correlated, i.e., they move in tandem with one another, but at different levels that are determined by transaction costs (necessary yet insufficient condition of market integration); (b) commodities flow between markets, i.e., markets are integrated through trade, which triggers price transmission from one market to another (necessary and sufficient condition of market integration). However, the statistical interpretation of price correlation coefficients is problematic in a context where numerically low price correlations prevail despite other evidence that suggests competitive and rational behavior by a large number of market actors (Delgado 1986). Market integration is influenced by the type of markets (urban, semi-urban and rural). It is product-specific, and price dynamics is a core to assessing it more accurately (Chamberlin and Jayne 2013). Indeed, transaction costs are dynamic and vary by time, space, and product. Delgado (1986) affirmed that “the yardstick of integration of a pair of village markets within a given season is that the price spread between them stays approximately constant, subject to random variation either way, over the weeks in the season in question.” Lutz (1994) observed that spatial and temporal arbitrage are simultaneously taken into account by price co-integration models, the level of statistical significance of which is used to conclude whether the markets are integrated or not. The use of co-integration models is recommended to assess market integration for the sake of accuracy, considering the need to separate seasonal, trend, and stochastic variations in price time series or to jointly consider them. The critical question is “how do prices on two spatially separated markets adjust in the long and in the short run?” To answer this question, Ravallion (1986) developed an autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) model with the aim of assessing both the long-run and short-run adjustment process. A “dynamic” structure was developed to take account of the sluggishness of price adaptations. A distinction is made between short-run integration, defined as restrictive target of instantaneous adjustment corresponding to the market efficiency hypothesis (Malkiel 1987), and long-run integration, defined as a less restrictive target of price integration in the long run (Lutz 1994).",5

Chiwaula,Gowokani Chijere Chirwa,Joseph Nagoli,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"The division of labour in artisanal fisheries in Africa is highly gendered, with men dominating the fishing operations and marketing of perceived high premium fish species (Coastal Resources Center 2016), whereas women dominate the processing and marketing of small fish species (Chiwaula et al. 2012; Nagoli and Chiwona-Karltun 2017). Women are not allowed to fish in open waters or be seen working with men in fishing (Chiwaula et al. 2012). Although women are the major fish processors, their access to fish processing technologies seems to be limited due to unequal division of labour, limited incomes and time to manage fishery resources and other social injustices (Ngwira 2001; Chiweza 2005; GoM 2008). Women therefore end up drying fish on open-air racks (sun drying). The problem with this method is that it is associated with large physical and quality postharvest losses such as high microbial contamination and low sensory properties (Sablani et al. 2003; Banda et al. 2016) which are estimated at 27.3% in Africa (Affognon et al. 2015). These losses have negative implications on fish supply and incomes of actors in the fish value chain particularly women who are involved in fish processing. The high postharvest losses also contribute to the global challenge of food loss and food waste as we think of feeding over 9.1 billion people with safe food by the year 2050 (Béné 2009; Parfitt et al. 2010; Affognon et al. 2015). It is reported that tackling postharvest waste and losses could add 15 million tonnes of fish to the food chain (FAO 2016). In an effort to reduce fish postharvest losses, a fish solar tent dryer (FSTD) has been designed and is being promoted along Lake Malawi. A FSTD is a greenhouse-like structure that is made of wooden frame and is wrapped in ultraviolet (UV)-treated transparent polythene 200-μm plastic sheet. Using FSTDs reduce postharvest losses, improve on sensory properties of the dried fish and reduce microbial contamination of the dried fish (Banda et al. 2016). An economic analysis of the dryer also shows that the solar tent dryer is profitable with an estimated net present value of MK6,014,489, has a payback period of 1.77 years and the internal rate of return of 55% which is greater than the cost of capital (Kawiya 2017). The dryer is economically viable because the price of solar dried fish is almost double the price of open sun-dried fish because of the improvements in quality and associated access to better markets. The solar tent dryer was first designed by Doe et al. (1977) in Bangladesh and was recently modified and used by Olokor and Omojowo (2009) in Nigeria. Unlike the original solar dryers that were small and were not designed for commercial purposes, the dryer on Lake Malawi is large and has a capacity of up to 850 kg of fresh fish per drying cycle (see Fig. 1). The size of the dryer implies that most of the small-scale fish processors that are being targeted in the project cannot privately own a solar dryer. Picture of the outside (upper) and inside (lower) view of a fish solar tent dryer Promotion of the fish solar tent dryers on Lake Malawi uses business approaches that encourage fish processors to demand the dryers unlike the convention of giving such capital technologies freely to the communities which undermine the sustainability of the interventions. Promotion of adoption of the dryers would therefore require adequate knowledge about economic incentives for fish processors to construct, own and use the fish solar tent dyers. Information about these economic incentives requires that we analyse the demand for the technology. Understanding the factors associated with the demand is important for the design of promotion strategies, and this involves the estimation of demand models that are normally based on observed demanded quantities and observed prices. In the absence of observed prices and quantities demanded, stated preference methods such as the contingent valuation methods (CVM) or choice experiments are used to assess demand (Diamond and Hausman 1994; Blumenschein et al. 2008). These methods are used to elicit preferences from potential users and buyers of goods and services. In this paper, we analyse Lake Malawi fish processors’ WTP and identify the gender disparities that are associated with the WTP for a common good, i.e. investing in a group owned fish solar tent dryer. We assessed the willingness to pay for group ownership of the FSTD because we assumed that the initial investments are too high for individual fish processors to bear. However, we note that common ownership of FSTD would bring with it low security of ownership which has been documented to have a negative influence on a long-term investment (Ayamga et al. 2016). We therefore expect this insecurity to influence their willingness to pay as well. This information has helped to better understand women’s and men’s decision-making as regards to accessing and benefiting from improved postharvest fish processing technologies. The knowledge on how gender and other forms of social differentiation affect and are affected by development processes can lead to unintended program consequences and/or the perpetuation of universalising myths about men’s and women’s roles in development, such as women’s concentration in small fisheries processing versus commercial fishing and their greater altruism. It also can lead to the treatment of women and men as monolithic groups. All of these are risks that value chain development should aim to avoid.",12

Kembo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Idiosyncratic and systemic shocks such as climate change (FAO 2010; Tirado et al. 2010), food price hikes (Christian 2010; FAO 2008; Quisumbing, et al. 2008), or global economic crises (Ivanic and Will 2008; Ivanic et al. 2012) impose gender-heterogenic consequences on food and nutrition security of households (Klasen et al. 2015). Vis-à-vis male-headed households, female-headed households have different demographic and socio-economic conditions, resource utilization patterns, and social network patterns (Croson and Gneezy 2009; Fletschner and Carter 2008; Fletschner et al. 2010; Gneezy and Rustichini 2004; Kairiza et al. 2017; Powell and Ansic 1997; Reevy and Maslach 2001) which renders them more susceptible to food and nutrition insecurity than their male counterparts (Horrell and Krishnan 2007; King-Dejardin and Owens 2009; Klasen et al. 2015; Peterman et al. 2010; Quisumbing 1996; Quisumbing and McClafferty 2006; Quisumbing and Pandolfelli 2009). Concomitant to the aforementioned gender heterogeneity in vulnerability to food and nutrition insecurity, are gender differences in the strategies employed by households to subsist when confronted with food and nutrition insecurity which are termed consumption-based and livelihoods-based coping strategies (Dercon and Krishnan 1999; Fafchamps et al. 1998; Gupta et al. 2015). This study expands on the body of literature focusing on gender and food and nutrition insecurity on the basis of a pool of five nationally representative cross-section surveys, comprising both rural and urban households in Zimbabwe. The annual household surveys employed in this study span from 2013 to 2017 and were conducted by the Zimbabwe Vulnerability Assessment Committee (ZimVAC). Specifically, on the basis of the gender of the household head, this study appraises the existence of the gender gap in food and nutrition insecurity in Zimbabwe. Secondly, it assesses the existence of gender differentials in the usage of consumption-based and livelihoods-based coping strategies in Zimbabwe. Finally, it evaluates gender heterogeneity in the correlation of the household usage of coping strategies when confronted with food and nutrition insecurity. The study measures food and nutrition insecurity on the basis of five proxies which are the household hunger score, poor food consumption score, and household consumption of vitamins, proteins, and iron. The study offers three major findings. Firstly, female-headed households in Zimbabwe are more prone to food and nutrition insecurity after controlling for major confounding variables. Secondly, in light of the high vulnerability to food and nutrition insecurity, vis-à-vis male-headed households, female-headed households are more likely to use consumption-based coping strategies, but not livelihoods-based coping strategies. Finally, in terms of gender heterogeneity in the correlation of household usage of coping strategies when confronted with food and nutrition insecurity, female-headed households are less likely to employ livelihoods-based coping strategies but not in respect of consumption-based coping strategies than their male counterparts. The next section of this paper reviews the relevant literature and outlines hypotheses to be examined in this study. The ‘Methods’ section details the methods employed in the study, whilst the ‘Discussion’ section provides a discussion of the results. Finally, the ‘Conclusion and policy recommendations’ section concludes.",7

In Colombia, the sector contributes with nearly 40% of the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and is associated with soil erosion, deforestation, water depletion, and biodiversity losses (Bradford 2015; Interamerican Development Bank [IDB], 2016; Matthews 2006; McAlpine et al. 2009). On the other hand, cattle production is the main economic activity of an important share of the population, with nearly 7% of the total employment (Lafaurie 2012). In addition, livestock production is in many cases one of the few options available to incorporate further marginal lands into productive crop-livestock systems. Against this background, several strategies have been proposed to mitigate the sector’s negative impacts, with some of the most promising initiatives emerging from diet and feed improvement (Gerber et al. 2013). In this sense, major efforts have been conducted globally to promote the sustainable intensification of cattle production systems through (i) the development of superior forages, (ii) the improvement of farming and natural resource management practices, and (iii) the promotion of suitable policies (Ibrahim et al. 2010; Rao et al. 2015). In Colombia, these technologies have been widely promoted; nevertheless, adoption levels among farmers remain marginal (Rudel et al. 2015) due to lack of knowledge and training, uncertainties on land ownership, low land prices, higher labor requirements and lack of capital, among other factors (Calle et al. 2009; Calle et al. 2013). Sector stakeholders, such as the Colombian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef and Dairy, have proposed the development of differentiated beef products coming from more sustainable production systems (mainly silvopastoral systems [SPS]) as a strategy to up-scale adoption, assuming that higher end product prices will encourage farmers to implement these technological packages (Ruiz et al. 2011), but so far, there have been no rigorous assessments of local consumer response for these products or estimations of potential price premiums. On the other hand, while there are clear efforts aimed at dealing with the environmental impacts of the sector, animal welfare aspects have taken a secondary place. Currently, regulations and beef production operations include animal welfare elements only to the extent that serves the short-term profit motive (Muñoz-M 2014), without explicitly addressing consumer preferences or the increasing demand for more ethical production systems (Broom 2010). Different studies have employed stated or revealed preference methods to measure consumer preferences for environmental or ethical improvements in food products and have shown that certain consumer segments are willing to pay more for these attributes. In the case of animal welfare, Clark et al. (2017) conducted a meta-analysis of 54 studies measuring willingness to pay (WTP) for animal welfare aspects, with 24 focusing on beef production, finding that there is an overall small positive WTP (0.63 standard deviations). Other studies focused on organic, free range, or environmentally friendlier meat production find positive price premiums ranging from 8 to 39%, with large variations related to socio-economic characteristics (Li et al. 2016; Curtis et al. 2012; Van Loo et al. 2014). Nevertheless, none of these studies has been conducted in a developing country, particularly in the Latin American context, where the characteristics of both production systems and consumer segments differ substantially from those of developed countries, in spite that they represent more than 27% of global beef production and a comparable share of consumption (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAOSTAT], 2019; United States Department of Agriculture/Foreign Agricultural Service, 2019). Additionally, preference for these attributes has not been measured simultaneously. It is therefore neither clear if consumers experience a greater preference for one of these attributes, nor the extent and form of their perceived interrelationship. This research attempts to broaden the current body of knowledge by assessing and comparing consumer’s preference for both the environmental and animal welfare aspects of more sustainable food systems through two approaches: (i) determining the characteristics of beef consumers who would be willing to pay a higher price for more sustainably produced beef and (ii) estimating the marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for animal welfare standard compliance and the environmental aspects related to the sustainable intensification of the cattle production systems. For this purpose, this research employs a contingent valuation exercise (CV) to understand and determine the characteristics of potential consumers, and a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to estimate the different MWTP for the attributes of interest within the identified consumer segment. In addition, the effect of information on the consumer’s MWTP was included in the study. Cattle production in Colombia takes place mostly in extensive systems, where animals feed from native and naturalized grasses (Mahecha et al. 2016). Land use is highly inefficient, yet nearly 80% of the total agricultural land in the country is destined to cattle production (DANE 2014) which translates into high levels of GHG emissions emerging in the form of (i) methane (CH4), (ii) released CO2 through land use changes (Wassenaar et al. 2007), and (iii) and nitrous oxide (N2O) derived from manure and fertilizers (Carmona et al. 2005). In response, stakeholders have been promoting the implementation of silvopastoral systems and improved forages, which can diversify farm income and increase land productivity (Sharrow et al. 2009). In SPS, trees may serve as sources of wood, feed banks, living fences, windbreaks, or provide shadow for the animals (Montagnini et al. 2013), while the improved forages supply larger amounts of biomass per hectare, provide higher nutritional quality, more persistence to biotic and abiotic stresses, and minimize the use of external inputs (Milera 2013; Peters et al. 2001; Rao et al. 2015). Some studies have shown that SPS with improved forages are more profitable than conventional systems that rely on extensive grazing or high fertilization, which translate in lower biomass yield or higher production costs (González, 2013; Turinawe et al. 2012; White et al. 2013). Nevertheless higher implementation costs and relatively long payback periods may be deterring the transition to what appears to be a sound economic decision. Well-managed SPS mitigate GHG emissions by (1) sequestering atmospheric CO2, (2) by reducing ruminant CH4 emissions per unit livestock product as compared to lower quality forage diets, and (3) by reducing N2O emissions (Peters et al. 2013). While aerial biomass from the trees capture substantial amounts of carbon, well-managed improved pastures have shown a larger carbon sequestration potential in the soils (Fisher et al. 2007; Guo & Gifford 2002; Powers et al. 2011), making them one of the most promising strategies for climate change mitigation in agriculture (Peters et al. 2013; Smith et al. 2008). CH4 emissions are reduced through gains in feeding efficiency, improved forages are more productive, have higher protein and energy concentration, and show greater resistance to abiotic stresses, allowing for higher loading capacity, higher daily weight gains, and increased food availability during extreme seasons. As found by Gurian-Sherman (2011), improved forages could reduce CH4 emissions by 15 to 30% through these effects. Finally, N2O emission from the cattle sector is generated mostly from nitrification and denitrification (Bremner and Blackmer 1978) due to the fertilizer use and improper manure management. As shown by Sylvester-Bradley et al. (1988) and Subbarao et al. (2009), some tropical forages (Brachiaria spp.) can reduce soil nitrification in a process called biological nitrification inhibition (BNI). It has been estimated that SPS could be accounted as carbon neutral or even carbon positive through carbon sequestration and gains in feeding efficiency, depending on the variety and density of species introduced (Montagnini et al. 2013; Naranjo et al. 2012). Additionally, SPS contribute to the recovery of degraded lands (Peters et al. 2001), since the plants’ root systems promote soil stabilization in sloping areas (Gutteridge and Shelton 1993), improve water holding capacity, soil fertility, and biological activity (Murgueitio et al. 2014). Most of the focus on SPS relate to their environmental or economic effects; nevertheless, these systems can also contribute to improving the animals’ life quality by providing shades and reducing heat stress, promoting more stable hierarchies and positive behaviors among heifers, reducing anxiety, and providing more varied, higher quality diets (Améndola et al. 2016; Broom et al. 2013; Panadero 2010). As mentioned earlier, the sector’s stakeholders have focused on the effects of animal welfare on productivity, but to the authors’ knowledge, no research or sector strategy in the country has yet delved in the ethical aspects of the food industry and its repercussion in consumer choices, even though these aspects have been widely assessed in developed countries and reveal a growing concern for animal welfare (Gwin 2009; Harper and Makatouni 2002; Tonsor et al. 2009).",10

AFN were so named following the refusal of some food chain players to accept and adopt the defining elements of traditional supply chains, such as excessive productivity, standardization, and industrial organization (Higgings et al. 2008; Watts et al., 2005), placing instead a greater emphasis on other aspects, such as quality, origin, and the “naturality” of agro-food production (Renting et al. 2003). Practices related to the sale of agro-food products through AFN have become widespread in recent years (Duncan and Pascucci, 2017). This evolution has affected both supply and demand: on the one hand, a large part of consumers is increasingly interested in “geographicised” food production; on the other hand, the producers are finding in these forms of direct marketing the possibilities linked to the economic sphere as for the socio-relational sphere (Dansero and Puttilli, 2014). In fact, the reduction of the number of intermediaries between the production phase and the purchase phase by the final consumer allows to retain a greater share of the added value of the product, increasing the profit margins and thus allowing to remunerate adequately the factors of the production (Kneafsey et al., 2013). Moreover, the direct relationship with the final consumer allows the producer to interpret the evolutions and needs of the food demand and, at the same time, to communicate in a more effective way the strengths and the qualitative aspects of the farm, creating very often the fertile ground for a mutual increase in trust and for a loyalty between seller and buyer (Marino et al., 2018). The innovations related to AFN do not concern only the marketing phase of the product. Indeed, AFN present interesting new elements, since they are configured as parallel to conventional food supply chains and represent alternative methods of production, distribution, retail, and final purchase (Galli and Brunori, 2013). “Alternativity” takes into account sustainability in its triple economic, environmental, and social meaning. In this context, AFN respect the three dimensions that define their “alternativity” (Whatmore et al. 2003): (1) to function as food markets that distribute the value through the network against the logic of mass production, (2) to contribute to the reconstruction of “trust” between food producers and consumers, and (3) to design new forms of social association and market governance. The absence—or the reduced number—of intermediaries between producer and consumer characterizes the AFN compared to the conventional one (Barbera and Dagnes, 2016). Often, this organizational-logistical proximity is accompanied by a spatial-geographical proximity, but it is not possible to state that it is the totality of the cases. In this regard, there are various definitions of AFN: for example, in France, according to the classification adopted by the Ministry of Agriculture (Barry, 2012), the AFN refer to the marketing of agricultural products through direct or indirect mediate sales, at most, from an intermediary. This definition meets the statement by Peters (2012) according to which the AFN are not only focused on the geographical distance between production and sales of the product, but also by the number of connections in the food chain. In Italy, there is currently no national definition of an AFN, although some regions have regulations for their classification and promotion, according to environmental or territorial criteria, depending on the case. In any case, the AFN find space mainly in urban areas: as a result, it is possible to state how, although it is not possible to coincide a priori AFN with the “zero kilometer,” there is certainly a strong territorial connotation (Cavallo et al., 2015). In the short chains, the issue of access to food is therefore linked in an innovative way to the sustainability of local food systems (Mastronardi et al. 2015). In relation to this, the role of the agricultural enterprise, with its strategies and related innovation processes, remains central in the training processes of the AFN (Ilbery, Maye, 2005; Giarè, Giuca, 2012). In fact, farms operating within urban and peri-urban areas often adopt diversification processes and differentiation strategies (Marino et al., 2018; Torquati et al., 2009) in which the shortening of the supply chain is one of the most frequent and of greater success (Henke, Vanni, 2017) that often accompanies other types of innovation (Diamantini, 2016). Most of the studies on the sustainability of AFN have focused on specific aspects of sustainability—economic, environmental, or social, depending on the case (Penker, 2006, Wiese et al., 2012, 2015, Mastronardi et al., 2015). Other studies have been conducted on the sustainability of AFN compared to traditional supply chains (Brunori et al., 2016; Fabbrizzi et al., 2014; Holloway et al., 2007) and on the contribution to the sustainability of specific productions by producers belonging to French AFN (Enjolras and Aubert, 2018). However, even with a view to a scientific response compared to what Born and Purcell (2006) define as “local trap”—the assumption that eating local food is more sustainable—the contribution of the various forms of AFN to sustainability has not yet been clarified (Tregear, 2011; Venn et al., 2006). The construction of a framework for the assessment of sustainability of AFN aims exactly at providing a solid base for understanding the real contribute of alternative channels of sales to the main environmental, social, and economic challenges. We consider it necessary to shed a light on the debate on the local trap and the tendency of food activists and researchers to assume something inherent about the local scale. The local is assumed to be desirable; it is preferred a priori to larger scales (Born and Purcell, 2006). In this scenario, the aim of the work is to evaluate the sustainability of Alternative Food Networks in Italy through the construction of a composite indicator based on the indicators mostly used in studies on the sustainability of food systems (FAO, 2014, Barilla, 2014, GRI, 2011; Cicatiello and Franco, 2012; UN DPSCD, 1996; Zezza, 2013). In relation to this, the paper aims to identify the contribution of these marketing channels in representing and disseminating the principles of sustainability, to outline a scenario in which to define regulatory actions that can regulate and promote these complex realities. Through a Global Sustainability Index that represents a specifically built synthetic index, it has been possible to assess different AFN experiences. Finally, the paper aims to compare the different sustainability performances of the producers participating in the various Alternative Food Networks schemes, in order to identify the elements that characterize them and to provide evidences for a better implementation of urban food policies.",18

Smallholders’ farming activities are majorly constrained by family labour and land size (Jayne et al. 2010). For most smallholders, the main source of production labour is family labour, which is highly dependent on household size (Kamau et al. 2009). In Uganda, smallholder farming activities are also constrained by the fact that farmers produce many crops on the small pieces of land (UBOS 2010). Many authors have also noted that the smallholder farmers are less productive compared to world standards resulting in lower yields (FAO 2014; Larson et al. 2014) as compared to other farms elsewhere. Although average crop yields in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in general and Uganda in particular have been steadily increasing, they remain the lowest in the world. For instance, with cereal productivity of just under 1500 kg/ha, SSA has the least cereal crops productivity per hectare than any other region in the world. In some cases, there has been declining productivity per unit area. For instance, the productivity of pulses for Uganda posted a negative growth rate of 1.5% for the period 2000–2010 (FAO 2013). There is even more variation in crop productivity among the many smallholder farmers for the different crops within a single country. In the Agriculture Sector Development Strategy and Investment Plan of Uganda (MAAIF (2010), it is noted that yields of most crops in Uganda remain substantially below the levels attained in research stations. For instance, in a study on rice production in Northern Uganda and South Sudan, Musebe et al. (2013) reported that NERICAFootnote 1 4 rice farmers in Northern Uganda were achieving yield levels of 1042 kg/ha against the potential yield of 4000 kg/ha. This is only about 25% of the yield potential of NERICA 4. In some cases, yield differences of up to 80% are reported (van Ittersum et al. 2013). Crop yields are expected to differ between on-farm and research stations due to differences in the structural settings of farmers’ farms and research stations; however, such enormous differences cannot be explained by differences between farm field and research station settings alone (Tittonell and Giller 2013). According to FAO (2014) and MAAIF (2010), these large disparities are evident of high levels of inefficiency in terms of farm resource utilization and allocation at farm level. Norton et al. (2010) noted that wide variations in yields are associated to natural, socioeconomic, and political causes and rapid population growths that create challenges of reallocation of productive resources among the different small farms. While these inefficiencies exist, the role of smallholder agriculture in poverty reduction and food security cannot be underlooked (Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA) 2014). According to Valdés and Foster (2010) and Wiggins et al. (2010), agricultural growth which entails increasing agricultural productivity plays an important role in fighting rural poverty and food insecurity. This is especially true where poverty levels are high and/or there exists a food security problem such as in Northern Uganda where the poverty level is greater than the national average. Poverty rates for Northern Uganda were estimated at over 45% in the 2012/2013 financial year, the highest in the country and more than twice the national average of about 20% (Hitchen 2016). The need to increase agricultural productivity has also been highlighted in several policy documents (e.g. AGRA 2014; FAO 2014; Larson et al. 2014; MAAIF 2010). In line with the increasing scarcity of land as a major productive resource in agriculture, increasing agricultural productivity faces a new challenge of ensuring that the increasingly limited resource becomes more and more productive. This is evident by the declining farm sizes especially in SSA (FAO 2014; Lowder et al. 2015). The World Bank’s World Development Report of 2008 highlighted that with the increasing scarcity of land as a result of increasing population, the future of agriculture is ‘intrinsically’ tied to efficient use of the production resources at our disposal (World Bank 2007). It is therefore imperative that strategies to increase agricultural productivity in SSA countries including Uganda be directed towards increasing efficiency of smallholder farming operations and the efficiency of resource allocation to various enterprises (AGRA 2014; MAAIF 2010). To improve efficiency of smallholder farmers, the existing levels of resource allocation must be known. Although evidence suggests general inefficiency of most smallholder farms (AGRA 2014; MAAIF 2010), little is known about the exact level of inefficiency of resource allocation of smallholder farms including those in Northern Uganda (Dalipagic and Elepu 2014). This is against the backdrop that efficiency of resource use varies significantly across farms and localities (Norton et al. 2010; Wood et al. 2016). Understanding resource use efficiency and its predisposing factors is particularly of high policy relevance for rice, a crop that has recently gained prominence in terms of poverty alleviation and food security households in Northern Uganda. For instance, Northern Uganda is the second largest producer of rice in the country. The region also has the highest mean plot size for rice at 0.45 ha per farming household (UBOS 2010). Efficiency of resource use and its predisposing factors is important for guiding decision-making and better farm planning. In Vietnam, for instance, Tung (2013) observed farmers need to change their farm plans and ‘expand their production’ due to the increased efficiency of rice production. This study used the parametric stochastic frontier approach (SFA) to estimate the level of efficiency of resource allocation. The study also analysed the sources and causes of inefficiency for rice production in the region. The aim was to fill the gap in literature and contribute to the discussion on efficiency. The main research question was as follows: what factors are responsible for the difference in observed and frontier production levels of rice and how do these factors influence allocative efficiency? Most studies on efficiency focus on technical efficiency (see, for example, Tung 2013; Madau et al. 2017; Ahmed and Melesse 2018; Karimov 2014) and profit efficiency (Hyuha et al. 2007). Technical efficiency looks at the ability of farmers to maximize output while profit efficiency combines both technical and allocative efficiency but does not show specific factors responsible for the observed technical or allocative efficiency. It instead combines the two into profit efficiency. However, in light of the need to promote smallholder commercialisation, there is an increasing use of purchased inputs (Sheahan and Barrett 2017). This brings into perspective the other dimensions of efficiency—economic efficiency—which is the ability of farmers to use the least possible cost in production. This study focused on the allocative efficiency which looks at the ability of farmers to produce the maximum possible output (technical efficiency) at the least possible cost (economic efficiency) (Farrell 1957).",17

African maize farmers are adapting to this weather variability in multiple ways (Fisher et al., 2015), including the use of drought-tolerant maize varieties (DTMVs). These varieties have been bred using modern conventional methods, without genetic modification, following efforts by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) in partnership with the National Agricultural Research Institutions in different African countries. In addition to drought tolerance, the varieties often have other attractive traits, such as resistance to major biotic stresses, responsiveness to inputs and good nitrogen use efficiency (Fisher et al. 2015). The DTMVs underwent extensive multi-location on-farm testing using participatory variety selection approaches with farmers across Eastern and Southern Africa, with DTMVs out-yielding popular commercial checks (Fisher et al. 2015; Setimela et al. 2017). In addition, there is evidence that DTMVs adoption positively impacts productivity, risk exposure, and welfare of smallholder farming households in Africa (Wossen et al. 2017; Awotide et al. 2016; Kostandini et al. 2013). By early 2016, over 200 DTMVs had been released in 13 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The seed dissemination and delivery has been the responsibility of the national agricultural research and extension systems and public and private seed companies. Yet the DTMV adoption rates remain somewhat modest, and the drivers of adoption are not fully understood. Earlier literature on technology adoption in Sub-Saharan Africa had a farmer orientation. Adoption was affected by risk and uncertainty, farmer learning processes, the rationing of complementary inputs such as fertilizer or water and farm characteristics, such as farm size (Minot et al. 2007). Some explanations invoked the more complex decision-making environment of semi-commercialized farmers. The household framework emerged as an analytical paradigm for predicting adoption, highlighting the importance of incomplete markets and transaction costs (Benjamin, 1992; Vakis et al. 2004). This framework emphasizes that when markets are imperfect, household consumption decisions cannot be separated from farm production decisions. Hence, household characteristics, as well as farm physical characteristics and relative prices, determine whether households will choose to grow a variety or not (Minot et al. 2007). Adoption scholars have also acknowledged the role of intra-household decision-making processes and the role of gender in variety choice (Doss and Morris 2000; Doss 2013; Colfer et al. 2015; Anderson et al. 2017). Finally, a thread that runs throughout the literature is the importance of farmer perceptions (Adesina and Forson 1995), variety traits, and farm household preferences for both agronomic and consumption-related traits (Wale and Yalew 2007; Asrat et al. 2010). A more recent strand of literature (Diagne 2006, 2010; Diagne and Demont 2007; Simtowe et al. 2016; Kabunga et al. 2012) has emphasized the role of heterogeneous information exposure on technology adoption. Such studies show how estimating adoption rates for a new technology not well known to the population can yield inconsistent and biased estimates. However, as pointed out by Diagne (2010), the potential adoption rate based on awareness alone, and by extension, knowledge (Kabunga et al. 2012), still underestimates the true potential adoption rate of a new technology, because being aware and having knowledge of the technology is not enough for adoption. Indeed, as expressed by Donstop et al. (2013), one may be aware but have no access to the innovation, as may be the case with seed access of new DTMVs. Seed access of a new variety thereby potentially becomes an important factor for its adoption. Donstop et al. (2013) and Dibba et al. (2015) thereby extend the estimation of potential adoption rates by considering both the lack of awareness and technology access as constraints to adoption. In this paper, we further extend the estimation and provide a micro-perspective of DTMV adoption rates and their determinants in Uganda under heterogeneous seed price affordability, seed availability/access, and information exposure. We apply the average treatment effect (ATE) framework proposed by Diagne and Demont (2007) but go a step further to also consider the availability and price affordability of seed. Our extension from these studies is premised on the fact that beyond the awareness of the new variety and physical availability/accessibility of seed, the affordability of that seed is a critical factor affecting the adoption of improved varieties. We thus consider households’ exposure to DTMVs, access to seed, and access to seed at an affordable price to be heterogeneous. Indeed, households for whom the seed is not affordable are unlikely to adopt the variety of their choice even if they know it and the seed may be physically available in their locality. An analysis of the adoption rates under seed access constraints is critical for understanding the current bottlenecks in maize value chains and for expediting DTMV scaling through more concerted private and public sector efforts. The study is expected to contribute to understanding the potential demand for DTMV seed and the seed sector support needed to scale DTMVs in Uganda. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses analytical methods while data sources and descriptive statistics are presented in Section 3. The results and discussions of adoption rates and determinants are presented in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes.",28

Emergence of highly concentrated industries may deter new entrants and may lead to inefficient allocation of resources in the market (Poulton et al. 2006; Porto et al. 2011; Sexton and Xia 2018). Highly concentrated markets might not be particularly good for food commodities especially when commodities are heavily consumed by the poor. Concentration can drive out small firms, scare potential investors and exacerbate avoidable crises (Sexton and Xia 2018). Few studies have been conducted to document and assess the complex relationship between food industry structure, traders’ productivity, performance, resilience and the role of institutions of developing economies. For example, Sitko et al. (2018) found no evidence of market concentration when large firms entered into smallholder grain markets but rather found that the retail prices of grain declined due to improved market efficiency. Gabre-Madhin (2001), using a new institutional economics perspective, assessed market institutions, transaction costs, and social capital in the Ethiopian grain market and found that social capital enhances trader productivity. Further, Fafchamps and Minten (2001), using survey data from traders in Madagascar, found high large social capital effects on firm productivity. We define social capital as the structure of informal social relationships conducive to developing cooperation among economic actors aimed at increasing the social product. The social product is then expected to accrue to the group of people embedded in those relationships (Hayami 2009). Social capital among traders may help reduce transaction costs if traders interact more over longer periods of time (Fafchamps and Minten 2001). However, such interactions may also affect efficiency outcomes as markets may become dominated by small groups of traders that are well acquainted. Using structural, relational and cognitive indicators for social capital, most literature from developed countries suggest a positive association between social capital and business performance (see Islam et al. 2018; Liu and Li 2018; García-Villaverde et al. 2018; Miao et al. 2017). To illustrate, Islam et al. (2018) found that cognitive ability, education, experience and the number of connections a manager possessed had a positive influence on a cooperative’s performance. Further, Miao et al. (2017) assessed the effect of social capital and business performance and found that the link between social capital and performance is mediated by human capital—education and skills of employees and entrepreneurial orientation which is the strategic, philosophical and behaviours in decision-making—of the trader. In a similar manner, Asiaei and Jusoh (2015) indicated that relational and social capital improve business performance. Further, other literature asserts that productivity, specifically profits, may be reduced if traders trade and interact with close relatives. For example, Levine et al. (2014) reported that ethnic proximity of traders may promote price bubbles and thereby bring about undesirable market outcomes such as market inefficiency. In addition, Atmadja et al. (2016) found that firms that are run by ethnically cohesive individuals perform poorly on indicators such as profitability and survivability—i.e. resilience measured as time in years a business stays profitable before closure. However, de Oliveira and Nisbett (2018) argue that there may not be much differences in outcomes from ethnically diverse groups than homogenous groups. In addition, Portes (2014) argued that social capital might drive marginalism such that individuals without significant social capital may be ostracized, face significant barriers to growth and eventually be left out of economic systems. This becomes particularly difficult when the individuals are poor traders in developing countries. To a greater extent, the link between business performance and behavioural aspects of traders such as social capital and informal arrangements such as trust relationships provide mixed evidence (Van Rijn et al. 2012). Interestingly, in Africa, where most staple food microenterprises, and therefore the transactions therein, are informal do not feature much in the debate on social capital versus business performance. As such, it is important to explore the role and implications of social capital on such economic outcomes. The main objective of this study is to assess the effect of industry structure and social capital on maize traders’ behaviour, business resilience and profitability in Malawi. We use a randomly sampled, market level representative data set involving small- to medium-scale maize traders where we ask about trade volumes, value of stock, proportion of costs, prices, pricing behaviour and whether the enterprise exports or not to ascertain the structure, conduct and performance of the firm. We also ask questions about the nature of the traders’ relationship with fellow traders, brokers, lenders and family relations to get information regarding the structure of social networks which might have a bearing on the nature of transaction costs. Further, the study also uses key informant interviews, focused observations and group discussions with industry representatives, grain traders’ associations and farmer associations. We hypothesize that traders who interact more with other traders, brokers and lenders will have more resilient and profitable businesses. To test our hypothesis, we econometrically analysed the data using Bayes Model Averaging (BMA) regression techniques. BMA analysis reduces model uncertainty by taking advantage of the posterior probability distributions of all competing model parameters conditional on the observed data and some prior knowledge (see Hoeting et al. 1999; Genell et al. 2010; Laffineur et al. 2017). In this study, we are able to use the sample data together with prior knowledge gathered from key informants and available literature to draw inferences about the organization of maize markets and the behaviour of maize traders. The study contributes to the literature on understanding drivers of business resilience, food policy design and industrial organization by bringing recent evidence from a developing country’s staple food industry and also complementing and triangulating results from methodologically different viewpoints namely qualitative and Bayesian regression analysis. This would make our interpretation of results particularly rich and highly informative. We find two consistent results that social capital enhances business resilience and that not all forms of social capital make maize trading profitable but when traders are very close, even to family ties, profits increase. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. We explain how we conducted the study in “Materials and methods”. In ""Results"" we present our key findings starting with descriptive and later inferential statistics. We expound our findings and their implications in ""Discussion"". We provide a summary in ""Conclusion"".",1

The importation of rice continues to surge ahead of production due to increases in domestic consumption. For example, annual per capita consumption of rice in Ghana grew from 17.5 kg in 2001 to 24 kg in 2011 (Ragasa et al. 2014). This has seen a further increase to about 32 kg for 2015 (MoFA 2016). Also, the demand for rice is projected to grow at an annual rate of 11.8%, exceeding that of maize (2.6%) in the medium term (Millennium Development Authority (MiDA) 2010). As only 5% of global production is traded, local production would also protect consumers from price shocks in the world rice market (World Bank 2013). While substantial investments in national rice production have been made, local production is still not able to keep up with the growing demand for rice. Ghana imported 508,587 MT of rice in 2013 alone, translating into USD$639 million to compensate for domestic shortfall (Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) 2013). This has increased further by 22% to 620,811 MT in 2016 (MoFA2016). Increasing rice yields through sustainable and efficient production systems is necessary and has therefore become a priority for stakeholders in the rice value chain. Adoption of irrigation technology is one way of improving farmers’ efficiency in the production of rice, especially in northern Ghana where the impact of climate change has become more evident. For instance, Azumah et al. (2017) found that rice farmers in northern Ghana who adopted irrigation were not only efficient but had higher yields compared with their non-adopting counterparts. This present study investigates the output effect of irrigation farming in northern Ghana. By way of methodology, it combines a stochastic production frontier framework correcting for sample selection bias developed by Greene (2010). To the best of the researchers’ knowledge and also based on available literature, this study is the first of its kind for efficiency studies in the rice sector of Ghana. Many of the studies conducted in the study area have employed the traditional stochastic frontier approach which did not control for sample selection bias. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: methodology, results and discussion, and conclusions and recommendations.",11

(2007) suggest two main sources of risk substantially affecting farmers’ decisions: business and financial risks. Business risks are combinations of various sources, generated by the unpredictable nature of the weather causing the uncertain performance of farmers’ incomes. Price risks refer to the price volatility of farm inputs and outputs (Rosa et al. 2014). In a survey conducted in the Netherlands, the price risks were perceived as the most important, while financial risks were ranked least relevant (Meuwissen et al. 2001). The lesson is that farmers should be better informed about the risk sources and react by combining their farm enterprises more efficiently. This topic has been explored by many researchers in farm management problems. Farmers usually elaborate their production plan in a context of limited information that biases the outcomes of their decisions, even in a shorter time horizon (Bernstein, 1996; Chen et al. 1999; OECD 2000; Shapiro et al., 1993; Stewart 1991).Footnote 1 These decisions affect crop supply and incomes in the short term, while the rigidity of the assets invested in longer periods and higher fixed costs increase the difficulty in adjusting the farmers’ decisions about risky crop prospects (Anderson et al. 1977, Anderson and Hardaker 2003, Anderson et al. 2004; Hardaker et al. 2007; Markowitz 1952). Price volatility is an external source of risk, whose importance is growing due to changes in the farming environment and strengthening of the integration between agricultural and commodity markets (Rosa et al. 2014). One example is the high price volatility of the oil markets due to financial speculation, transmitted to the agricultural input markets through prices of fertilizer, feedstock, pesticides, machinery, etc. Table 1 summarizes some sources of risk affecting farmers’ decisions. The farm situation in Italy is represented by 1.5 million units with average UAS of 10 ha; smaller farmers are the majority of the rural population, and in most cases, they are unable to deal with the complexity of the agricultural sector (Salvioni et al. 2009; Dries et al. 2012). Limits in entrepreneurial skills could be a factor that influences the risk avoider attitude.Footnote 2 Due to fear of losing all their assets in the case of adverse events, risk aversion could address preferences towards “risk minimization and safety-first” instead of a profit maximizing strategy (Kaine et al. 1994; Oguntade and Bamire 1994; Anderson et al. 1977; Knight 1971; Matlon 1991; Chavas and Holt, 1990; Martin and Shadbolt 2000; Anderson and Hardaker 2003, Anderson et al. 2004; Manfredo and Leuthold 1999; Sulewski and Kłoczko-Gajewska 2014).Footnote 3 In a survey to test farmers’ preferences for risk in the Netherlands, Meuwissen et al. (2001) found that risk aversion was correlated to changes in crop yield and suggested that “higher expected level of farmers’ incomes in certain conditions do not balance the risk of losing their assetsFootnote 4.” Tobin (1965) says that under risky conditions (variance), averse decision makers formulate their optimal portfolio with crop diversification (risky prospects), while for risk preferring decision makers, the optimal portfolio will be reduced to few or a single risky prospect. Crop diversification in farm planning is then usually adopted to hedge against risk; as the average of the sum of variance and covariance of different price-yield combinations compensate for each other if the risk factors are similar and are generally inferior to the variance of a single crop (Mishra et al. 2004; Backus et al. 1977).Footnote 5 The optimal combination of risky prospects about crops generates the efficient E-V frontier (Fig. 1), representing the locus of efficient solution with maximum E value for a given variance (or s.d = V 0.5) or minimum variance for a given E value. The literature reports different methods to assess farmers’ risk attitudes with computable models of the E-V frontier (Hardaker et al. 1988; Anderson and Hardaker 2003; Backus et al. 1997). The approach proposed in this research is based on (i) the variance of total gross income (GI) in the crop combination portfolio, using quadratic risk programming in the linear version to approximate the quadratic E-V frontier and (ii) introduction in the subjective expected utility (SEU) of individual beliefs and preferences about risk (Pannell and Nordblom 1988; Backus et al. 1997; Bazerman 2006). The subjective probabilities about changes in frequency of risky prospects are justified by the different farmers’ knowledge about external events (climate, market, finance, policy, etc.) that affect the SEU of farmers’ beliefs about future events (Hardaker et al. 1991, 2007; Pannell and Nordblom 1988). With these premises, the objective is to simulate optimal crop combinations portfolio of risky prospects about crops with an “ad hoc” utility function to parameterize the risk for specific traits of it.Footnote 6 The solutions are used to draw the E-V frontier and the tangency between utility and E-V frontier will give the optimal solution for portfolio crop combination. The risk is assessed with the mean and variance moments of some diffuse crops in Italy. Four cereal crops: maize, barley, wheat, sorghum, and three oilseed crops: soybean, rapeseed, and sunflower, are selected for the crop portfolio solution.Footnote 7 The stochastic condition is assessed by using the yield and price fluctuations of these crops, assuming that the annual observations are drawn from a stochastic distribution of events (Markowitz 1952; Stovall, 1966; Taylor 1990; Lien and Hardaker 2001; Pope 1982; Hardaker et al. 1988).Footnote 8 A second observation concerns linear segmentation of the utility function, which is a quadratic approximation to facilitate application of the parametric linear programming method, without losing the stochastic nature of the activity (Hardaker et al. 1988). The problem is formulated as the minimization of risk to a range of possible levels of expected GIFootnote 9 subject to farm constraints and other restrictions (Hazell and Scandizzo 1974; Anderson et al. 1977, p 207). Efficient E-V frontier for whole farm planning This research is organized as follows: the “The utility efficient programming and linearization with MOTAD” section is a discussion on the properties of the sumex utility function (SUF) (Fig. 2) and risk modulation for its specific traits, the parametric programming method, and linearization; the “Empirical analysis: the risky prospects ” section discusses the sample of risky prospects used for empirical analysis; the “Computation of utility efficient frontier ” section is dedicated to analysis of the utility efficient frontier; the “Conclusions” section analyzes the results obtained with evidence of the initial hypothesis about crop diversification and other suggestions to implement these results.

Compared to the traditional tillage-based way of farming, NT can be considered in general terms as an innovation that, as all innovations, has got both technical as well as organizational components.Footnote 1 NT adoption requires specific skills and the use of adequate machineries. In everyday language NT is often linked to a new vision of agriculture centred on sustainability. This is due to the fact that NT is one of the three main components of Conservation agriculture (CA),Footnote 2 a vision of sustainable farming firmly promoted by FAO also in consideration of its ability to conserve the soil resource. In other words, in the frame of CA, NT can be considered one of the complementary practices aiming at conserving soil and preventing its degradation. Soil is one of the basic resources for all agriculture production and its protection and restoration represents one of the environmental (and climate) objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The CAP objective of sustainable management of natural resources, and more specifically the provision of environmental public goods and the pursuit of climate change mitigation and adaptation, are actually clearly relevant to the soil protection and improvement. The CAP is an important economic driver for farming decisions across the EU and has the potential to advance soil protection in both agriculture through Member States’ and land managers’ implementation of its measures and associated obligations. As is well known, CAP measures available in 2014–20 are the result of a series of incremental reforms since the policy was first introduced in 1962, and some measures relevant to soils have been available for decades. For example, EU Rural development policy support for afforestation and environmental land management contracts dates from the 1980s and CAP cross-compliance originated in requirements for good farming practice first introduced in the 1990s. Conservation of agricultural soils is a major challenge in Italy. Degradation, erosion, loss of fertility, compaction are relevant issues affecting the agricultural as well as the environmental value of this natural resource. For this reason, soil conservation is one of the main priorities of 2014–2020 Rural development in Italy where 15 out of 21 Rural development programmes (RDPs)Footnote 3 are currently granting support to farmers to adopt soil-friendly practices such as NT under the scheme of Measure 10,Footnote 4 with a provisional budget of 280 million euro targeting 192.000 ha of Utilized Agricultural Area (UAA). The relevance of soil conservation issues in the Italian context, together with the relevance of the budgetary effort provided by the RDPs for, evidently require a more detailed knowledge about the characteristics of the spread of NT in CA in among farmers in order to provide knowledge for improving RDP’s decision-making and implementation processes. NT, actually, can play a major role in the conservation of agricultural soils only if adopted in the wider context of the CA approach and not only as a tillage technique merely alternative to the to traditional tillage-based way of farming. RDPs should be able to seize this latter aspect to ensure the effective achievement of durable environmental results of soil conservation. The aim of the work is to examine the spread of No-tillage in Italy analyzing the modalities of adoption and the factors that can influence it. Concerning modalities, as it will be better clarified further in this paper, we should contemplate that NT can be considered both: an incremental innovation within the already existing technological paradigm (i.e. the traditional tillage-based way of farming), and one of the elements of an alternative farming paradigm based on sustainability (the CA). In the first case (a) the most relevant issues concern with the adoption and with the process of diffusion of the practice itself. The second case (b) is more complex instead. Together with the issues already mentioned, in this case adoption of NT must relate to problems of adaptation to the context of the entire paradigm of CA, and the solution of these problems requires a wide cooperation among farmers and other stakeholders operating in a certain area. In this sense, one of the main issues addressed by the work has been to discriminate between the two cases a) and b). This has been done by conveniently processing the data from the last Agricultural Census (2010). The other central issue has been to identify the main determinants of the process of spread of NT. In this sense, firstly the main references in the literature have been examined in order to create a suitable conceptual framework. Subsequently, a series of elaborations has been carried out on the Census data with the aim to verify the influence by the identified determinants on the process of spread of NT. Apart from the soil and climate aspects and from some structural features of the holdings, among the factors considered to explain the spread and the related spatial concentration of the phenomenon of the adoption of NT, a key factor has been represented by the presence of networks of farmers and other stakeholders which play a key role in the phenomena of knowledge spillovers, particularly in those situations where the adoption of NT is an element of a more complex transformation that can be assimilated to the CA paradigm. In agriculture a reduction in soil tillage, in many cases, is a choice that does not require particular skills or technical adjustments: if I do a deeper harrowing instead of plowing,Footnote 5 I am not doing anything particularly revolutionary in my farm. Maybe this choice is dictated simply by the need to reduce some costs related with soil tillage operations. After changing my soil tillage technique, evidently, I have to check if my choice leads to a decrease in yields and therefore a decrease in revenues, or not. The case would be a bit more complicated if I decide to adopt NT, since for this purpose mechanical and practical adjustments are needed; anyway, even in case I would choose to adopt NT as farming technique, the problem would be not very dissimilar to a case of incremental innovation. On the other hand, it is very different to rethink the way of doing agriculture (or of adopting NT) in terms of sustainability as proposed by CA, because it is necessary to rethink the complex of decisions in terms of “overall” sustainability. Ultimately it is clear thus that CA and NT cannot be considered the same thing. In most of the references listed in the bibliography there is a clear definition of CA: NT plays a key role in CA systems, but it is also emphasized that NT is just one of the requirements (principles) of CA. CA complies with the generally accepted ideas of sustainability: both in environmentalFootnote 6 and socio-economic terms. This latter in particular seems to relevantly affect the adoption process of NT in CA (FAO 2001). Quite apart the difficulties related to investments for suitable equipment (Guccione and Schifani 2001), from an economic perspective the issues considered in the literature are those related to the impact on costs and revenues related with the adoption of CA. Obviously any reduction of production costs could represent a significant incentive in direction of adopting CA, as shown in some developing countries (Gupta and Sayre 2007). Cost reduction is largely due to oil and energy saving (Guidobono Cavalchini et al. 2013). FAO (2001) reports economic benefits related also to labour savings and machinery depreciation, and some other authors report CA benefits on investments efficiency and productivity (Marandola and Marongiu 2012). Labour requirements are generally reduced by about 50%, which allows farmers to save on time, fuel and machinery costs (Saturnino and Landers 2002; Baker et al. 2007; Lindwall and Sonntag 2010; Crabtree, 2010). Fuel savings in the order of around 65% are in general reported (Sorrenson and Montoya 1984; 1991). On the other hand, effects of CA adoption on yields seem to be limited (Van den Putte et al. 2010). The yield levels of CA systems seem to be comparable with (and, under certain conditions, even higher) than those under conventional intensive tillage systems, which means that CA should not lead to yield penalties. CA systems, comprising no or minimum mechanical soil disturbance, organic mulch soil cover, and crop species diversification, in conjunction with other good practices of crop and production management, are practiced globally on about 157 M ha, corresponding to about 11% of field cropland, in all continents and most land-based agricultural ecologies, including in the various temperate environments. This change constitutes a difference of some 47% globally since 2008/09 when the spread was recorded as 106 M ha. The current total of 157 M ha represents an increase in adoption of CA by more countries but the estimate is on the conservative side as the updated database does not capture all the CA cropland (Kassam et al. 2015). In the last years CA has consistently expanded, particularly in North and South America as well as in Australia and New Zealand, so CA cannot be considered a temporary fashion (Derpsch and Friedrich 2009). Europe and Africa are the developing continents in terms of CA adoption and uptake. However, because of the good and long lasting research in these continents, showing positive results for CA systems, plus increasing attention being paid to CA systems by governments, European Commission, NGOs, the private sector, international organizations and donors, CA has experienced significant rates of adoption in recent years. For example, CA area in Europe of 2.04 M ha estimated in 2013 is greater by some 30% than the 1.56 M ha that was estimated in 2008/09 (Kassam et al. 2015). However in several areas of the world the choice of adopting NT under the “full principles” of CA is not definitive, so the soils are often in a transitional phase, and the benefits of the new farming paradigm proposed by CA cannot be completely obtained (Derpsch 2008). Among the main barriers to the adoption of CA practices, actually, there are knowledge on how to do it (know how) and mindset (tradition, prejudice)Footnote 7 (FAO 2008; Friedrich et al. 2009). Several authors have explored the role of social mechanisms in the generation of the specific knowledge connected to CA and in its spread. Change in tillage and cropping practices requires cooperation between farm and non-farm knowledge (Coughenour and Chamala 2000), and the spread of CA is often the result of specific social networks (Coughenour 2003). The adoption of soil conservation practices requires a growth of social capital (Cramb 2005). Actors promoting CA, often in projects in developing countries, must take into account the specific perception of farmers (Nyanga et al. 2011) and the gap existing between farm and non-farm culture (Moore et al. 2014). The role of social networks seems significant in the above mentioned “transition” (D’souza and Mishra 2016) to the full membership to CA. Last but not least, literature emphasizes the importance of (social and environmental) context specificities (Andersson and D’Souza 2014), and the difficulties to find general determinants (education, profitability, etc.) to explain the adoption of CA (Knowler and Bradshaw 2007). However cooperation among farmers and other actors plays a key role to promote the necessary mind-set and to adapt CA principles to specific environments.",12

Whey protein represented a global market value of approximately USD 7.7 billion in 2016, and its market value is forecasted to reach around USD 9 billion by 2021, corresponding to an average annual growth of 4% (3A Business Consulting 2017). The global sports supplement market has expanded rapidly due to many factors, including increased consumer health consciousness, technical advances in the food industry, predictions for an aging population, and increased health costs (Hasler 1996; Mirasol 1999; Challener 2000). In addition, the expected increase in dairy production following the abolition of the EU milk quota regime, and governments’ promotion of value-added dairy products, will further push the growing market of whey protein-based sports supplements (e.g., Department of Agriculture, Food, and the Marine (DAFM) 2011). From the supply side, the major producers of whey products and ingredients are the EU-28 countries and the USA. In recent years, strong growth of high-end protein products (i.e., products with higher protein concentrate like WPC80 and WPI) has been observed, resulting from the fast growth in the main nutritional application sectors, such as sports supplements, infant formula, clinical nutrition, and functional foods. Leading dairy and cheese companies, such as Lactalis, Friesland Campina, and Glanbia, play important roles in whey and lactose markets.Footnote 1 Although the two largest dairy companies, Nestlé and Danone, rarely produce whey and lactose ingredients themselves, they are the major end users of whey and lactose in their products. From the demand side, the major markets have expanded from the EU and US markets to Asia and beyond. In terms of market size, Asia has surpassed North America and is predicted to have the most growth potential over the next 5 years (3A Business Consulting 2017). From the consumer profiles’ prospectus, the whey protein sports supplement market has transformed enormously over the years. Historically, consumers of sports nutrition products have been bodybuilders and athletes (Froiland et al. 2004). With increased consumer health consciousness and rapid expansion of the dietary supplement industry, the market has seen growing interest in the use of whey protein supplements by recreational users (Agriculture and Agri-Food, Canada [AAFC] 2010). Studies have also shown that the calcium and mineral mix provided by dairy products can accelerate weight and fat loss during energy restriction, suggesting that whey protein might facilitate consumers in achieving a favorable body weight and composition (Ha and Zemel 2003). Previous research on consumer perception and behaviors toward whey protein products can be found for whey protein-added snack, yogurt, and meal replacement products. Lee et al. (2002) investigated four formulations of whey-protein-isolate (WPI) coatings used for chocolate-covered almonds and found that water-based WPI-lipid coatings had higher consumer acceptance than alcohol-based shellac. In another study done by Childs et al. (2008) on consumer perception of whey and soy protein in meal replacement products, the researchers found that consumers preferred bars to beverages, but there were no significant preferences for protein type, which may result from the lack of knowledge and understanding of the different protein types. They also found that exercisers viewed muscle-building claims as more important, while non-exercisers viewed the heart health, calcium, and vitamin/mineral claims as more important. There are no up-to-date quantitative studies that explore consumers’ choice behaviors for whey protein-based sports supplements. Although the expansion of the sports supplement market has provided tremendous opportunities for the industry, producers and marketers are facing increasing challenges. First, as a wider variety of products become available in a growing variety of channels, competition is intensified from both inside and outside the sports nutrition market Agriculture and Agri-Food, Canada [AAFC] 2010; Euromonitor 2015). Second, ever-evolving consumer trends have placed more pressure on companies to develop novel products and accelerate the product adaption and innovation process in order to meet consumer needs (Bistrom and Nordstrom 2002; Agriculture and Agri-Food, Canada [AAFC] 2010). Under such a situation, continuous effort in understanding consumer trends is crucial to all the players in the industry. To facilitate improved understanding on whey protein sports supplement consumption and the evolving consumer trends, we carried out a small-scale consumer survey in Ireland in 2014. Although a small country, Ireland plays a unique role in the world sports nutrition market. From the production side, Glanbia (headquarters in Ireland) became the world’s largest sports nutrition producer in 2003. A number of high-profile acquisitions, including that of Optimum Nutrition and BSN, have given Glanbia a 13% share in a fragmented global sports nutrition market (Food and Drink Business Europe 2011). From the market side, the Irish market for whey protein sports supplements has seen rapid growth in both Irish-owned brands (Optimum Nutrition, Kinetica, BSN, ROS, etc.) and non-Irish brands (USN, PhD, etc.). Compared to the average annual growth of 4% globally, shares of sports nutrition grew by 9% and sports protein powder grew by 12% in current value terms in 2015 in Ireland (Euromonitor 2015). With its leading position in sports nutrition production and its tremendous market growth, Ireland has lent itself to being an appealing case study choice for the evolving trends of this fast-growing industry. Sports supplements are traditionally used by athletes to enhance training effect and to accelerate body recovery. It is often believed that males are the dominant users of sports supplements (Froiland et al. 2004). The objectives of this research are (1) to identify the determining factors that affect consumers’ choice of whether or not to consume whey protein products, (2) to determine the key factors that affect the amount of whey products consumed by consumers, and (3) to determine the brand awareness and the key factors that affect consumers’ brand choice. Three hypotheses are explored. Hypothesis 1: gender plays an important role in the choice of whey protein consumption. Hypothesis 2: exercise type is a determining factor for the consumption of sports supplements. Hypothesis 3: country of origin label has strong impacts on consumer choices. Findings from the study will have direct implications to improve the effectiveness of product development and other marketing efforts of the industry. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The “Methodology” section explains the model and methodology applied in the study. The “Data and analysis” section reports the sample details, the analysis process, and the main results. The “Conclusions and implications” section concludes the study and provides industry implications.",4
7.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,19 March 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-019-0124-x,Analysis of households food insecurity and its coping mechanisms in Western Ethiopia,December 2019,Seid Sani,Biruk Kemaw,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Food is both a basic need and a human right as enough food in terms of quantity and quality for all people is an important factor for a healthy and productive life as well as for a nation to sustain its development (FAO (2014); Sani and Kemaw 2017). Besides, enough food in terms of quantity and quality is a key for maintaining and promoting political stability and insuring peace among people (Idrisa et al. 2008). However, reports indicated that about 1.4 billion poor people were living on less than US$1.25 a day and 1 billion of them live in rural areas where agriculture is the main source of livelihood, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia (IFAD 2011). Furthermore, FAO (2015) reported that about 795 million people in the world were food insecure, with many more suffering from ‘hidden hunger’ caused by micronutrient or protein deficiencies. Moreover, different studies depicted that food insecurity occurred in most countries to varying degrees, and 75% of the food insecure people lived in rural areas of developing countries, in which two thirds of these lived in just seven countries (Bangladesh, China, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia and Pakistan) (Keatinge et al. 2011; Khush et al. 2012; Sani and Kemaw 2017). As a part of Africa and developing world, Ethiopia is one of the most food-insecure and famine affected countries as large portion of the country’s population has been affected by chronic and transitory food insecurity (Abduselam 2017). Over 30% of the population is below the food poverty line, unable to afford the minimum caloric intake for a healthy and active life (CSA (Central statistical agency) 2014). Furthermore, FAO (2012) finding figured out that 52% of the rural population was food insecure i.e. consume below the minimum recommended daily intake of 2100 kcal/ AE /day, which led the rural households to temporarily depend on relief food assistance. As a result, more than 8.5 million people were in need of emergency food aid and assistance (WFP 2017). Moreover, under-nutrition has been a persistent problem as 44% of children in the country were stunted, 10% of children were considered to have low weight-for-height (wasting) and 29% of children were considered to have underweight (low weight-for-age). Besides, under-nutrition was predominant in rural areas in which stunting accounts for 46%, wasting accounts for 10%, and underweight accounts for 30% of rural children in the country (CSA (Central statistical agency) 2011). The western part of Ethiopia, Assosa zonein particular, is hit by high degree of incidence of food insecurity as agricultural production and productivity is highly vulnerable to climate variables (Sani and Kemaw 2017). In addition, Assosa zone is characterized by erratic and unreliable rainfall, land degradation, low per capita, poor infrastructure development, vulnerable groups (landless and the poor without assets, very small and fragmented land holders, female- headed households, families with large size, drought and pest affected households) which cause low agricultural production and food deficit in the area (Asfir 2016; AZBARD (Assosa Zone Agriculture and Rural Development Office) 2015). To reverse the food insecurity situation, the government has been formulating and implementing long-term strategies (such as Agricultural Development Led Industrialization, Growth & Transformation Plan I and Growth & Transformation Plan II)—which takes ensuring food security as its core objective (FAO 2012). In addition, to reduce the incidence of food insecurity households use different kinds of coping mechanisms in order to improve their livelihood. As to Gemechu et al. (2015) finding there is improvement in food security status of households in the country that shows the role of improvement in livelihood assets as well as investment strategies and policies that promoted households food security and concluded that there is still room for improvement. But, the improvement programs to be effective, they should be supported by location specific empirical evidences (Van der Veen and Tagel 2011). To this end, there is limitation of information on the issue in the study area. Hence, this study analyzes extent of food insecurity and its determinants along with the coping mechanisms opted by households against food insecurity and shortage in the study area. Thus, it addresses what factors affect households’ extent of food insecurity and what coping mechanisms have been used by households against food insecurity and shortage in the study area. Various studies conducted in Ethiopia mainly focused on food availability and access dimension (Girma 2012; Mesfin 2014; Nigatu 2011; Arega 2015; Okyere et al. 2013; Hussein and Janekarnkij 2013; Motbainor et al. 2016) and others adopted 24 h or seven day recall method to capture the utilization dimension (Gemechu et al. 2015; Zemedu and Mesfin 2014; Beyene & Muche, 2010) to address households’ food security and its determinants. However, considering only the food availability and access measures do not fully address the actual food energy utilization by the households and the quality of the food consumed. In addition, the drawback of relying on seven day recall method is that as a part of developing countries the majority of rural households have weak access to formal education due to that they cannot accurately respond on the types and quantities of food items consumed. The novelty of this study is that it considered households’ food consumption/utilization for seven consecutive days collected using weighed records method as food energy intake is sensitive to different unforeseen factors such as religion, weather, holidays, etc., which can be captured by taking weighted data.. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 provides the methodology employed; section 3 presents and discusses the results; and section 4 concludes and infers policy implications..",31

Kurgat,Wolfgang Bokelmann,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"The agriculture sector is vital to the economy of many developing countries because it provides raw materials, food and employment to the rising and urbanising population, thus improving the welfare of producers who are poor smallholder farmers (Rios et al. 2008; Zuwarimwe and Mbaai 2015; von Grebmer et al. 2016). Furthermore, its role in improving the livelihoods of smallholder farmers has remained the major strategy towards sustainable rural development through effective and efficient forward and backward linkages (Olwande et al. 2015). Currently, most developing countries are struggling to secure an adequate and nutritious food supply to match rising demand through various strategies of increasing agricultural production capacity and enhancing the commercialisation of farm produce (Muhanji et al. 2011; FAO 2014; Zuwarimwe and Mbaai 2015). This is due to the strong link between the strategic direction taken by smallholder farmers when organising their scarce resources and the market conditions for the produce, along with other investments and innovations. Market-oriented production in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) can play a significant role in the households of smallholder farmers if sustainable market integration is embraced (Xinshen et al. 2007). Many African countries have therefore introduced policies and programmes to support the integration of smallholder farmers in input and output markets through agricultural intensification and commercialisation (Barrett 2008) since the competitivenessFootnote 1 of smallholder farmers in most markets in SSA is still low, despite agriculture’s significant contribution to household food security and poverty alleviation (Barrett 2008; Omiti et al. 2009; Olwande et al. 2015). Furthermore, linking smallholder farmers to markets reduces the cost of agricultural products and strengthens the economic linkages between farm and non-farm production systems (Fischer and Qaim 2012; Rao et al. 2012). As a developing country, Kenya is currently facing both social and environmental challenges, with the main problem being poverty (FAO 2014). This has led to the country suffering from transitory and chronic food insecurity, which has been associated with a numbers of factors such as agricultural production and marketing shocks (PMS), a growing population, low market-oriented production, poor institutional and infrastructural development, and a heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture (Ngugi et al. 2007; Omiti 2012). Recently, the emergence of high-value market chainsFootnote 2 (HVMCs) has triggered the commercialisation of African indigenous vegetables (AIVs) and other farm products (Reardon et al. 2009; Chelang’a et al. 2013). This has made policymakers aware of the importance of AIVs in terms of their role in improving the food situation, nutritional status, income and health of rural and urban households alike in Kenya (Ngugi et al. 2007). The enactment of the Kenyan food security and nutrition policy in the development blue print entitled Vision 2030 was solely informed by these developments, with the main aim of ensuring food and nutritional security in all parts of the country at all times (Omiti 2012; Ngenoh et al. 2016). This is due to the fact that these vegetables have medicinal properties (Kimiywe et al. 2007; Chege et al. 2014), are highly nutritious (Mampholo et al. 2016) and have great potential to attract a premium of up to 79% in urban retail outlets in Kenya under the conditions of consistent supply and packaging (Muhanji et al. 2011; Chelang’a et al. 2013). Furthermore, the majority of rural and urban households rely on these vegetables to fulfil their daily food and nutritional requirements for micronutrients, particularly vitamin A and iron (Chadha, 2006). The production, handling and marketing of AIVs are mostly performed by smallholder farmers in Kenya (Ngugi et al. 2007; Omiti 2012; Ngenoh et al. 2016), and this puts AIVs in a central position as a catalyst for rural development. Consequently, AIV production provides an economic pillar for the livelihood of rural smallholder farmers and therefore represents a livelihood strategy whose implementation should continuously be targeted through sustainable means. According to Schippers (2000), AIVs play a crucial role in income generation and subsistence for the very poorest and thus help them earn a living as producers and traders without substantial capital investment being required. Additionally, the area under AIV cultivation in Kenya increased from 27,102 ha in 2009 to 35,503 ha in 2014, while their yields and value rose by 6% and 10% respectively between 2012 and 2014 (HCDA 2014). Currently, the demand for AIVs has been increasing in major marketing outlets (formal and informal markets) in urban centres in Kenya (Ngugi et al. 2007; Fischer and Qaim 2012; Chelang’a et al. 2013; Ngenoh et al. 2016). Despite this great potential, there is inconsistency in the supply of these vegetables to the majority of HVMCs across urban areas of the country (Ngugi et al. 2007; Chelang’a et al. 2013). Therefore, for smallholder AIV farmers to meet and benefit from this rising demand, they should be integrated into HVMCs so as to sustainably produce and supply vegetables all year round (Ngugi et al. 2007). However, recent studies have indicated that the majority of smallholder farmers are being excluded from the significant growth opportunities offered by HVMCs (Fernandez-Stark et al. 2012; Omiti 2012; Chelang’a et al. 2013) since they face numerous competitiveness bottlenecks (Fig. 1) and market failures along these chains such as low productivity, poor product quality, lack of standards compliance, high transaction costs and a lack of networks among others (Narrod et al. 2009; Rao et al. 2012; Boström et al. 2015). These challenges have further reduced their sustainable entry into HVMCs, and hence, there is a need for a holistic approach to address these constraints in a more coordinated and sustainable way that promotes their effective participation in such lucrative high-value agro-food market chains (Fernandez-Stark et al. 2012). This has been aggravated by stringent regulations in terms of consumer demands from HVMCs, coupled with their sophistication and consolidation, which have made it more difficult for smallholder farmers to participate in these chains (Fernandez-Stark et al. 2012; Rao et al. 2012). Competitiveness bottlenecks and pillars for sustainable inclusion. Source: authors compilation To overcome these challenges, Fernandez-Stark et al. (2012) have proposed a four-pillarFootnote 3 model for holistically enhancing the competitiveness of smallholder farmers in HVMCs. The inclusion of smallholder farmers in HVMCs involves significant changes that require them to holistically overcome the major competitiveness constraints and numerous market failures that limit their competitiveness and thus their sustainable entry into these chains. The authors argue that access to these four pillars by smallholder farmers will lead to several complementary and integrated investments that will ultimately translate competitiveness constraints into income opportunities and serve as a means of reducing poverty. Against this backdrop, this study sought to contribute to the understanding of how smallholder AIV farmers can be supported effectively and efficiently to ensure that they are included in HVMCs in a sustainable way. This will only be possible if they receive assistance with overcoming the significant competitiveness challenges and bottlenecks that prevent them from accessing HVMCs. Therefore, identifying the drivers and incentives for accessing high-value markets, training/extension, finance/credit and farmers’ groups may improve smallholder AIV farmers’ chances of competing successfully and sustainably in HVMCs. Finally, it will also provide a clear framework that could be used by policymakers when making decisions about how to support this vulnerable group of farmers so that vibrant agro-food HVMCs can be developed which, in turn, will improve rural household food security and reduce poverty. The reviews conducted for this paper show that previous studies (Markelova et al. 2009; Narrod et al. 2009; Gruère et al. 2009; Fischer and Qaim 2012; Trebbin 2014; Ma and Abdulai 2016) have only used collective action/farmers’ groups to link farmers to the markets on the assumption that these are the best model for farmers to access other pre-conditioning factors, without considering the heterogeneity of smallholder farmers in terms of their household characteristics and resources. Additionally, Ferris et al. (2014) used the involvement of extension services and advisory services in linking smallholder farmers with niche markets. Therefore, this paper’s contribution is twofold. First, using a “holistic” model with four key pillars or intervention instruments (access to HVMCs, credit services, extension services and farmers’ groups), it was possible to identify the main drivers and incentives for overcoming the major constraints limiting the competitiveness of smallholder AIV farmers in HVMCs. Second, using a multivariate probit model, it was possible to estimate the influence of exogenous factors on simultaneous decisions about accessing the four key pillars of competitiveness, while allowing for the error terms of each of these pillars to be freely correlated. Furthermore, the model allowed the complementarities and substitutabilities of these pillars of competitiveness to be captured and hence their promotion to be facilitated in order to achieve the maximum welfare benefit for smallholder AIV farmers.",31

This expansion of the market for natural and organic products follows a global trend of an increasing demand arising from greater expectations for health and well-being.

In the scholarly literature, organic food consumption is related to environmental awareness, health, quality, perceived value, and price fairness (Srinieng and Thapa 2018; De Toni et al. 2017; Petrescu et al. 2017; Tsakiridou et al. 2008). However, little is known about organic food production and consumption in developing countries. Indeed, North America and Europe generate the most organic food product sales, have about one-third of global organic farmlands, and consume over 90% of organic food and drinks (Willer and Lernoud 2016). But surprisingly, much of the organic crops are grown in other regions, especially in Asia, Latin America and Africa, and exported (Sahota 2016). Most literature on organic food markets (supply and demand) is dominated by case studies in the Western world (Orlando 2018; Benedetti et al. 2018; de Toni et al. 2017; Petrescu et al. 2017; Cene and Karaman 2015; Dias et al. 2015; Annett et al. 2008). These cases studies are about organic food production/consumption, certification and traceability within long food chains (with intermediaries and retailers). So far, little is known about the factors that shape local organic food demand in situations where there are no retailers or intermediaries between vegetable producers and consumers. Instead, in these cases, there is a direct linkage between producers and consumers. Such short food chains do exist in organic food production in rich countries, as well as in traditional agricultural and resource-constrained contexts such as peri-urban Burkina Faso. These short food value chains in Burkina Faso largely fall outside national statistics. There is, however, an extensive literature in other parts of the world on organic food. This establishes the key determinants of organic food demand in terms of sensory factors (e.g. food taste) and non-sensory characteristics (e.g. gender) of consumers (Annett et al. 2008; Tsakiridou et al. 2008; Dias et al. 2015; Cene and Karaman 2015; Petrescu et al. 2017; de Toni et al. 2017). Some authors use the concepts of pull and push factors to explain the behaviour of consumers towards organic food (Nandi et al. (2016)): health concerns, environmental awareness, income, price, food availability, education, gender, perception of organic food, taste, and nutrition value, are amongst the factors that shape the demand for organic food found in this literature. Even though these case studies have largely focused on vegetable demand in their approach (Srinieng and Thapa 2018; Nandi et al. 2016), they did not consider the demand of those foods as a dynamic system in which the producers and consumers interact with each other within a ‘market place’. Hence, this research addresses the question: What are the interactive determinants of the effective demand for organic vegetables within the short food chain in the urban context? It empirically tests the significance of these determinants in a case study of Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. Ouagadougou is an interesting context because consumers are increasingly becoming aware of the benefits of eating fresh organic products and are willing to pay premium prices for it. Also, although a certain internal (local) demand exists, the supply of products in the local market is still quite low: data from the National Council for Organic Agriculture (CNABio) identifies only two production sites of organic vegetables, 3 acres in total, in the Ouagadougou (CNABio 2015). Two women groups produce fresh vegetables in both sites (Women Food Entrepreneurs-WFE project 2015). Such organic food is seen as a new concept in Ouagadougou as there is no formal evidence of the attachment of consumers to organic food within a weak existing system regulating the supply and consumption of this type of food.",6

In 1900, worldwide, there were 7 rural dwellers to each urban dweller; now there is less than one and projections suggest close to three urban dwellers to two rural dwellers by 2025. UN’s projections suggest that the world’s urban population will grow by more than a billion people between 2010 and 2025 (United Nations 2008). Unlike the situation in the developed countries at comparable stages of development, the process of urbanization in the third world countries appears to be more a function of rural push factors than the urban pull factors (Adem 2010). It is also common that as the population increases in urban areas, urbanization expanded to rural areas. Today’s rapid rate of urbanization of the world is higher, particularly radical urban growth predicted in developing countries (Marshall and Randhawa 2009). Africa’s urban transition is proceeding rapidly, with the accumulated relative growth rate of its cities now among the highest in the world (UNECA 2014). In 2000, 38% of the African population lived in urban areas and the proportion is expected to increase to 47% by 2015 and to double by 2050 (Adeboyejo 2007). Such rapid urban expansion has a great impact on the urban periphery in terms of changing in land use, differential access to urban benefits (such as basic infrastructure and employment), and increased pressure on common natural resources (Marshall and Randhawa 2009). The areas of developing countries are characterized by high incidence of poverty. This is due to low-income populations attracted to the periphery by inexpensive, but mostly illegal land for housing (Gugler 1996). However, most of the peri-urban dwellers of low-income groups who are originally resided in the area before the urban encroachment and have the rural background. Some of these groups depend to some degree on agricultural livelihood for the living. The interaction of rural-urban interface determines community in peri-urban areas to build or enhance in adapting various livelihood strategies and fulfill their needs. Rapid urbanization process is demanding a transformation of land use in surrounding rural area to cater to the needs of urban areas (DFID 2000). The land is the primary asset that can be affected by intense pressures of the land conversion process in peri-urban areas. Changes in land use from rural to urban activities affect the economic features of the peri-urban interface (DFID 1999). The urban periphery is an open countryside including peri-urban areas largely occupied by agricultural communities in rural settlement pattern to which urban settlement expands (Adem 2010). Peri-urban areas are those areas adjacent to build up areas of high population concentration, zones where traditional farming activities come into conflict with alternative economic, residential, and recreational interest (Mandere and Anderberg 2010). Peri-urban is an area neither urban nor rural but an interface where there is increasingly less provision of various urban services when compared to the urban system and increasingly less provision of ecological services when compared to the rural system (Adeboyejo 2007). According to Brook and Davila (2000) observations in Kumasi and Ghana, while the phenomenon of peri-urban development must be acknowledged as inevitable, it is worth noting that even in Kenya “there appears to be no recognition of the changes being caused or to be caused by the presence and growth of urban activity including the inherent opportunities and threats. Similarly, problems and benefits of urban spatial expansion are not fully recognized.” On the other hand, agriculture remains an important livelihood activity among the majority of indigenous peri-urban communities (Mutua 2013). Ethiopia has a long history of urbanization and has the urban settlement like Aksum, Lalibela, and Gondar. However, urbanization and urban development in Ethiopia face a number of socioeconomic problems due to its fast pace (Tegegne 2000). Ethiopia is characterized by low level of urbanization even by African standard, where only 16% of populations live in urban area. Despite this, it has recorded a relatively high growth rate of urban population (4% annually), double that of rural areas. However, such high growth rate is not often accompanied by development in economic services and infrastructure, and economic and employment capacity of the urban centers to support the growing population (Tegenge 2000). Moreover, urban growth and urbanization process in Ethiopia characterized by high primate city development. In Ethiopia, commercial farms, protection of parks, villagization, resettlement, road construction, urban expansion, and similar state organized national plan caused population displacement (Feleke 1999). The urban development strategy of Ethiopia is mainly based on expropriation of peri-urban agricultural land from local peri-urban farmers. However, its economy still depends on agriculture, which accounts for more than 42% of the GDP, 90% of the exports and 85% of total employment (Hassan 2011). The government delivers land for this program through taking compulsorily the nearby agricultural land from local peri-urban farmers who have given a lifetime right through giving cheap price as compensation in advance (ibid). In agrarian country like Ethiopia, land is not only the main means for generating a livelihood but often also used to accumulate wealth and transfer it among generations. In urban areas also, most of the human activities are meaningfully linked to land. It is the starting point for all urban development activities that provides the physical location for shelter, commercial, industrial, and other public services (Daniel 2006). The main reason for urbanization in the Amara regional state is derived from reform in the country in terms of economic policy (FDRE Proclamation No. 455/2009, 2009) that has created the enabling environment for private investments. The main reason for urbanization in the Amara regional state is derived from reform in the country in terms of economic policy (FDRE Proclamation No. 455/2009, 2009) that has created the enabling environment for private investments. The proclamation more focused on how to attract potential private investors but not consider the livelihood of peri-urban dwellers. On the other hand, the rural farming community has little knowledge and know-how to adapt to the situation of urban life as most of them is unskilled to compete for the urban job opportunity. As a result, most of the dislocated families could be exposed to economic disadvantage. Livelihood strategies of those farmers can be exposed to economic problems that lead them to impoverishment. This study has tried to assess the economic linkage between urban development and the livelihood of peri-urban farming communities in Amara regional state and recommend suitable strategies for municipality officials and policymakers. In the study, the following hypothesis was stated: Hypothesis: Urban expansions negatively and significantly affect the economic livelihood of peri-urban farming communities in Amara regional state. Based on the identified problems, the study also answers the following research questions:
  What are horizontal urban expansion policies and real practice of urbanization to protect the economic interests of peri-urban agricultural farming communities in Amhara regional state? What are the factors that contribute to urban expansion in Amara regional state? What are perceptions of evicted community on eviction process that are pursued by urban administrators to rehabilitate the livelihood of peri-urban farmers? What are the challenges that hinder proper implementation of urban policy and livelihood of peri-urban dwellers of agricultural communities? To address the research questions, the general objective of the study is to assess economic linkage between urban development and livelihood of peri-urban farmers in Amara regional state. The specific objectives were the following:
 To assess economic impacts of urban development on the livelihood of peri-urban farmers in Amara regional state (test hypothesis). To assess policies and current practices of urban development concerning the economic aspect of peri-urban agricultural communities in Amara regional state. To identify the factors that contributes to urban expansion in Amara regional state. To identify the challenges that hinder proper implementation of urban policy and livelihood of peri-urban dwellers of agricultural communities. To assess the attitude and perception of evicted community on eviction process that is pursued by urban administrators.",7

R. Dossou,Augustin K. N. Aoudji,Rodrigue S. Kaki,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"In Sub-Saharan Africa, the agricultural sector plays a key role in tackling poverty and promoting food security (Sheahan and Barrett 2014; Affognon et al. 2015). In Benin, it contributes 23% on average to gross domestic product (PNUD 2015) and employs about 47% of the country’s active population (INSAE 2016). Supplying farmers with adequate inputs could foster agricultural development (Shah et al. 2008). Several studies have demonstrated that credits have a beneficial effect on farm productivity and on the cash-flows of farmers’ households (Rajagopalan 2000; Arif 2001; Dawar 2003; ONU 2005). Financing constraints in the agricultural sector, therefore, limit the productive capacity of poor farmers (Shah et al. 2008). This impedes the modernization of agriculture by decreasing the use of technological innovations (Adégbola et al. 2009; Tarchiani et al. 2017). In the context of increasing demand for agricultural financing in developing countries, including Benin, commercial banks show a limited interest in financing this sector (Kodjo et al. 2003). Microfinance has, therefore, become the main supplier of agricultural finance (Wampfler and Lapenu 2002; Morvant-Roux et al. 2010). However, most microfinance institutions only fund agricultural activities with lower risk, such as agricultural trade, or agri-food processing. As a result, microfinance is less able of meeting most farmers’ financing needs (Moses and Zangue 2017). This supports the need to develop microfinance schemes tailored to the farmers’ needs in order to effectively strengthen their investment capacity and optimal management decisions. Documenting the specific requirements of farmers could assist the government and other stakeholders in agricultural funding in developing adequate policies to satisfy these requirements. This study seeks to analyze the adequacy between credit supply and the expectations of rice farmers in Central Benin, in order to identify policies for improved agricultural-oriented financial services. Indeed, rice has progressively become a fundamental food in both rural and urban areas of Benin and contributes to food security (Konnon et al. 2014). However, the domestic supply does not fulfill the growing demand. This increased demand is reflected in massive imports, accounting for more than 60% of total consumption in 2013 (FAO 2015). In order to guarantee food self-sufficiency for rice, with the prospect of serving sub-regional and regional markets, it is essential to set up financing schemes tailored to the requirements of rice farmers. The present study was built on an integrated framework combining the characteristics of rice farmers and their farms, the financial services offered (Kumar et al. 2012), the categorization of rice farmers according to their expectations (Aoudji et al. 2014), and the expectancy disconfirmation paradigm (Oliver 1980; Taylor 1997). It was hypothesized that rice farmers are unsatisfied with the current credit supply. Although this study was conducted in Central Benin, its practical interest was to provide policymakers in Sub-Saharan Africa with useful information for identifying the attributes of adequate agricultural credit from the microfinance institutions. This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, the research methodology is presented. “Results” appear in section 3, and the discussion of those results is done in the “Discussion” section. The main conclusions and related policy recommendations are summarized in the “Conclusion” section.",1

Nevertheless, the conventionalization of this market is a serious threat to the improvement of economic conditions of such farmers (Blank and Thompson 2004). Many authors say that the increasing barriers represented by regulation, health standards and trade practices force these farmers to engage with alternative food networks (AFN) as the only option to commercialize their products (Cicatiello et al. 2015; Micheels and Boecker 2017; Wilkinson 2010). The same is considered by Goldberger (2011), who proposes a bifurcation where small farm holders follow AFN and large farmers supply the conventional super and hypermarkets. There is not yet a clearly accepted definition along the discussion that defines what an AFN is, and the most often found proposal defines it in opposition to the conventional super and hypermarket model (Forssell and Lankoski 2015; Si, Schumilas, and Scott 2015; Tregear 2011; Wilson 2013). This includes farmers’ markets, community-supported agriculture (CSA), and solidarity purchase groups (SPG), among other formats. I also highlight that many articles overlap with similar research areas, such as short food supply chain and local food systems. Another way to conceptualize AFN is as an expression of recursive material and symbolic interactions between producers and consumers (Goodman, DuPuis, and Goodman 2012). These all combined have formed an area of growing attention while more and more researchers are turning their focus to contribute to its development. Its importance relies on the fact that AFN development could bring more sustainable practices, socio-economically and environmentally, to food production (Mastronardi et al. 2015). Fonte (2013), based on several authors, questions if they are fairer and more sustainable pre-figurative ways of political models of consumption. This is because the sustainability is assumed from a closer relationship between producers and consumers in opposition to the distance established in the conventional chain (Cicatiello et al. 2015; Hayden and Buck 2012; Hunt 2007; Lass, Lavoie, and Fetter 2005; Thilmany 2008; Vermeir and Verbeke 2006). Shorter distances involve not only the geographic dimension, but also informational gaps. It is assumed that, as far as consumers can make a more informed decision mediated by trusted sellers, their choice would be influenced by sustainability values (Baldi et al. 2019). Alterity is not a guarantee of sustainable practices, though, as localism can result in elitism and reactionism (Hinrichs 2003). The proximity may strengthen the influence of social embeddedness on their purchase decision (Granovetter 1985; Hinrichs 2000). Brinkley (2017:315) considers the “food supply chain as means of spatially distributing social values by leveraging economic capital” so, its social embeddedness creates feedback loops that concentrate economic and social capital. The recent growth of AFNs may also be related to modern information technologies. Nowadays, the cost of communication is so low compared to previous decades that it enables many small entrepreneurs to advertise broadly with low investment (Bos and Owen 2016). Groups of people can also find and connect with each other much more easily using instantaneous messages (Thorsoe and Kjeldsen 2016). Virtual communities facilitate the flow of information across social networks, and artificial intelligence mechanisms can even automatically connect people to topics and people that interest them. Therefore, virtual reality is part of the continuity of the human evolution (Castells 2000). It is neither separated nor distant from what is already known about human relationships, but a new tool that enables new communication formats and flow of meanings (Sykes 2005). A review of the literature has shown that box-schemes are one of many different AFN models, but they have received less attention from researchers. Paul e McKenzie (2013) define box-scheme as a home delivery system of fresh fruits and vegetables with seasonal assortment, usually delivered weekly and paid for in advance. Brown et al. (2009) adds the possibility of central delivery points instead of home delivery. In Mastronardi et al. (2015:1), it is described as “sales method whereby the farmer sends produce directly to the homes of participating consumers.” But we also find it as composed by products from different farmers (Milestad, Kummer, and Hirner 2017) as the practice gains scale and reaches over 60,000 people with large companies operationalizing box-schemes in the UK. Hashen et al. (2018:1600) define box-scheme as a system that “usually works by subscription, using the Internet as shopping platform. The majority of box-schemes in the United Kingdom are run on a local or regional basis by farmers who deliver weekly boxes to customers’ homes or to a local collection point.” Additionally, Vidal et al. (2011) highlight as key characteristics their regular delivery, product range, and limited customer choice. Different from other options of AFN, box-schemes do not necessarily involve face-to-face contact. This characteristic is very strong in the case of farmers’ markets and is considered a significant step change in the quality of the relationship between buyers and sellers (Cicatiello et al. 2015; Hunt 2007; Spilková, Fendrychová, and Syrovátková 2013; Thilmany 2008). Some researchers say that face-to-face contact is imperative for the establishment of a trustworthy tie (Bos and Owen 2016; Thorsoe and Kjeldsen 2016). Compared to CSA and SPG, they do not demand such strong links between actors (Cembalo, Migliore, and Schifani 2013; Fonte 2013; Hayden and Buck 2012; Lagane 2015). The fact that box-schemes share the usage of boxes with pre-defined content, advance payment and a relationship supposed to last longer (subscriptions), approximates it to CSA and SPG but, for these last ones, this combination is not as central as it is for the companies centered around the box-schemes because, according to their principles, CSAs and SPGs demand higher involvement of consumers. Considering that its appearance is related to capabilities created from new information technologies, box-schemes could be considered a format of electronic commerce. Traditional retail chains have evolved into digital stores, making all their assortment available online to ease grocery shopping. More recently, retailers who have grown solely in digital world have made the opposite movement, invading the physical stores’ environments, like Amazon’s acquisition of Wholefoods in 2017. In our case, these box-schemes are operated by much smaller companies, with ways of working based on a limited assortment of organic products, delivery contracts expected to go beyond a unique shopping trip, and choices that are not fully flexible, which means that buyers acquire a set of products defined by sellers. These products are usually in season, and buyers have some flexibility to change some of them or add new ones. Yet, what makes it unique is the combination of imposed conditions (pre-defined boxes) and lower involvement (in reference to the engagement of buyers in production and acquisition processes compared to CSA and SPG). To underscore its relevance, in the UK, such box-schemes were pushing organics sales growth by increasing sales two to three times the market average and represented 11% of the total organic sales in 2015 (Organic research center 2016; Soil Association 2014). These initiatives would simply be an electronic commerce format if they were not breaking the freedom of consumers to choose what they want in favor of a standard box. Having said that, I defend the box-schemes as an AFN itself because of alternative patterns that differentiate them from conventional retailers as well as from most similar AFNs. Thus, box-schemes are the commercialization system in which customers buy a pre-defined basket of fresh food without any tactile experience, accepting assortment, delivery, and payment conditions imposed by suppliers that also define a certain level of customization. Considering its potential as alternative for small producers excluded from the conventional system, what are the alternative practices and conditions in which producers and consumers establish box-schemes? This article intends to understand the practices and conditions connecting suppliers and customers and its capacity to involve the latest in rural challenges. The hypotheses initially conceived based on the studies about other AFN and the knowledge of theoretical framework presented above about trade relationships are:
 Information technology is essential to promoting and creating customer confidence under conditions in which society is evolving into new relationship forms, and presential contacts are being replaced by new possibilities of connection. Connections goes beyond commercial contracts to reach moments and circumstances that indicate social bonds, interdependences, and relationships of care that take place to demonstrate a sense of friendship; therefore, customers become more sensitive to agricultural challenges and how their consumption will impact farmers. Qualitative methods were deployed to analyze three cases of box-schemes in Brazil. The results are presented in sequence to highlight the possibility of AFN, like box-schemes, to strengthen urban-rural ties and build responsible consumption. The origin of an AFN may vary a lot; it can be born simply from a market failure such as supply issues (Si et al. 2015) or driven by complex necessities of new political stewardship among citizens (Lagane 2015), for example. Times of produce shortage have seen the rise of self-provisioning structures in both socialist and capitalist worlds (Mincyte 2012; Naylor 2012). More recent quality issues in meat supply are supposed to have triggered the search of organic food by many consumers, from the UK to China (Si et al. 2015; Wang et al. 2015). Other cases demonstrate that AFN are linked to an upscale form of consumption and would be linked to status demonstration by part of the population (Jehlička and Smith 2011; Kato and McKinney 2015; Smith and Jehlička 2013; Vittersø and Tangeland 2015). At the same time, Cicatiello et al. (2015) associate the participation in AFN to rational needs (including personal values), hedonism, and sociability. According to them, embeddedness is an important lever for AFN development even when main organizational drivers are egoistic reasons like health and quality food supply. This is because trustworthy relationships are needed to guarantee food quality and environmental concerns are addressed (Baldi et al. 2019). The possibility of the social network influence in the choice was found by Migliore et al. (2014) studying SPGs in Italy, where a strong correlation links these groups to the Slow Food movement. Trustworthy information and the belief that an individual choice can make a difference in a specific cause may be linked to the potential importance of an embedded purchase act (Vermeir and Verbeke 2006). From the Economic Sociology perspective, trade relationship is a rich area to observe economic agency (Glucksmann 2000). Polanyi (2012) proposed that the economic integration could happen in three different ways: commerce, redistribution, and reciprocity. Commerce is currently the main form, broadly known by everyone and defined by the exchange of goods and services. Reciprocity and redistribution are ancient forms of integration, conceived before currency creation and still a strong format of economic linkage in archaic communities. Reciprocity refers to the act of benefiting others driven by the expectation of being benefited by others in the future (Mauss 2007; Sabourin 2011, 2012) and is linked to the logic of gift. Sykes (2005:1) claims that “the gift can seem a small thing, but the habit of giving and receiving gifts resonates through human lives because the gift is more than the material object. It establishes or confirms a relationship between people.” Gift may simply be an uninterested donation while reciprocity, for some scholars is an interested act (Hénaff 2009). Regardless of its dimension of economic interest, reciprocity is an acknowledgement of the relationship that may take place in different scales, including on the individual level (Hénaff 2009). Sabourin (2011) states that reciprocity can trigger values and friendship, ultimately resulting in justice. Thus, links established under reciprocity values demand development of trust, either between actors or an actor and its social network, aspects closely related to the social embeddedness of the economic act (Granovetter 1985) that determines not merely commercial relationships but loyalty, thankfulness, and identity (Courlet and Pecqueur 1992). In conventional retail networks, a reciprocity integration is not supposed to be relevant, as clients are not usually establishing human ties when they go to the store, grab what they need, and return home, barely talking to anyone (Cicatiello et al. 2015). In AFN, interactions are many times needed, and they will depend on what kind of AFN we are considering (Hinrichs 2000). Polanyi (2012) also discusses the possibility of integration through redistribution. It is also observed in ancient communities by the habit of centralizing part of or the whole harvest and hunting on the community member accountable for redistributing them across the community and avoiding inequality. This practice guarantees every member will be provided for, regardless of health, age, or any other special condition that could prevent any member from being equally nourished. The contemporary world sees a strong prevalence of commerce over the two other integration formats, but it does not mean they do not exist or, more important, that they do not co-exist when consumers choose what and how to purchase (Sabourin 2011). Considering the growing influence of neo-liberal economic thinking and the decline of the welfare state, former structures of redistribution could be occupied by mechanisms born from civil societies as social innovations (Haddock 2013; Moulaert, MacCallum, and Hillier 2013; Tremblay, Fontan, and Klein 2009). Organic food consumers are frequently associated with trade formats that are considered more fair (Hemmerling, Hamm, and Spiller 2015), and these consumers are even willing to pay premium prices when profits are to promote equity across the supply chain; this behavior is even stronger among those who spends more on organics (Briggeman and Lusk 2011). For Glucksmann (2000), retail represents a link that is not well observed in the often studied dyad of production-consumption. This moment is so important that companies focused on retailing are now giant organizations, more influential than many industries and even countries, from a macroeconomic standpoint, globally (Reardon and Timmer 2012). This environment has changed quickly driven by different facts, among which we find globalization trends, information technology, and economies of scale. Observing this fast-evolving society, Glucksmann (2000) still highlights a transformation of the role of women over the last century, as they search for gender equality. From a retailer perspective, the habit of shopping starts to be redefined when women do not accept it as a non-remunerable responsibility. The change fosters the search for more efficient methods for household supplying, embracing not only the reassignment of the task but also new channels, technologies, choices, etc. Another aspect impacted by the changing role of women is the responsibility over the family’s food and nutrition, something that needs to be delegated or reformulated. Nonetheless, women continue to be the primary person responsible for food provisioning in AFNs, combining new demands with adapted formats to handle everything (Hashem et al. 2018; Som Castellano 2015). In other words, the search for trade conditions that are fairer may coincide with a transformation of purchase habits when women and men revisit their roles regarding non-remunerated tasks related to the family support. In search of new retail formats, AFN can be identified as more trustworthy due to its supposed stronger social embeddedness (Cicatiello et al. 2015; Hinrichs 2000; Hunt 2007; Lass et al. 2005; Thilmany 2008). New retail formats are also a result of the convergence of emerging needs related to the changing of women’s roles and new technology possibilities. Considering digital formats, Przepiorka (2014) considers purchase acts either as only transactional or as able to establish relationships, and that is linked to the capacity of verifying the quality of the good under negotiation. Occasional transactions involving things whose quality is verifiable present a low risk event. In case it is not possible to verify the quality, the risk increases, and the influence of prestige will be important to build trust. Here is where Internet reputation systems play an important role to develop confidence. On the other side, regular transactions will foster closer relationship inherently and it is supposed to last longer, depending on the establishment of trust created out of the satisfaction of both sellers and buyers. In summary, trust in occasional transactions comes out of prestige but trust in regular transaction depends on relationship (Przepiorka 2014). In these cases, given the intrinsic variability of agricultural products, it depends on the regular verification of its quality and the trust on the supplier, when only the long-term usage will build a platform to repair possible failures. This is a third aspect brought to the possibilities influencing the emergence of new trade formats that are created based on new possibilities for communication and meaning exchange (Sykes 2005). The fact that channel and consumption could be used as political tools raises again the possibility of connections beyond the commercial exchange. Wilkinson (2010) proposes that AFN driven by political reasons are mainly ignited by social movement leaders, politicized citizens, and the public sector. For Dubuisson-Quelier, Lamine, and Le Velly (2011), the members of consumption social movements could be split into engaged, recruited, and opportunists. Considering only individual manifestations, we disregard the public procurement and the other five types that may be valuable in the construction of mass consumption through AFN. Yet, engaged and recruited customers could be taken as social leaders and politicized citizens, while opportunists would remain as a group of adopters, not really moved by the values that fuel such movements. In the case of Stevenson et al. (2007), a different role is attributed to different movements. According to their demands and results, they would be warriors, builders, or weavers. From this standpoint, AFNs could be taken as builders once they come up with solutions to the warriors’ demands. Nonetheless, it is interesting to note that Baldi et al. (2019) found that most engaged consumers in SPG in Milan (Italy) were egoistic centered while a large group of less involved consumers were followers with altruistic objectives, contradicting the idea of social engaged leadership in AFNs. When traced back to the organic agricultural foundations and evolution, we find the roots of a social movement in favor of an agriculture less dependent on external and industrialized inputs, against the green revolution that has massified and intensified productions to maximize output (Luttikholt 2007). Bringing it to the bifurcation moment we mentioned before, pioneer activists that preserved low input agricultural methods in organic production may have evolved into activists that refused to participate in (or were excluded from) the conventional system to kick-off new retail formats. Both followed by consumers supporting sustainability ideas may see their system growing up to a point that other consumers start to join the movement without necessarily being engaged with the cause, but motivated by externalities such as convenience or quality. Differences in the way AFNs are created and grown may end up in different impacts. Thus, farmers’ market may be stronger in creating producer-consumer links while direct sales are more efficient in terms of demand stability and economic return (Mastronardi et al. 2019). In the end, box-schemes are an AFN that is closer to regular commercial practices but may keep a certain alterity that fits consumers’ need to contribute towards fairer and more sustainable practices in food trade. They may reinforce economic integration beyond trade practices and enable information flow to consumers that previously were disconnected from producers and vice-versa.",5

As a reaction to these challenges, many food chain actors have started to join alternative production and consumption patterns, grounded on the re-localization of the food systems (Kneafsey et al. 2013) that may result in a greater sustainability of the food chains. Biodiversity conservation, farmers’ value added, and the strong relation with the territory have been indicated as the most relevant sustainability attributes of local food chains (Galli et al. 2015). This situation facilitated the development of alternative food networks (AFNs) arising in contrast with mainstream distribution channels based on large-scale production and standardization (Renting et al. 2003; Higgins et al. 2008). Their distinctive feature is the geographic and/or relational proximity of production and consumption processes (Aubry and Kebir 2013; Pascucci et al. 2011); to recall, the local origin of products and/or the low number of intermediaries along the chain are also elements of short food supply chains (Marsden et al. 2000). Examples of AFNs include farm shops, farmers’ markets, producers’ shops, pick-your-own farms, box schemes, solidarity purchasing groups, and community-supported agriculture. The development of AFNs was initially pushed by farmers as a market strategy to prevent the “squeezing” between upstream and downstream chain actors (Van Der Ploeg 2010) and to overcome the asymmetry in farm-to-retail markets (Xia 2009), thus increasing the profitability of farming activities and their market power. However, their success is strictly connected to the changing demand of consumers, that in the same years turned to a higher attention to quality (Goodman 2003) and a greater awareness of the environmental and social issues linked to mainstream food systems (Ilbery and Maye 2005). The growth of AFNs has been very fast both in the USA and in Europe. In the USA, the number of farmers’ markets grew from 1755 in 1994 to 8717 in 2018, becoming a widespread phenomenon in most of the USAFootnote 1. In Europe, the diffusion of AFNs is more recent, and the UK is the country where they have encountered the greatest success. Following the first farmers’ market which opened in Bath in 1997 (Kirwan 2006), in 2009, FARMAFootnote 2 counted 750 markets. In Italy, ColdirettiFootnote 3 counted over 1000 operating farmers’ markets in 2013. More innovative examples of alternative markets are also spreading all around the world: community-supported agriculture schemes are now operating in over 25 different countries (http://www.urgenci.net), while solidarity purchasing groups are particularly developed in Italy (Franco et al. 2015), where Cembalo et al. (2013) reported estimates of over 700 active groups in 2010. Despite their increasing popularity, AFNs are still regarded by most customers as a complementary source of food provision, and they still represent a niche in the food market. Unfortunately, no data is available on their market share and turnover, rather AFNs are not even regarded in the national statistics on the market shares of the distribution channels. At the moment, it can be stated that AFNs are not even competing with mainstream distribution channels, as the quantity of food purchased by customers at these markets is too little. The objective of this paper is to study the determinants of the quantity of food purchased by AFNs’ customers through these channels, with respect to conventional markets. This will allow to identify the factors that can be used in the marketing strategy of AFNs to increase their importance in the food market. To reach this objective, the paper is organized as follows. First, the research problem is framed within the relevant literature, to argue that an increase in the quantity of food purchased through AFNs may have a positive effect in terms of food system sustainability. Then, data from a survey involving 1200 Italian alternative food market shoppers are analyzed; the share of households’ food provisions purchased through alternative markets is studied against a set of factors through an ordinal logistic regression model. Results are compared and discussed with respect to previous findings in the literature, while some potential trajectories of development of AFNs are suggested in the conclusions.",16

Kassie,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Snack food products have a large impact on agricultural production and marketing as well as on agrifood processing business operations, and the products are becoming an important part of human diets as its convenience and availability attract consumers’ attention (Nor et al. 2013). Snack foods are commonly foods that are eaten between main meals for pleasure and during relaxation. Snack products are acquiring an important place in the shopping list of upper and middle-class income group (Dean and Joseph 2013). Global snack sales totaled $374 billion annually in 2014 with an annual increase of 2% (Nielsen Company, 2016). Indian ready-to-eat snack market is estimated at more than RsFootnote 1.50,000 croreFootnote 2; having grown at a compounded annual growth rate of around 13% since 1998 till 2014 and expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate of 22% during 2014–2019 (CARE Ratings 2015). The snack sector in the United States (US) continued to grow both in volume and in retail sales with a compounded annual growth rate of 4.2% and 2.1%, respectively, from 2011 to 2015 (Agriculture and Agrifood Canada 2016). Ethiopia is endowed with ethnic diversity manifested in cultural diversity and a variety of indigenous knowledge such as traditional foods and beverages’ processing practices (Hunduma 2012). Varieties of traditional food products such as Injera (leavened pancake from Teff, Eragrostis teff), Dabbo (varieties of bread), Kocho (fermented food product of enset, Ensete ventricosum), and Wakalim (fermented meat sausage) are produced through traditional fermentation. Local foods such as Kollo (roasted cereals and pulses), Nifro (boiled cereals and pulses), Besso (roasted and powdered barley),Genfo (porridge), kitta (unfermented bread), Chuko (barley roasted, powdered, and spiced into paste), Kinche (coarsely milled barely/wheat, boiled, and spiced), Ashuk (roasted and slightly boiled faba bean grain), Dabbokollo (wheat dough sliced into pea size and roasted), Yebekollo Tibs (roasted green maize cob), Yebekollo kikil (boiled green maize cob), and Yedinch kikil (boiled potato tuber) (Hunduma 2012) are consumed both as a snack and main meals. Currently, the idea of agribusiness development and agro-processing had given considerable attention in Ethiopia to provide linkages between agricultural producers and processors and create an opportunity for value addition on agricultural products. Within the manufacturing sector, the agrifood processing is the largest subsector accounting for 36% of the total gross value of production (CSA 2014) and 33% of the national value added (Legesse 2015) of large and medium scale manufacturing industries. Even though no information is available regarding national sales of snack products, the Ethiopian government is emphasizing on small agribusinesses like snack products to contribute to agricultural growth through programs such as “Market and Agribusiness Development” (Quilligan 2018). The country has a lot of potential from the supply side but is poorly organized with respect to connectivity, reliable supply, technology level, and knowledge. However, there are various industries tackling this issue by setting up their own supply chain (Boere 2015). Many established industries are already developing and launching snack products that aim to appeal to evolving consumer tastes. Like many other successful industries, there is also a severe competition in this industry (Mammadli 2016). Dynamic business environment and growing competition among market players force snack food operators to sustain competitive advantage by utilizing their resources and enhance their operations. One way to achieve that is to constantly strive for improvement, keep up with changing customer needs, perceptions, habits, and expand market share through carefully built marketing strategies. The increasing customer demands and expectations make competition among market players even tougher. Furthermore, several studies (Enz 2010; Parsa et al. 2011; Wood 2015) claim the food industry has the highest business failure rates among other industry sectors. Parsa et al. (2011) further note the poor performance and business failures are the consequence of a misconception of the growing customer demands, needs, and expectations. Production and marketing strategies are determined by consumers’ beliefs, attitudes, preferences, and willingness to pay for the products. To implement the appropriate marketing concepts, sellers require information about the characteristics, needs, wants, and desires of their target markets. Therefore, it is necessary for snack food producers and supply chain members to know the consumers’ preference and willingness to pay for the product and the main traits that consumers value more to produce the product with preferred traits. Hence, this study analyzed the consumer preferences for enriched snack products and their willingness to pay for each trait of the products and assessed factors affecting the consumers’ choice in Shashamane and Hawassa cities. The choice of food is influenced by a number of factors including demographic characteristics such as age, sex, education level, health status, and income and time constraints. Other factors are the product’s attributes such as price, taste, and information obtained from its label (Sunelle et al. 2010). The consumer preference for snack food depends mainly on taste, flavor, and shape (Dean and Joseph 2013). The effects of nutrition consideration in food choice are likely to be related with consumer perceptions of the product attributes, but not necessarily related with their actual product attributes (He et al. 2005). Several studies have examined trait preference and associated willingness to pay in a range of food products over the last years (Evans 2008; Bonilla 2010; Zou 2011; McCluskey, 2013; Zheng, 2014). However, very few studies have undertaken on snack product traits. This study therefore expands the literature on snack product trait preference in a developing country by employing a discrete choice experiment. Most studies have used multinomial logit to account for preference heterogeneity. Fiebig et al. (2010) pointed out that the multinomial logit model is likely to be a poor approximation of scale heterogeneity. This study uses the recent models more for their ability to embed flexible distributions (Hess and Rose 2012) than their capability to disentangle scale heterogeneity. Data from a choice experiment undertaken by 700 randomly selected consumers in Shashamane and Hawassa city administrations were utilized. The taste parameters, preference heterogeneities, and the implicit prices of enriched snack product traits were estimated by generalized multinomial logit (G-MNL) model (Fiebig et al. 2010).",9

Loos,Tulsi Gurung,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Seventeen sustainable development goals have been set to be achieved by 2030 (World Health Organization 2018). Gender equality is one of the cross-cutting issues highlighted in several of these goals. Fostering gender equality will contribute to and enhance the speed of achieving other goals including, for example, zero hunger (Nilsson 2017). There are numerous studies in the literature showing that women’s empowerment is a pathway to sustainable livelihoods. Women are more likely to invest in health and education (Schmidt 2012). Their empowerment has a positive impact on the dietary status of the households (Sraboni et al. 2014). Moreover, gender per se or gender-linked differences in access to resources, in many cases, was found to be a powerful determinant of the adoption of agricultural practices and technologies that increase yield and protect the environment and agro-biodiversity (Doss and Morris 2001; Fisher and Carr 2015; Ndiritu et al. 2014; Ragasa 2012; Simtowe et al. 2016). Kabeer (2001) defines empowerment as an expansion of one’s abilities to make crucial life choices. Obviously, these choices not only affect one’s own life but have significant effects at the household and community levels. Many recent studies present the linkage between women’s empowerment and household livelihood outcomes. Programs that contribute to agricultural development will be more effective if they target women. When agricultural income is in women’s hands, it is more likely to be spent on health, education, and nutrition. When women have control over assets and decision-making power, they favor agricultural products that support and ensure household food security (Schutter 2013). Sraboni et al. (2014) find a positive association between women’s empowerment and dietary diversity as well as calorie availability. However, studies find that male-headed households are more food secure than female-headed households, a finding that can be explained by women’s limited access to productive resources (Agidew and Singh 2018; Magaña-Lemus et al. 2016; Tibesigwa and Visser 2016). Although literature about the outcomes of women’s empowerment is rich, to the authors’ best knowledge, there is no literature about its outcomes in areas where females have historically enjoyed equality, and even in some cases were favored in asset inheritance and experienced polyandry (that is, women take two or more husbands) marriage practices. This study is done in Bhutan, a country where polyandry was still reported as a prevailing domestic custom in the early years of the twentieth century (Shakespear 2012), and vestiges like fraternal polyandry were still reported in a few nomadic ethnic groups in the early years of twenty-first century (Dorji 2003). Considering the above-mentioned gap, we aim to contribute to the literature by focusing on one important aspect of empowerment: intra-household decision-making. This study’s objectives are (i) to investigate intra-household decision-making and women’s participation in crucial decision-making processes of Bhutanese households’ livelihoods, and (ii) the outcome of their participation level on the household’s dietary diversity that reflects household-level dietary quality. The study adopts the latest methodology introduced by Sariyev et al. (2020) in building an index for women’s participation in domestic decision-making and aims to investigate the linkage between dietary quality and empowerment in Bhutanese households. This paper begins with the background information on the research country (Bhutan) and the status of its female population; it proceeds with a literature review on the linkages between women’s status and household food and nutrition security that is followed by a review of tools for measuring empowerment. In the second section, the conceptual framework of the paper is presented. The third section describes the data and methodology employed. The fourth section presents result and discusses them and is followed by concluding remarks in the final section. The Kingdom of Bhutan is a landlocked South Asian country located in the Himalayas and bordered by India and China. The country remained isolated from the world until the early 1960s. Agriculture has been and remains a dominant sector of the economy. The country is mountainous and widely covered by forests. Except for significant investment in hydroelectric power production, there is little industrial development (Neuhoff et al. 2014). Its population mainly lives in rural areas and depends on agricultural production. The remoteness of rural areas is a remarkable challenge for people and their livelihoods. Nonetheless, significant positive improvements were brought by the government’s commitment to infrastructural development (Minten and Dukpa 2015). Bhutan’s economy is growing fast. In fact, per capita GDP growth remained above 6% in past few years. It is forecasted that the growth will continue, and Bhutan might become the fastest growing economy in South Asia (Asian Development Bank 2018). In 2016, the agricultural sector contributed around 17% to the GDP of the country, and it employed around 58% of the labor force. Infrastructural development has enhanced the cash crop production of farmers who were mainly subsistence farmers during the twentieth century (National Statistics Bureau 2017). Bhutan has achieved noteworthy progress in the participation of women in the labor force. Nevertheless, much still remains to be improved with regard to the quality of jobs held by women. Moreover, general perceptions in the society about gender roles have moved towards more equality, and women are given off-farm work opportunities, while men increasingly support their wives with child care (World Bank 2013). In rural areas, unemployment rates are higher for women than for men, and in general, the unemployment rate is higher for rural than for urban females. Women constitute a considerable share of educated jobseekers in Bhutan, and they also constitute more of the agricultural labor force than men, and their working hours are longer than men’s (Asian Development Bank 2014). Bhutan ranks 110th on the gender inequality index, better than most South Asian countries, especially its culturally and historically close neighbors, India and Nepal. In fact, only the Maldives and Sri Lanka have a better ranking than Bhutan (United Nations Development Program 2018). FAO (2000) reported that 70% of the land was owned by women in Bhutan, and matrilineal heritage was seen as the major reason for female favoritism in land inheritance by the end of the twentieth century. World Bank (2013) indicates the matrilineal inheritance practice supports and creates opportunities for Bhutanese women in their empowerment and advancement, and contributes to the gender parity. In 2002, a member of the planning commission reported that in some areas of Bhutan, females controlled around 60% of property (ThingsAsian 2002). Moreover, Martin Brauen (1997) (as cited in Pain and Pema (2004)) in his study in Bhutan provides clear family examples evidencing matrilineal inheritance and female domination in land ownership and household headship. In Bhutan, according to the Land Act of 1979, men and women have the same rights in land ownership. Moreover, there is no reported gender discrimination in land distribution in Bhutan, unlike in other South Asian countries. In this regard, Agarwal’s book “A field of one’s own land: Gender and land rights in South Asia” (Agarwal 1994), where Bhutan is neither covered nor appears on the map, highlights the importance of land ownership on women’s empowerment. Thus, as also mentioned by Pain and Pema (2004), one would need to carefully search for an answer as to whether Agarwal’s argument that ownership has enhanced women’s well-being holds true in case of Bhutan. The Asian Development Bank (2014) does not confirm this pattern and reports that Bhutanese culture also enables women to be powerful participants in household decision-making processes. Although, land is an important resource, this does not mean that females are absolutely better off. Rural women have higher illiteracy rates than men, and their access and use of financial resources is limited (World Bank 2013). While, historically, matrilineal heritage supported daughters in land inheritance, nowadays, it has moved towards more equality. All children regardless of their gender inherit lands from their parents mostly in equal shares. It is questionable if historical favoritism of women in land inheritance actually gave them any economic benefits. Despite the favoritism in land inheritance, their decision-making power over land was mostly limited. Men are reported to be the main decision-makers regarding land use. While decisions were generally found to be taken jointly, females were found to be sole decision-makers mostly only in the case of an absent male (World Bank 2013). Although it is widely cited that women produce around 60% of the world’s food, empirically it is impossible to quantify female contribution to the food production as the production process involves both genders, and disaggregation is in most cases not possible. What is important is to highlight that women are principal in food production (Doss 2014) and homestead lands that are mostly used by females contribute a great deal to the dietary diversity of the households (Doss et al. 2018). Women’s status is found to have a significant positive effect on the nutritional status of children in South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and Latin America. Sariyev et al. (2020) show a positive effect of women’s participation in household decision-making on dietary diversity in Ethiopian households. In Malawi, analysis shows that if female-headed households enjoy equality in access to productive resources their food security significantly improves (Kassie et al. 2015). In many parts of South Asia, there are inequalities in distribution of power within families. These inequalities can have different individual level outcomes regarding education, employment, and nutrition. The presence of this intra-household inequality can be observed as females eating left-over food and female children being fed less than male children. This is expressly present in poor households (Mukherjee 2009). Poor households are poor because of their limited productive resources, and it is often observed that food is assigned to higher priority members of the household who are quite often male (Miller 1997). Thus, the status of women may directly affect both their own and their daughters’ nutritional status. Malapit et al. (2015) find positive implications for different specifications of female empowerment on dietary diversity of women and children in Nepal. Moreover, in Bangladesh, the status of women is found to be positively linked with long-term nutritional status of children (Bhagowalia et al. 2012). The large pool of literature on the interaction of food security and gender shows that investing in rural women is a proven method to contribute to household-level food and nutrition security. Among many analyses regarding food security, empowerment and their interaction in South Asia, the authors here fail to find any such studies in Bhutan or in any similar context. The study aims to contribute a good deal to the literature on women’s participation in intra-household decision-making. Kabeer (2001) finds that empowerment should be seen as a process of expansion in one’s freedom to make choices that affect one’s life. Its aim is to grant one’s deserved control over resources and decisions (Malhotra and Schuler 2005). In this study, we look at the decision aspect. As mentioned, land is a crucial productive resource over which Bhutanese women exercise control and in most cases, even enjoy favoritism. Empowerment is difficult to measure as it is not directly observable. In light of this well-known difficulty, Malhotra and Schuler (2005) identify four possible ways of measuring empowerment. One of these approaches measures empowerment through survey questionnaires that capture aspects of one’s empowerment. This study uses the same strategy and tries to measure women’s empowerment through their participation in decision-making. Women’s participation in household decision-making is widely considered a good measure of empowerment (Acharya and Bennett 1983; Allendorf 2007; Bhagowalia et al. 2012; Schuler et al. 1996). Malhotra and Mather (1997) consider domestic decision-making one of the dimensions of empowerment along with paid work and education. Becker et al. (2006) reported and analyzed decision-making as a measure of empowerment using analysis of husband and wife reports on household decision-making, which revealed differences in the reported participation of wives. As mentioned, this is considered the main shortcoming of this approach of measuring empowerment. Hashemi et al. (1996) and Garikipati (2008), both use decision-making power as a proxy of empowerment along with a few other proxies to investigate the effect of credit programs on women in Bangladesh and India. Another example is from a nation close to Bhutan—Nepal, where empowerment was measured through questions on decision-making power. The analysis concentrates on uncovering the effect of owning land on the decision-making power of women. The results suggest that there is a high probability that women who own land have a final say or at least participate in joint decision-making (Allendorf 2007). This proves our earlier suspicion. A similar effect could be expected in Bhutan as well. To capture the level of female voices heard and preferences declared in domestic decision-making, we adopt a recently suggested approach by Sariyev et al. (2020) that enables the consideration of possible participation by all members in decision-making processes and aims to quantify women’s participation in them. The underlying conceptual framework described in Fig. 1 is adapted from Headey et al. (2011). It describes linkages between agriculture and nutrition affected by different socioeconomic factors. One key aspect is intra-household inequality, which is presumed to cause a leakage in the pathway. Agricultural policy at the national level influences the production of food, household income, and the amount spent on food and non-food purchases. This is followed by its effect on the households’ nutritional and health outcomes, which are determinants of individual nutritional intake and healthcare, respectively. Intra-household inequality can cause leakages in the pathway towards better nutrition. Headey et al. (2011) introduce intra-household inequalities that cause leakages with regard to food allocation among household members, and thus individuals’ food security. This study extends this approach and aims to discover the relation to the household-level dietary quality, measured by the Food Variety Score (FVS) and the Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS). An increase in female participation in decision-making in households where inequality exists and males enjoy much stronger decision-making power than females is expected to positively contribute to the linkage.
 Linkages between agriculture and nutrition: effects of intra-household inequality. Source: Adapted from Headey et al. (2011) In general, gender inequality is a cross-cutting issue that needs to be considered if good nutritional attainments are to be achieved (Headey et al. 2011). Emphasizing that this study investigates intra-household decision processes of Bhutanese households and aims to identify the effect of women’s participation level in domestic decision-making on the Bhutanese household nutritional outcomes, the study will test the following hypotheses:
 Considering historical matrilineal heritage in Bhutan, women are not expected to be significantly lacking in participation in domestic decision-making. The level of women’s participation in household decision-making determines the level of dietary diversity in the households. Echoing the thoughts of Headey et al. (2011), an increase in participation in decision-making will be associated with better outcomes in low levels of gender equality, but negative outcomes if it leads to inequality or one gender’s dictatorship in decision-making. Thus, the association between women’s intra-household decision-making power and household-level dietary quality is expected to be nonlinear.",12

In this article, however, we focus on the contribution of UA to urban household food security (FS). UA has received considerable attention over the last decade for its actual and potential contribution to reducing food insecurity and poverty among urban households (Gerstl et al. 2002; Rogerson 2003; Mougeot 2005; Shifa and Borel-Saladin 2019). UA has been promoted by some civil society organizations, researchers, government agencies, and development agencies as a pro-poor initiative in developing countries (Mougeot 2006; Lee-Smith 2010; Clinton et al. 2018). Proponents argue that UA is an important source of food in most developing countries and is a critical food and nutrition security strategy among the urban poor (Armar-Klemesu 2000; Mougeot 2000; Nugent 2000; Maxwell 2001). The above notwithstanding, there is a continuing debate about the actual contribution of UA to urban food supply as a whole and to the food and nutrition security of participating urbanites in particular. Many authors (Ellis and Sumberg 1998; Zezza and Tasciotti 2010; Crush et al.2011; Lee-Smith 2013; Stewart et al. 2013; Frayne et al.2014) argue that the importance of UA for urban household FS has been overstated. For example, using nationally representative data for 15 countries including four from Africa, Zezza and Tasciotti (2010) found a positive association between participation in UA and FS in two of the African countries (Ghana and Nigeria) included in their sample. However, they cautioned that the positive relationship should not be overstated because of the minimal contribution of UA to the income of participating households; Ellis and Sumberg (1998) provided similar caution. Based on results of their study of 19 countries (including six from Africa), Badami and Ramankutty (2015) are even more doubtful about the contribution of UA to FS. They conclude as follows: “UA can only make a limited contribution to urban FS, let alone FS generally, in low-income countries” (p. 14). As could be expected how UA is defined and measured matters for the conclusions one might reach, both with respect to the magnitude of participation and the association between UA and FS (Warren et al. 2015). The three most common definitions of UA in the literature are (a) crop and livestock production by urbanites irrespective of where the activity takes place (e.g., Zezza and Tasciotti 2010), (b) crop and livestock production within urban and peri-urban spaces irrespective of who is involved (e.g., Lee-Smith 2010), and (c) the growing of crops in cities (e.g., Clinton et al. 2018). Some authors (e.g., Badami and Ramankutty 2015) define UA more narrowly as primary vegetable production in “built-up” urban areas. Clearly, the association between UA and FS would depend on which of these definitions is applied. As an empirical point of departure from the received literature, the present article applies the first definition of UA mutatis mutandis as explained below. Policies and institutions play a role in either promoting or inhibiting UA and its poverty and food insecurity reducing potential (Bryld 2003; Smit 2016). In Ghana for example, one of the six components of the Medium Term Agriculture Development Plan for the period 2011–2015 (METASIP I) was termed “Support to Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture” (MoFA 2010). The program acknowledged urban and peri-urban agriculture as major contributors to national FS. Thus, the government of Ghana, unlike their counterparts in most African countries, viewed UA as important for FS and therefore sorts to promote it through an agricultural policy. However, it must be noted that the policy did not consider the interplay between agricultural production by urbanites in urban and rural spaces and urban household FS. In this sense, the policy did not contextualize UA in small and medium-sized cities (Ayerakwa 2017). It is worth noting that when the METASIP was revised in 2014, leading to the formulation of the METASIP II for the period 2014–2017, UA was mentioned only once in the entire policy document and was in relation to food safety, not an advocacy for promoting UA. This probably reflects a change in policy emphasis as pressure on urban lands continues to rise. It can be argued that the main concern of policy makers, practitioners, and urbanites within the context of increasing urbanization and rising urban poverty in Africa should be how UA as a livelihood activity contributes to poverty and food insecurity reduction rather than where the activity takes place per se. At the same time, however, the availability of land—the most important resource required for UA in Africa—could depend on proximity to peri-urban and rural areas. Yet, as observed by Abu Hatab et al. (2019b), the available UA literature has neglected interactions between urban and rural areas in urban food systems. For example, the UA literature has not considered the differential FS outcomes of food production by urbanites beyond urban and peri-urban boundaries. Another important research issue that remains unaddressed, which is directly related to the gap identified in the UA literature by Abu Hatab et al. (2019b), is whether the opportunity for agricultural production by urbanites in both urban and rural areas matter for the FS of urban households. Living in an urban area and yet producing food in rural areas could be an important way of overcoming the land constraint to agricultural production within built-up urban areas. Another gap in the literature relates to the paucity of knowledge on UA and FS in rapidly urbanizing secondary cities, which is partly due to the overconcentration of UA research on primary cities—Accra and Kumasi in the case of Ghana—although secondary cities tend to face the most pressing challenges and vulnerabilities to poverty and food insecurity (Battersby and Watson 2019). Zezza and Tasciotti (2010) also called for detailed and rigorous country-specific case studies to aid understanding of the precise magnitude and effects of UA. Based on the gaps in the literature outlined above, the main objective of this article is to examine urban households’ participation in agricultural production in both urban and rural areas and the implications for urban household FS. Addressing this objective contributes to the UA and FS literature in two major ways: first, by examining the household FS implications of food production by urbanites in both urban and rural areas rather than focusing on production in either urban or peri-urban spaces and second, we contribute by breaking away from the “large city” bias to provide evidence from the perspective of a small and a medium-sized city. By employing statistically representative samples of households in two of Ghana’s fastest growing urban areas—rather than a sample of UA participants as most studies have done (Poulsen et al.2015)—we provide further and better understanding of the association between the geography of urban households’ food provisioning arrangements and their FS. This approach is more relevant for unraveling important policy implications for UA, FS, and urban planning in general. The relevance of our approach could also be viewed within the context of increasing urbanization, which is associated with rising urban land values and thus makes the opportunity cost of putting such lands under agriculture prohibitively high. Such opportunity cost could be moderated by proximity to rural areas where pressure on land is lower, which is why it is important to differentiate between the FS effects of urban households’ engagement in agriculture in urban areas on the one hand and rural areas on the other. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The next section describes the methodology by first providing a contextual background that informed the sampling strategy within the cities. The “Methodology” section also provides and analytical framework, describes the key variables employed, and presents the empirical econometric models. The results from the analyses are presented and discussed in the fourth section; the final section concludes.",4

In this instance, the question should not be whether African governments ought to intervene but, instead, how African governments could provide stability to grain prices without disrupting the domestic grain market environment. This is the challenge for many African countries that are responding with short-term stabilization interventionsFootnote 2 by allowing state marketing parastatals to undertake the price stabilization job. This traditional method of price stabilization is counterintuitive by impeding private traders and could make prices even more unstable and unpredictable (Minot 2014). Hence, African governments need to find effective means of managing food price risks. African governments implemented a wide range of policy responses to cushion the impact of the 2007/2008 food crisis. The major policy responses included consumer support measures (safety net programs, reducing tariffs and domestic taxes, and releasing stocks) and trade and price control measures (export bans, price controls, and foreign exchange restrictions) (Demeke et al. 2009 and Demeke et al. 2014). However, most of these interventions were the result of panic and even worsened the situation in some African countries such as Malawi and Ethiopia (Jayne 2012). Minot (2011), in his comprehensive analysis, argued that African governments’ ‘fire-fighting’ and ill-advised policy interventions contributed more to the food price spikes of 2008, rather than the price shocks from international market did. Among trade policies, the major form of intervention comprises export bans. After the 2008 crisis period, Egypt, Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zimbabwe have imposed export bans. Zambia recently lifted its export ban on maize and maize products (Food and Agriculture Policy Decision Analysis Tool (FAPDA) 2017). Export bans can reduce domestic grain prices if export is profitable. However, there are diverging views on the impact of export bans on commodity market prices in Africa. Porteous (2012) and Chapoto and Jayne (2009) found no significant relationship between an export ban and domestic prices. The authors argue that in most African countries, export bans are implemented in response to soaring domestic grain prices. Unless the prices in other trading countries rise much faster, the higher domestic prices are likely to make exports unprofitable and the ban unnecessary. In contrast, Diao et al. (2013) found that the maize export ban in Tanzania reduced maize producer prices by 9 to 19%. The experiences of Malawi, Zambia and Kenya have indicated that imposing an export ban may create uncertainty in the grain market. In these countries, the government has been actively involved in large-scale maize imports in response to supply shortfalls. In some cases, this is accompanied by a ban on private grain trade. Even when the ban is lifted, the uncertainty arising from involvement of state trading enterprises in the grain market makes it difficult for traders to profitably import maize. This uncertainty in the grain market environment is expected to contribute to food price spikes (Dorosh et al. 2009 and Dorosh et al. 2016). The Ethiopian government has imposed an export ban on maize since 2008. From a food security perspective, the ban is expected to improve domestic maize consumption. However, the export ban may also create a disincentive for production if the domestic maize price decline below the export parity price. Since maize is a major food crop in Ethiopia, any price instability in the domestic maize market is expected to have an adverse effect on other tradable and non-tradable goods (Getnet 2009; Rashid 2011). Nevertheless, the export ban may also distort maize food availability and food security in the eastern Africa region. Maize is the major staple crop consumed and traded in the region. It is the second most-traded commodity,Footnote 3 next to sesame, in the east African cross-border area. Owing to low maize yields, recurrent wars, and drought, several eastern Africa countries have relied on cross-border maize trade to fill their shortfalls. For instance, countries such as South Sudan, Kenya, Rwanda, and Somalia rely on formal and informal cross-border trade to import maize. These regional maize demands have been mainly met by imports from Uganda and Tanzania (FEWS NET 2016). However, maize production in Tanzania and Uganda does not exceed 3.5 million metric tons and is not enough to supply the regional demand. For instance, South Sudan alone imported more than 500 thousand tons in 2013 (Dorosh et al. 2016). Furthermore, Tanzania has tightened up on maize exports to the region, depending on domestic harvest conditions. The Ethiopian maize market has the potential to supply affordable and quality white maize to eastern Africa countries. Several initiatives for maize exports to eastern Africa maize-deficit countries are being halted by the Ethiopian export ban. The World Food Program (WFP) initiative, the Purchase from Africans for Africans (PAA) programme, planned to procure maize from Ethiopian farmers for export to the rest of the eastern Africa countries (Nogales and Fonseca 2014). However, the frequent export ban has become the main roadblock to this initiative. In order to solve this pressing issue, the Ethiopian government has requested the agricultural advising agency, Agricultural Transformation Agency (ATA), to advice government as to whether to lift the export ban in case of good harvest seasons. This article has attempted to support the on-going policy discussions by providing evidence on the likely impact of production shocks on the white maize market in Ethiopia. Existing literature have examined the impact of production shocks on the Ethiopian agriculture at one point in time, which is inadequate to capture the effect of weather-induced shocks across time (Dercon and Krishnan 2000; Dercon 2004; Deressa and Hassan 2010; Porter 2012; Thiede 2014; Hill and Porter 2017). In this article, we simulate the dynamic impact of production shocks (a bumper harvest and drought shocks) on the maize market in Ethiopia. Additionally, we examine the impact of these shocks on the maize trade regime in Ethiopia. The impact of production shocks are evaluated by comparing the outlook period maize price during a normal harvest season with hypothetical parity prices for a bumper harvest and a drought season. These production shocks were introduced into the model in the 2017 outlook period. From a policy perspective, understanding the likely impact of weather-induced and good harvest shocks on the domestic maize market and on the regional maize trade patterns are critical to provide policy alternatives for the Ethiopian government to lift maize export bans and allow private sectors to export and import maize under different domestic maize harvest conditions. This will support rules-based state interventions in the domestic maize market and would reduce regional food insecurity by strengthening the ability of markets to provide access to affordable maize to poor households. Moreover, since Ethiopia has been a major recipient of food aid, food aid agencies would also benefit from a likely impact of weather-induced shocks on maize production, market price, consumption, and government stocks. This article is structured as follows. The “Data source and description” section describes price formation of a commodity and data sources. The “Concept of partial equilibrium modelling” and “Model structure” sections explain the analysis approaches. Findings of the study are discussed in section five. The “Conclusion and policy recommendations” section concludes and provides policy implications.",7

Evidence from a randomized field experiment in Rural Indonesia,December 2020,Ayu Pratiwi,Aya Suzuki,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"The majority of the world’s poor lives in rural areas and is engaged in subsistence agriculture (Bank 2007); hence, initiatives aimed to improve their well-beings are often geared toward improving agricultural practices as a means of increasing productivity, efficiency, and income (Parvan 2011; Mendola 2007). At the same time, environmental problems have been acknowledged as one of the fundamental factors causing low agricultural productivity for smallholders farming (Morton 2007), threatening the food security for the growing population (Godfray et al. 2010). Technological improvements in sustainable agriculture are found to drive advances in labor productivity (Minten and Barrett 2008), incomes (Hailu et al. 2014), food security (Vermeulen et al. 2012), and general economic growth (Sanders et al. 1996); however, technologies are often not adopted immediately and thoroughly in a population (Maertens and Barrett 2012). For the smallholders, pursuing the fastest route to improved productivity without compromising environmental integrity can be done via the implementation of the resource-conserving agricultural technologies (Fan et al. 2011). Agricultural training and formal extension serve as a means to overcome information-related barriers to technological adoption (Feder and Umali 1993; Hussain et al. 1994). While training has generally positive effects on adoption (Noltze et al. 2012; Sidibé 2005), what works best in practice can differ from what is taught as best practices in formal trainings, especially in remote villages when local contexts matter (Vasilaky 2012). In these cases, personal networks can play roles to disseminate the locally-appropriate information (Boahene et al. 1999; Lyon 2000; Katungi et al. 2008). When farmers test and localize the taught practices and ultimately create usable knowledge, that information can be transmitted via personal networks (Conley and Udry 2010; Munshi 2004). These interactions may induce social learning which, according to Mobius et al. (2015), consists of diffusion of information and aggregation of information into an individual’s correct knowledge or beliefs. The process of social learning may change farmers’ beliefs about the return of certain agricultural techniques, while at the same time teach them the practical knowledge to implement different technologies. However, social network research oftentimes comes with three shortcomings:
 Estimating the effects of social networks on technology adoption is not a straightforward process, as the reference points of knowledge, the direction of interaction, and the frequency of contacts would be a challenge to measure. Inferring causal social interaction effects from correlations in individuals’ behavior is challenging, thus the difficulty to isolate the specific knowledge being dispersed within the interaction. Individuals may interact and change behavior simultaneously, generating a “reflection problem,” which makes it difficult to separate endogenous from exogenous effects. These limitations result in having very few empirical studies that document how networks actually function to disseminate information, with notable exception in Banerjee et al. (2013) among others. Our paper tries to address these limitations through a randomized experiment which examines the effects of training location heterogeneity upon resource-conserving technology diffusion and adoption through the changes in various social network variables, taking a case of Indonesia. Training is administered to the half of the randomly selected sample of 312 farmers from 14 villages, and impact evaluation is carried out using one baseline and two post-program surveys. We estimate the effects of the training on agricultural technology, in particular soil and water conservation practice and grafting techniques, to the participants. We then decompose the effects of training into two steps, namely whether farmers actually know the technology and whether they consequently adopt and implement the technology.  For the first shortcoming, we categorized our sample farmers into several groups and gave information for certain groups so that the reference points of knowledge are clear. Further, we collected detailed information on interaction among farmers in our survey. The training is administered to the half of the randomly selected sample of 312 farmers using one baseline and two post-program surveys. The trainings were organized in three different geographic locations, namely (1) in their hometown, (2) in a different district but still the same island (hereafter, intra-island), and (3) in a different and more advanced island (hereafter, inter-island). We then identify to what extent social networks influence diffusion and adoption of technology of the participants and non-participants, by defining several reference groups: (i) among the participants in the same and different training location, (ii) between participants and extension services and peer-farmers, and (iii) between participants and non-participants. In this way, we can rigorously estimate the reference point of information, namely the participants trained in varying locations, and establish the direction of information sharing towards their various size and depth of social contacts upon returning from the training. Addressing the second limitation, training taught participants knowledge regarding sustainable practices, namely soil and water conservation practice and grafting techniques. As the knowledge taught at the training is specific, we may be able to isolate the particular knowledge being dispersed within the participants’ networks upon returning, while at the same time examine to what extent location effects matter. This way, apart from isolating the knowledge, we can also examine whether training location matters in diffusing the specific knowledge within participating farmers’ locality. And finally, for the third, we decompose the change of behavior into knowing the technology and consequently adopting it as dependent variables, to deal with the “reflection” problems. As training location assignment is randomized, we can infer that any behavior changes may be exogenously attributed to the location effects. To our knowledge, this is the first study ever conducted in incorporating training location effects that are exogenous, upon social learning with formal and informal networks, and the spillover to non-trained farmers that tend to be endogenous. We found that while training increased the probability of knowing conservation techniques by 15 percentage points, only inter-island participants improved the probability of adopting conservation techniques and the pooled grafting and conservation methods, both by 18 percentage points. Farmers trained in inter-island location are found to increase their size of social network with peer-farmers and non-training participants, and the frequency of contact with extension services. Thus, we can infer that the strengthened networks may activate social learning with peers and experts, which result in the adoption of standalone conservation methods and the pooled techniques. Positive information spillover from participants to the non-training participants is detected, though the effects are seemingly adversarial for adoption. The rest of the study is organized as follow: the “Conceptual framework” section describes the hypothesis, the “Agriculture Characteristics in Indonesia” section describes study sites, the “Methodology: data collection and estimation strategy” section presents the methodology comprise data collection and estimation strategy, the “ Estimation results ” section draws the estimation result, and the “Conclusion and discussion” section discusses the conclusion and policy implication.",7

Shively,Stein T. Holden,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Do food-for-work (FFW) programs improve diets or change production practices among participating households? The answer to this question is important because food-based transfer programs have become a standard tool for addressing the problem of chronic food insecurity in low-income settings (Alderman and Mustafa 2013). Food aid has evolved substantially from its origins in providing food surpluses for humanitarian needs to engaging donors from high-income nations in promoting food security, economic development, and social assistance and protection through a range of cash and in-kind transfers (Devereux, 2001; Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 2005; Adato and Hoddinott, 2008; Dercon, 2011). By engaging beneficiaries in community infrastructure projects in exchange for food or cash, food-for-work, and cash-for-work programs have become especially attractive to donors and recipients and recognized as potential vehicles for improving nutrition (Rogers and Coates 2002; Nair et al. 2016). In theory, such programs have the potential to expand dietary diversity, especially if the food items provided by the program are not otherwise part of the staple diet. Consumption of additional varieties of food items is also possible if distributions free up spending that otherwise would have been used to purchase food items provided by the program. By raising effective incomes, cash payments also have the potential to “crowd in” purchases of nutritionally important foods (Bailey 2013; Burchi et al. 2016; de Groot et al. 2017). However, if FFW participation requires a household to divert labor away from on-farm production, such programs have the potential to undermine production diversity by altering the basic crop mix, especially if labor is withdrawn from non-staple food production.Footnote 1 The net effect of these opposing forces is unclear and is the primary investigation in this paper. The geographic focus of this study is the Tigray Region, in northern Ethiopia, a country that has been a recipient of food assistance with FFW interventions for more than three decades. Historically, food aid provision in Ethiopia took the forms of free food and food-for-work, often in response to drought and subsequent food shortages (Jayne et al. 2001; Caeyers and Dercon 2012). As a result of chronic food insecurity, provision of long-term assistance to vulnerable rural households gradually became part of the food security program of the country. Since 2005, FFW programs in Ethiopia have been administered mainly as part of the country’s Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP), a larger and more comprehensive social protection program designed to reach more than five million chronically food-insecure individuals. Large proportions of beneficiaries receive food or cash transfers in exchange for work on public work projects. A smaller proportion (10–15%, mostly elderly or disabled individuals or pregnant women) receives unconditional transfers (Gilligan et al. 2008; Tigray Food Security Task Force 2009; Berhane et al., 2013). Hidrobo et al. (2018) review the implications of social protection for food security and asset formation. Rigorous empirical studies conducted in Latin America show potentially positive impacts from transfers. For example, Hoddinott and Wiesmann (2008) and Hoddinott and Skoufias (2004) report that beneficiaries of conditional cash transfers in Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua had higher diet quality and Hidrobo et al. (2014) report that cash, food, and voucher transfers improved both the quantity and quality of food consumption in Ecuador. The empirical record for Africa remains incomplete and mixed. Berlie (2014) argues that Ethiopia’s PSNP led to reduced dietary diversity, but Berhane et al. and Berhane et al. (2014) found no PSNP effect on caloric availability or dietary diversity. Using a dietary diversity score and a coping strategy index to classify households as either food secure or food insecure, Uraguchi (2011) found only a limited impact of emergency food aid or PSNP participation on food security. Gilligan and Hoddinott (2007) found a positive effect of emergency food aid on food consumption in the aftermath of Ethiopia’s 2002 drought, and Berhane et al. (2015) found a positive effect from a pilot program of social cash transfers on dietary diversity in the Tigray Region. Elsewhere in Africa, the Social Cash Transfer Programme pilot in Malawi, the Child Grant Program in Zambia, and the World Food Program’s food and cash transfer modalities in Mozambique were all associated with higher household dietary diversity (Miller et al. 2011; American Institutes for Research (AIR) 2013; Zhou and Hendriks 2017). Merttens et al. (2013) report that Kenya’s Hunger Safety Net Programme improved dietary diversity of the poorest households, but that the overall impact on the full set of program beneficiaries was limited. Several empirical investigations link food-for-work programs and food production (Abdulai et al. 2005; Gelan 2007; Bezu and Holden 2008). However, few studies examine the implications of food-for-work on diversity in food production, and those that do are mainly descriptive (e.g., World Food Program 2015; World Food Program 2017; World Food Program 2019). The lack of studies that empirically measure the connection between FFW programs and production diversity is somewhat surprising given that a major requirement of all such programs is that beneficiary households provide labor to local projects, in some cases diverting individuals from other productive activities. The studies that come closest to addressing the concerns of this paper, especially in the context of Ethiopia, have faced data limitations, in terms of both the types of data available and geographic coverage. Berlie (2014) focuses on one district in the Amhara Region and employs cross-sectional data. Uraguchi (2011) uses data from one district each in Amhara and Tigray to examine the effect of transfer projects on food security status before and after the PSNP, but was unable to estimate the direct effect of the PSNP on dietary diversity. To address this gap in the literature, this paper uses representative panel data from the Tigray Region and panel regression models to identify direct impacts on a dietary diversity indicator. Studies by Berhane et al. (2011), Berhane et al. (2013) and Berhane et al. (2014) use data from four major PSNP regions in Ethiopia to examine the implications of intensity of benefits from the PSNP, measured as the difference in receiving payments for 5 years and 1 year. The approach in this paper differs in that it uses a longer time series of data (starting in 2001 and extending through 2010) and examines the broader implications of participating in FFW programs. To further test the robustness of findings to alternative definitions of treatment, participation in FFW programs is first measured using a binary indicator and then using a continuous measure of treatment, based on total monetary payments a household received from public works participation. Overall, the current study makes two contributions. First, it provides new evidence for Ethiopia, making use of four waves of panel data including periods prior to the start of the PSNP. The use of long panel allows for the control for household fixed effects and pre-PSNP characteristics and thereby improves upon previous estimates of project impacts.

Tefera,Jos Bijman,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Smallholder agriculture remains important for economic development in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and produces about 80% of the food consumed in the region (FAO 2013b). In recent years, food systems in this region witnessed major changes and rapid structural transformation. The increase in urbanization, rising incomes, industrialization, a burgeoning middle class, and globalization have led to the emergence of modern supply chains, including modern food retail (Maertens and Swinnen 2012; Minten et al. 2016; Reardon et al. 2009; Verhofstadt and Maertens 2013). These developments have resulted in changes in the food production process, vertical coordination, and dominance of food processors (Swinnen and Maertens 2007). Increased vertical coordination and modernization in food systems present market opportunities for smallholders (Dries et al. 2009; McCullough et al. 2008; Verhofstadt and Maertens 2013). However, smallholder access to modern chains is limited due to several constraints. Smallholders are unable to comply with the stringent standards (safety, quality, and reliability) and technical requirements. They are often constrained by lack of access to improved technology, low bargaining power, and high transaction costs (Poulton et al. 2010). Contract farming has been presented as a possible solution to raising productivity and linking smallholders in the emerging modern chains (FAO 2013a). Many scholars have studied the increasing prevalence of contract farming arrangements (CFAs) in the dynamic food systems (Bellemare 2015; Minot and Sawyer 2016; Oya 2012; Wang et al. 2014b). Most of these studies claim that CFAs promote smallholder linkages to high-value markets and increase farm income. Yet, there is also evidence that participating in a CFA has a negative association with farm income (Michelson et al. 2012; Narayanan 2014; Wendimu et al. 2016). Most studies have focused on supply chains of high-value products (e.g., vegetables), traditional cash crops (e.g., coffee, tea, cocoa), and industrial commodities (e.g., cotton, palm oil, and rubber), mainly destined for international markets (Minot and Sawyer 2016; Otsuka et al. 2016). The empirical evidence on the impact of CFAs in domestic food systems is sparse, with the exception of Maertens and Vande Velde (2017). In this paper, we seek to fill the knowledge gap by exploring the impact of CFAs between foreign investors and smallholders on economic performance of malt barley farmers in Ethiopia. Understanding the effectiveness of CFAs in the emerging malt barley sector in Ethiopia is particularly relevant because the country aims at expanding the domestic malt barley production to cut the import bill and to increase smallholder commercialization. The paper also discusses how foreign direct investment in developing countries—in Africa in particular—affects modernization of domestic food systems. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the impact of CFAs on production, commercialization, and farmer income within a local food system. Specifically, we seek to address: (i) What factors determine farmers’ participation in malt barley CFAs? (ii) How do CFAs improve production, crop yield, product quality, and commercialization and prices in malt barley chains? (iii) How do CFAs improve malt barley farm income? The study is based on cross-sectional survey data and uses inverse probability-weighted regression adjustment (IPWRA) and propensity score matching (PSM) techniques to analyze the impact of CFAs. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a short review of the literature on CFAs in emerging economies. In the “Multinationals and CFAs in Ethiopian food systems” section, we present a brief account of the Ethiopian malt barley chain and describe the process of vertical coordination. The “Methodology” section describes the methodology. The “Empirical results” section presents the empirical results. The “Discussion” section discusses and puts the results into perspective. The “Conclusions” section concludes.",9

In Brazil, the dairy industry corresponds to 5.8% of the total value share in national agricultural GDP and 15% of animal production (IBGE 2017). It also generates around 4.7 million jobs. In 2017, 1.17 million farms produced 33.5 billion liters of milk, making it the fourth largest producer in the world. Since the early 1990s to the present, Brazilian dairy processing has been consolidating and undergoing a process of rapid restructuring and multi-nationalization. The rise of supermarkets and the deregulation of the dairy market that occurred in the early 1990s freed retail and farm prices, which brought a sharp increase in firm’s competition on price and cost cutting. This has led to the entrance of large multinational processors in the sector (Carvalho 2008; Chaddad and Jank 2006). National companies were slow to respond to this path of consolidation, mainly for political and management problems (Beber et al. 2018). Cooperatives and investor-owned firms (IOFs) adopted different strategies to adapt to this new context. However, the shutdown of dairy enterprises was inevitable, taking thousands of farmers along, causing irreparable damages to family farms. Sustaining the participation of these dairies with solid technological and economic performances, although challenging, is crucial for farmers and rural communities, even more so in developing and emerging economies (Nguyen et al. 2018). This is especially true in the case of cooperatives, which might pursue other objectives besides that of pure profit maximization (Franken and Cook 2013; Soboh et al. 2012). In several cases, the cooperatives’ objectives are, e.g., to maximize members’ benefits. They might also provide important social functions in rural areas as, e.g., collecting milk from remote farming locations (Magalhães 2007) or offering inputs at lower costs or feed and veterinary services. These actions considerably improve farmers’ profits and incomes (Chagwiza et al. 2016; Gupta and Roy 2012). While it is relatively easy for cooperatives to enter modern agri-food chains, it is challenging to sustain their participation by following the market requirements, especially for the traditional cooperatives (Berdegué 2001). This context shows evidences of low competitiveness of the processing companies, especially the cooperatives. In southern Brazil, such cooperatives also face a mix of difficult challenges: to reorganize the supply chain in their coverage area, to collect milk over long distances, to transfer technological and managerial improvements for farmers, and to have qualified human resources (Beber et al. 2019, 2018). Measuring companies’ efficiency levels and identify their determinants might offer important information for policy makers and managers to promote the resilience of production systems and rural communities. Based on this background, the main research-question here is which is the right legal set-up for dairy supply processing companies in developing and emerging economies? This paper aims to investigate and display the efficiency and productivity differences of such a typical institutional set-up in a way which reflects the different organizational forms, namely cooperatives vs IOFs. Therefore, this study adds to the firm-organization literature by defining the production frontier and estimating the technical efficiency (TE) levels of dairy processing companies. In summary, the literature is controversial in what concerns the efficiency of cooperatives and our study contributes with further insights into these debates. Therefore, in this study, we assess a set of determinants that, according to the literature, may have a significant impact on the (in)efficiency of dairy processing companies. First, we included “cooperatives” as a determinant of efficiency. Among the few empirical studies comparing the TE of dairy cooperatives and IOFs, we found different results showing that both cooperatives and IOFs can be more efficient depending on the context, the data used, and the objective of the performance measured. Beckmann (2000) suggests that dairy cooperatives perform less efficiently than IOFs due to their institutional form and their social functions in rural areas. Furesi et al. (2013) also showed a higher efficiency in favor of IOFs, but found no technological differences between sheep dairy processing cooperatives and IOFs and Sardinia, Italy. The studies of Porter and Scully (1987) and Ferrier and Porter (1991) corroborate, showing IOFs to be more efficient. Hirsch et al. (2020), in an analysis of the European dairy industry, also reveal that cooperatives are less efficient than IOFs and less flexible, possibly led by the different objectives of cooperatives (maximizing members’ profits). In this study, besides company age, the processing plant idleness was one of the main drivers of efficiency. Chaddad (2007a) showed that cooperatives usually add value only in the initial stages of the industrial process. Furthermore, and with few exceptions, agricultural cooperatives in developing countries are generally not well prepared to develop a competitive and efficient commercialization model (Ruiz-Guerra and Molina-Moreno 2014). This fact leads to an increased dependency on other companies to market the farmers’ production. Scarce capital for investments, and their organizational characteristics in general, usually slows down the development of such projects (Cook 1995). The organizational structure of the traditional cooperativesFootnote 1 has inherently “five vaguely defined property rights” (Cook 1995) that impact negatively on their organization and performance (Grashuis 2018). Furthermore, part of the literature also argues that internal transaction costs might decrease the efficiency of cooperatives. It may occur because their objectives and decision-making structures are not exclusively focused on profits and returns on assets, but rather on the interests of the members (Beckmann 2000; Hirsch and Hartmann 2014). Other authors suggest that cooperatives may be more efficient by having a more conservative financial structure. They argue that this can be important for dealing with crisis and changes of policies and for paying higher prices to farmers (Soboh et al. 2014) from one side. Form the other side, it may alleviate market imperfections and reduce transaction costs for farmers, for example (von Braun et al. 1989). Other factors making cooperatives succeed are also the homogeneity of member’s interests and low costs of ownership. This holds even in the absence of serious market imperfections that would make market contracting costly for the producers (Hansmann 1996). Singh et al. (2001) assessing processing plants in India also found cooperatives to be more efficient. The same outcome was found by Soboh et al. (2014) comparing the efficiency of European dairy processing firms. They found cooperatives to be slightly less efficient but having a more productive technology. Finally, Soboh et al. (2012) also used data from European dairy processing firms to show that cooperatives could either outperform their IOF counterparts or be outperformed by them, depending on the approach used to account for the cooperatives’ differential objectives. Studies using approaches other than stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) also found cooperatives to be at least as economically efficient as other potential forms of organization such as IOFs (Boyle 2004; Soboh et al. 2011). Soboh et al. (2011) also suggest that marketing cooperatives in the Irish dairy sector behave “as if” they were profit maximizing companies regarding the prices paid for the farmers’ milk. Following other empirical studies, we assume in our study that the cooperatives’ objective is to maximize a company’s profits, and we want to investigate which organizational form shows higher levels of efficiency based on the measured output. A composite measure of the cooperative performance including other objectivesFootnote 2 the cooperative might have, such as maximizing the members’ welfare, would rather offer a more precise indicator of their overall performance (Franken and Cook 2013) and should be considered in further studies. In our set of determinants of (in)efficiencies, we also included the type of inspection service adopted by the companies. With this, our intention is to verify whether the level of sanitary restrictions and the commercialization area have any impact on the efficiency levels. Just as with the sanitary aspects, the quality aspects of the milk processed by the dairies are also included. We use an indirect approach, controlling for the companies that have a program of payment based on quality premiums/penalties (and not just quantity). Finally, we also investigate the effects of the idle capacities on (in)efficiency. This paper contributes to the literature in three ways—first, we investigate TE in an intermediate step in the agri-food supply chain, while the vast majority of the literature focuses on farm-level analysis. Despite the importance of the milk processing industry for agribusiness in general, the literature investigating the TE of dairies is limited. Furthermore, among the few empirical studies comparing the TE of dairy cooperatives and IOFs, only a few of them have assessed the determinants of efficiency levels, such as that of Hirsch et al. (2020). Second, we use a unique own dataset of 243 companies with data collected at plant level. The few studies assessing TE at the same processing level use general data from national statistics databases where little or no information on management practices is available. Third, while most of the available studies on TE in the processing stage refer to developed countries—where data is more easily accessed—we conducted this analysis in an emerging economy. Data is often not available in developing and emerging countries because of the high participation share of the informal activities (Wilkinson and Rocha 2006), especially in the dairy sector (Revoredo-Giha and Renwick 2016) and the high costs of data collection. This study uses data from Paraná, southern Brazil, one of the most promising and dynamic dairy production areas in the worldFootnote 3. The socioeconomic and structural characteristics of this area make it an interesting case study for the assessment of attributes with potential to promote the agro-industrialization in developing and emerging economies. Consequently, the results contribute for the rural development of several countries in South America, North, South and South-East Asia, Western Europe, and Africa, where the dairy sector has an important participation on the agricultural income. The article is organized as follows: in the next sections, we present the study area with context of dairy processing companies in Brazil and how we propose to measure the efficiency of processing companies. The methodological framework employed and the Bayesian techniques used to estimate the model are shown in sequence, followed by a description of the data. Next, the principal results and the discussion are then presented. The article ends with some concluding remarks and policy implications.",5

More topical in recent times however is the limited access to land and poor tenure security attributable to increases in rural land commodificationFootnote 1 (Schoneveld et al. 2011; White et.al2013; Kansanga et al. 2018). While using theoretical conceptions of primitive accumulation (Marx 1961) and accumulation by dispossession (Harvey 2004), the critical literature on land grabbing is replete with recurrent cases of rural land dispossession, commodification and consequent livelihood implications. The recent focus on land grabbing has shifted attention away from equally consequential rural land contestations arising from traditional mechanisms of crop and livestock production. Specifically, rural land demands have been influenced by the heightened demand for pasture by pastoralists who migrate towards hitherto uncharted parts of the forest and coastal zones of Sub-Saharan Africa in search of water and pasture (Tonah 2002a; Tonah 2006). The migratory herding patterns of pastoralist tribes including the West African Fulani and East African Masai, coupled with land-grabbing effects (see Schoneveld et al. 2011; Scoones et al. 2013; White et.al 2013; Boamah 2014b; Kansanga et al. 2018), increases in cattle herds and persistent reductions in vegetation cover in the arid and semi-arid regions has forced many herders to seek alternative grazing lands in the vegetal-rich forest and transition zones of Sub-Saharan Africa (Boonzaier 1987; Bonfiglioli 1992; Bonfiglioli 1993; Bennett et al. 2013). The consequent pressure on land and water resources in the transition and forest zones of Sub-Saharan Africa has led to increased competition among traditional user groups—farmers on one hand and herders on the other—and poses challenges to customary land tenureFootnote 2 security. Cotula et al. (2006) posit that smallholder farmers’ customary land rights, defined by their indigeneity to the land-holding community, are especially threatened by increased competition and demand for land by pastoralists. Continuous land contestations create tenuous relations among competing use groups; degenerating into conflicts (Turner 2004). For example, competing use rights to land has historically degenerated into conflicts in parts of northern Nigeria, Mali, Chad, Ghana and between the Nuer and Dinka ethnic groups in South Sudan (see Bennett 1991; Blench 1996; Blench 2004; Turner 2004; Benjaminsen et al. 2009; Abubakari and Longi 2014). Competitions over land between farmers and herders brings into focus debates on market and non-market-based customary tenure. Primarily, customary land tenure is non-market based hence ownership is secured through conquest, occupation, usufructuary access, inheritance, customary gifts and customary licenses (Lambrecht and Asare 2016). The non-market customary tenure system has been praised for its advantage of securing tenure verified by communal knowledge of asset use, occupation, ownership and distribution (Kasanga and Kotey 2001). It is further lauded for its egalitarian quality and comparative capacity to efficiently distribute land resources to all segments of land users (Juul and Lund 2002). In contrast, the introduction of formal and informal market systems within customary tenure is underscored by monetary considerations; a phenomenon described by Goldstein and Udry (2008) as “the monetization of customary land tenure”. Commodification of customary tenure through market processes encourages the individualisation and consequent privatisation of land rights (Besley 1995; Chimhowu 2019); a development which is in sharp contrast to the definitive communal characteristics of customary land ownership. In Ghana, the dual operationalisation of market and non-market tenure domains in customary land allocation increases competition, creates overlapping land use rights and encourages tenure insecurity. Notably, the dynamics of a hitherto non-market spatiotemporal land tenure among pastoralists is changing to accommodate market-based leasehold rights for purposes of creating livestock pasture reserves to support dry season grazing (Tonah 2002b; Tonah 2006). This practice has created discontent among usufruct farmers primarily because traditional authorities do not seek prior community consent when demarcating land for use by pastoralists (Kuusaana and Bukari 2015; Kuusaana 2018). Thus, the once complementary use rights between farmers and herders, characterised by livestock grazing on crop remnants after the planting season, have degenerated from a state of symbiosis to one of discord (Tonah 2005; Kuusaana and Bukari 2015). In Agogo, a community located in the central plains of Ghana, the contestations between farmers and herders stem from use right ambiguities between usufruct farmers whose ownership and use entitlements to customary lands are embedded in non-market claims of indigeneity and pastoralists whose claims are grounded in market-based tenurial rights (usually long-term leases). The question of whose land rights supersede the other in such parallel tenure domains remains unanswered. This degenerates into tenure insecurity and contestations for survival by either group. Despite the inherent fluidity and dynamism of customary land tenure systems in adjusting periodically to changing trends (Berry 1993; Berry 2009), it has been unable to efficiently solve land tenure insecurity problems. It has especially failed in reconciling the multiple and overlapping rights over land between smallholder crop farmers and agro-pastoralists. With over 80% of Ghana’s land area administered under customary land tenure arrangements, (Kasanga and Kotey 2001) and 40.65% of the population engaged in agriculture (World Bank 2019), farmer-herder conflicts and associated threats to land tenure security may compromise the livelihoods of smallholder farmers (Bennett 1991; Tonah 2002a; Benjaminsen et al. 2009), discourage farmland investment and reduce agricultural productivity (Besley 1995; Cotula et al. 2006; Cotula and Vermeulen 2009). This paper investigates how tenure insecurity arising from competing claims over land between farmers and herders affects farmer’s farmland investments and patterns of production in the Agogo Traditional Area (ATA). Issues of customary land commodification, livelihood contestation and farmer’s coping strategies are explored further in relation to spatiotemporal causes of tenure insecurity. The contribution of this paper lies in the research gap on perceived tenure insecurity created as a periodic phenomenon (3–4 months per annum) due to high in-migration of herders and the investment decisions farmers make in the light of such periodic experiences of tenure insecurity. The study becomes more relevant as the government of Ghana in 2019, after several failed militarisation attempts to flush-out pastoralists from Agogo, is considering policy initiatives to create dedicated cattle routes, ranches and grazing zones to accommodate registered pastoralists in the unoccupied and uncultivated plains of Agogo. This paper is structured in five sections. The first section presents the contextual background; the “Land tenure and administration in Ghana” section focuses on literature review of customary land tenure, land tenure security, pastoralism and farmer-herder conflicts in Ghana; the “Theoretical aspects” section presents the theoretical framework to guide the analytical focus of this paper; “Methodological considerations” section describes the methodological aspects of the study including data collection, data analysis and contextualisation of the case study area; the “Results and discussions” section discusses relevant findings and draws conclusions.",10

Evidence from Southwestern Ethiopian smallholder coffee producers,December 2021,Muhammed Abdella Usman,Daniel Callo-Concha,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Food insecurity and undernutrition rates are high in many Sub-Saharan African countries (UNDP 2012). In addition to compromising wellbeing, undernourishment in early life impairs proper cognitive and physical development, which affects later health outcomes, school performance, and labor productivity in adulthood (Alderman et al. 2006; Glewwe et al. 2001). Globally, around 815 million people were estimated to be chronically undernourished in 2016 (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO 2017). In Ethiopia, about 38% of children younger than 5 years have stunted growth, defined as low height for age (CSA and ICF International 2017), which indicates chronic malnutrition. Agricultural production remains the main source of livelihood for many rural households, and this industry employs over 60% of the labor force in Sub-Saharan Africa (Thornton et al. 2011). The link between agriculture and security of food and nutrition is, at first sight, straightforward. Paradoxically, most of the poor and undernourished people live in smallholder households, defined as small farms operating within a small-scale model of agriculture (Ogutu et al. 2020). Cultivating diverse crops and raising livestock has a positive dietary effect on the supply of micronutrients to smallholder households. Nevertheless, the empirical evidence that links agriculture and nutrition outcome appears weak (Webb and Kennedy 2014). The growth in agricultural productivity has done little to improve food and nutrition security of farming households because gains in productivity are mainly from the production of staple foods, such as rice, wheat, and maize, which are crops that provide only a scarce amount of vitamins and minerals (UNDP 2012). Food and nutrition security are influenced not only by the quantity of available food but also by its diversity. As a result, access to healthy, diverse, and affordable food is central to household food security (Ruel et al. 2017). Furthermore, most smallholders sell their staples and buy food items from local markets. Subsequently, identifying and understanding the interactions between agriculture and nutrition is far more complicated than may be assumed. Smallholders need more than increasing agricultural productivity to ensure a sustained supply of diverse foods and to safeguard their food and nutrition security. Increasing on-farm production diversity is positively associated with greater diversity in household food consumption (e.g., Bellon et al. 2016; Chegere and Stage 2020; Islam et al. 2018; Jones et al. 2014; Muthini et al. 2020; Sibhatu et al. 2015; Singh et al. 2020; Usman and Haile 2019). However, this type of production may not happen if farming income from specialized production outweighs the gains from farming diversification (Sibhatu et al. 2015). Smallholders face several constraints that prevent them from expanding and diversifying their production beyond the subsistence level. In Ethiopia, most smallholders are located in remote areas; therefore, they are poorly connected to local markets, which results in high transaction costs in terms of buying and selling agricultural products and other goods (Stifel and Minten 2017). Smallholders are also poorly linked to markets because of a lack of information, low production, and low farm-gate prices—prices received by farmers for their produce at the location of a farm (Wiggins and Keats 2013). All these conditions are concomitant in Ethiopia. Agroforestry is the dominant farming system in southwestern Ethiopia. Farmers produce a variety of food crops, fruits, and vegetables as well as shrubs and trees—some of high value—on the same piece of land (Jemal et al. 2018). Agroforestry systems can be a source of micronutrients and contribute to diversifying household food consumption (Jemal et al. 2018); however, the farming system is dominated by a few high-value cash crops, such as coffee (Coffea arabica) and khat (Catha edulis). This focus may affect own-food crop production because more agricultural resources are freed from staple food production to be used more efficiently for producing cash crops. In turn, smallholder households become less self-sufficient and more dependent on markets. Markets offer more diverse foods than any given household can produce (Bellon et al. 2016). Markets also determine the price for agricultural produce and the farmer’s revenue, which affects the household consumption expenditures (Stifel and Minten 2017). Previous research showed that smallholders generating income from cash crops spend more money on foods of better quantity (Negash and Swinnen 2013; Pierre-Louis et al. 2007). For example, Negash and Swinnen (2013) found a positive relationship between household food caloric intake and the production of castor beans (Ricinus communis), a species used for biofuel in Ethiopia. In contrast, a study in Vietnam by Janssen (2018) reported that commercialized households spend a larger share of their incomes on non-food items than on food. Taken together, these findings suggest that the effects of income from cash crops on the food access for a smallholder household can be either positive or neutral, depending on the local context. In this setting, this study aims to understand the extent to which market access contributes to the dietary diversity and food security of smallholder households in the Yayu area of southwestern Ethiopia. To measure food security, the study used the Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS) as a proxy for diet quality and the Household Food Insecurity Access Scale (HFIAS) score as proxies for both the behavioral and psychological aspects of insecure food access for the household. The article is structured as follows: “Market access, household dietary diversity and food security” section addresses the links between market access and household consumption and food security. “Materials and methods” section presents the data sampled and the statistical methods for analysis. “Results and discussion” section provides the descriptive and the multivariate regression results and discusses the findings. “Conclusions” section concludes with the implications of the study findings and ad hoc suggestions.",23

(2010), agriculture has had less impact on most African economies compared to many Asian economies, leading to the debate on the role of agriculture in African development. Whichever direction the debate is directed, the widespread poverty in Africa can be linked to the performance of the agricultural sector. In Ghana specifically, the agricultural sector is essential for the socioeconomic development of the country through employment generation and contribution to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP). However, the global drive to attaining zero hunger can be interrupted by climate change (Wheeler and Braun, 2013). Already, there is substantial evidence that temperature levels have increased while rainfall in the tropics have decreased over the years with associated negative impacts (WMO, 2018). In agrarian communities, these negative effects of climate change are noticed in reduction in yields, increase in food prices, land use changes, increase pest infestations, and difficulty in farm management (Lungarska & Chakir, 2018; Mu et al., 2017). Dinko (2017) and Wheeler and Braun (2013) expressed that all four food security pillars (food availability, accessibility, utilization, and stability) are under threat due to climate change. As a result, climate change and its induced stresses are putting more pressure on the ability to provide a food-secured society (de Gennaro and Forleo, 2019). The effect of climate change on economies is not universal but depends on the economic characteristics of each country. Climate change has high risks to areas that are already vulnerable to hunger and undernourishment (Wheeler and Braun, 2013) and where agriculture is the backbone of their economy (Abdul-Razak & Kruse, 2017). Ghana’s high dependence on rainfed agriculture increases its vulnerability to the impacts of climate change and variability (Dinko, 2017). Already, Ghana’s crop production is below its potential yields due to factors such as deteriorating soil conditions. Thathsarani and Gunaratne (2018) argued that poor households with low resources are riskier to climate change irrespective of their location. It is thus clear that Ghana’s food security status is dependent on the climate (Dinko, 2017; Issahaku and Maharjan, 2014). Current evidence shows the presence of climate shocks such as droughts and floods that affect farmlands across the country. These climate shocks have made households and communities in Ghana food insecure, reduces their social safety and resilience (Akudugu and Alhassan, 2012). In order to minimize the impacts of climate change, farmers engage in the adoption of several adaptation strategies. Investing in these climate adaptation strategies to obtain climate-smart food systems is required to enhance food security amidst climate change (Wheeler & Braun, 2013) Climate adaptation involves the processes and actions of an agent such as households to cope, manage, or adjust to a changing climatic condition (Smit and Wandel, 2006). This requires adjustments of the agent to respond to actual or expected changes or enhance the resilience of the agent to climate change. As such, climate adaptation is a manifestation of the adaptive capacity of the system to climate change (Smit and Wandel, 2006)—the higher the adaptive capacity, the higher the adaptation. There is generally an increasing body of literature on climate adaptation. These climate adaptation studies on farming households have focused on exploring the adaptation strategies adopted by the farmers (Assan et al., 2018; Phuong et al., 2017; Denkyirah et al., 2017; Limantol et al., 2016; Knox et al., 2015; Tessema et al., 2013), the determinants of climate adaptation (Alhassan et al., 2019; Akrofi-Atitianti et al., 2018; Khanal et al., 2018a; Denkyirah et al., 2017; Niles et al., 2016; Tessema et al., 2013), and the impacts of climate adaptation on farm and livelihood outcomes (Martins et al., 2019; Khanal et al., 2018a; Abid et al., 2016; Issahaku and Maharjan, 2014). Others indicated that to minimize climate vulnerability, adaptation is required (Akudugu & Alhassan, 2012). There are also studies to suggest the spillover effects of adaptation since adaptation or maladaptation may create unintended outcomes such as redistribution of risks and vulnerability (Atteridge and Remling, 2018). Notwithstanding the increasing research on adaptation, an important gap in the literature on the impacts of climate adaptation on crop production is the failure to incorporate the concept of efficiency into the analysis of climate adaptation. Instead, a large body of the existing studies has either deliberately or unintentionally assumed that climate adaptation affects observed farm outputs and not the efficiency of production. For instance, Khanal et al. (2018b) and Roco et al. (2017) examined the impact of climate adaptation on technical efficiency but assumed that climate adaptation only affects the position of the production frontier and not the position of the farmers on or beneath the frontier. This predefined assumption without test may be misleading. Therefore, this present study slightly differs from these previous studies by integrating the concept of efficiency analysis into the estimation of the stochastic production function of farmers. The advantage of this is that the research is able to isolate the effects of climate adaptation on the position of the farmers on or beneath the production frontier (the observed output) as well as the effects on the position of the production frontier. This is important because the agriculture sector needs to minimize its impacts on the environment while adapting to the environmental changes (Gennaro and Forleo, 2019). Primarily, therefore, the objective of this study is to analyze the effects of climate adaptation strategies such as conservative agriculture (CA), integrated soil fertility management (ISFM), integrated pest management (IPM), and changing planting dates on technical efficiency of maize production.",14

Also, in Switzerland, there is a long-lasting and vivid public debate about milk prices, especially at the producer level, with strong opinions about “fair” or “unfair” milk prices (e.g., Cornall 2017). Lately, Swiss dairy market organizations and agricultural consultants have given some attention to how more value can be retained by producers (SBV 2013; Reviron et al. 2017). Yet, the relationships between prices at different stages of the dairy and cheese value chains have not yet been analyzed systematically and quantified. Therefore, this study analyzes vertical price transmission in the Swiss milk market. For other countries, numerous studies have examined the price relationships in different milk and dairy markets. Table 1 provides an overview of existing studies dealing with vertical milk price transmission.Footnote 1 More than 60% of these 22 studies focus exclusively on farm gate and retail prices; the remaining also include wholesale or processor levels, but only two studies include the three stages (farm gate, processing/wholesale, and retail) (Jaffry and Grigoryev 2011; Kharin et al. 2017). While the specific focus differs among these studies, the majority finds long-run price transmission elasticities with positive asymmetries in the long- and/or short-run. This implies that price increases are passed on at a greater magnitude/speed than price decreases. Only one study finds no vertical long-run relationship (Kharin 2015); this is for Russian farm and retail milk prices. Also, the findings regarding the direction of price transmission are consistent across most case studies, which find that prices are passed on downstream, that is, either from producer or wholesale to retail prices. This is in line with the concept of mark-up pricing (Tirole 1988). Only Bakucz et al. (2012) find that in Poland, retail price changes cause farm-gate price changes.
 Despite the large number of case studies available, we want to add another one for Switzerland for the following reasons. First, highly detailed price data are available. We are able to include four value chain levels: farm gate, wholesale, export, and retail prices. These data are available for a large number of products, including cheese, dairy, and organic products at the retail level and corresponding producer prices, separated by processing use, at the farm-gate level. Hence, we are able to analyze and compare price transmission along different value chains in the dairy, cheese, and organic sector. A second reason is that in Switzerland, those chains are strictly separated and differ in terms of industry concentration, value chain governance, and product characteristics. This allows us to derive insights on the reasons for different magnitude, speed, and (a)symmetry of price transmission.",3

Holden,Frode Alfnes,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Adoption of improved agricultural technologies is an important means of adapting to climate change, improving agricultural productivity, and facilitate the transition from subsistence agriculture to market-oriented agriculture (Bezu et al. 2014; De Janvry and Sadoulet 2002; Mendola 2007; Minten and Barrett 2005; Yu et al. 2011; Zilberman et al. 2012). Among the technologies adopted by farmers in the Ethiopian highlands are improved wheat, drought-tolerant teff, and cash crops (Belay et al. 2006; Shiferaw et al. 2014; Wale and Chianu 2015). In this paper, we investigate to what extent farmers in the semiarid Tigray region of Ethiopia have adopted improved wheat, drought-tolerant teff, and cash crops and which factors explains the adoption and intensity of adoption. Technology diffusion often takes years and can best be captured using panel data. However, most studies on the adoption of improved wheat in semiarid agriculture in Ethiopia use cross-sectional data (Kelemu 2017; Kotu et al. 2000; Lobell et al. 2005; Matuschke et al. 2007; Shiferaw et al. 2014; Tesfaye et al. 2016). One of the few studies including a time dimension is Abera’s (2008), which used cross-section household data from 2001 with recall data back to 1997 and estimated factors affecting adoption of improved wheat in northern and west Shewa zones of Ethiopia. He analyzed how farmer and farm characteristics are correlated with adoption and intensity of adoption, but does not cover important supply-side constraints that need attention. Studies of drought-tolerant teff in Ethiopia include Wale and Chianu (2015) and Belay et al. (2006). Wale and Chianu (2015) examined farmers’ demand for drought-tolerant teff using cross-sectional data. The study of Belay et al. (2006) used data from an experiment on village demonstration plots, including 41 farmers in 2002 and 2003, and found that farmers adopt drought-tolerant teff varieties when there is limited rainfall. To the best of our knowledge, empirical studies of the adoption of drought-tolerant teff using rich panel data from semiarid agriculture are missing. Adoption of cash crops is mainly associated with access to irrigation and has a dual advantage. First, irrigation and adoption of cash crops typically allow the smallholders to harvest more than one time per year, which lead to improved land productivity. Second, the adoption of cash crops leads to improved output market integration and increased income. Ethiopia has adopted smallholders’ commercialization as part of its economic transformation strategy (Gebremedhin et al. 2009). The development of irrigation reduces the production risk in semiarid areas and expansion of public investments in infrastructures improve market access. This has improved agricultural productivity and enhanced market participation by Ethiopian smallholders (Gebregziabher et al. 2009; Hailua et al. 2015). The main contribution of this study is threefold: first, we provide new insight into the development in the adoption of the three improved agricultural technologies improved wheat, drought-tolerant teff, and cash crops in Tigray, Ethiopia. Second, we provide new insight into factors affecting the likelihood of adoption and intensity of adoption for these improved agricultural technologies. Third, we discuss policy implications for how to best integrate and reap the benefits from the promotion of improved wheat, drought-tolerant teff and cash crops, given their importance for food productivity, food security, and market integration.",5

9.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,05 April 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-021-00180-w,Commoning of territorial heritage and tools of participated sustainability for the production and enhancement of agro-environmental public goods,December 2021,G. Fabiola Safonte,Claudio Bellia,Pietro Columba,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"Over the last decade, at the national level, there has been a proliferation of multiple experiences of commoning, that is, forms of self-government (Magnaghi 2007, 2012) of the territorial heritage as a common good, a strategic result of the reconstruction of local development projects, through initiatives capable to activate governance processes for the implementation of participatory sustainability tools in favor of the environment and the protection of natural resources and of mitigation and adaptation to climate change. These experiences have unfolded in the form of practices, behaviors, and initiatives both on the part of the productive structure and on the part of groups of citizens, who often do not know each other (Huron 2015), and are united by a narrative of renewed link between community and territory from the strongly spatial character, since the action of putting in common manifests itself in precise and concrete spaces. To reflect on the spatiality of these practices is particularly relevant in the Italian context, characterized by the emergence of numerous initiatives that have adopted the language of the commons just after the outbreak of the economic crisis, and the adoption of strict austerity policies combined the intensification of processes of neoliberalization of public policies. In this context, a set of policy actions operate at the European level in the direction of consolidating environmental and climate performance. These include the Rural Development Policy, which offers a diversified range of incentives to encourage investment in rural areas, capable of favoring the supply of common goods (Hardin 2009), that are the class of goods used by several individuals, with respect to which there are difficulty of exclusion and whose “consumption” by an actor reduces the possibility of use by others (Ostrom et al. 2002); they are characterized by the absence of property rights in private terms and can give rise, under certain conditions, to phenomena of exhaustion of availability (Tietenberg et al. 2006). The interdisciplinary debate, especially of Anglo-Saxon origin, refers to the relational nature of resources, so as not to “fix” these assets to specific entities. And thus, we witness the passage from the noun (common) to the verb (commoning) which calls in itself the dimension not of existing things, but of processes, of actions. Attention is therefore shifted from ontology, which defines what common goods are “in themselves,” in their essence, or in their perimeter, to the relative “performativity,” thus indicating the consistency in the practices that make them exist (Caleo 2016, 13-14). The theme of common goods is closely linked to that of the multi-functionality of agriculture—related to the problems of market failure—and of the instruments of public intervention in support of the social functions recognized to the primary sector. According to the definition given by the OECD, multifunctionality is often used to describe how agriculture can produce several non-commodity outputs in addition to agrifood products, associating it with the specificity of the agricultural production process (OECD 2001). In fact, it is able to produce a complex set of goods, some of which (non-commodity outputs) are able to determine social benefits (maintaining the landscape, safeguarding biodiversity, preventing environmental risks, preserving cultural heritage, rural development, food safety, and animal welfare) being characterized by an obvious positive anthropic value. On the other hand, commodity outputs refer to the satisfaction of material needs and determine negative externalities (in the case of forms, for example, of pollution and depletion of natural resources); this one is a strong motivation that pushes the EU to continue to advocate, both internally and in international relations, the choice of financial support for primary activities. The purpose of this paper is to analyze how the commoning processes of the local heritage find application for the production of agro-environmental public goods in contexts of high socio-economic marginality (Gurung and Kollmair 2005; Déry et al. 2012) and environmental vulnerability, characterized by abandonment and from the consumption of agricultural land for food use (Benayas et al. 2007; Renwick et al. 2013). The purpose is to understand how these processes are able to influence, at local level, the governance processes for the implementation of environmental protection strategies. The institutional approach to the production of public goods (Hagedorn 2008) theorizes that collective goods and services are produced or managed through specific organizational methods. These modalities are determined by the local governance system and by the relational dynamics among the different subjects that act within a territorial system, since public intervention must take into account, in addition to accounting for externalities in the absence of a market price, also the social and cultural dimension of public goods associated with productive activities through innovative forms of intervention. The latter must be addressed not to individual economic actors, but to a network of subjects, so as to make the intervention more effective, more aimed at the needs of local communities, and above all, lasting over time. According to these studies, the role of agriculture and rural activities is analyzed in relation not only to the choice of policy instruments and forms of regulation adequate to guarantee a certain level of disbursement, but rather to the different organizational and coordination solutions of the institutional and social context of the structure of a territory capable of influencing the functioning of a policy action, explaining its efficiency and, above all, its effectiveness in achieving the pre-established objectives. In this context, a crucial role is played by collective actions (Ostrom 2000) that are “the actions that a group of people (directly or through an organization) undertake to achieve common perceived interests” (Scott and Marshall 2009), or “a set of action taken by group of farmers, often in conjunction with other people or organizations, acting together in order to tackle local agro-environmental issues” (OECD 2013). Their determinants rely on the characteristics (a) of the local system (Agrawal 2001; Pretty 2003; Vanni 2014), (b) of the group of actors involved (Ostrom 2006; Mantino 2010), and (c) of the institutional organization and the external environment (Mills et al. 2011) and find fulfillment on the model of agro-ecological production, on the territorial heritage, and on the paths of innovation that can contribute to rebuilding the socio-ecological systems, through the attribution of an ecological value to small-scale forms of agriculture. Several studies have shown that collective actions can be characterized by (a) higher productivity in the medium to long term (Badgley et al. 2007); (b) greater efficiency in the use of resources, including environmental resources (Reganold and Wachter 2016; Frison 2016, IPES-Food 2016; Rodale Institute 2015); (c) lower levels of final consumption (Rudel et al. 2009; Lambin and Meyfroidt 2011) and waste (Kneafsey et al. 2013; Forssell and Lankoski 2015) compared to those of agro-industrial production models; (d) greater temporal stability of production (Herrero et al. 2017), providing high and diversified quantities and qualities of nutrients for food (EPRS 2016); and (e) better planning and greater coordination between production and consumption and greater control of technical and commercial constraints and fair and shared determination of the final price of food (Forssell and Lankoski 2015; Nevens et al. 2017; Opitz et al., 2017). The framework for the analysis of collective actions in the supply of agro-environmental public goods recently proposed by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (OECD 2013; Jones et al. 2015) allows to explore the key factors of success, as well as the barriers to overcome to produce goods and services of common interest through shared strategies at territorial level (Fig. 1).
 Benefits, barriers, and key factors of collective actions. Source: OECD 2013 In order to verify the research hypothesis, we used a two-phase research methodology—based on the analysis of certain dimensions of the territorial capital (Camagni 2010; Capello et al. 2011; Fratesi and Perucca 2018; Fratesi and Perucca 2019)—applied to a rural and inner area of central Sicily. In literature, territorial capital is understood as: “the system of territorial assets of an economic, cultural, social and environmental nature that guarantees the potential for developing places” (Perucca 2014: 537); “(The stock of) specific territorial aspects” (Ventura etal., 2008); “(a set of) localized resources” (Zonneveld and Waterhout 2010); “geographically and locally limited services and conditions” (Capello et al., 2011); “attraction factors” (ESPON 2012) and “local structural elements” (Martinoia 2014). All previous interpretations draw attention to the fact that territorial assets should be exploited and actively used in order to promote territorial development and guarantee territorial competitiveness. According to Camagni, the territorial capital includes the differentiated set of territorial resources, localized natural and artificial factors and assets, of a public, private, or “common” nature, tangible or intangible, productive or human, cognitive, relational and social that contribute to the creation of the distinctive and unique elements on which the competitive potential of a territory depends. Such a “capital” is present with differentiated quality in all places where there is a human community (Camagni 2009, 2016, 2018). According to Zonneveld and Waterhout (2010), it is a portfolio of territorial resources to be actively used to improve the added value of economic units and strengthen territorial competitiveness that depends on the characteristics and models of the economy and society that insists on the territory, as well as on the quality of natural and man-made environment. It refers to the unity of local resources (endogenous), which differ in their extent, composition, and convenience among territorial units. The concept of territorial capital was used to verify development problems through various case studies that attempt to measure the allocation of territorial capital at different scales, covering a varied range of objectives. The first empirical investigations, both qualitative and quantitative, were conducted mainly by Italian scholars (Barzotto et al. 2016; Perucca 2014; Pompili and Martinoia 2015) and focus on the following:
 The explanation of the differentiated growth rates of the Italian provinces with respect to their regions and, in a comparative perspective between regions, to temporarily compare the endowment and to measure the impact of the economic crisis on the structural components of the socio-economic reality (Brasili 2012, 2014; Brasili et al. 2012; Perucca 2014); The analysis of the specificities and the differentiation of the conditions of particular territorial divisions, in Northern Italy (Camagni and Dotti 2010) or in the provinces of central and southern Italy (Mazzola et al. 2014, 2018) or at the level of European (Fratesi and Perucca 2018), or between the regions of the Latin arch (Affuso and Camagni 2010); The analysis of the relationship between territorial capital, cohesion, and economic growth policies at macro-regional level, concerning the countries of Central and Eastern Europe (Fratesi and Perucca 2014) or the NUTS 2 (Nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques) regions of the European Union (Camagni and Capello 2013; Capello et al. 2011); the analysis of the role of territorial capital, and in particular of intangible assets such as natural and cultural capital, in regional growth processes and in local response processes to exogenous crises (Pompili and Martinoia 2011). In order to analyze how the commoning heritage processes find application for the production of agro-environmental public goods, we have decided to investigate a rural and internal area of central Sicily, falling within the territory of the province of Caltanissetta. The area under investigation is characterized by a context of high socio-economic marginality (Gurung and Kollmair 2005; Déry et al. 2012) and environmental vulnerability, and moreover by abandonment and consumption of agricultural land. This area is characterized by structural disadvantages mainly due to peripherality, low accessibility indices, depopulation, and rarefaction of essential services for the person. Furthermore, the area must be considered as having a high environmental vulnerability (ISPRA 2017), which determines the exposure to risks for people and for the assets due to the inadequate insertion of the population in a delicate biophysical environment (Cullen and Pretes 2000; Gurung and Kollmair 2005). Analyzing the territorial issues related to the environment and landscape aspects, it is necessary to highlight the obvious transformations of the landscape, caused by rural depopulation (Table 1) and abandonment of agricultural practice.
 From the analysis of Table 2, we can observe how the variation of the agricultural surface is substantial, touching, in the period from 1982 to 2010, peaks of − 67% while the decrease in the number of employees in the sector is really alarming, with the exception of the paradisiacal situation which is found in the municipality of Riesi (+800%), linked to the development of the wine sector.
 In particular, in central Sicily, rural and inner areas have been victims of a long and progressive process of marginalization and abandonment in favor of urban areas and a process of weakening personal services since the second half of the last century. Inexorably struck by “territorial drifts,” the main effects of which were depopulation, emigration, social and productive rarefaction, land abandonment, and landscape changes; internal Sicily was the sacrificial victim of economic development and suffered negative effects also on the environmental level: from hydrogeological vulnerability to landscape transformations, from uncontrolled re-naturalization to the loss of anthropic values. However, the territory under study summarizes in itself a wide range of characteristics of historical and cultural specificity that make it a laboratory of extraordinary interest. It is endowed with a substantial historical-monumental cultural heritage composed of medieval and baroque historical villages and a relevant system of fortified architecture and archeological areas, an ecclesiastical and artistic heritage, valuable naturalistic environmental heritage as well as being strongly characterized by the presence of a historical memory, not always shared, based on the peasant tradition and that of the sulfur.",5

In modern society, the consumer is ever more curious and conscious, especially about the agri-food sector, and the provided information plays a key role in his choices; it is important to find the right balance between economic interests and marketing, profit and transparency. The Italian drinking milk market is currently experiencing a crisis, with a constriction in sales of 1.8% between 2015 and 2017, and 2.5% in consumption (Assolatte 2017). In this market, there is in fact a great concern about domestic food safety issues, and there are a lot of new food-tendencies, which promote consumption of alternative products (for example vegetable drinks). Therefore, it could be very useful to study the consumers’ interest towards the information disclosures related to their consumption behaviours and characteristics. First of all, new laws and decrees are mandatorily required (Bai et al. 2013). By analysing the present milk offer, it is clear that the information provided through the label is divided between “mandatory” and “non-mandatory”, as with most products. Indeed, through these two types of information, labelling can be used as a means of obtaining the consumer’s informed consent, and consequently mitigating outraging factors (Zepeda et al. 2003). Some consumers may consider sufficient this kind of information, because they trust the production system and national law system, and not needing any further information or participation to the production process. Otherwise, they might acquire a high perception of risk, which could lead to the need for a new personal system of rules (Babutsidze 2007). This can be considered a consumer’s centralisation of decision rights about information, and so greater knowledge, and more participation to the production process. Many companies use the new information provided through the label as a tool to differentiate the offer or as a product enhancement, trying to place themselves ahead of tendencies and future market requirements, to ensure a competitive edge over competitors. As a result, the label becomes an element of differentiation from the competitors, making the product stand out. There are many studies that correlate and show that there is interest in regard to some information that determines a plus of the product and therefore its distinctiveness with respect to others (Scarpa et al. 2009). The aim of the research is to understand which kind of disclosures has the most impact among consumers in relation to their concerns as buyers, to their lifestyle, and to their background. The research aims to investigate what impact the components of different choices have on the interest towards these two kinds of disclosures. It also investigates how the consumer’s interest is an indicator of his willingness to invest in food information. This should clarify if the reduction of the information asymmetry conveyed through the “non-mandatory” disclosure, is more impactful than the one conveyed through “mandatory” disclosure, and which one is better for the producer and the consumer. The questionnaire takes into consideration the Italian law for milk and dairy products, which establishes that in Italy it is mandatory to declare the origin of milk (decree 9 December 2016) the stabilization treatment, and the nutritional information. The new laws and decrees have been established to assure the consumer about the quality, safety, and origin of this product, in order to satisfy his need for more information, and his growing concern about the quality of milk. Such is the case of the declaration of origin of milk, which became mandatory through the decree of 9/12/2016, implementing Regulation (EU) n° 1169/2011. Other mandatory information, which was not considered for the study, is the expiration date, the presence of technological adjuvants, allergens, conditions of conservation, and name and address of the responsible for the label declaration. Other disclosures can be included in order to enhance the product, and overall be beneficial to the reputation of the producer and his territory of production. In our research, the “non-mandatory” disclosures considered are local origin, cattle feed, and environmental sustainability. The interest in each of these is given by the sum of all the aspects of the consumers’ characteristics and behaviours, the attitude towards the purchase, habits, profile as consumers, and social-demographic characteristics, which can lead to specific purchase choices, with the mediation of the information (Cowan et al. 1997). The paper is structured as follows: in the “Conceptual framework” section, the main literature about label disclosures will be illustrated, and a new model for consumer behaviour through neo institutional approach will be introduced. In the “Methodology” section, the research, together with data and methodology, will be presented. In the “Results and discussion” section, the results and their discussion will be illustrated. Conclusions, political implications, and limits of the research will be in the “Conclusions” section.",10

Indigenous and traditional crops are comparatively less popular in the commercial market because of various reasons that include low levels of acceptability and access, limited market information, lack of processing technologies, intrinsically weak value chains and technologies to push the indigenous crops to the broader commercial markets (Mabhaudhi et al. 2019; Kasolo et al. 2018; Omotayo and Aremu 2020). Often the indigenous crops are considered underutilized since these crops are generally harvested from wild populations that are probably considered weeds. However, indigenous vegetables have an advantage over staple crops, as they are well adapted to the local climatic conditions and tolerant to biotic and abiotic stresses (Weinberger and Lumpkin 2007). To drive the development agenda for the smallholder, a pervasive change of the farms from semi-subsistence, low input, low-productivity approaches to intensive, market-oriented approaches is needed (Olwande et al. 2015; Fischer and Qaim 2012). In recent years, many Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries have experienced considerable changes in agri-food sectors including demand and supply-side components. This transformation in the food system on the demand side is driven by dramatic changes in consumer preferences, tastes, and food choices (Vroegindewey et al. 2021; Tschirley et al. 2015; Udomkun et al. 2021). Although, the supply-side relies on productivity growth (Agamile et al. 2021; World Bank 2008; Barrett 2008; Alene et al. 2008) and improved access to markets (Fischer and Qaim 2012; Obi 2010; Chamberlin and Jayne 2013). Productivity growth involves upgrading technologies, dissemination, and adoption of high-yielding crop varieties. The productivity advancing technologies help to achieve marketable surpluses that lead to increased household income and livelihoods. This is referred to as the “agricultural productivity pathway” for the sustenance of agriculture and to eradicate poverty (Barrett 2008). Still, productivity growth alone is not enough to address the challenges encountered by farmers when marketing their agricultural produce (Obi 2010; Jagwe et al. 2010). The farmers in SSA have weak or non-existing markets due to a lack of coordination among the community and high costs of transactions (Namonje Kapembwa et al. 2022; Obi 2010). Under this market situation, productivity enhancement technology provides only marketable surpluses but may not generate significant economic benefits for the farmers (Obi 2010; Jagwe et al. 2010; Minot and Ngigi 2004). Further, contract farming has the potential to connect farmers to global markets and limit market channel choices. However, in SSA where contract enforcement is weak, inadequate institutional support and infrastructural developments are considered as major restrictions to smallholder farming than low productivity (Gerard et al. 2022; Namonje-Kapembwa et al. 2022; Alene et al. 2008; Pingali et al. 2005). Often, poor infrastructure and limited supporting services reduce the farmer's interest in market participation (O’Cass and Viet Ngo 2012; Fischer and Qaim 2012; Key et al. 2000; Omamo 1998). Smallholders are also excluded from emerging markets due to the enforcement of quality standards and modernization of procurement systems (Olwande et al. 2015; Okello et al. 2008). These challenges, combined with seasonal cash shortages, lack of produce handling facilities, and limited market information weaken farmers’ position along the value chain in Sub-Saharan Africa (Vroegindewey et al. 2021; Pokhrel and Gopal 2007). Given this reality, researchers have recommended that addressing smallholder productivity growth must be coupled with measures to enhance market access for agricultural commodities (Fischer and Qaim 2012; Alene et al. 2008). In Sub-Saharan Africa, several intervention projects have focused on productivity growth and market access in order to improve their food and nutritional security. For instance, research and development of indigenous vegetables have focused on eco-geographic assessment, collection, evaluation, and identification of promising germplasm (Brindisi et al. 2020; Chadha et al. 2007; Dinssa et al. 2020) the nutritional and health contributions of AIVs (Mebelo et al. 2020; Somers et al. 2020) and strengthening the value chain (Govindasamy et al. 2020). Further, past studies indicate that most farmers would prefer to sell their produce in modern market outlets. In reality, this may not always be possible or even desirable (Blandon et al. 2009; Guo et al. 2007; Masakure and Henson 2005). In this paper, we examine farmers' behaviour in decision-making related to market outlet choices for AIVs by using representative samples of the farmers in Zambia. Gaps in knowledge concerning AIVs to be addressed with outlet choices to promote and expand the market options for wider production, fair market operation, and necessary infrastructure developments. Against this background, this paper addresses these research gaps by analysing the factors that influence farmers to choose a particular outlet to market AIVs.",

Among the options being considered, the usage of renewable fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel has recently gotten increased attention from policymakers. The world's economies have launched a near-simultaneous push to expand biofuel production and consumption, resulting in a huge increase in ethanol output for use as a gasoline additive. In Canada, the Renewable Fuels Regulation, which went into effect in 2011 mandates fuel producers and importers to have an average renewable content of at least 5% of the gasoline they produce or import.Footnote 1 In the USA, the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) in the US Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires renewable fuel to be blended into transportation fuel in increasing amounts each year (US EPA 2010). Similarly, in EU countries, the 2009 Renewable Energy Directive requires the EU to meet at least 20% of its total energy needs with renewable by 2020 achieved through the attainment of individual national targets, with all EU countries ensuring that at least 10% of their transport fuels come from renewable sources by 2020.Footnote 2 As a result of these measures, ethanol production has been increasing significantly as shown in Fig. 1. Trends in ethanol production in Canada, USA, and the EU countries As a result of this accelerated growth in ethanol production, the contribution of ethanol to the US gasoline fuel supply has reached approximately 10%, the result of which is that today, nearly 40% of the US national corn crop is used for ethanol production while approximately 30% of soy oil produced is used in biodiesel (The International Council on Clean Transportation 2021). Virtually all ethanol production in the US is based on corn (EIA 2020). This has significantly increased corn prices (Anderson and Coble 2010), but most importantly, those of meat, eggs, and dairy because animal feed makes up an estimated 50–69% of production costs for livestock farmers and primarily consists of corn, soybean meal, and dried distiller grains and soluble (EIA 2020). The increased use of corn acreage is displacing production of other crops and is also another important channel through which this affects consumer food prices. The general impact on consumer food prices is obvious. According to Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) data, the period 2008–2009 when ethanol production was leaked was also marked by significant food inflation globally. As shown in Fig. 2, the prices of many food items have increased significantly (Fig. 2).Footnote 3 Many studies have argued that the spike in ethanol production was the main culprit for the significant spike in food prices across the globe (Mueller et al. 2011; Hausman et al. 2012; Berry et al. 2013; Roberts and Schlenker 2013). The US Congressional Budget Office (2009) estimates that about 10–15% of the food price spikes were attributable to the use of corn for ethanol, while Hausman et al. (2012) estimate that increased corn ethanol production during the boom production year 2006/2007 explains approximately 27% of the experienced corn price rise, causing more acreage to be converted to corn production, which causes a rise in the overall food price. Berry et al. (2013) argue the fact that the US accounts for over 40% of the world's corn production justifies the link between ethanol and food inflation. Further, Robert and Schlenker (2013) predict that these “food-for-fuel” programs will increase food prices by about 30%, but the prediction could be as low as 20% if a third of the biofuel calories are recycled as feedstock for livestock. Source: Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) statistics Trends in World Food Price (Index, 2004 = 1). The Canadian experience is not an exception. As Sparling and LeGrow (2015) noted, input costs for the Canadian food processing industry have skyrocketed, particularly from 2008 onward, leading to both plant closures and job losses. They reported that Canada’s food manufacturing industry experienced the closure of 143 plants wand 23,807 jobs during the period 2006 to 2014, with both plant closures and job losses peaking during the 2007–2008 period. This is an important issue given the significance of the food processing industry in the Canadian economy in terms of manufacturing jobs and GDP contributions, and as an essential channel for Canadian agricultural products (Sparling and Cheney 2014). This study is motivated by the descriptive studies of the Canadian food processing industry offered by Sparling and LeGrow (2015) and Sparling and Cheney (2014), specifically the observations related to how the industry is responding to the increased raw material costs and coping with consolidation and restructuring in the aftermath of the rise in raw material costs. The paper attempts to generalize these descriptions by employing econometric models and estimation methods that can characterize the cost economies of the food processing sector. In general, factor substitutions, capacity utilization, and technological changes are the main mechanisms by which input prices influence production costs and thus profitability. Accordingly, analyzing how these factors are influenced by raw materials prices in the context of the Canadian food industry is the objective of this study. It employs the econometric method of estimating capacity utilization and its elasticity with respect to input prices. It also explores the substitution possibilities among the inputs by estimating the elasticity of substitutions among the inputs. The production cost of the Canadian food industry is studied using the restricted trans-log cost model to estimate the elasticity of substitutions, technological progress, and factor-bias of technical changes. Estimation of capacity utilization and its elasticity with respect to variable input prices are also offered. These are carried out using the Canadian KLEMS data set covering the period 1961–2014. The cutoff year is 2014 because of data availability. The KLEMS data reveals that there is a very close correlation between the raw material input price index of the food processing sector and the output price index of the crop and animal production sectors (Fig. 3). This reveals that the raw materials used in the Canadian food processing industry come primarily from crop and animal production. Accordingly, a rise in crop prices driven by ethanol production has an impact on the food industry through its impact on the cost of raw materials, as hypothesized earlier. Raw material price and output price of crop and animal production. Data source: Statistics Canada, Productivity Data (KLEMS) The findings reveal that the industry has experienced a negative productivity shock, mainly through a significant drop in capacity utilization. Given the finding that raw material inputs are substituted with other variable inputs, factor substitution possibilities and harnessing excess capacities provide potential coping mechanisms, implying that firms in the industry could mitigate production costs by substituting other inputs for raw materials to the extent possible. Capacity utilization is also found to respond positively to a rise in variable input prices, more so to that of raw materials. We further find evidence of the existence of raw material-saving technical changes. These findings suggest the existence of various cost-saving responses to the rise in raw material input prices. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section two, we offer a brief discussion of the theoretical framework and present the restricted trans-log cost specification along with the derivation of the measurements of our interest. The data and estimation method are discussed in Section three, followed by a presentation and discussion of the results in Section four. Section five concludes.",1

McKenzie,Guido Van Huylenbroeck,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Rice is synonymous with food security in Bangladesh, and economic and political stability is highly correlated with rice price volatility (Kabir et al. 2020; Sayeed and Yunus 2018). Rice prices raise farmers' incomes and livelihoods. However, high prices raise food spending and food insecurity and hurt the impoverished portion of the country. Rice farming has moved away from mostly subsistence to considerably more commercial farming, resulting in significant changes in the domestic trade of rice. The marketed surplus of rough rice produced at the farm level is 54 to 60% of total production depending upon seasons, farm categories and geographical segmentations in Bangladesh (Rahman et al. 2021). The Bangladesh government has enacted substantial policy reforms over the last 30 years to increase pricing efficiency among its domestic rice markets. These reforms were recommended in the 1980s by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, under the structural adjustment program. As a result of the policy reforms, Bangladesh domestic rice markets were liberalized and all kinds of supports were virtually abolished. However, producers and consumers could not fully benefit from the liberalization reforms, as Bangladesh commodities markets were not well integrated, leading to ineffective price signals across marketing channels. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Bangladesh's rice markets experienced massive liberalization (Hossain and Verbeke 2010). Since the late 1990s, large-scale automated rice mills have greatly increased milling capacity with large investments in Bangladesh (Reardon et al. 2014). Unhusked rice is processed in semi-automated and automatic rice mills and is supplied to both local and long-distance markets. This form of market expansion has fulfilled the local demand and taste for locally supplied clean rice. This milling revolution also added quality to basic rice through polishing, grading and bagging, allowing millers to better share economic benefits between producers and customers (Murshid 2015). Until the mid-1990s, Bangladesh's rice market was largely isolated from the world to insulate itself from world price volatility (Sayeed and Yunus 2018). In 1998, the country was self-sufficient in rice production for the first time in history, but in 1999, floods forced the country back to imports (Kabir et al. 2020). In mid-2007, Bangladesh's rice markets were affected by market volatility as world rice and other cereals grain prices surged dramatically. This volatility was exasperated in October 2007 when India ceased exporting rice to Bangladesh because of low public wheat reserves (Dorosh 2009). Bangladesh was able to overcome this shortage by boosting domestic rice production via the use of green revolution-led technology and government support. Since 2009, the country has consistently been close to self-sufficiency in rice production, exporting an average of 5,998 million tons of fragrant rice annually (Ali and Sunny 2020). In Bangladesh, the government’s share of the rice market is very low and has a negligible impact on the pricing and distribution system of rice to the end users (Rahman et al. 2020). Private traders, millers and wholesalers mostly procure and sell domestic rice, resulting in a wide price spread between farm and retail levels (Alam et al. 2016). Furthermore, a few well-organized millers and wholesalers wield large market power, leading to market failure (Rahman et al. 2020). Farmers are obligated to sell rough rice at a lower price than the competitive market price, but consumers pay exorbitant costs (Abdullah and Hossain 2013). Over the last decades, transportation infrastructure—roads and communication and mobile networks—has been greatly improved and developed. In the wake of these infrastructure and communication developments, greater spatial market integration was expected. High levels of spatial market integration are crucial to market performance. Markets that are not integrated may convey inaccurate price information, leading to misguided policy decisions and a misallocation of resources. Sexton et al. (1991) identified three reasons for a lack of market integration: imperfect competition, differential trade barriers and prohibitive transaction costs. With this in mind, we model the impact of transaction costs, which are typically high in developing countries, using a threshold vector error correction model. Although several studies have examined rice market integration in Bangladesh, to date no comprehensive studies that consider the role of transaction costs (hereafter TC) with respect to market integration have been done. The seminal work of Ravallion (1986) showed that there is limited market integration in Bangladesh rice markets. In addition, Goletti et al. (1995) concluded that market integration in Bangladesh rice markets is moderate. These conclusions of limited and moderate market integration in the pre-reform era reflected restricted food grain movement, poor infrastructure and inadequate communications. For example, prior to market reforms, Bangladesh government procured rice from surplus regions to maintain a buffer stock and this policy restricted the incentive of private traders to move rice from surplus to deficit regions. In effect, the policy prevented price equalization across regions. In contrast, Dawson and Dey (2002) showed that Bangladesh rice markets were perfectly integrated following the trade liberalization reforms. The authors used a vector autoregressive error correction model (VECM) to test the Law of One Price (LOP) within the central–regional market. However, they did not account for transportation costs. Their standard VECM modeling framework implicitly assumes that the price adjustment process is linear and symmetric. However, in more recent literature such as Enders and Siklos (2001), Enders and Granger (1998), Goodwin and Piggot (2001), Meyer (2004), Sarno et al. (2004), Pede and Mckenzie (2008), it is argued that the standard cointegration framework is mis-specified if the true adjustment process is nonlinear and asymmetric. This is likely the case if TC are significant. The factors that might contribute to higher TC are inadequate infrastructure, transportation bottlenecks, lack of market information, information asymmetry, market power and menu costs. These kinds of factors are common in developing countries’ agricultural markets and pose serious challenges to policy makers. Therefore, estimating threshold TC and their effect on price adjustments from one market to another or from one supply chain level to another should be a rule rather than an exception, especially in the context of developing countries. Hossain and Verveke (2010) examined if Bangladesh rice markets have become spatially integrated following the liberalization using wholesale weekly coarse rice prices during January 2004 to November 2006. The authors used Johansen cointegration analysis and found that rice markets in Bangladesh are only moderately integrated. Although this paper examined long-term relationships, it covered only a very short span of time—less than 3 years. This short span of time might not be sufficient to make firm conclusions about long-term adjustments. Siddique et al. (2008) investigated spatial integration between Dhaka, Mymensingh, Sherpur, Kishoregonj, Bogra, Rangpur and Dinajpur districts using monthly wholesale rice prices from January 1994 to December 2004. They concluded that distance between markets was not an important impediment to integration. More recently, Rahman et al. (2021) examined market cointegration among five main rice markets in Bangladesh using monthly wholesale prices from January 2006 to June 2017. They concluded that rice markets in Bangladesh are well integrated. Although Dhaka is the leading consumer market in the country and is home to about 20 million inhabitants, the study concluded that the leading rice market is Chattagram. This is a particularly surprising result given that Chattagram is the lowest rice-producing region. Akhter (2016) studied market integration between surplus (India) and deficit rice markets (Bangladesh and Nepal) during the global food crisis. They concluded that domestic rice prices of India, Bangladesh and Nepal are integrated in both the short and long run in spite of the imposition of export restriction policies by India. Alam et al. (2012) examined the dynamic relationship between the world and the domestic market price of rice for Bangladesh over the September 1998–February 2007 period. They found the evidence of a long-run unidirectional equilibrium relationship, meaning that domestic Bangladesh prices adjust to the world prices but not vice versa. However, neither Akhter (2016) nor Alam et al. (2012) analyzed markets integration among different regions within Bangladesh. Our study first tests whether domestic Bangladesh rice markets are integrated using Johansen cointegration and secondly tests for price causality between these markets. We extend Dawson and Dey (2002), Hossain and Verveke (2010), Siddique et al. (2008) and Rahman et al. (2021), by relaxing the assumptions of linear price adjustments. We explicitly account for nonlinear price adjustments in the presence of transaction costs using the Hansen-Seo (2002) threshold cointegration model. Under this approach, the threshold is estimated by means of a grid search approach. The proposed methodology is appropriate when only price data are available; if trade flow and TC data were also available, the parity bound method of Baulch (1997) would be a more appropriate alternative. Since the sample size is relatively small for threshold cointegration and threshold model estimation, we attempt to estimate the linear model first in order to validate the results from the threshold model. The paper contributes to the existing literature in two different ways. It is the first paper to consider transaction cost-induced nonlinear price adjustments when testing for spatial market integration in Bangladesh rice markets. In addition, it is the first study of its kind to examine Bangladesh rice market integration with respect to the post-liberalization reform era. Our analysis includes the data from January 1999 to December 2021, which is the longest time series examined to date. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes the linear cointegration approach, a causality test for market dominance, and the threshold cointegration model. The data are explained in Sect. 3. Section 4 presents the results and discussions, and the last section concludes.",1

According to the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) data, animal-based consumption is growing worldwide, particularly in population-dense middle-income countries (FAO 2022). This global excessive consumption could have significant impacts on the environment and public health, directly through consumption and indirectly through climate change (Godfray et al. 2018). Following the latest research, the food sector alone accounts for one-third of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (Crippa et al. 2021). To achieve the targets proposed to mitigate climate change, many international organizations have highlighted the need for a shift in dietary habits. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) highlights that diets with larger shares of animal-based foods have lower mitigation potentials, compared with plant-based diets (Mbow et al. 2019). The literature also points out that animal-based foods, in general, have higher ecological footprints compared with plant-based diets (Clune et al. 2017; Poore and Nemecek 2018; Reinhardt et al. 2020). Plant-based diets are addressed in the literature as both healthier and more sustainable (Chen et al. 2019; Clark et al. 2019; Springmann 2019), with the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics defending that, if planned and diversified, they can satisfy all nutritional requirements (Melina et al. 2016). Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) has also classified processed meat as “carcinogenic to humans” and red meat as “probably carcinogenic”, recommending a reduction in these types of meat followed by an increase in plant-based foods (Bouvard et al. 2015). More recently, two new studies revealed that a healthy plant-based diet rich in whole foods could help protect against the COVID-19, suggesting that consumers following the diet are both less likely to catch the virus and be hospitalized with it (Kim et al. 2021; Merino et al. 2021). This relationship has been recently highlighted by Kahleova and Barnard (2022). Similar to the IPCC, the Lancet Commission, in their extensive review on food consumption, has advised for a drastic reduction in animal-based consumption, particularly red meat, and a twofold increase in plant-based foods, particularly fruits and vegetables (Willett et al. 2019). The European Union Farm to Fork Strategy notes that “moving to a more plant-based diet with less red and processed meat and with more fruits and vegetables will reduce not only risks of life threatening diseases, but also the environmental impact of the food system” (European Commission 2020). Additionally, Vanham et al. (2018) and Gibin et al. (2022) suggest that this shift also substantially reduces consumption of water resources. Berners-Lee et al. (2018) further advise that radical changes to the dietary choices of most consumers are required so that current global food production is sufficient to meet the nutritional needs of the projected global population of 9.7 billion in 2050. For particular population groups, such as pregnant women and children, the scientific literature suggests that a well-planned plant-based diet, using supplementation when needed, may be considered safe (Baroni et al. 2019; Sebastiani et al. 2019; Sutter and Bender 2021). These recommendations are also in line with the ones from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics above-mentioned. Regarding the population of athletes, the scientific literature also suggests that a nutritive vegan diet can be designed to achieve the dietary needs of most of this population satisfactorily (Rogerson 2017; Shaw et al. 2022). Considering the negative externalities associated with the excessive animal-based consumption, a dietary shift away from these ecologically burdensome foods towards greater reliance on more sustainable and healthier ones, particularly healthy plant-based foods, is required (Aiking and de Boer 2020; Jiang et al. 2020). Even for animal-based foods produced following sustainable methods, plant-based foods still show lower ecological footprints. Poore and Nemecek (2018) reveal that the least ecologically burdensome red meats, in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, are still higher than any plant-based food compared for the same 100 g intake of protein. However, concerning plant-based foods, nuts in particular are still dominated by low-yielding cashews and water-, fertilizer- and pesticide-intensive almonds. Rice production is also a strong contributor to water footprint in Eastern countries where consumption is also high (Fan et al. 2022). Nevertheless, Rabès et al. (2020) highlight that omnivorous consumers have the highest environmental impact, and vegans the lowest, and further that an organic-based omnivorous diet has a higher environmental impact than a conventional one (see also Chai et al. (2019)). Additionally, Mottet et al. (2017) highlight that animals have relatively low efficiency in converting feed into human-edible foods, more so when considering that feed rations may contain human-edible food and that these feed rations are competing for land suitable for human-edible food production. Particularly, the authors estimate that to produce 1 kg of boneless requires an average of 2.8 kg and 3.2 kg of human-edible feed in ruminant and monogastric systems, respectively. The authors conclude that farming practices in the livestock sector do not account much for the environmental impact of animal-based foods, and that plant-based foods, and the correspondent plant-based diets, score the lowest environmental impacts. Although the impact of animal-based foods can be mitigated mainly by changes in behaviour, the impact of plant-based foods can be further lowered through technology change and innovation in efficiency rates. To promote the dietary transition proposed, it is vital to understand the motivators behind food choices. Knowing the reasons behind food choices, and particularly for abstaining meat or choosing more plant-based foods, which vary across consumers and may involve taste, health, animal welfare, the environment, among other considerations, is crucial to define effective policy measures (Neff et al. 2018; Graça et al. 2019; Dominici et al. 2021; Martinelli and De Canio 2021; Hielkema and Lund 2021). From the various motivators, regularly the issue of cost arises as price is often a driver of the dietary transition (Pais et al. 2021). From the many plant-based consumers, an “economic vegetarian” is one who avoids meat because it is more expensive (Lusk and Norwood 2016). On the retailers’ side, Tjärnemo and Södahl (2015) suggest that food retailers are not open to guide consumers to more environmental-friendly food choices as it would mean reducing meat consumption (see also Bălan (2021)). Food retailers further suggest that animal-based foods are important to attract new and keep loyal customers. With the recent meat-substitute market reaching about 12% and increasing rapidly (Martinelli and De Canio 2021), reaching $7.5bn by 2025 (Allied 2019), the public might generally perceive plant-based foods as more expensive than their animal counterparts, and consequently perceiving plant-based diets as more expensive. Additionally, fruits and vegetables may also be out of reach for some consumers due to high prices (Li et al. 2018). However, studies such as Stewart et al. (2021) report that if consumers prioritize fruits and vegetables in their budgets, they can better afford to meet the dietary lines regarding the consumption of these foods. Nevertheless, Grabs (2015) and Berners-Lee et al. (2012) estimate that plant-based consumers save up to 10% and 14% on grocery store expenditure compared to omnivorous. However, these estimations are based on a pooled data set and assumptions using inferred prices, rather than observed prices paid by consumers. This method does not assess the specific meals consumed from different diets, which is a major gap in the literature. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, only one published peer-reviewed study has assessed food expenditures at the consumer level for different diets. Using primary data for the USA, Lusk and Norwood (2016) conclude that consumers who follow a strictly plant-based diet (vegan) report lower food expenditures, and that plant-based diets are in practice cheaper than the omnivorous diets. However, consumer preferences and the food market may differ considerably between the USA and Europe, and particularly for Mediterranean countries such as Portugal where the Mediterranean diet is greatly promoted. Thus, the omnivorous diet may show considerable differences between these regions. No evidence has been assessed at the consumer level in Mediterranean countries, which presents an opportunity for the present study, more so when the Portuguese food guidelines suggest that the share of animal-based foods, such as meat, fish and eggs, should not exceed 5% (DGS and FCNAUP 2017), and the current average consumption exceeds 15% (FAO 2022). As a result, food consumption is the main driver (30%) of Portugal’s ecological footprint (Galli et al. 2020b). Portugal requires 2.3 planets Earth to satisfy a year of consumption (Galli et al. 2020a). Considering the gap in the knowledge highlighted, more assessments are needed to fully understand the implications of the shift towards less animal-based foods and more plant-based diets globally, proposed by international organizations and the scientific literature. The implications of the potential dietary costs of plant-based diets go beyond its effect on a consumer’s finances—it will also be crucial for the assessments of the ecological footprint of the proposed shift. As described by Grabs (2015), “the rebound effects” of changing diets shows that one half of the carbon footprint reduction credited to the shift towards plant-based diets actually disappears after considering the re-spending of the savings (see also Lekve Bjelle et al. (2018)). If plant-based diets have both a lower ecological footprint and a lower price tag, it is crucial to account for the possibility such re-spending. Thus, a clear understanding of the relationship between plant-based diets and food expenditures is vital as it helps to recognize the economic consequences of shifting diets, as well as its potential environmental consequences. Additionally, if plant-based diets are cheaper than other diets, they could be a potential mechanism to mitigate food insecurity. Following the above, the present study aims to verify if plant-based consumers in fact spend more on food than omnivorous consumers, at the consumer level, in the context of a Mediterranean country. In this paper, both food expenditures at-home and away-from-home are assessed. Besides diets, other consumers’ characteristics are tested such as preference for organic foods, making use of leftovers, having own production, and also socio-economic characteristics such as age, education level, household disposable income, among others. The study is structured as follows: besides the motivation in Sect. 1, Sect. 2 displays the data and methods applied. Then, results are presented and further discussed in Sect. 3. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes and examines drawbacks and future research.",5

Over the past few decades, agricultural productivity along with global food production made a contribution to reduce hunger (Godecke et al. 2012) but malnutrition or hidden hunger remain extensive, notably in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa region (Sibhatu and Qaim 2018a). Although the nutritional status of many developing countries has been upgraded over the years South Asian countries lag behind other regions. This region is the home of around 50% of world’s hungry population (Pandey et al. 2016). Aside from the high level of food insecurity, about 23% of the populations of South Asia lack proper calorie consumption (WDI 2014). South Asian countries mainly depend on agriculture for employment and livelihoods (Deb 2014). Bangladesh, a developing and overpopulated nation in South Asia, has achieved commendable growth in reducing poverty and hunger over the last two decades, but several indices of nutrition remain a matter of concern (Belton et al. 2014; Rahman 2010; Rahman and Salim 2013). In rural Bangladesh, one-third of women are malnourished and 36% of children under five are stunted (Ahmed et al. 2012; Osmani et al. 2016). Moreover, the country continues to struggle with micronutrient deficiencies such as zinc, iron, iodine and vitamin A due to inadequate diets that are dominated by rice and lack diversification (Ahmed et al. 2013). Research indicates that the food habit of Bangladeshi people is inadequately diversified and this emerged as a major barrier in acquiring a standard nutritional status. Dietary diversity is a proxy method of nutrient adequacy of an individual's diet (Kennedy et al. 2011). It can be defined as different types of foods available across and within food groups that can ensure adequate intake of vital nutrients for optimal health (WHO/FAO 1996; Ruel 2002). It is linked to adequate vitamin and micronutrient intake and better child nutrition outcomes (Fongar et al. 2019; Kennedy et al. 2007; Muthini et al. 2020; Steyn et al. 2006).
 Dietary diversity is determined by different factors including agricultural biodiversity and farm production diversity (Jones et al. 2014; Oyarzun et al. 2013), production technology, historical consumption habits, household income (Doan 2014; Drescher et al. 2009) and cultural traits at the regional level. Although dietary diversity is a crucial indicator of nutrition, but for low-income people consumption of nutritious food is quite difficult (FAO 2013; Chegere and Stage 2020). For households engaged in subsistence agriculture, farm production diversity would be a promising approach for achieving nutritional security and therefore nutritionists have given emphasis to harnessing the linkages between farm diversity and diversity in household diets (Malapit et al. 2015). For small landholders, agricultural diversification plays a vital role in dietary diversity as it improves the consumption of own-produced food, as well as purchased food on account of increased income from the selling of farm produce (Chegere and Stage 2020; Herrero et al. 2010; IFAD and UNEP 2013). Various trails are indicating how agriculture can affect the nutritional outcomes which include increased farm production and consumption of food, increased income, reduction of food prices and women empowerment (Kadiyala et al. 2014; Kanter et al. 2015). Research related to agriculture-nutrition linkages has recently gained increased attention and several studies have been conducted on-farm diversity and nutrition. Different studies used varied methods of assessing the link between production diversity and dietary diversity with varied outcomes. Some studies showed a positive association between farm diversity and household dietary diversity (Chegere and Stage 2020; Jones 2017; Pellegrini and Tasciotti 2014; Saaka et al. 2017). Chinnadurai et al. (2016) showed a positive relationship between household dietary diversity and crop diversity, whereas the association was found negative in case of diversity of vegetable production and dietary diversity. Likewise, Sibhatu and Qaim (2018b) found a mixed result indicating that farm production diversity was positively related to dietary diversity when measured with simple species count, whereas did not find any significant relation with dietary diversity when production diversity was measured in terms of the number of food crops. Production diversity also interrelates with other factors such as household income, market access and commercialization of households. While rising income has proven to be an important indicator of dietary diversity (Dillon et al. 2014; Singh et al. 2020), small effort has been taken to see how dietary diversity and nutrition are affected by diversifying income of the household (Benfica and Kilic 2016). Also in developing countries, farmers are gradually diversifying their sources of income which makes the relationship is critical to understand (Davis et al. 2014, 2017; Winters et al. 2010).
 Our present research adds to the literature in various aspects. The current evidence revealed that the association between them is complex and situation-specific (Muthini et al. 2020; Sibhatu et al. 2015). In this strand of literature, one of the drawbacks is that most of the studies were conducted in the African region, where smallholder farmers were mainly subsistence in nature and the green revolution was not very effective (Jones 2017; FAO 2014). Hence, more research is required in the Asian region to determine the association. The intensity of associations may vary by context, but further research from Asian settings is essential to confirm this. Moreover, most of the studies used cross-sectional data and one of the main problems of cross-sectional studies is selection bias which violating the true association (Jones 2017). Panel data is needed not only to reduce omitted variable bias but also to increase the accuracy of the estimation procedure (Tae et al. 2007). Also, many studies used small sample sizes and simple econometric methods for assessing the relationship which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions especially in the policy context. Our research has not only used the large, nationally representative, unique panel data but also used panel econometric procedures. In addition, we have also used alternative measures for measuring both dietary diversity and agricultural production diversity. Hence, it is necessary to address the above shortcomings and gain a deeper knowledge of the relationship between farm production diversity and dietary diversity of households. The present study seeks to answer the research question of whether farm production diversity has any effect on household dietary diversity. Therefore this study’s objective is to examine the effect of farm production diversity and dietary diversity using the complete set of (3 rounds) large, unique and nationally representative panel data in Bangladesh.

A study accounting for observed and unobserved selectivity,December 2022,Ayobami Adetoyinbo,Verena Otter,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Over the past decades, smallholders in developing countries have increasingly faced significant transactional challenges in food supply chains caused by constraints in agricultural production and adverse changes in economic, environmental, and sociopolitical structures (AUC/OECD 2019; Ngenoh et al. 2019; Orsi et al. 2017). As a result of smallholders’ relatively inefficient production methods, they are often excluded from international high-value food supply chains and limited to less profitable local markets (Barrett et al. 2012). A possible solution to this problem is provided by the growing scientific evidence that collective actions have positive effects on smallholders’ economic performance and welfare (Ainembabazi et al. 2017; Chagwiza et al. 2016; Fischer and Qaim 2012; Markelova and Mwangi 2010; Mojo et al. 2017; Ochieng et al. 2018; Verhofstadt and Maertens 2014). Indeed, producer groups and cooperatives are nowadays widely viewed as a valuable institutional arrangement to cope with inefficiencies and exigencies associated with food production and marketing (Martey et al. 2014). In Africa, fisher groups also bear the responsibility for alleviating supply and marketing challenges (Adetoyinbo and Otter 2020; Mkuna and Baiyegunhi 2019). By acting collectively, fishers can deploy groups’ economies of scale, superior information access and effective management of fish resources to enhance their technical ability, productivity, and welfare. However, the relative proportion of artisan fishing households—one of the most socially disadvantaged groups within Africa’s agricultural sector—in formal producer groups remains rather low (FAO 2007; WorldFish 2018). This could be an indication of limited economic incentives for group participation as a result of the institutional malfunctioning and inconsistent objectives of the existing fisher group structure (Adetoyinbo and Otter 2020; AUC/OECD 2019). Consequently, the sector remains relatively underdeveloped and non-commercialized and is still barely connected to profitable, high-value markets (Alawode and Oluwatayo 2019; Belhabib et al. 2018; Kobayashi et al. 2015). The Nigerian shrimp subsector is a primary example of an African fishery sector that remains underdeveloped and has low participation rates by artisanal fisher groups (Adetoyinbo and Otter 2020). Enhanced fishing efficiency obtained via fisher groups could improve artisan fishers’ competitiveness and help them to commercialize, target profitable high-value markets, and deal with adverse economic conditions. Despite the government’s strong political will to promote agricultural cooperatives and collective action through various policy instruments,Footnote 1 no cross-cutting program has been proposed to specifically encourage artisan fishing smallholders to join fisher groups and improve technical efficiency and productivity in the artisanal fishery sector (WorldFish 2018). To this end, appropriate policy measures based on solid scientific evidence about the role and effectiveness of fisher groups should be developed and implemented by governments, agribusiness firms, and extension agents to improve the technical ability and productivity of artisan fishers. The majority of existing empirical research from which insights on the technical effectiveness of producer groups can be drawn were centered on collective actions in farm-based food sectors like maize, dairy, and coffee (Ainembabazi et al. 2017; Chagwiza et al. 2016; Mojo et al. 2017; Ochieng et al. 2018; Verhofstadt and Maertens 2014). Results from these studies show that the effects of group membership on smallholders’ farm and economic performance are mixed, with both positive and negative effects documented (Bernard and Taffesse 2012; Chagwiza et al. 2016; Fischer and Qaim 2012; Hellin et al. 2009). The mixed effects of collective action could be attributed to group heterogeneity of numerous kinds: in goals, organization and governance forms, and property rights distribution. This situation points to the need for a case study and group-specific analyses. However, no studies to date have provided empirical evidence on the selectivity-corrected technical and productivity effects of group membership in African artisanal fisher associations. The objective of this study is to analyze the selectivity-corrected role of fisher groups in improving the technical efficiency (TE) and productivity of artisan shrimpers in Nigeria. Using recent data obtained from 353 artisan shrimpers (treatment (n = 95) and control (n = 258) groups) in the Nigerian shrimp and prawnFootnote 2 subsector, this article contributes to the literature in three ways. First, an unbiased effect of group membership on the TE and technological difference of artisan fishers is estimated using an approach that combines Greene’s (2010) stochastic production frontier (SPF) method and propensity score matching (PSM) to correct for bias from selectivity. Concerns over selectivity have been stressed in the general empirical productivity and agricultural economics literature over the last two decades (Greene 2010). Yet, empirical studies (e.g., Abate et al. 2014; Álvarez et al. 2019; Gedara et al. 2012; Hailu et al. 2015; Madau et al. 2017) published on productivity and efficiency effects rarely account for selectivity. Relevant extant studies that did often control for selection bias by employing empirical methods such as propensity score matching, counterfactual endogenous switching regression and inverse Mill’s ratio-based frontier models (Abate et al. 2014; Azumah et al. 2019; Ma and Abdulai 2016; Wollni and Brümmer 2012). However, these techniques cannot properly control for selectivity from both observable and unobservable characteristics. This study resolves this limitation by combining Greene’s (2010) SPF method and PSM, thus allowing for control of (a) different technological sets for members and nonmembers and (b) sample selection bias from observed and unobserved factors. Consequently, unbiased TE and technical change effects attributable to group membership are estimated. Furthermore, extant studies have estimated group-specific TE and productivity using several approaches. Abate et al. (2014), for example, analyzed the technical effectiveness of group membership by directly comparing group efficiency scores without controlling for possible group-specific technological differences. However, metafrontier analysis using pooled data is not admissible for different groups since efficiency scores may not cover group-specific frontiers (Huang et al. 2014). Similarly, Abdul-Rahaman and Abdulai (2018) and Ma et al. (2018) conducted a direct comparison of efficiency scores after group-specific frontier estimations, which led to estimations that were made against various production frontiers rather than the pooled metafrontier (Battese et al. 2004; O’Donnell et al. 2008). Instead of performing a metafrontier analysis using only pooled data as done in existing literature, Huang et al.’s (2014) two-step stochastic metafrontier (SMF) regression method was estimated to control for group-specific TE and technological differences. Third, the study estimates a binary probit model to identify factors that influence artisan shrimpers’ decisions to join artisanal fisher groups. This study answers a pressing need for identifying membership obstacles. Furthermore, the results have significant policy implications for the institutional improvement of current artisanal fisher groups in Africa. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. ""Shrimp supply and artisanal fisher groups in Nigeria"" section gives details of shrimp supply and artisanal fisher groups in Nigeria. ""Conceptual framework and empirical specifications"" section presents the study’s conceptual framework and empirical specification. The data and models used, as well as the results and discussion, are presented in ""Data and model specification"" and ""Empirical results and discussion"" sections, respectively.

This is heightened with rising demand for necessities such as food, raw materials for industries, and biofuels. However, growth in agricultural production globally does not match this demand well, especially in parts of Africa. Africa has been projected to be vulnerable to climate change because of its proximity to the equator (Ojo et al. 2021; Thinda et al. 2021; Sarr et al. 2021; Onyeneke 2021; Ahmed 2022). Some of the physical impacts of climate change in Africa are rising sea levels, temperature andchange, and rainfall change (World Bank 2010; Abdulai 2018), which will harm agricultural productivity, farm income, food security, and economic development. This will negatively affect the poor, whose livelihoods are tired of agriculture in Sub-Saharan Africa. There has been a global discussion on overcoming the negative externalities of climate change. Most experts believe that sustainable agriculture management could be a solution to the challenge associated with climate change (Kassie et al. 2013; Ndiritu et al. 2014; Ogemah 2017; Zhou et al. 2018; Adenle et al. 2019; Rose et al. 2019; Zeweld et al. 2020; Ma and Wang 2020; Ehiakpor et al. 2021; Bekele et al. 2021). This approach is expected to improve agricultural production performance whilst reversing the negative degradation processes on the agroecosystem, particularly in smallholder farming systems. It is an upgrade of the green revolution, which led to a significant increase in agricultural productivity globally and is credited for jump-starting economies in Asia out of poverty but has left negative externalities such as deforestation, land degradation, salinization of water bodies, and loss of biodiversity in its wake. To reverse the negative externalities from crop intensification, farmers have been advised to adopt sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs), which are made up of elements of the green revolution and an agronomic revolution. The literature is filled with studies on the adoption of specific or single elements of SAPs, such as improved seed, irrigation, drought-tolerant crop varieties, climate-resilient crop variety, organic soil amendments, and soil and water conservation practices, and their effects on crop yield and net farm income (Abdulai and Huffman 2014; Agula et al. 2018; Adenle et al. 2019; Adegbeye et al. 2020; Kimathi et al. 2021; Zheng et al. 2021; Ahmed 2022; Yang et al. 2022). Despite the potential complementarity or substitutability of specific elements of SAPs, the research on the adoption of multiple SAPs and their effects on outcome variables such as income, outputs, consumption expenditure and food security remains limited. This paper seeks to investigate the determinants of multiple SAP adoption and the adoption effects on farm income and food security, using second-hand data collected from Ghana. This study contributes to the literature in twofold. First, it provides empirical insights into the importance of SAPs on welfare indicators, specifically food security. The use of food security as a proxy measure for welfare is particularly important in the Ghanaian context, where farming is done mostly on a subsistence level, and farmers sell crops as and when they need cash. Thus, farmers may be food secure but not have a high net farm income or high consumption expenditure. Our analysis extends previous studies that have focused on other proxies of household welfare such as net farm income, net crop income and consumption expenditure (Kassie et al. 2013; Teklewold et al. 2013a; Manda et al. 2016; Bopp et al. 2019; Oyetunde Usman et al. 2020; Ehiakpor et al. 2021). Secondly, we employ a multinomial endogenous switching regression model to mitigate selection bias. In particular, this model helps address the selection bias issues arising from observed factors (e.g., age, gender and education) and unobserved factors (farmers’ innate ability in innovation adoption and motivations to address external shocks). Findings from the study will aid in formulating specific policies targeted at improving SAP adoption and enhancing the food security status of farm households in developing countries. The remaining sections of the paper are as follows; ""Literature review"" section covers a review of relevant literature. The methodology is presented in ""Methodology"" section. The descriptive and empirical results are presented and discussed in ""Results and discussions"" section. The final section highlights the conclusions and policy implications of the findings.",12

Vanilla has a wide variety of uses in the food industry. These uses usually include its inclusion in ice creams, sweet foods, alcohol, cosmetics, and perfumes (Menz and Fleming 1989). It must be noted that vanilla belongs to an industry that is small and its production is quite low, which makes it a product that is not adequate for global consumption. The vanilla (VNL) market involves a few major producing countries such as Madagascar (Zhu 2018), and while the consumers are many, this is exactly what may lead to the difference between the demand and supply, which ultimately exerts pressure on the VNL price. This has then led to the creation of artificial VNL as a substitute for natural VNL, primarily due to the rising costs associated with the pure form. On the other hand, the usage of artificial vanilla may have potentially led to health issues, due to which the companies have now started to turn back to natural forms of VNL. Moreover, it must also be noted that the VNL crop is cultivated in a specific region of the sub-Saharan constituency, fraught with environmental, political, economic and security issues (Wexler 2017; Neimark et al. 2019) which have played a decisive role in the VNL price changes, and lead to a boom and bust. Hence, the phenomenon of the VNL price bubble is a crucial standpoint for policymakers and analysts. The price bubbles and their bursting have previously had a profound impact on the economy and have been studied and analyzed extensively (Khan et al. 2020). The bubble usually occurs when there is a successive rise and abrupt collapse of the prices in a definite period (Lind 2009; Khan et al. 2021). Data tell us that the prices are not consistent in their intrinsic value, which is affirmed to be the most essential example and the most powerful assumption behind the conventional finance theories (Khan et al. 2020). That is to say that if the assets form a price bubble, these assets are then more attractive to investors, and therefore, their demand increases, and the asset prices rise even further. The bubble will, however, disappear if the buyers believe that the prices are no longer rising, which will then reduce demand and may trigger a crisis (Case and Shiller 2003; Shiller 2003). Hence, it can be affirmed that the price bubbles have an essential influence on the financial and real markets and are worthy of study. Vanilla is the most expensive agricultural product after saffron (Menz and Fleming 1989), as it is quite difficult and delicate to grow. It is the most popularly used in ice creams, sweet foods, alcohol, cosmetics and perfumes. Madagascar is the biggest producer of VNL in the world, and for a century or so, it mostly monopolized the market of vanilla production. Other countries such as Papua New Guinea, India and Uganda are the other major producers of vanilla. On the other side of the spectrum, The USA is the biggest importer of vanilla, primarily due to the significantly big ice cream industry that it hosts. Similarly, the European Union (EU) and China are also among the largest importers of VNL (Cadot et al. 2009). In general, it is common knowledge that the price fluctuations affect agricultural commodities, but VNL is exceptionally volatile due to the liberalization of the market (Turner 2015). Moreover, as this is a small and exclusive industry, even a single hurricane can devastate the entire crop. Also, it takes three years to fully mature, and the flower blooms only for one day. Therefore, in order to produce these precious beans, the crop must be pollinated by hand on the very same day (Neimark et al. 2019). The complete process of VNL cultivation is time consuming and laborious. The growers also have to struggle with thieves who are targeting the VNL crop. In order to avoid these problems, some of the farmers harvest the beans before the plant even matures, but this produces poor-quality VNL which ultimately drives down the price (Neimark et al. 2019). Hence, the deteriorating quality and high prices have an adverse effect on the VNL price bubbles burst. Likewise, climate change is also a phenomenon that is increasing the frequency and intensity of storms in Madagascar, and the farmers are now facing the risk of their crops being destroyed by severe weather events (Pagano and Echevarria 2018). This is the epitome of instability, not only because of the weather, but also due to the issue that the workers themselves are marginalized, a factor due to which there is high susceptibility to disruptions in the market and price. The changes in the market structure are related to the record high prices of VNL, and the various policy changes that have ultimately triggered the price fluctuations (Neimark et al. 2019). Also, the market is now held by cheap artificial VNL since the 1980s to counter the natural VNL, and therefore, the farmers have decreased VNL cultivation as a result of low returns from this industry (Menz and Fleming 1989). Artificial VNL is derived from synthetic flavoring that is extracted from wood and even petroleum called vanillin. This is a viable substitute to natural VNL and is economical (Cadot et al. 2009). It is expected that vanillin will be adopted more widely in various industries, so as to escape the increasing costs of natural VNL. The demand for natural VNL experienced a rise in 2011, and this is when the companies pledged to exclude artificial from their products and increase the content of natural VNL. Following this, it was expected that the demand for VNL may decline, owing to the impact of terrorist attacks, the global oil crisis and the political crisis, which would then lead to a reduction in the consumer income and VNL price (Danwatch 2018). The product VNL is considered to be physically, socially and politically insecure, and hence, it has been experiencing price fluctuations. It is noteworthy that the price has fluctuated sharply since the market has opened in the year 1989, from $400 per kilogram in 2003 to $30 per kilogram in 2005, a phase that lasted for a decade. Similarly, the VNL price also shot up and became even more expensive than silver. The international price of the bean fell from a high in 2003 to a historical low. However, it was also observed that the VNL price burst and dropped to its lowest level between the years pertaining to 2005 and early 2014, as caused by the abundance of VNL production (Danwatch 2018). This then prompted the farmers extracting vanilla to switch to other crops, primarily because the yields were not enough for them to survive, which eventually lead to shortages. It was noted that the price of VNL was $80 a kilogram in the year 2014, and reached up to a staggering level of $600 in the year 2017 due to its high global demand. Moreover, the companies also shunned artificial VNL in favor of the natural and organic varieties of VNL. Simultaneously, the government then made efforts to regulate the VNL price and industries; wherein, the prices were negotiated at the point of sale, which made the market freer and more volatile (Neimark et al. 2019). In this regard, it was commonly believed that the power to determine the price on the VNL market was mainly with the buyer and the farmer has no way to control supply or withhold the quantity of VNL, therefore, this leads to the increase in the prices. It was in the year 2018 that this bubble burst, as the companies resorted to the use of vanillin due to the high price of natural VNL. Likewise, the bumper crop in the other regions also leads to a rapid decline in the price of VNL. This wide fluctuation in the VNL market has not been considered as a good sign. This is because it may have caused overinvestment into VNL when the price was higher and underinvestment when the price was lower, which is a phenomenon that ultimately leads to price volatility in any industry. Similarly, a greater level of stability is essential for farmers to continue producing a certain crop in the long run as well. We can thus derive the main contribution of this study in the existing literature in the following forms. First, the investigation of the VNL price has been undertaken, which has scant studies available on the discipline of price bubbles. The VNL crop is a considerably attention worthy crop due to its extensive usage in the food industry, and its production in poverty-stricken and unstable regions can critically disrupt its global supply. Thus, it is crucial to examine the VNL price bubbles in the VNL market, and hence acknowledge this as one of the first studies to evaluate the price bubble phenomenon that is experienced in the VNL market. Second, the study aims to determine the causes of the development of the price bubbles in the VNL market, a concept that has been overlooked in the extant literature established thus far. Therefore, it thoroughly discusses the leading factors, such as the sudden climate changes, political uncertainty, speculation about low quality, development and availability of synthetic VNL and theft, factors which may have contributed to and continue to contribute toward the disturbance of the demand and supply, as well as the price bubble. Lastly, the econometric methodology, such as the Supremum Augmented Dickey–Fuller (SADF) and the Generalized Supremum Augmented Dickey–Fuller (GSADF), has been employed in this study in order to detect the VNL price bubbles. It is noteworthy that this method possesses superior conduct as compared to the other conventional procedures, which can be applied to determine bubbles in any data with varying frequencies. Moreover, these two tests may detect the bubbles in the full and sub-sample as well which can thus offer more convincing results. The study concludes that the VNL prices experience this bubble behavior and therefore detects five bubbles over a period of time. In this regard, the opening point and the ending coincide with specific events that eventually lead to the formation, as well as the puncture of the bubbles. Thus, the mismatch between the global demand and supply, cyclones and other natural disasters, political instability, cartels monopoly, strict government regulation, poor weather, exchange rate fluctuations, theft, price speculation and low quality are some of the leading determinants of the VNL bubbles formation and perforation. The VNL price is also vulnerable to variable supply, uncertain weather and market speculation. Therefore, a greater level of stability is required in the VNL market in order to ensure a continuous supply, which can lead to the control of the usual price volatility. Moreover, the governments should also facilitate the big organizations and companies to directly negotiate with the framers, which may be ultimately beneficial for both the companies and the farmers. Therefore, the government should take measures to overcome the theft problem and can thus enact and levy special laws in order to discourage early harvest of the VNL crop. These huge fluctuations lead to price speculation and unpredictability regarding the price and quality of VNL. Thus, stability is an important component for all the stakeholders in the market. Similarly, the market structure should be devised in such a way that it involves all the participants so as to avoid instability and uncertainty. We have organized this study into seven sections. The relevant review of the literature has been listed in section “Literature review.” Then, the theoretical framework has been highlighted in section “Bubble model.” Section “Methodology” described the techniques employed in order to evaluate the analysis, while the data explanation and trends are explained in Sect. Data. The results of the study are discussed in section “Empirical analysis” and we have concluded the study in section “Conclusion and policy recommendation.”",3

The adoption of precision agriculture (PA) enables farmers to reduce negative externalities such as biodiversity loss, the over-exploitation of resources and CO2 emissions (Pretty 2001; Ogle et al. 2014). For this reason, policies at the European level are promoting PA adoption: in the recent communication ""The future of food and farming"" (EC 2017), PA could have a dedicated area within rural development policies. Nonetheless, technology adoption raises wider questions of “complexity” that should be analysed in depth. Most studies speak of “complexity” with the aim of describing the multidimensional scenario of the factors influencing innovation adoption. The socio-structural characteristics of farms, farmers’ perception, and factors linked to the institutional context contribute to depicting this complex framework (Pierpaoli et al. 2013). This paper argues that this complexity needs to be reviewed from the point of view of the potential adopter, defining the concept of “perceived complexity”. From this perspective, this paper does not analyse the direct effect of factors on the propensity to adopt; rather, it aims to provide an original contribution by proposing the “factors–perception of complexity–adoption” (FACOPA) model. More precisely, this paper tries to provide a new approach under the hypothesis that perceived complexity is the main driver affecting the propensity to innovate. By emphasizing perceived complexity and with the purpose of measuring it, the paper aims to contribute to the abundant literature on technology adoption with special reference to the uptake of precision farming tools. The specific purpose of our analysis is not to focus on one specific innovation related to PA but to evaluate farmers’ behaviour of either adopting PA or not. The paper is organized as follows: “Theoretical background: problematizing complexity in innovation adoption” section  provides a conceptualization of the complex scenario of adoption from the perspective of farmers. Section 3 presents the materials and methods, while the results are presented in “Results” section  and discussed in “Discussion”  section, jointly with conclusions and policy implications.",7
10.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,09 February 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-022-00210-1,Nonfarm activity and market participation by farmers in Ghana,December 2022,Paul Kwame Nkegbe,Abdelkrim Araar,Shamsia Abdul-Wahab,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In developing economies, the role of agriculture in leading the socioeconomic transformation at the micro- and macro-levels is well documented. However, recent developments in most parts of the developing world show that there have been parallel sectors that are increasing in strength and rivalling the agriculture sector in terms of importance. One of such sectors that has come to the fore in development economics research is the rural nonfarm sector (see, for example, Ellis 2000; Reardon 1997; Reardon et al. 1994). In fact, the growth of nonfarm work among farmers is attested in developed economies as well. For example, Alasia et al. (2009) note that in Canada, there is a rise in the number of farmers who engage in nonfarm work, forcing a significant reduction in the number of farmers. The rural nonfarm sector has been observed to exert positive externality on development outcomes of rural populations. Income earned from nonfarm activities holds the tendency to increase average household income and ultimately ease household capital and credit constraints and enhancing farmers’ ability to purchase farm inputs and to adopt improved production technology (Dedehouanou et al. 2018; Babatunde 2015; Maertens 2009). This investment in farm enterprise enhances farm productivity and increases marketed surplus which encourages farmers to participate in the market (Woldehanna 2000). Nevertheless, various studies have also reported adverse effects of nonfarm activity engagements on farm activities. It has been reported that moving away resources such as land and labour previously used on-farm reduces farm productivity, which decreases marketed surplus and thus dampens market participation by farmers (see, for example, Omiti et al. 2009; Pfeiffer et al. 2009). In addition, nonfarm income if used for consumption reduces farm investment, thereby decreasing farm productivity and thus marketed surplus (Babatunde 2015). Given the crucial role of rural nonfarm work participation on agricultural commercialisation, and the fact that agriculture remains a key sector of the economy that employs the majority of the labour force, the Government of Ghana through the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) has formulated and implemented policies/initiatives that seek to promote nonfarm work opportunities and agricultural commercialisation through farm investment and increased crop productivity. For example, the Medium-Term Agriculture Sector Investment Plan (METASIP II) (2014–2017), METASIP III (2018–2021) and the current government flagship initiatives, namely, Planting for Food and Jobs, Planting for Export and Rural Development, and One-District-One Factory programmes all gear towards promoting livelihood diversification, farm productivity and agricultural commercialisation. All these seek to help the government achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1 and 2 which focus on alleviating poverty and ending hunger by the year 2030. Despite these policies and initiatives, farmers still have numerous challenges regarding market participation and finding alternative livelihood activities. While the policy perspective acknowledges the importance of market engagements of farmers and their participation in nonfarm work as key for poverty reduction, a key question is whether there exists a link between nonfarm work and market participation among farmers. This information, if sought, will help inform policy makers to either simultaneously tackle nonfarm engagement and market participation of farmers or treat them as independent activities. It also has serious implications for the larger policy area of poverty alleviation and hunger eradication. However, there are limited empirical studies on the effect of nonfarm activities on farmer’s participation in the market. Specifically in Ghana, studies have explored the nonfarm-farm linkages (see, e.g. Canagarajah et al. 2001; Anríquez and Daidone 2010; Owusu et al. 2011; Osarfo et al. 2016). For example, Canagarajah et al. (2001) examined the distribution of earnings by gender and income type, and the effect of nonfarm earnings on inequality. Okoh and Hilson (2011) assessed the importance of promoting and regularising artisanal and small-scale mining as a livelihood diversification from unproductive smallholder farming. Further, Anriquez and Daidone (2010) examined whether nonfarm engagement stimulates economies of diversification of farm households and the effect of nonfarm engagement on input demands and production efficiency. Though these studies examine the nonfarm-farm linkages, none of these explores the linkage in the context of market participation—the focus of this study. The combined focus of these studies has been on input demand, production efficiency, inequality, food security and welfare. Against this background, this paper aims to provide the necessary empirical content to back policies in these areas. Indeed, most of these policies generally have weak empirical dimensions and providing evidence that informs us on the specific relationship between promoting diversification through nonfarm engagement and market participation is worthwhile. Against this background, the current study examines the effect of nonfarm activities on market participation of farmers in Ghana. In other places, however, empirical studies have been conducted on the effect of nonfarm engagement on market participation just as this present study aims at achieving. For example, Kan et al. (2006), Tudor and Balint (2006), and Woldehanna et al. (2016) have conducted studies on the link between nonfarm activity and market participation. However, these studies are largely descriptive or focus only on farmers who engaged in nonfarm activities. Other studies have focused on the linkage between nonfarm activities and income inequality, poverty reduction and food security (see, e.g. Alemu and Adesina 2017; Seng 2016; Hoang et al. 2014). Thus, this study contributes to the literature by its specific focus on market participation and it does so by using a modelling approach—the endogenous switching probit model—which allows us to examine the drivers of market participation of nonfarm participants and non-participants on one hand, and the estimates of the effect of nonfarm participation on farmer’s sale of crops in the market on the other. The rest of the paper is as follows. While the next section reviews relevant literature, theoretical and conceptual issues are presented immediately after it. The next section describes the method and data used and the following section discusses the main findings of the study. The final section then concludes with policy implications.",3

They were followed by a sharp decline in import volumes, a domestic price growth, and an increase in agricultural production and exports during the post-embargo years in Russia (International Trade Centre 2020; Rosstat 2020). The price changes in Russian food markets were a considerable consequence of the policies of 2014 (Ponomareva and Magomedov 2017; Volchkova and Kuznetsova 2019; Cheptea and Gaigné, 2020). Many previous studies investigated the food embargo in Russia in 2014 (Dillen 2015; Boulanger et al. 2016; Uzun and Loginova 2016; Gohin 2017; Kutlina-Dimitrova 2017; Banse et al. 2019; Fedoseeva and Herrmann 2019; Kadochnikov et al. 2019; Liefert et al. 2019; Volchkova and Kuznetsova 2019). Fewer studies aimed to investigate the other shocks of 2014 and quantify price effects in Russian food sectors (e.g. Kiselev et al. 2015; Götz and Jaghdani 2017; Cheptea and Gaigné 2020; Yugay et al. 2020). Previous studies agreed that after 2014, Russian food sectors destabilised in the short term, while Russian food production permanently grew at the cost of consumer depletion and with the benefits of financial support from the government (Kiselev et al. 2015; Shagaida and Uzun 2016). Because a currency shock may also affect domestic food prices (Dreger et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2019; Yugay et al. 2020), one should consider this exchange rate effect as an indirect impact of trade disruptions. In this article, we study how the economic interventions in 2014 contributed to price dependencies in the Russian meat markets. In particular, we analyse three exogenous interventions: (1) the pork ban, when Russia banned imports of live pigs, fresh pork, and other pig products from the EU; (2) the embargo, when the president of the Russian Federation introduced the food embargo as an ‘anti-sanctions’ measure; and (3) the exchange rate liberalisation of the Russian rouble. We hypothesise that these interventions affected domestic prices for producers, consumers, and trade owing to the loss of traditional and territorially close trade partners who previously had compensated the shortage or seasonality of domestic production in conditions of the stronger Russian currency. The hypothesis and the expectations about the results of the present study are in line with the previous observations on protectionist policies.Footnote 1 The empirical strategy of the present study is to estimate the changes in prices in the medium term considering the effects of price transmission and the studied interventions. We employ vector autoregression (VAR) models to study price transmission in a seven-year period. We have several reasons to focus our study on meat in Russia. Firstly, meat is among the main constituents in the diets of people in Russia, particularly if compared with vegetables and fruits (Shagaida and Uzun 2015b). Secondly, meat prices have less weather-driven seasonality and no seasonal production interruptions as is usually observed for crops. The absence of a clear weather pattern in the meat sector is a notable benefit in conditions of Russian agriculture and for the VAR specification. Thirdly, the meat prices are directly affected by bans, whereas eggs, root vegetables, and grains are only affected on the level of input prices, on which we do not focus.Footnote 2 Fourthly, since 2020, the large-scale producers of pork and poultry have organised the expansion of exports to the world marketsFootnote 3; therefore, the effects of substitution, protection, and currency on domestic prices could continue to be relevant mechanisms in the future. Finally, there are different degrees of self-sufficiency in Russian beef, pork, and poultry markets (Shagaida and Uzun 2015a, b), while these markets substitute each other. The difference in self-sufficiency and possible substitution effects could result in a different price behaviour during and after the events of 2014. We expect the strongest price changes in the import-dependent beef sector and weaker effects in the pork and poultry sectors.Footnote 4 Therefore, the novelty of our study is that we consider the effects of substitution, currency, and protection policies for different economic agents in the three meat sectors with different self-sufficiency. We present some background information and a review of previous studies in “The policies driving the Russian meat sector” section. Our data and method are described in “Data and empirical approach” section. Our results are presented in “Results” section, and “Discussion and conclusion” section  concludes the study.",1

Over the past 10 years, the area used for organic olive farming has more than doubled. Currently, approximately 20% of the world’s organic agricultural land is used for olive cultivation (Willer and Lernoud 2019). Olive cultivation is a major farming activity in the Mediterranean region, in which organic producers develop food and cosmetic products that are labeled with organic certification. The production of organic olives in this region has become increasingly significant, presenting a promising alternative for advancing agriculture (Tzouvelekas et al. 2001a). In the Mediterranean region, the diffusion of organic olive farming in Palestine has lagged behind, although olive cultivation is a major agricultural activity. The Palestinian Authority, in collaboration with international organizations and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), has been promoting organic agriculture, yet the distribution of organic areas remained at 7.5% in 2017, less than other that of Mediterranean producers such as France, Spain, Tunisia, and Turkey (Willer and Lernoud 2019). Severe geopolitical constraints under Israeli occupation, including a lack of market access and deterred diffusion of knowledge on organic farming, might have hindered its potential; however, other Mediterranean countries’ experiences imply that the diffusion of organic farming and development of organic certified products could offer an effective strategy, even in the occupied territories. Despite widespread interest in organic production and its significance, some studies have found organic farming methods to be characterized by lower yields and profits, higher fixed costs, and production inefficiencies (Kumbhakar et al. 1991; Cobb et al. 1999; Tzouvelekas et al. 2001a, b; Mayen et al. 2009; Oelofse et al. 2010; de Ponti et al. 2012). Several factors, including compliance with food safety regulations and stringent standards, may impose additional costs. In addition, higher labor costs are detrimental to organic production. In contrast, other studies have suggested that organic methods have a positive impact on the technical efficiency of olive farming. Tzouvelekas et al. (2001a) discovered organic olive-growing farms in Greece to exhibit a higher degree of technical efficiency and lower costs than conventional farms. Galluzzo (2014) suggested that organic olive farms in Italy were more efficient and productive than conventional farms. Artukoglu et al. (2010) asserted that the yields and technical efficiency of organic olive farms exceeded those of conventional farms in Turkey. Regarding profits, Berg et al. (2018) found that organic olive farming in Greece was more profitable than conventional farming, primarily because of the higher market price of organic olive oil. While olive yields from organic and conventional farms do not significantly differ, organic olive farming may still promote higher efficiency. Several studies of the Mediterranean region reported on the higher productivity and efficiency of organic olive farming; however, they fail to consider the potential endogeneity bias due to self-selection in adopting the organic method. As the observed and unobserved heterogeneity of farms’ characteristics may affect the decision to adopt the organic farming method, the distribution of organic and conventional farms is not randomly assigned. Therefore, measured productivity and efficiency may be influenced by self-selection bias due to unobservables. In their analyses of dairy farms, Kumbhakar et al. (1991) and Sipilainen et al. (2005) addressed endogenous self-selection bias in organic farming, and Mayen et al. (2009) employed propensity score matching (PSM) to create quasi-experimental conditions for comparing organic and conventional dairy farms. Kumbhakar et al. (1991) developed an identification framework for the joint estimation of the technical efficiency of dairy farms in Finland and their endogenous selection of technological methods, either conventional or organic. The maximum likelihood method is used to estimate the parameters of production technologies, which are then used to estimate the efficiency of each organic and conventional farm. The authors found that conventional farms are, on average, more technically efficient than organic farms. Mayen et al. (2009) employed PSM to address self-selection into organic farming to compare the productivity and technical efficiency of organic and conventional dairy farms in the US. The authors found heterogeneous technology use among organic and conventional dairy farms in the US and that organic dairy technology is less productive but there is little difference in technical efficiency between the two types of farms. While some studies have addressed the selection bias problem, few relevant studies focus on the case of olive farming. Given the above, the objective of this study is to examine the effect of the adoption of organic farming on the technical efficiency (TE) of olive-growing farms. Using cross-sectional data of olive farm households collected from the Jenin Governorate of West Bank, we employ input-oriented data envelopment analysis (DEA) to compute TE. We employ the endogenous switching regression (ESR) method to reduce selection bias by controlling for both observed and unobserved heterogeneity (Shiferaw et al. 2014; Wossen et al. 2017). The aforementioned studies on olive production found organic farming to have a positive impact on productivity and efficiency (Tzouvelekas et al. 2001a; Artukoglu et al. 2010; Galluzzo 2014); however, the potential for endogeneity bias may remain due to the self-selection of adopting organic farming. This paper endeavors to fill this gap. We compute TE using the DEA approach wherein the efficiency scores of individual farms are measured based on the distance from the use of the identical production technology. We compare the TE of organic and conventional farms, assuming that all farms are operating under the same production frontier; however, comparisons of TE scores across farms are only meaningful if the production frontiers of these two groups are identical. If organic farms are operating under different production frontiers than conventional farms, TE scores are not directly comparable. To address this issue, we employ a metafrontier framework with directional distance functions proposed by Färe and Grosskopf (2000) and O’Donnell et al. (2008). In this framework, TE is evaluated relative to a shared metafrontier, which is defined as the boundary of an unrestricted technological set, whereas group-frontiers are defined as boundaries of restricted sets of technology. Hence, we apply a metafrontier DEA approach to compute the TE of organic, conventional farms with respect to global technology and group-specific technology. Most efficiency studies using the DEA approach have assumed the adoption of common production technologies in the operations of olive-growing farms (Amores and Contreras 2009; Artukoglu et al. 2010; Fousekis et al. 2014; Berg et al. 2018; Niavis et al. 2018). In contrast, we found several studies that assume the presence of different production technologies by using the directional distance functions approach. Beltrán-Esteve (2013) applied an input-oriented directional metadistance function to olive farms in Spain to evaluate the overall and input-specific efficiency of traditional rain-fed mountain and plain olive groves. Investigating olive oil manufacturers in Turkey, Ozden and Dios-Palmores (2016) employed a metafrontier approach to compare TE across different ownership structures. Regarding the production technology of organic and conventional olive farming, Tzouvelekas et al. (2001a) stressed in their analysis of Greek olive farms that organic olive farms face a different production frontier from that of conventional farms, while authors assumed that olive farms operate in the same production frontier. In Palestine, organic farms not only have more access to knowledge related to organic farming including knowledge on soil preparation and compost making, but also develop sales and marketing channels including exports. For the diffusion of organic farming, the Cannan Fair Trade Organization actively extends services to local farms and tries to develop a direct link between individual farms and global consumers. Due to advantages of access to various agricultural information, it is rational to assume that production technology is heterogeneous between organic and conventional farms. Previous studies have not considered the heterogeneity of production technologies of olive growers. For instance, Kashiwagi (2017) estimated a stochastic production frontier of olive-growing farms in Jenin to compare the TE of irrigated and nonirrigated farms, and Kashiwagi (2020) investigated the impact of joining agricultural cooperatives on their productivity and efficiency; however, a nonparametric approach was not employed, nor was the impact of organic farming examined. These studies did not employ a directional metadistance function approach. To our knowledge, few studies have examined the impact of organic farming on the TE of olive-growing farms using a metafrontier framework. Bertran-Esteve and Reig-Martinez (2014) employed metafrontier approach to compare the efficiency of conventional and organic methods for citrus production. The authors found that the distance between the level of efficiency on each group-specific frontier and metafrontier is wider in organic than conventional citriculture. Using metafrontier approach, Aravindakshan et al. (2018) found that the adoption of conservation over traditional tillage affected the technical efficiency of wheat production in South Asia. While these studies applied the metafrontier approach, they do not focus on olive cultivation. For the application to olive-growing farms, Bertran (2013) used metafrontier approach. They found an advantage of the plain olive grove system over the rain-fed mountain olive grove system, but this study did not compare organic and conventional olive farming. In the present study, we assume that adopting organic farming has a positive impact on the TE of olive production. Our hypothesis also asserts that organic olive farming is more efficient with respect to labor and other inputs than conventional farming. It is not only for olive but also for other agricultural products that organic farming method is generally regarded as technically inefficient and require more cost. Our empirical analysis shed light on this issue, using olive production as example. From a policy perspective, we emphasize the significance of adopting organic farming. The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), State of Palestine formulated a “National Strategy for Olive and Olive Oil Subsector” in 2014 under the National Agricultural Sector Strategy “Resilience and Development” of 2014–2016. Under this strategy, eight specific objectives were addressed, including improving production and productivity per unit of land, water, labor, and investment; reducing production costs; developing farmers’ associations and cooperatives; improving labeling and branding; and making the best use of profitable niche markets, such as organic and Fair Trade markets (MOA 2014a). Organic agriculture is considered a targeted means to increase value added and explore new markets (MOA 2014b). In view of the strategic importance of the olive sector for Palestinian agricultural development, we emphasize the promotion of organic olive production as a promising direction, despite the region’s severe geopolitical constraints. In addition, empirical evidence from Jenin of the West Bank that supports efficiency of organic olive farms may have relevant implications that the promotion of organic farming is effective strategy to improve olive productivity throughout the Mediterranean region. The remainder of this paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 presents the data collection method used. We explain the models used as an identification strategy in Sect. 3. Section 4 presents the empirical results, which are followed by a discussion in Sect. 5. Section 6 summarizes our conclusions. Agricultural operations and management in Palestine are constrained not only by climatic conditions but also by geographical and political factors under Israeli occupation. First, the West Bank in Palestine itself has a small area where agricultural land is about 1,105 square kilometers. As most agricultural land locates in mountainous area, the opportunity of land expansion is limited. Second, the West Bank locates mostly in the Mediterranean climate zone with annual precipitation between 300 and 500 mm. Compared to Egypt, Jordan and Israel, annual rainfall in the mountainous area of West Bank is more but water resources are extremely scarce for the Palestinian side due to the limitation of use of groundwater. The Israeli civil administration which governs the occupied territories rarely approves the application of drilling new well proposed by Palestinian Authority. While it is allowed to rehabilitate existing wells and to construct water harvesting facilities and cisterns for collecting rainfall, the development of new well is severely restricted. Third, the West Bank is divided into Area A under the Palestinian National Authority (PNA), Area B which is semi-autonomous area administered by the PNA and Israel, and Area C which is fully administrated by Israel. In Area C that makes up over 60% of the West Bank, Jewish settlement has been constructed, which results in the isolation of Palestinian land in the occupied territories. Moreover, the Israeli government started building a separation barrier (separation wall) along the Green Line and inside parts of the West Bank. Due to the growing Jewish settlement and extension of the separation wall, movement of Palestinian people, their access to agricultural inputs and markets are severely constrained. Under such geographical and political situation, it is difficult to expand land, develop new water resources, and procure agricultural inputs including fertilizers and modern varieties. In addition, the Israeli civil administration imposes restrictions on import of dual use goods including chemical fertilizers which are used for civilian purposes. These constraints severely hinder the possibility of development of agriculture in the West Bank, where most smallholders suffer from unstable production and uncertainties, limited access to modern inputs, finance and export markets. Nevertheless, the development of organic farming is considered as one of the effective directions for agricultural development. The role of organic farming becomes extremely important for adding value to the current production and for expanding access to international markets. The dual use restriction on chemical fertilizers has been conversely promoting adoption of organic farming. Within agricultural sector, cultivation of olives and olive oil extraction have a strategic position and have a significant relevance in production, job creation and export. Olive production comprises about 3.5% of agriculture production value (MOA, 2014b). They identified olive cultivation and olive oil production as one of the main subsectors for agriculture development. While olive harvest is highly volatile, olive oil has a significant export potential among tradable goods in Palestine (UNCTAD, 2011). Currently, the MOA designed “National Strategy for Olive and Olive Oil Subsector in Palestine” and “Olive Oil Sector Export Strategy 2014–2018” to identify the specific role of olive and olive oil sector. In these sectoral development strategies, the role of organic olive farming was addressed to improve productivity, competitiveness, and efficiency in the olive oil value chain. In the sectoral export strategy, exploitation of marketing advantages of Palestinian olive oil including high quality, natural organic production and fair trade is regarded as important vision to realize its export potential (MOA 2014b). Despite the strategic importance of olive production and organic farming in particular, the current level of production remained low in comparison with the nearly identical climatic conditions such as Israel and Jordan. The average land productivity in Israel was from 1.5 to 2.5 tons per hectare, while it ranged from 0.4 to 2.4 tons in Palestinian (UNCTAD 2015). Jordanian olive farming realized about 16.9% higher yield than that of Palestine (MOA 2014b). According to the MOA, the land productivity lagged behind compared with their potential but it is possible to improve by 30–40% as far as farmers adopt the appropriate technologies (MOA 2014b). Production cost of olive farming in the West Bank is roughly 30% higher than those in Jordan (World Bank 2006). This low productivity and higher cost imply inefficiencies exists in olive production. The distance between current output and the maximum possible output with available inputs and given technology is huge. Hence, it is meaningful to quantify how organic farming affects technical efficiency and whether olive farmers are efficient in terms of labor and other inputs. To this end, we employ the input-oriented efficiency evaluation to measure the level of efficiency of both organic and conventional farms, and to estimate the impact of the adoption of organic farming. Reduction of inputs while maintaining a current output is crucial to improve efficiency under severe constraints. We emphasize organic farming is one of the promising directions under Israeli occupation. To quantify the magnitude of impact of the adoption of organic farming on technical efficiency provides empirical evidence that support the national olive oil strategy.",

A condition when humans do not have sufficient access to safe and nutritious food to achieve average growth, development, and health is referred to as food insecurity (Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 2020). The condition may hinder an individual or a household’s ability to develop in terms of education, health, and employment, limiting access to a decent income and ultimately leading to extreme poverty (FAO 2020). The FAO defined four aspects of food security; food availability, food accessibility, food utilization, and food stability. Respectively, these aspects are defined as the availability of sufficient food in quantity and quality through production or imports (including food assistance), the availability of access to adequate food resources for every individual, the ability to utilize food to obtain the nutrients needed for daily life, and the ability for each individual to access sufficient food at all times. If these conditions are not met, it can lead to food insecurity. In Indonesia, the issue of household food insecurity still needs attention. The latest World Food Programme (2022) annual report stated that 4.85% of households throughout the country experience moderate to severe food insecurity, with a higher prevalence in women and girls at 13.48%. Data from the Central Statistics Agency of Indonesia (Badan Pusat Statistik, BPS) also show that the prevalence of insufficient food consumption in Indonesia reached 8.34% in 2020. This figure has increased compared to the previous year’s 7.63%. Indonesia’s hunger index, assessed through the Global Hunger Index (GHI), has decreased since 2006. However, the country ranked 70th out of 107 countries in 2020. Although the hunger index in Indonesia has a declining trend, its level is still higher than that of other Southeast Asian countries such as Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and the Philippines. Thus, it is evident that Indonesia’s attempts to decrease food insecurity are still lagging. Previous studies have found that internet access decisively influences household welfare (Ma et al. 2019; Leng et al. 2020; Siaw et al. 2020), particularly food security (Jere and Maharaj 2017). Bowman et al. (2014) mention that technology, information, and communication, including cellular telephones, radio, TV, computers, and satellite systems, have positively contributed to achieving global food security. According to Adeniji (2010), internet technology can be a two-way communication tool. It is used to exchange product information between the government and farmers; and communicate between farmers and other farmers, leading to a potential reduction in food insecurity. Information and communication technology are also known to increase food security through access to information. Namubiru et al. (2018) show that households in Uganda that use technology, information, and communication to access agricultural and market information can improve their food security status. Empirical studies focusing on the effect of internet access or use on food insecurity typically found a negative effect (Anser et al. 2021; Twumasi et al. 2021; Xue et al. 2021). The present literature still lacks discussions on Indonesia, as it concentrates on general welfare, particularly internet use's effect on household income (Ariansyah 2018; Rahayu and Riyanto 2020; Gurning and Khaliqi 2021). Therefore, there is a need for a study focusing on the impact of internet use on food insecurity in Indonesian agricultural households. The present research differs from the previous ones regarding food insecurity measurement. The Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) is a new global standard to compare the severity of food insecurity between countries (FAO, 2013). This study will measure food insecurity using a direct approach, in contrast to the measurements in the prior studies, which used indirect approaches, such as expenditure on calorie intake, food consumption, and food diversity (Adeyanju et al. 2023; Twumasi et al. 2021; Xue et al. 2021). The indirect approach to measuring food insecurity cannot be used to compare food insecurity between countries due to an indefinite method for classifying foods. Moreover, the indirect techniques have a high possibility of measurement errors, take a long time to measure since consumption patterns must be recorded in detail, and produce biased results due to inaccuracies in determining food items, groupings, portion sizes, and intake frequency (Fawole & Ozkan 2017). According to FAO, using FIES as a food insecurity measurement method has several advantages. It directly inquires individuals or households about food insecurity experiences, ease of use, and lowers costs compared to other methods. It can also describe the severity of food insecurity and provides basic information for policymakers. From a methodological point of view, potential endogeneity problems may arise in examining the impact of internet use on food insecurity in agricultural households. Agricultural household decisions using the internet may be “self-selected” so that they are not randomly distributed (Twumasi et al. 2021; Xue et al. 2021). Households that desire to increase agricultural productivity will use the internet to obtain information on increasing household productivity and income. On the other hand, households may decide not to use the internet and choose a different method. Unobservable factors influence internet use decisions and are likely to affect food security, such as social networks, skills, or motivation (Xue et al. 2021). According to Crown (2014), these problems may cause selection bias and produce endogeneity problems. Therefore, this study will use the instrumental variable (IV) approach to ensure the results are robust to endogeneity. The present study examines internet use's effect on food security. Furthermore, it will also determine whether income acts as a mediator for the role of internet use on food security. The research is expected to contribute to providing empirical evidence about food security for agricultural households. Addressing the measurement error and endogeneity issues, the present study will undertake the abovementioned measures, such as using FIES to measure food insecurity and employing the two-stage least square estimation with instrumental variables to estimate the effect of internet use on food insecurity.",
11.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,20 July 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-023-00267-6,Modeling inequality in access to agricultural productive resources and socioeconomic determinants of household food security in Ghana: a cross-sectional study,December 2023,Duah Dwomoh,Kofi Agyabeng,Richmond Aryeetey,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The 2016 Africa Human Development Report showed that gender inequality costs sub-Saharan Africa approximately 95 USD billion per year (Anderson et al. 2021). The lack of resources and opportunities for women in agriculture in developing countries explains the underperformance of the agricultural sector (FAO 2013). The desire of women to be involved in agriculture, and entrepreneurship remains undoubtedly high. However, almost everywhere they face more severe constraints than men in accessing productive resources, markets, and services (FAO 2017; Singh 2014). This gender gap hinders the likelihood of achieving the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 of ending all forms of hunger and malnutrition by 2030, lowers productivity and reduces their contributions to the agricultural sector and the achievement of broader economic, and social development goals (Nakai 2018). The impact of changing climate, food economics including the fluctuations in food prices, growing global population inadequate access to agricultural productive resources and environmental stressors will have significant yet uncertain impacts on food security in the next decades. According to the Ghana Living Standard Survey (GLSS) (GSS 2018), extreme poverty (individuals whose total expenditure falls below GH¢ 792.05 per month) is more prevalent in rural Ghana where women are most vulnerable to poverty and malnutrition compared to urban areas. An estimated 2.2 million persons live in extreme poverty in rural areas. The GLSS report for 2016/2017 indicated that the poverty incidence was approximately 43% among households whose heads are self-employed in the agricultural sector (GSS 2018). Poverty in Ghana is more prevalent in households that own farms compared to non-farm households. The poverty rate among households whose heads are engaged in agriculture was higher than even the unemployed, retired, or inactive (GSS 2018). Women in rural communities across the globe are constantly confronted with low socioeconomic status, the power to make informed decisions and low self-esteem arising from gender stereotyping (Afzal et al. 2009) and Ghana is no exception. Although the percentage of women involved in agriculture is 41.3%, empirical evidence from the literature shows that women have lower access to agricultural productive resources (credit and extension services, fertilizers, improved seeds, mechanical equipment, and machinery) (FAO 2013). There is evidence that women are more likely than men to be involved in agriculture in part-time, occasional and low-paying jobs and to receive lower wages for the same type of work, even if they have similar experience and qualifications to men (FAO 2013). The hindrance to accessing agricultural productive resources largely emanates from the cultural orientation and practices that identify males as ‘heads of households and females as “contributing family workers” in most countries in sub–Saharan Africa (SSA) (GSS 2015). These practices strengthen the uneven and hierarchical relationships between men and women, especially, in rural areas. Thus, women are limited in power, decision-making opportunities and resources and fulfillment of their rights. These negative tendencies may expose them to low self-esteem and confidence with dire consequences on poverty, high costs for the agricultural sector, food security and economic growth. Improving access to agricultural input services (including improved seedlings and new technologies) through gender empowerment can contribute to poverty reduction, improved food security, and nutrition among women (FAO 2017). The 2011–2013 report from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations indicated that closing the gender gap in agriculture would generate increased yields on women's farms, raise the total agricultural output, especially in developing countries, and significantly reduce the number of people suffering from hunger in the world (FAO 2013). Although some studies (deCampos et al. 2016; Doss et al. 2014; Kabeer 2016) have assessed the inequalities in access to agricultural productive resources in different countries across SSA and concluded that women are generally disadvantaged, there is contradictory evidence in some cases that showed that women had equal access to productive resources such as land, agricultural inputs and even in some cases, higher control of household income than their male counterpart (GSS 2015). This counter-argument raises the need to explore further the impact of geography and the context that enshrines sociocultural norms and their relative effect on women's access to agricultural productive resources. Admittedly, few studies have been conducted in Ghana on this issue, but these studies were limited in scope and geographic boundaries (Ahmed et al. 2016; Nyantakyi-Frimpong 2020; Ragsdale et al. 2018). Almost all the studies that were reviewed assessed gender inequality differentials in the northern part of Ghana due to extreme poverty levels that may be similar to or even lower than poverty levels in coastal and non-coastal rural communities in the Central region of Ghana. Furthermore, to ensure that country-specific agricultural policies tackle the gender aspect more explicitly, we need to collect up-to-date data on the realities faced by rural women and men to inform policy development. As emphasized by the FAO, there is an urgent need to use findings from research to promote policy dialogue among various stakeholders with adequate participation of women (FAO 2017). Studies sometimes attribute geographic location to food security which is justified due to soil and climate related factors (Hossain and Majumder 2018; Islam et al. 2020), but we current do not know how socioeconomic status mediate that effect. For instance, the geographical effect may not be about living in coastal or non-coastal area but perhaps people who live in coastal communities are poorer compared to non-coastal community and that may contribute to the observed relationship. In other words, intervention must target poverty alleviation in those communities to reduce food insecurity. Thus, this study sought to quantify the levels of inequality in the access to agricultural productive resources and food security in coastal and non-coastal rural communities, women empowerment, and gender. We further estimated the impact of women's empowerment on access to agricultural productive resources. To better understand the underlying mechanisms of the relationship between geographical location (coastal versus non-coastal) and food security, we explored the mediation effect of socioeconomic status using household wealth as a proxy to measure socioeconomic status.",

A transaction cost economics analysis of coffee farmers in Mexico,December 2023,Carlos Omar Trejo-Pech,Roselia Servín-Juárez,Álvaro Reyes-Duarte,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Agricultural cooperatives are often referred to as structures that contribute to social and economic development, particularly for rural poor and marginalized groups (Bijman and Wijers 2019). A recent review of the literature on agricultural cooperatives concluded that farmer cooperatives are flawed and complex business organizations that nonetheless have a positive economic impact on their members (Grashuis and Su 2019). According to this review, the increased bargaining power of cooperatives pooling many farmers’ production and input needs contributes to improving farm-gate input and output prices for farmer members. The review also found that membership in a cooperative tends to increase productivity and product quality at the farm level due to the increased access to inputs such as fertilizers and the technical knowledge that cooperatives provide. Regarding the effect of cooperative membership on household income—which captures a combination of increased productivity, input access, technical expertise, yields and quality, off-farm work opportunities, and in general, transaction costs and benefits of cooperative membership—Grashuis and Su (2019) found mixed results, with studies reporting positive, negative, or neutral effects.
 Despite the potential economic benefits of agricultural cooperatives, many farmers decide not to join cooperatives, although given the opportunity (Zeweld-Nugusse et al. 2013; Milford 2014; Abate 2018). Further, in some cases, even farmers already affiliated with cooperatives decide not to use the cooperatives’ services (Pascucci, Gardebroek, and Dries 2012; Abate 2018). Understanding this behavior is puzzling and is sometimes explained by the fact that cooperative membership or cooperative affiliationFootnote 1 involves relatively high transaction costs for farmers (Ménard and Valceschini 2005; Bernard and Spielman 2009; Pascucci, Gardebroek, and Dries 2012; Ciliberti et al. 2020), and cooperatives play diverse functions for farmers varying across countries and crops (Grashuis and Su 2019). Thus, cooperative membership research from the lens of transaction cost economics (TCE) theory on specialized cooperatives—managing one crop rather than several agricultural products—should contribute to understanding the puzzling behavior of some farmers deciding not to affiliate with cooperatives despite the potential benefits these organizations provide. Our study addresses this concern, specifically contributing to the literature on the economics of coffee in two ways: (1) proposing and testing a TCE-based model that explains the farmer’s decision to affiliate with coffee cooperatives and (2) analyzing whether the cooperative affiliation decision impacts the farmer’s cash holdings. These contributions fill gaps in the coffee cooperatives literature. First, while the TCE framework is commonly used to model the cooperative affiliation decision in agricultural—other than coffee—cooperatives, we could not find any coffee-related paper modeling the cooperative affiliation with TCE or any other distinct theoretical framework. Because of this, there is a lack of consensus on what factors explain the farmer’s cooperative affiliation decision, according to the four coffee-related papers we identified as closely related to our study (Grashuis and Skevas 2022; Ortega et al. 2019; Mojo et al. 2017; Shumeta and D’Haese 2016).Footnote 2 Therefore, our study represents the first attempt to model the cooperative affiliation decision based on TCE in the coffee sector. Modeling the cooperative affiliation/membership in the coffee sector is worthwhile because, unlike other crops, niche coffee markets related to the specialty coffee market, shade-grown coffee, fairtrade, and organic certifications make this a specialized commodity. Our second contribution is also relevant to the economics of the coffee sector because the literature reports that coffee cooperatives cannot afford to fully pay farmers for their coffee beans at harvesting and selling time while intermediary buyers can (Bacon 2005; Milford 2014; Luna and Wilson 2015; Arana-Coronado et al. 2019; Mwambi et al. 2020). Thus, it is commonly argued that the lack of immediate full-payment capacity affects the farmer-cooperative relationship causing problems such as side-selling and disincentives for farmers to join cooperatives in the first place. However, previous research has not evaluated whether the coffee cooperative farmers (i.e., the cooperative affiliation decision) are worse off than non-cooperative farmers regarding cash holdings when harvesting and selling. This study has two related objectives. We first propose and test a coffee cooperative membership model explaining the coffee farmer’s decision to join a cooperative or operate as a non-cooperative farmer (i.e., this is what we refer in this paper as the cooperative membership or cooperative affiliation decision). The coffee cooperative affiliation model is based on the transaction cost economics theory (Williamson 1983, 2010). TCE predicts that economic agents choose a particular organization mode or business structure to conduct their business based on attributes of transactions. The model is tested with primary data collected from Mexican coffee farmers affiliated and peers not affiliated with cooperatives. Our results suggest that indeed TCE attributes, further explained in the following sections, statistically explain the coffee cooperative membership or affiliation decision. In addition to modeling the cooperative affiliation decision, the second objective of this study is to investigate if coffee cooperative affiliation has an economic impact on farmers’ output. Specifically, using propensity score matching (PSM), we evaluate what group of farmers is more likely to experience cash shortness around coffee harvesting and selling time to cover household consumption or farm working capital needs. PSM pairs coffee cooperative and non-cooperative farmers with similar observable characteristics. This research question is relevant in light of prior research documenting that one of the disadvantages of coffee cooperatives over intermediaries is that the former are not able to fully pay the farmer at harvest time, while local intermediaries can (Bacon 2005; Mujawamariya et al. 2013; Milford 2014; Luna and Wilson 2015; Arana-Coronado et al. 2019). Farmers may perceive the inability of cooperatives to fully pay them at harvest time as problematic, potentially causing cash shortness. Cash shortness relates to higher production costs due to working capital financing, may constrain the adoption of best agricultural practices due to a lack of resources, or may cause farmers to side-sell part of their harvested coffee at lower prices to obtain quick cash. At the household level, cash shortness may cause farmers to acquire short-term debt, with the consequent costs this represents. Furthermore, if farmers perceive that cooperative farmers are more likely to experience cash shortness than non-cooperative farmers, farmers may decide not to affiliate with cooperatives in the first place, forgoing other benefits. However, this study finds no impact of cooperative affiliation on cash shortness. The following section presents a background on coffee cooperatives followed by the theoretical framework based on TCE. The fourth section describes the data collection and presents the models. Next, we provide and discuss the two main sets of results. A final section concludes the paper.",
11.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,19 April 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-023-00255-w,Assessment of inequality in the Common Agricultural Policy in Portugal,December 2023,Miguel Viegas,Jan Wolf,Francisco Cordovil,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The distribution of support between farmers and between regions is, currently, one of the most critical aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). This profoundly skewed distribution is the result of the main guidelines of the CAP in the initial phase of its implementation. Since its creation, the CAP has adapted to a constantly evolving internal and external context. In the period between 1962 and 1992, a production-oriented CAP prevailed, aiming to solve the problem of European dependence on food (Gay et al. 2005). In its initial phase, the CAP generated an intensive production model that was increasingly dependent on synthetic additives, many of which are highly harmful to public health (Lowe et al. 1999). At the same time, it caused huge production surpluses, which had to be sold on the world market at subsidized prices (Ackrill 2000). This created a huge burden for the Community budget, which tripled between 1980 and 1992 (Grant 1997). From the 1980s onwards, the CAP became unsustainable. The Uruguay Round was an important impetus for the first major CAP reform led by Agriculture Commissioner MacSharry in 1992 (Patterson 1997). The MacSharry reform reduced support prices for the first time. Farmers were compensated for the expected income loss through the introduction of partially coupled direct payments. In 1999, the European Council decided to complete the CAP with a second pillar dedicated to rural development. Its creation resulted from the need for accompanying measures to the 1992 reform: early retirement, agri-environmental measures, and afforestation, as well as aid schemes for disadvantaged areas. The first regulation (2000–2006) focused its priorities on the competitiveness of agriculture and its multifunctionality, on the promotion of environmental protection, forestry, and sustainable development and on the socio-economic development of rural areas (Baldock et al. 2001). With the 2003 CAP reform (2003 mid-term review of agenda 2000), subsidies were decoupled from production and replaced by the Single Farm Payment (SFP). The new payments were based on historical farm production. The economic rationale is that decoupled payments do not influence production decisions of farmers and allow free determination of market prices (Grant 2010). The amounts paid per hectares were calculated based on historical productions between 2000 and 2002 and remained unchanged until the 2013 reform, in favor of larger and more profitable farms. This decoupled payment ended up fixing the inequalities (Erjavec et al. 2011). The 2013 reform, applied in the 2014–2020 MFF, ended the Single Payment and its historical backing and launched the greening payment. This was replaced by the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS), the amount of which is subject to a process of internal and external convergence aimed at a uniform payment per hectare throughout the European regions (Ciliberti and Frascarelli 2018). Today, despite the efforts of the European Union (EU), it is imperative to recognize that unacceptable inequalities in the distribution of direct CAP support remain. The European Commission estimates that 20% of farmers benefit from 80% of the CAP support (Garcia-Bernardo et al. 2021). In Portugal, according to data from 2020 released by the IFAP (Agriculture and Fisheries Financing Institute) and available on the European Commission’s website, 65% of beneficiaries with 6.8% of the area received 12.5% of direct support, while 1.5% of the largest beneficiaries, holding 43.5% of the area, received 32.8% of the direct support. Aware of this problem, the European Commission proposes a greener, fairer, and more flexible CAP for the period 2021–2027 (Pe’er et al. 2020). Increasing farmers' income and promoting a fairer distribution of support is one of the nine main objectives of the new post-2020 CAP (even if, due to delays in the negotiations, the new rules only apply in 2023). To promote a fairer distribution, the new regulation proposes a cap on aid, a more ambitious redistributive payment aimed at rewarding smaller farms, support for young farmers and the continuation of internal and external convergence. Several studies show that the redistributive payment of the 2013 reform had a positive, but limited, effect within the EU (Hanson 2021). The article assesses the distribution inequality of CAP support in Portugal, with three relevant contributions. Firstly, it draws up a comparative study that evaluates the present distribution of aid with that which will result from the application of the rules coming into force on January 1, 2023. Secondly, it uses the totality of registered farmers in Portugal as opposed to existing statistics that use only farmers who are within the support system, leaving out thousands of properties. As a third contribution, a synthetic inequality index adapted to the fundamental objectives of the CAP is proposed. Currently, many accuse the CAP of subsidizing profitable farms, to the detriment of others located in disadvantaged territories where they provide relevant environmental services, but which are not remunerated by the market. This new indicator thus makes it possible to assess the distribution of support according to the CAP's fundamental goals in terms of employment, aid to vulnerable territories and rural development.",

The role of the EU Mountain Product term and other credence attributes in consumers’ valuation of lamb meat",December 2023,Leonardo Cei,Edi Defrancesco,Francesco Pagliacci,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Areas facing natural or specific constraints include mountains and other marginal areas characterized by difficult natural conditions connected to climate, morphology and soil, which in turn cause higher production costs, lower yields, limited possibilities for the expansion of farms and limited production alternatives; hence, the profitability of farming activities is hindered (Institute for European Environmental Policy 2006; Renner et al. 2021). Although the severity of these issues varies in different areas of the EU (Schuh et al. 2020), low profitability leads, in general, to high rates of termination of agricultural activities and to widespread land abandonment (Fayet et al. 2022; MacDonald et al. 2000; Sluiter and de Jong 2007) with severe socio-economic and environmental consequences (Zavalloni et al. 2021). Farmers in areas with natural constraints can adopt different strategies to improve their income (Bowler et al. 1996). They can integrate it through relying on off-farm jobs (García-Martínez et al. 2011) or introducing on-farm product differentiation, farming diversification through service provision (e.g. tourism) (Ilbery and Bowler 1998; Sharpley and Vass 2006) and integration of processing and direct selling in the farm (Knickel et al. 2016). Strategies based on on-farm product differentiation take advantage of specific product characteristics that might relate to a number of factors, such as the production methods, respect for animal welfare, or geographical origin. In this respect, farmers in mountain areas potentially have a large spectrum of opportunities to add value to their products in the eye of consumers. The less intensive methods of production (Teillard et al. 2012) as well as the use of less productive plant and animal landraces may be turned into value-adding factors thanks to consumers’ perception of mountain products as healthier and more environmentally friendly (Bernués et al. 2014; Zuliani et al. 2018). Moreover, local landraces have a strong link with local cultures and traditions (Bellon 2008) and are more adapted to the specific local environmental conditions (Colino-Rabanal et al. 2018). Hence, products from such local resources could also benefit from the growing interest of consumers for local food and its links with tradition. However, all these characteristics are credence attributes (Darby and Karni 1973), thus suffering consumers’ information asymmetry. This issue might limit the demand and willingness to pay (WTP) for products from the mountains if no specific signalling instrument is adopted to increase consumers’ awareness and trust, especially in the case of longer supply chains that involve large-scale retail. As a way to signal and valorize the mountain origin of the products, by differentiating them from flatland products, the European Union introduced the “Mountain Product” (MP) voluntary quality term in 2012 (Reg. (EU) no. 1151/2012). Ten years after the adoption of the EU Regulation on the MP term, the literature exploring consumers’ WTP for this label is still limited, as is research focusing on specific credence attributes of mountain products. Considering the importance of livestock rearing in mountain systems (Bernués et al. 2014), this paper contributes to this scarce literature by considering consumers’ attitudes towards three attributes that often characterize animal-based mountain products: i) the local landrace; ii) the mountain origin communicated through the MP term; and iii) the adoption of a specific livestock rearing practice, i.e. rotational grazing, which improves the stewardship of agroecosystems. An element of novelty of the paper is to consider the three attributes simultaneously in the evaluation. This paper focuses on lamb meat consumption, given that all the three aforementioned attributes can be associated with sheep rearing systems in North-Eastern Italian Alps. Through a choice experiment, the paper estimates consumers’ WTP for them on lamb meat. In addition, it explores how the WTP varies across distinct groups of consumers and how it is affected by consumers’ attitudes. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Sect. “State of the art”, we provide the state of the art of the scanty literature connected to the attributes under investigation. In Sect. “Methods”, we detail the methodology used in designing and conducting the choice experiment. In Sects. “Results” and “Discussion”, we present and discuss the results, while we conclude in Sect. “Conclusions and policy implications”.",
11.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,28 March 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-023-00250-1,Impact of informal institutions on youth agribusiness participation in Southern Benin,December 2023,Kadoukpè Gildas Magbondé,Djana Mignouna,Ayélé Odile Sossou,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"The agribusiness sector has been described as an avenue for sustainable development (United Nations Industrial Development Organisation [UNIDO] 2011; World Bank 2007) because it holds promise for job creation, particularly for women and the youths, and has the potential for income generation and improvement in the poor’s welfare (Adenle et al. 2017; Osabohien et al. 2021; Saridakis et al. 2021; White 2012; Yami et al. 2019). The livelihood of the poor improves as the agribusiness sector allows them to integrate commercial agricultural value chains and to access inputs and markets. Yet, agribusiness sector fosters innovation and technological progress (Nguyen et al. 2019; Ozaralli and Rivenburgh, 2016) and therefore projects itself as a promoter of economic growth more than pure agriculture does (Wilkinson and Rocha 2009). Furthermore, a developed agribusiness sector leads to food security (van Westen et al. 2019). Based on these attributes, the agribusiness sector represents a critical pathway to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by reducing poverty (SDG1), lowering hunger (SDG2), and promoting economic growth and decent work (SDG8). African countries are in a convenient position to harness advantages from a developed agribusiness sector, in terms of youth employment particularly. For instance, in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the livelihood of more than 600 million people depends on agriculture which employs 80 per cent of rural populations and represents 25 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) (Mukasa et al. 2017). In the Benin context where youth unemployment is a preoccupying issue (Afrobarometer, 2019), almost 70 per cent of the population secures their employment and livelihood from agri-related activities (Adjimoti 2018; Akrong and Kotu 2022). As agriculture features the country’s leading economic sector, a thriving agribusiness sector would absorb a great portion of the youth, curbing the rate of unemployment. Defined as all activities and services along the agricultural value chains, the agribusiness sector is regarded as a nest of job opportunities (Roepstorff et al. 2011). Therefore, above pure agriculture, agribusiness sector can provide a buffer against youth unemployment as it involves production, commercial, and manufacturing activities along agricultural value chains. Featuring an employment niche, the agribusiness sector has raised awareness among Beninese policymakers whose rhetoric then espouses its development.
 Despite the potential of agricultural sector in job creation, hurdles still hamper the youth participation in the agribusiness sector. The youths’ overall sentiment towards the agribusiness sector leans on a disinterest (Magagula and Tsvakirai 2020; Mulema et al. 2021). Mounting evidence suggests that most youths identify agricultural activities as laborious work with low productivity and earnings (Sumberg and Okali 2013; Yami et al. 2019). Furthermore, the dependence of the agriculture on rainfall and its low adherence to technology and capital (Akrong and Kotu 2022) make agri-related activities unappealing and unattractive to the youths. From White's (2012) perspective, the youths are driven away from agricultural livelihoods in rural areas due to their experience of de-skilling, the downgrading of rural life and the lack of infrastructure. More interested in off-farm occupations, rural youths are more likely to migrate to urban areas, worsening the already-high urban unemployment rate. Empirical evidence suggests that limited access to financial services, plots of land, technical knowledge and the youths’ negative perception of agribusiness sector are critical factors that hamper the youths from fully participating in the agribusiness sector (Akrong and Kotu 2022; Fox and Thomas 2016; Magagula and Tsvakirai 2020; Senou and Manda 2022; Sumberg and Okali 2013; Twumasi et al. 2019; Yami et al. 2019; Magagula and Tsvakirai 2020; Mulema et al. 2021). The current paper takes a new perspective in explaining the disenchantment of the youths towards the agribusiness sector. In a departure from previous empirical studies, this paper aims to evaluate the importance of informal institutions on youth participation in the agribusiness sector. The argument remains that the provisions of financial support, plots of land and agribusiness-based training sessions may be insufficient in driving the youths into the agribusiness sector. Therefore, inspecting the institutional environment that shapes the entire life of the youths and the choice of their careers is critical to obtaining ample broad insights. Institutions are indeed important for youth participation in the agribusiness sector as they are meant to reduce transaction costs and uncertainties. As such, institutions inform entrepreneurial decisions and provide incentives for productive activities (Baumol 1990; North 1990). As the behaviours and intentions of individuals develop and grow within a given institutional environment (Jack and Anderson 2002), institutions can predict participation in existing entrepreneurial opportunities (Muralidharan and Pathak 2017). Furthermore, the youths may desert the agribusiness sector if it is not socially valued and supported (Ephrem et al. 2021). Social desirability, self-expression and societal-level performance are critical for youths to venture into entrepreneurship (Dimitratos et al. 2004; Muralidharan and Pathak 2017; Stephan and Uhlaner 2010). Likewise, societal trust is a critical informal institution that could shape youth participation in the agribusiness sector. For instance, in a low-trust society, higher transaction costs and monitoring expenses restrict engagement in productive occupations. This paper contributes to the existing body of literature in two ways. First, though a growing body of empirical findings has linked institutions to entrepreneurial activities (Bouncken et al. 2009; Calza et al. 2020; Elert et al. 2017; Fuentelsaz et al. 2019; Muralidharan and Pathak 2017; Samadi 2019), the impact of informal institutions on youth agribusiness participation remains unexplored, to the best our knowledge. This paper bridges that gap by exploring the extent to which informal institutions affect the youths’ decision to venture into the agribusiness sector. Second, the research conducted so far in Benin to explain the youth participation in the agribusiness sector remains limited. For instance, the existing evidence that explored the hampering factors to youth participation in the agribusiness sector has mainly highlighted low access to funding (Akrong and Kotu 2022; Senou and Manda 2022). This paper goes beyond financial development and non-institutional factors, delving into informal institutions. Even though the importance of factors such as access to credit, land, and technical knowledge in triggering youth participation in the agribusiness sector should not be underestimated, the argument is that the quality of the institutions is instrumental to these factors and participation in the agribusiness sector. Therefore, ignoring institutions while researching the determinants of youth participation in the agribusiness sector would lead to omission variable bias. To avoid such bias in the estimates, the current paper positions itself at the interface of informal institutions and participation in the agribusiness sector. By reflecting on the impacts of informal institutions on youth participation in the agribusiness sector, this paper expands the frontier of the existing empirical findings in Benin. To stimulate youth participation in the agribusiness sector, policymakers continue to focus on access to credit and formal institutions at the expense of informal institutions. While setting more formal rules is relevant to unleashing entrepreneurial potentials, formal institutions may not be sufficient, as underlined by Muralidharan and Pathak (2017). Furthermore, while financial resources are prerequisites for participation in the agribusiness sector, proving financial means to the youths with low desirability to be involved in the agribusiness sector would prove inefficient and unable to guarantee stable and sustainable participation. Therefore, findings from this paper would be insightful for policymakers in undertaking measures that enhance pro-agribusiness informal institutions. The paper relies on the propensity score matching (PSM) technique to isolate the causal impact of informal institutions on youth participation in the agribusiness sector. The PSM, which is widely cited in the literature, has been useful to account for non-randomness in the treatment and therefore to extricate selection bias based on observables. In the baseline estimations, the standardised PSM estimates have been computed based on the nearest-neighbour and Kernel density matching algorithms. In the main estimation, a logistic regression analysis based on the matched sample has been utilised. For robustness checks, gender, access to credit, land and technical knowledge have been controlled for. The remainder of the article unfolds as follows: ‘Institutions and entrepreneurship: literature review’ section provides a brief literature review. ‘Method and data’ section outlines the methods and describes the data used. ‘Results’ section presents the results, and ‘Discussion of the main findings’ section discusses findings. ‘Conclusion and policy implications’ section concludes the paper and draws some policy implications.",

Evidence from soybean farmers in Northern Ghana,December 2023,Ayeduvor Selorm,D. B. S. Sarpong,Henry An,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Increasing the productivity of smallholder farmersFootnote 1 through the use of external inputs, such as fertilizer and improved seed, has been the priority of major agricultural development policies in Ghana over the last three decades (Houssou et al. 2017; Tanko et al. 2019). However, the strategy has resulted in mixed outcomes on poverty alleviation (Houssou et al. 2017). Though Ghana has made substantial gains in reducing the national poverty rate in half, from 56.5 to 23.4% between 1992 and 2018, a high incidence of poverty still exists in the three northern regions where it is between 54.8 and 70.9% (Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) 2018). This has led to a renewed interest in an alternative strategy to develop the rural areas that focus on market-oriented agriculture (MoFA 2015). Contract farming has been touted as an approach that has the potential to provide smallholder farmers with credits, inputs, and transfer improved technologies (Oya 2012; Otsuka et al. 2016). In the past three decades, contract farming has emerged as the most dominant institutional arrangement linking smallholder farmers to agricultural value chains (Barrett et al. 2012) and commercial markets both domestically and internationally (Kirsten and Sartorius 2002; Da Silva and Rankin 2013). Smallholder farmers with low education and limited access to land, credit, technical advice, and current information on market prices can benefit from contracting with large professional agribusiness firms through the reduction in transaction costs and risk (Barrett et al. 2012; Cahyadi and Waibel 2016; Ruml et al. 2021). These contractual arrangements have led to higher productivity for smallholder farmers in many less developed countries (LDCs) (Wang et al. 2014; Henningsen et al. 2015). Given the effort of policymakers in the drive toward achieving increased agricultural productivity and welfare through contractual arrangements, this study seeks to examine the impact of contract farming participation on the productivity of smallholder soybean farmers in northern Ghana. Early studies on contract farming focused on examining its impact on household welfare. Empirical evidence from these studies revealed that participating in contract farming increased household income (Miyata et al. 2009; Rao and Qaim 2011; Jones and Gibbon 2011), increased farm profitability (Mishra et al. 2016), increased household productive asset holdings (Michelson 2013), improved household food security and nutrition (Bellemare and Novak 2017; Debela et al. 2022) and improved subjective well-being (Dedehouanou et al. 2013). A common theme among these papers is that improving productivity can often lead to improved household welfare. However, there is a large amount of heterogeneity due to weaknesses in empirical approaches and widely different contexts (Bellemare and Bloem 2018). In the Ghanaian context, there is some evidence that contract farming in Maize did not lead to poverty alleviation or greater welfare as the higher input costs outweighed the benefits of greater yields (Ragasa et al. 2018). This shows that higher productivity is not a sufficient condition for improving overall welfare and that simply having a contract may not lead to poverty reduction. Nevertheless, improving overall productivity is still an important element, and a better understanding of the nature of and the extent to which contract farming can improve soybean output is one of the steps to a more-effective pro-poor strategy.Footnote 2 Technical efficiency (TE) refers to the extent to which input usage in the production of a given set of outputs is minimized, or obtaining maximum output from a given set of inputs (Kumbhakar et al. 2015). Having knowledge of the TE levels offers several benefits. Firstly, it can be used to rank producers and to identify under-performing producers or those performing near the efficient frontier. This is useful in designing agricultural development programs or subsidy programs aimed at improving the overall productivity levels of farmers, which can assist with government targeting programs. Secondly, further investigation can reveal drivers of higher performance among these producers. This helps to identify appropriate government policies and responses or identify processes and improved technologies that can be introduced to less efficient farmers (Kumbhakar et al. 2015).
 In Ghana, soybean is a key cash crop with vast potential to improve household nutrition, decrease poverty, and reduce of the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to cash income constraints (Dogbe et al. 2013; Osman et al. 2018). Additionally, the crop can make positive contributions to the development of the health, agricultural, and industrial sectors of the Ghanaian economy (MoFA 2020). The production of soybeans has been increasing for more than two decades as it has become a key raw ingredient for industrial purposes and a more important source of food for humans, livestock, and aquaculture (Gage et al. 2012; MoFA 2020). Unfortunately, these increases in soybean production have been largely due to the expansion of land area rather than increases in yields, a situation that limits the potential of the country to become self-sufficient in soybean production (MoFA 2020).
 Contract farming has the potential to improve the productivity of the soybean sector in Ghana. As has been shown in other settings, contract farming can lead to greater access to knowledge and improved technologies, productivity-enhancing inputs, credit, more stable output prices, and guaranteed market access (Henningsen et al. 2015; Meemken et al. 2020). Research on the impact of contract farming on TE has shown a positive effect in crops (González-Flores et al. 2014; Ragasa et al. 2018) and livestock (Simmons et al. 2005; Begum et al. 2013). However, there is significant heterogeneity across studies, which may be due to the modeling approach or institutional differences across countries and commodities (Wang et al. 2014). Another issue that can have an effect on the results is the presence of observable and unobservable biases when using a stochastic frontier model. González-Flores et al. (2014) show that unobserved factors in contract farming participation correlate with the white noise of the stochastic frontier model. Given that farmers self-select to participate in contract farming, this implies that productivity and TE outcomes can be subject to sample selection bias. Several recent studies have employed the sample selection SPF approach to examine the impact of technology adoption in Zambia and the Philippines (Abdulai and Abdulai 2017; Villano et al. 2015), evaluate project participation impact in the Ecuadorean Sierra (Gonzalez-Flores et al. 2014), as well as evaluate the effect of farmer groups on yields and efficiency of a rice farmers in northern Ghana (Abdul-Rahaman and Abdulai 2018). In this study, we investigate the impact of a large-scale contract farming program implemented by the Ghanaian government on the soybean sector in Northern Ghana. This research has important implications for the empirical literature. It investigates if contract farming, as an approach through which credit, inputs, and markets are easily accessible to the farmers, has an impact on the technical efficiency of smallholder soybean producers in developing nations. In addition to the novel empirical setting, we contribute to the literature by accounting for bias from both observable and unobservable factors using a two-stage approach. First, we use propensity score matching to reduce bias from observables; second, we estimate a stochastic production frontier model that addresses selection bias arising from unobservable variables.",
11.0,1.0,Agricultural and Food Economics,24 March 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40100-023-00249-8,The relationship between market information and entrepreneurial orientation: the case of smallholder honey producers in Northern Uganda,December 2023,Walter Amuko,Stephen W. Kalule,Walter Odongo,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Honey production is reportedly an important commercial enterprise for socioeconomic development and overall poverty alleviation (Berem et al. 2010; Kasangaki et al. 2022; Mujuni et al. 2012; Otim et al. 2018). As a socioeconomic product, honey is highly demanded for household consumption and it is widely used in medicinal and cosmetic products (Dossou et al. 2022; Kasangaki et al. 2022; Mbah 2012). Consequently, honey production has potential to contribute to food security and employment creation among smallholder producers (Sialuk 2014; Yadeta 2015). However, the potential of honey production has not been fully exploited in most developing countries such as Uganda, a fact attributed to marketing challenges (Dossou et al. 2022). Key marketing challenges include high transaction costs, inferior quality products, unreliable supplies and a general lack of marketing information (Kalanzi et al. 2018; Kumsa and Takele 2014; Masuku 2013). As such, smallholder honey producers persistently face marketing difficulties in spite of the existence of extensive market opportunities for honey (Kalanzi et al. 2015). These marketing constraints are related to finding appropriate buyers, processing technologies and product differentiation. Market information is an important tool that allows producers to identify and meet customer demands (Ajewole and Fasoro 2013). Access to timely and up-to-date market information therefore enable producers to make informed decisions regarding what, when, how and how much to produce (Keh et al. 2007). Besides its basic economic role, market information also allow producers to decide on which market to sell, what prices to charge, when to sell and how to package and distribute their products (Engotoit et al. 2016). Lack of relevant and timely market information negatively affects the performance of a farmer (Benard et al. 2014; Seenuankaew and Vongprasert 2015). A farmer therefore requires a comprehensive information related to buyer needs in order to effectively market their product or services (Ajewole and Fasoro 2013). Previous research suggests the critical role of market information in stimulating farmers’ entrepreneurial orientation. For instance, Keh et al. (2007) found that market information was as a mediator between entrepreneurial orientation and firm performance; and Keh et al. (2007) concluded that market information is an important factor in stimulating entrepreneurial orientation. As part of scanning and monitoring the operating environment, firms search for information that enables them to better meet their customer needs, create customer value, manage their risks, innovate, identify new marketing opportunities, as well as manage market competition. Whereas commercial firms typically have the potential to constantly search for market information, smallholder farmers, especially in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), usually lack such capacity. Particularly, smallholder farmer may fail to access quality information on market-desired product attributes. This has the possibility of negatively influencing their entrepreneurial orientation (Mugonya et al. 2021). Consequently, commercialization of honey production is likely to depend on smallholder farmer access to quality market information. Existing research on entrepreneurial orientation (EO) emphasizes the practice of innovativeness, proactiveness and risk taking as critical dimensions for strategic market-oriented decisions (Tirfe 2014; Konte et al. 2019). Although research has been done on different aspects of smallholder honey production such as honey value chain (Ndyomugyenyi et al. 2015; Kilimo-Trust 2012); technology adoption (Bukenya 2018; Otim et al. 2018; Kalanzi et al. 2015; Amulen et al. 2017a); and honey quality(Amulen et al. 2017b; Kugonza and Nabakabya 2008), limited studies exists on the influence of market information on entrepreneurial orientation. Understanding the role of market information need and the quality of market information farmers receive is critical if smallholder farmers are to profitably enter new or existing markets. This paper assesses the role of response to farmer market information needs and information quality in fostering entrepreneurial orientation of smallholder honey producers. The subsequent sections of this paper are organized as follows: The next section presents the conceptual framework and the associated hypotheses, followed by the study methodology, presentation of results, discussions and conclusions arising from the study. Finally, recommendation and limitations are discussed and suggestions for future research are given.",

While there have been several national and international efforts to achieve this goal, food insecurity remains a major livelihood challenge in many developing countries, particularly in Africa. A recent report by FAO (2021) indicates that about 21% of the African population faced severe hunger in 2020, doubling the proportion reported by other regions in the World. Also, over 50% of the population faces moderate to severe food insecurity (Gebre 2021; World Health Organization, 2019), representing one-third (799 million) of the estimated 2.37 billion people facing moderate to severe food insecurity in the World (FAO 2021). Compared to other regions, the prevalence of food insecurity is much higher in West and East Africa, where over 68% and 65%, respectively experience moderate to severe food insecurity (FAO 2021). While food security has received significant attention in the empirical literature in recent years due to the 2030 UN agenda (Masa et al. 2020), existing studies seem to be skewed toward the household, with scanty evidence on young adults. According to Sithole and Dinbabo (2016), youths, defined as people between 18 and 35 years old, belong to a vulnerable group subjected to high rates of unemployment, social segregation, stigmatization, and low incomes, which affect their livelihoods and economic status. Similarly, Hadley et al. (2009) described youth as a forgotten population experiencing a range of social, biological, and mental transitions as they shift into adult roles. Among other livelihood issues, living without food is a serious issue that disproportionately affects young Africans (Masa et al. 2020), who account for over 60% of the African population (African Development Bank et al. 2017). This corroborates Elgar et al. (2021) who posit that youth face moderate to severe food insecurity and other livelihoods, economic, and health risks resulting from the negative implications of severe food insecurity. It is worth noting that based on the relevance of agriculture to rural economies and, consequently, the livelihood of youths, concerted efforts are being made by both national and international stakeholders to promote agricultural employment among rural youths in Africa (Adeyanju et al. 2021a, b; Yami et al. 2019). Most of these efforts are being implemented to curb the rising rate of youth unemployment and ensure that rural youths engage in economic activities for better livelihood outcomes. For instance, the ENABLE-TAAT programme implemented by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) under the funding of the African Development Bank (AfDB) aims to help young farmers develop relevant agricultural and business skills to improve their livelihood and food security status. Thus, within this context, where strategies and efforts are ongoing to improve youth livelihoods through agriculture (Adeyanju et al. 2021a, b; Yami et al. 2019), it is important to assess their food consumption to ensure that their food security is also being addressed. This is because, compared to other categories of the population, food insecurity can be especially hard on young people maturing from adolescence into “emerging adulthood” (Larson et al. 2020). This is supported by Acheampong et al. (2022) who posit that farmers in rural areas experience heightened food insecurity and hunger despite growing and marketing food crops. Though studies have been conducted on youth food security in Africa, the bulk of available pieces of literature focus mostly on children, university students, and other socially vulnerable groups (Davidson and Morrell 2020; Larson et al. 2020; Leung et al. 2019; Loftus et al. 2021; McArthur et al. 2018; Ragasa et al. 2019; Tong et al. 2019) while studies on the food security status of young farmers are quite limited. The evidence that has been provided so far does not give grounds for adequate policy suggestions on young African farmers. This is because studies that considered young farmers across Africa are quite hard to find. Specifically, there is very limited peer-reviewed research on the level and determinants of food security among young farmers in developing countries. This highlights a critical evidence gap in a region where youths are more likely than adults to lack timely access to adequate food (Masa et al. 2020). Thus, it is imperative to empirically understand the depth and determinants of food security among young farmers from a demographic perspective to ensure that they are continuously being captured in food security debates. Furthermore, this evidence is important to dissociate youths enrolled in schooling from those engaged in economic activities since the latter may be less dependent on family members for their basic needs (Masa et al. 2020). Also, this evidence will inform timely and appropriate targeting of vulnerable youths and identify the unique factors to target to reduce food insecurity among young people. This study aims to generate empirical evidence that could guide policymakers and relevant stakeholders in addressing food insecurity among young farmers in Africa. Specifically, the study seeks to answer the following questions: 1. Do young farmers in Africa face food insecurity? 2. What are the determinants of food security among young African farmers? Also, the study was interested in gaining new insight into youths' food choices and sources while comparing these with the household consumption pattern found in other studies. For better insights, the result was disaggregated by gender to assess the common and different factors that influence food security among young male and female farmers. In answering these questions, the study adopted the World Food Programme’s (WFP) Food Consumption Score (FCS) based on the consumption frequency of specific food groups weighted based on their respective nutritional importance. Also, the determinants of food security were identified using a logistic regression model. The results show high consumption of starchy and fatty/oily foods against proteinous foods during the 7-day recall period, suggesting low dietary diversity which could be a result of high reliance on own production and rising food prices. Also, despite their engagement in food production, the results show that food insecurity was high among the youths, with the highest prevalence in Uganda. Among other factors, participation in agribusiness programmes, access to extension services, credit, and market information was relevant to food security. This implies that efforts to improve the food security status of young farmers must consider these factors for better outcomes. These results have clear implications for youth food security debates and policy, especially during this period of multi-faceted economic crisis and youth bulge. Within the context of this study, food security exists “when all people, at all times, have physical, social, and economic access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (FAO 2009, p. 1). This definition identifies four major dimensions of food security including availability, access, affordability, and utilization. Food availability denotes having sufficient food in both formal and informal markets which meet both individual and market demand. This also entails raising food production locally and through imports. Food accessibility is having sufficient resources (both economic and physical) to acquire sufficient foods needed for a nutritious diet (Acheampong et al. 2022). This entails an individual’s ability to obtain their food need on a timely and regular basis. In the case of smallholder farmers, food access is mostly facilitated through their own production, gifts, exchange, borrowing, food aid, and purchase. Evidence abounds that the majority of smallholder farmers largely depend on their own production which could limit their access to other food items they don’t produce (Huang and Tian 2019; Nchanji and Lutomia 2021). Food utilization entails how individuals or household use the food items available and accessible to them while food stability encompassed the other three dimensions, looking at steady availability, accessibility, and utilization of food at all times (Acheampong et al. 2022). According to van Meijl et al. (2020), it is not just the quantity of food available, but also the ability to access it physically and financially that matters, along with the ability to utilize food well through good processing and preparation practices and the stability of these three components at all times. While this definition of food security has been widely accepted, defining a common metric to identify the common factors influencing food insecurity across different countries, population categories, and age groups is lacking (Smith et al. 2017). This is because the root causes of food insecurity are multidimensional and difficult to understand, particularly in Africa (Kansiime et al. 2021), thereby raising the need to understand the depth and determinants of food (in)security across different ages and population categories (Wieck et al. 2014). According to Matavel et al. (2022), a critical aspect of strategies to achieve food security is the identification of food-insecure individuals or households and the characterization of the nature of their insecurity through measurements which will in turn provide a basis for monitoring the progress and impact of food security efforts. The current study aims to fill this research gap by assessing the food security status and identifying factors affecting food security among young African farmers. In achieveing this, the WFP’s FCS was adopted to measure food security based on its ability to accurately capture dietary diversity which is important to facilitate policy debates on youth food security. According to Masa et al. (2020), the research gap on youth food insecurity in Africa could be attributed to several factors, including the lack of suitable data and validated measures. While economic factors such as farm production and income are commonly linked to food security (Mulwa and Kabubo-Mariara 2022), this approach has been criticized since income is highly variable for those engaged in farming activities, suggesting a need to capture other relevant correlates such as socioeconomic, demographic, and institutional factors to inform effective targeting and practical policy on youth food security. For instance, some studies have found a significant link between food security and gender, social capital, and empowerment programmes (Devereux et al. 2020; George et al. 2020; Larson et al. 2019; Sseguya et al. 2018). According to Masa et al. (2020), the heterogeneity of the youth population depicts varying economic, physical, and social characteristics which could invariably influence their food security status in ways that differ from adults and other vulnerable groups. The authors argued that while youth in the lower age category (aged 15–18 years) may remain dependent on their parents or family members for food, the older ones are more likely to be less dependent, suggesting the need to examine the relevant factors influencing food security among this category. Also, in identifying these factors, it is equally important to consider their influence from a gender perspective since food allocation may be biased against young women, which could mean that they receive smaller portions or a less diverse diet (Aurino 2017). In essence, young women may be at risk of severe food insecurity compared to their male counterparts. This is supported by Harris-Fry et al. (2018) who attributed the gender bias in food allocation to varying degrees of resources at an individual or household’s disposal. Thus, in addition to identifying factors that influence food security among young farmers, we assessed whether significant socioeconomic correlates of food security varied by gender.",1

Ng’ombe,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Since the full legalization of hemp production and consumption in the USA by the 2018 Farm Bill, industrial hemp (i.e., hemp) farming has been growing in North America (Kraszkiewicz et al. 2019). Recent studies show that hemp has an economic potential to become a viable alternative crop for farmers (Cherney and Small 2016). Farmers can choose hemp over other agricultural commodities, especially for the crops that share farming conditions with hemp, such as wheat and the corresponding rotation crops (e.g., soybean and corn) (Adesina et al. 2020). The wheat–soybean rotation is one of the most conventional double-cropping methods (53% among all double-cropped acres) in the US agriculture (Borchers et al. 2014). This is supported by previous studies that suggest double-cropping has lower production costs and higher yields, residues, and glucose than single-variety cultivation (Caviglia et al. 2011). Also, soybean is one of the most common energy crops that is profitable for farmers (Hitaj and Suttles 2016). On the other hand, there is an argument for agronomic and economic potential of hemp. For example, Fortenbery and Bennett (2004) suggest hemp could be a more profitable crop than other row crops in the USA because of the country’s favorable agronomic and economic conditions. Also, some experiment studies contend that a wheat–hemp rotation could increase wheat yield by enhancing soil conditions (Struik et al. 2000; Gorchs et al. 2017; Adesina et al. 2020). Moreover, Cherney and Small (2016), Kraszkiewicz et al. (2019) and Parvez et al. (2021) show that hemp could be a sustainable bioenergy crop for biofuel and biochar. These findings suggest that hemp shares the role of soybean in a wheat–soybean double-cropping rotation. Thus, if hemp production was legalized in the USA, the farmers would have to replace soybean with hemp in the wheat–soybean double-cropping rotation order to increase their yield and profit. This implies that a potentially significant correlation over time between wheat, soybean, and hemp acreage is plausible. However, to the best of our knowledge, only a few studies consider the correlation between hemp and other crops (e.g., wheat) in terms of cultivation (e.g., Lambert and Hagerman 2022), and there is no study that examines the relationship between hemp, wheat, and soybean using time series analysis (i.e., cointegration). The cointegration between hemp and corresponding crops could affect farmers’ decisions on which crop to cultivate in the long-run (Mushtaq and Dawson 2002). Our study is therefore the first to attempt to close this important research gap. The purpose of this study is to examine the time series relationship of hemp, wheat, and soybean acreage to predict farmers’ decision when hemp is a legal alternative agricultural commodity. Based on previous research findings that hemp is a potentially profitable substitute for conventional double-cropping crops for wheat, this study demonstrates the choices that wheat and corresponding crop farmers would make in an environment where hemp is legal. Therefore, the results will provide policy implications for farmers and local governments considering hemp farming in areas where hemp has been legalized in recent years. To achieve our objective, we employ a Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) model and Bayesian impulse response analysis (BIRA) with a Minnesota priorFootnote 1 to resolve the limited data and subjective prior issues. While the USA has considered hemp as an agricultural commodity since 2018, unlike other agricultural commodities, there is neither a stable hemp market nor a sure way to predict farmers’ behavior to choose hemp (Mark et al. 2020). A Bayesian approach could remedy the insufficient sample size problem and could provide a more reliable and consistent estimation result than the frequentist estimation approach in time series analysis (Price 2012; Gelman et al. 2013; Wanless et al. 2015; McNeish 2016). Indeed, results from a Bayesian estimation could be manipulative if the results over-rely on a prior, i.e., subjective prior. Thus, we apply the Minnesota prior (i.e., Litterman prior) to address the subjective prior issue (Litterman 1979). We find partial complementary relationships between wheat and soybean acreage and a partial substitution relationship between hemp and wheat acreage. Moreover, our results show that hemp acreage responds to a positive shock with a significant increase on hemp acreage over years.",
