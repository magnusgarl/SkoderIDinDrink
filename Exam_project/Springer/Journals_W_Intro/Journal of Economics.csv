Julien,Olivier Musy,Aurélien W. Saïdi,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Stackelberg competition has been widely studied in the literature. Several extensions have been added to the original duopoly model (Stackelberg 1934), including a larger number of stages (Boyer and Moreaux 1986; Daughety 1990), and/or a larger number of players (Sherali 1984; Heywood and McGinty 2008; Watt 2002). The overall sequential structure of a Stackelberg model is usually called a hierarchy (Boyer and Moreaux 1986; Watt 2002). In this context, a puzzling result has often been noticed: despite the hierarchical structure, firms behave as Cournotian oligopolists on the residual demand. In the specific case of a single firm per stage, the standard Stackelberg duopoly leader produces exactly the same quantity as a monopolist. More generally, for a larger number of firms per stage and a homogeneous product, the strategies of leaders at any stage depend neither on the number of followers who play after, nor on the number of remaining stages. While this property is a striking feature of the Stackelberg literature, neither its foundations, nor its implications have been fully formally studied.Footnote 1
 In this paper, we go a step further by investigating the conditions under which such a property holds. To do this, we determine the conditions under which a Stackelberg leader firm behaves as a Cournotian oligopolist. We then consider the maximization program of a Cournot oligopolist and we analyze the assumptions under which the program of a Stackelberg leader is equivalent. While the literature only focusedon the equivalence between the equilibrium strategies, our approach allows us to study the impact on profit functions of alternative assumptions on market demand, costs and the hierarchical structure.Footnote 2 The equivalence between the best response functionsand the equilibrium strategies follows. We show that the property holds whatever the number of cohorts and firms in the economy, as long as we conjointly assume the three following assumptions: a linear demand, constant and identical marginal costs. These three assumptions, unlike the structure and size of the economy, are critical features. Assuming the linearity for market demand and costs is not sufficient since individual marginal costs have also to be equal for all firms. We fill a gap in the existing literature by showing that these assumptions are not only sufficient but also necessary conditions for a \(T\)-stage hierarchical oligopoly model to reduce to a succession of Cournot games. Any departure from one of these assumptions rules out the equivalence between the Cournot and the Stackelberg strategies. We display several examples to illustrate our results. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we present the hierarchical model, state the assumptions and provide a graphical interpretation of the property. The next two sections deal with the formal proof that the hierarchical model reduces to a succession of Cournot games. Section 3 considers sufficient conditions, while Sect. 4 deals with necessary conditions. In Sect. 5, we provide an illustration with three cohorts. Section 6 concludes.",8

Leading economists reassess economic policy",November 2012,Andrea F. Presbitero,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Economic research and policy making have been under attack since the onset of the global crisis. A serious rethinking of some aspects of macroeconomics, financial intermediation and regulation has already started, but the academic debate is far from settled, a new consensus has not yet emerged, and national and global institutions have to implement economic policy in an uncertain and unknown environment. The academic and policy discussion on the crisis has followed the course of the events. The economic profession started discussing the role of the shadow banking system, which was underlying the subprime crisis, then looked at global imbalances to explain the transformation of the US crisis into a world crisis and now is discussing the future of the eurozone and the effects of fiscal austerity. The book edited by Olivier Blanchard, David Romer, Michael Spence and Joseph Stiglitz convincingly sets the agenda to deal with this set of new known unknowns. The book is a selection of short essays by lead economists and policy makers, based on the proceedings from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) conference on “Macro and Growth Policies in the Wake of the Crisis”, held in March 2011. The contributions are organized around the following six main macroeconomic themes, on which our knowledge has been greatly questioned by the global economic crisis: unconventionally monetary policy in presence of zero lower bound in nominal interest rates and unsound fiscal positions; the design of fiscal rules to deal with long-term sustainability and the response of fiscal policy to the economic crisis: fiscal stimulus and austerity; the government involvement in the reformed financial sector and the necessity to preserve the positive effects of financial intermediation on growth and development; macro prudential response and capital controls to deal with the global risks of large capital outflows and inflows; the design of sustainable and innovative growth strategies to re-start growth in advanced economies and to accelerate convergence by emerging and developing countries; the reform of the international monetary system (IMS) to design a (dollar-based or multi currency) system which mitigates global imbalances and efficiently provides global liquidity. One of the strength of the book is to bring together almost all the current policy-relevant macroeconomic issues. Clearly, the broad scope of the book and the ongoing crisis make it almost impossible to provide all the answers. In the words of Olivier Blanchard, “it was the beginning of a conversation and an exploration.” With this spirit I comment on the book. The vast range of subjects covered by the conference prevents this review from being comprehensive. Therefore, I am going to discuss only few issues related to fiscal policy, which are covered in the second section of the book. This choice is motivated by two reasons. First, growing public debts in the US and in several European countries and the choice between further stimuli and austerity measures are currently one of the most-debated issues both amongst academics and politicians. Second, the economic literature on fiscal policy and fiscal multipliers provides contrasting results, which call for a careful and in-depth analysis. The actual estimation of the fiscal multiplier has serious consequences on the expected result of fiscal expansions and austerity programs. Given the current macroeconomic framework and the austerity measures followed by some peripheral European countries, it is extremely relevant to know if and when fiscal consolidation may be expansionary. In chapter 6, David Romer strongly asserts, on the ground of some recent evidence, that fiscal consolidations can not be expansionary. If the fiscal multiplier is positive and large, the expected benefits of consolidation in terms of consumption smoothing and lower borrowing costs is offset by the output contraction due to lower public spending or higher taxes. However, Robert Solow points out that the estimates of fiscal multipliers vary widely, depending on the state of the economy and on other country-specific characteristics. Thus, there is no consensus about the effectiveness of fiscal policy and the effect of consolidation may be more or less harmful depending on the level on indebtedness, the exchange rate arrangement and the degree of trade openness, among other things. Reading the book one can learn that a key lesson that the crisis is reinforcing is that there are no global solutions and fiscal adjustments need to be country-tailored and can not be easily exported. While the popularity of self-defeating austerity is increasing, the argument about expansionary fiscal consolidation can not be considered as settled. More research is required to understand the right timing of the adjustment—a topic the IMF is now stressing—and its most efficient composition between higher tax revenues and spending cuts. Additional guidance should be provided on the actual kind of taxes or spending that need to be reduced or increased. The discussion of fiscal policy in the UK and in India during the crisis (chapter 5) is extremely instructive and additional in-depth analysis of country experiences can shed more light on the real impact of fiscal policy in times of crisis. More generally, the reasons behind the necessity to undertake a fiscal adjustment require a better understanding. It is often argued that high debt levels impair growth. This negative causal relationship, however, is not robust. Nevertheless, a rising debt-to-GDP ratio may not be sustainable. Rising borrowing costs, uncertainty and limited fiscal space may hurt the economy and the capacity to face a crisis, as properly pointed out by David Romer. In other words, it could be that the sustainability and credibility of fiscal policy matter for growth more than the actual debt-to-GDP ratio. The dispute on fiscal policy naturally brings the analysis to a much general issue. Fiscal profligacy and growing public debts are often treated as one of the causes of the eurozone crisis, while in the US the current discussion is about the strategies to reduce fiscal imbalances. However, it should not be forgotten that the piling up of government debt is the outcome of failures in the financial sector and, in the case of Europe, also of growing external imbalances between surplus and deficit countries under a common currency regime. Moreover, economic growth is the key element for heavily indebted countries to grow out of their debt. Section 3 and 5 of the book deal, respectively, with the reform of the financial sector and growth strategies. Given that the conference has been organized when the eurozone crisis has not yet fully unfolded, the sustainability of a common currency area in presence of large external imbalances, instead, is not explicitly discussed in the book. The great value of this collection of short essays is its capacity to indicate in an extremely neat way the main policy issues that macroeconomics has to deal with in the next years. While solutions are not provided—and this was not in the scope of the book—we are left with a rich agenda to discuss and explore. It is not a new new Washington Consensus and it would be vital for the discussion to be as open as possible to the voices from emerging and developing countries. Some of the essays (see, for instance, the one by Dani Rodrik about structural change and industrial policy), as well as some of the recent policy papers by the Fund about capital controls, suggest that this might be the case and that the old IMF orthodoxy is a “barbarous relic”. In times when reality and policy making are moving faster than economic research, a comprehensive agenda would act as a useful guide. Some problems, while temporarily dismissed because of the urgency of others, have not yet been solved and more analyses are required. The debate on the reform of the international monetary system, discussed in the last section of the book, is a nice example. Rising global imbalances and the China–US current account imbalances contributed to bring the debate on the reform of the IMS at the top of the agenda of policy makers. The eurozone break-up and the debate on the role of the government in the US election year are now making regional imbalances and fiscal policy the priority issues. However, the reform of the global architecture is still urgent and a weakening euro is further changing the perspective of the US dollar as the dominant international reserve currency. The strategies to further sustain the growth and convergence of middle-income countries are also a key (national) policy issue in a globalized world that is somewhat overlooked. If I had to name one topic not covered by the book, I would say that the policy agenda could become more inclusive if focused also on the challenges that low-income countries would have to face in the future. The slow transition to manufacturing, the high dependence on advanced economies business cycle and on the volatility of commodity prices, shrinking aid flows, and the depletion of natural resources require more economic research and a deep involvement by international organizations. Some of these provocative essays will certainly trigger an intense debate. Neither all recommendations and ideas that will follow will be easily shared among economists and practitioners, nor is it necessarily to reach a global consensus on where the macroeconomics paradigm should aim. What is really needed in times of crisis is an open and research-based discussion to guide policy makers. This book serves extremely well this goal.",

Since Solow (1957), total factor productivity (TFP) growth and growth in human capital through R&D activities have been considered as a central factor in the determination of long-run growth. However, some studies imply that physical capital too plays an important role in economic growth: Howitt and Aghion (1998) emphasize complementarity between capital accumulation and long-run growth, and present some (indirect) evidence of this property. Howitt and Aghion (1998) construct a model with this complementarity, and Chandler (1990) demonstrates that the scale expansion of enterprises generates R&D and product diversification. Furthermore, some empirical works show that the level of capital accumulation affects the capability and/or profitability of R&D activities. Abramovitz and David (1973) show that America’s economic growth in the early nineteenth century was more dependent on capital accumulation than on TFP growth. Hayami and Ogasawara (1999) report similar results from Japanese pre-war data. These works reveal that economies in the early stages of development grow as a result of capital accumulation, but they subsequently pursue a growth regime that is driven by R&D. On these perspectives, some empirical works report that newly industrializing countries in Asia grow mainly through capital accumulation [as reported by Krugman (1994) and Young (1995)], but as Matsuyama (1999) discusses, these results are not itself negative for long-run growth. The important question is whether economies can make a regime switch. Thus, the main purpose of the present study is to analyze the dynamical properties of economic development with a regime switch, and as such, we construct a model that directly relates R&D activities and capital accumulation by assuming that both human capital and physical capital are accumulated and invested into R&D activities. We then replicate the dynamics of a regime switch: namely, we change the growth regime from capital-accumulation-based growth to R&D-based growth. In this regard, we extend Romer (1990) model that contains endogenously-driven R&D activities, yields steady-growth and no-growth steady states, and gives a framework on optimal economic policies.Footnote 1
 In the literature on endogenous growth theory, many studies have discussed positive and no/low growth in the side of indeterminacy and multiple equilibria. For example, by incorporating R&D spillovers in the growth model, Chen and Chu (2010) consider dynamics with indeterminacy to derive growth with multiple steady states corresponding with high R&D, low R&D, and zero R&D, and Kuwahara (2006)derive growth with multiple steady states corresponding with high R&D, low R&D, and zero R&D by introducing management ability in the production process. In addition, regime change and realization of long-run growth have attracted attention in this decade. Some theoretical works produce models for describing the regime change from capital-based growth with decreasing returns to long-run positive growth (Zilibotti 1995; Matsuyama 1999; Funke and Strulik 2000; Galor and Moav 2004; Irmen 2005; Kuwahara 2007). The present study shares its purpose and structure with those of Zilibotti (1995), Matsuyama (1999, 2001), Irmen (2005) and Kuwahara (2007), who focus on the regime switch from capital-based growth to R&D-based growth. While Zilibotti (1995) and Irmen (2005) conduct an analysis by using the model of a competitive economy, Matsuyama (1999, 2001), Kuwahara (2007), and the present study use models with monopoly power, which stems from the intellectual proprietary right created by R&D activities. While Matsuyama (1999) and Kuwahara (2007) assume instantaneous monopoly power in the R&D sector and focus on the multiplicities of the economic path,Footnote 2 the present study focuses on long-run growth with the regime change as a one-off, epoch-making event in economic development. In our study, the obtained growth path is a unique saddle-stable one, and no multiple equilibrium is obtained. However, this uniqueness makes it possible to definitely analyze economic welfare. Our main modification to Romer (1990) model is the consideration that both human capital and physical capital are used in R&D. This transformation of assumptions yields a regime switch in economic growth. The models of Romer (1990) and this paper encompass two growth phases—growth without R&D (capital accumulation phase) and growth based on R&D—and have the property that a sufficient stock of R&D input is necessary for growth based on R&D. Romer (1990) assumes that R&D is executed by an exogenously given human capital endowment,Footnote 3 whereas we assume that endogenously supplied capital is used for R&D activities; hence, the determination of whether or R&D exists is endogenized. Because economic growth accumulates capital, an economy with sufficient capital can shift from growth through only capital stock to R&D-based growth. This is the brief sketch of the mechanism of the regime switch in our study. Next, because we obtain a saddle stable path, we can derive optimal policy rules in our model. As Jones (2002, p. 118) points out, resource allocation for R&D is distorted by three channels: (1) the “knowledge spillover” effect that is caused by missing the market on R&D input for future contribution on improving productivity, (2) the “stepping on toes” effect that is classical externality, and (3) the “consumer surplus” effect that stems from monopoly pricing. Because our model shares properties, such as a distortion of intermediate goods pricing and freely used public knowledge capital, with the Romer model, it causes a deviation in optimal resource allocation and thus the equilibrium capital stock to be excessively small, and because of a positive relationship between the GDP growth rate and capital stock, a lower GDP growth rate is engendered by a smaller capital stock. This under-accumulation of capital can be eliminated by (only) interest subsidies. Whereas Romer (1990) policy analysis provides the result that the determination of the long-run growth regime depends on the endowment of R&D input, we go one step ahead by endogenizing R&D input factor accumulation, and as a result, obtain the result that the determination of the long-run growth regime is a deep parameter, such as R&D efficiency, rather than an endowment. Therefore, our study concludes that any policy—that adds factor endowment—has no effects on the long-run growth phase. Thus, this optimal policy can enhance economic welfare, and affect the economic growth rate. However, this optimal path for an economy with low efficiency leads to a steady state with no growth path. In such a case, it is impossible to set the economy on a long-run growth path through an optimal subsidy policy. Namely, it is impossible to set such an economy toward long-run positive growth through extending knowledge, human or physical capital stock. Thus, our study concludes that the effectiveness of official development assistance (ODA) is restrictive and conditional, which is also confirmed by some previous empirical studies; for example, Boone (1996) asserts that foreign aid does not increase growth rates in poor countries, and Burnside and Dollar (2000) report that the effectiveness of an aid policy is conditional. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 establishes the model of a decentralized economy. The existence of the two types of steady states and their determinants is explained in Sect. 3. The dynamic property of the model is analyzed in Sects. 4, and 5 presents a welfare analysis. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",7
108.0,1.0,Journal of Economics,03 November 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-012-0319-z,Regional integration and innovation offshoring with occupational choice and endogenous growth,January 2013,Colin Davis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In an increasingly integrated global economy, access to technical knowledge and a skilled labor force are key conditions for regions hoping to attract firms that offer the high wages associated with employment in research and development (R&D). The rapid advance of communication technologies, however, has improved knowledge dispersion and prompted firms to focus more on positioning innovation activities in close proximity to low-cost talent pools in emerging regions (Ernst 2006). In a survey of top firms in worldwide R&D spending, respondents ranked China and India within the top three most attractive locations for prospective R&D investment (UNCTAD 2005). The importance of China and India as locations for innovation can also be seen in the rising US trade deficit with these countries in research, development, and testing services (RDT). This deficit increased from $0.4 billion to $2.2 billion between 2006 and 2009, with their combined share of US trade in RDT rising from 2.6 to 7 % (BEA 2009). In this paper, we propose a theoretical model to explain current patterns of R&D activity using a framework in which the geographic locations of innovation and manufacturing and the direction of their associated net offshoring flows are both determined endogenously according to the characteristics of regional integration. In particular, we develop a two-region model of perfect capital mobility, occupational choice, and endogenous growth. The model extends the framework of Martin and Ottaviano (1999) in order to investigate how the allocation of heterogenous workers into high-skilled and low-skilled employment shapes patterns of industry location as firms migrate innovation and manufacturing activities towards the locations with the lowest costs. As high-skilled researchers carry out innovation, their wages are a key determinant of regional product development costs. On the other hand, regional stocks of knowledge capital are captured within the production processes of incumbent manufacturing firms and spillover into innovation, thereby raising labor productivity in R&D. Thus, with imperfect knowledge spillovers between regions, product development costs can be reduced by locating innovation in the region with the largest share of manufacturing activity. In this way, the model captures the tension between locations with better access to knowledge and locations with low-cost high-skilled labor. As a result of the tension arising between high-skilled wages and access to stocks of knowledge in the location choice for product development, regional shares of innovation and manufacturing activity tend to reinforce one another. Transport costs incurred in interregional trade cause a greater share of firms to locate production in the region with the larger market through a “home market” effect (Krugman 1980). This concentration of manufacturing activity increases the region’s share of knowledge capital inducing a fall in product development costs and raising the region’s share of innovation activity (a product development cost effect). The expansion of the region’s innovation sector has positive effects on both high-skilled wages and employment, and as a result average household income rises causing a further increase in the size of the region’s market (a labor income effect). In this manner, an increase in a region’s share of manufacturing leads to an increase in its share of innovation, and vice versa. With symmetric skill distributions and labor endowments, the regional distribution of asset wealth, the level of trade costs, and the degree of knowledge dispersion between regions determine relative market size.Footnote 1 The asset wealthy region always earns a greater level of investment income as it has greater asset wealth (an investment income effect). Relative labor incomes, however, depend on the balance of the product development cost, labor income, and investment income effects. When trade costs and knowledge dispersion are sufficiently high, the investment income and product development cost effects dominate and the asset wealthy region has a larger market supported by higher investment and labor incomes. When trade costs and knowledge dispersion are sufficiently low, on the other hand, the labor income effect dominates, and the asset poor region has a larger market with a higher level of labor income, despite its lower level of investment income. Focusing on the case where both regions are active in product development, we investigate the effects of greater regional integration resulting from lower trade costs and greater knowledge dispersion. An increase in the freeness of trade unambiguously increases the innovation and manufacturing shares of the asset wealthy region. An improvement in the level of knowledge spillovers, in contrast, has an ambiguous effect on manufacturing shares, but raises the share of innovation activity located in the asset wealthy region up to a threshold level, after which further improvements in knowledge dispersion increase the share of innovation activity located in the asset poor region. We use the model to study the relationship between regional integration and the net offshoring patterns that arise in the innovation and manufacturing sectors. There are three cases. First, for low levels of trade costs and knowledge dispersion, the asset poor region maintains a larger market and greater shares of innovation and manufacturing activity, and accordingly net offshoring flows from the asset wealthy region to the asset poor region in both sectors. Similarly, for an intermediate level of trade costs, the asset wealthy region has the larger market and shares of industrial activity, and net offshoring flows from the asset poor region to the asset wealthy region. Finally, for high levels of trade costs and knowledge dispersion, although the asset wealthy region has a larger market, its shares of innovation and manufacturing activity are not large enough to offset the high wages of its high-skilled workers, and net offshoring in product development and production flows from the asset wealthy region to the asset poor region, as firms take advantage of the lower high-skilled wages of the asset poor region. If one considers that the cost of transporting ideas has fallen faster than the cost of transporting goods in recent decades (Baldwin et al. 2001), with sufficiently high trade costs and knowledge spillovers, the equilibrium pattern of offshoring that arises in our framework provides a plausible explanation for the current trend observed in innovation offshoring from the US to China and India. This study is closely related to the “New Economic Geography” literature that investigates the relationship between spatial patterns of industry and innovation-based growth (Baldwin and Martin 2004). A key feature of this literature, however, is a tendency towards the catastrophic agglomeration of innovation activity in one location when knowledge spillovers are imperfect across regions. The theoretical concentration of innovation is problematic for two reasons. First, two-region models which conclude that innovation activity concentrates fully in the region with the larger market are unable to explain current patterns of innovation offshoring from the US to China and India. Second, casual observation of geographic patterns of R&D activity make it clear that innovation is, at least to some extent, interregionally dispersed and showing no sign of convergence towards concentration in a few particular regions. Indeed, domestic R&D expenditures reported by the OECD Science, Technology, and Industry Scoreboard 2007 suggest a trend towards greater dispersion of innovation activity. The framework presented in this paper resolves the issue of agglomeration in innovation by introducing heterogenous workers. The lower wages of high-skilled workers in the smaller market provide a counter to the cost benefits of greater industry concentration in the larger market. A side effect of the dispersed pattern of innovation, however, is that while patterns of manufacturing and innovation activity are determinate, industry concentration no longer has an impact on economic growth. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2 we present a two-region model of occupational choice and endogenous growth. Then, Sect.  3 characterizes the geographic patterns of innovation activity that arise for a given distribution of asset wealth, and a particular level of regional integration. We briefly examine the effects of regional integration in Sect. 4. The implications of our model for innovation and manufacturing offshoring flows are investigated in Sect. 5. Concluding remarks are given in Sect. 6.",3

Hence the importance of its accumulation for the human development and economic growth. Building on Uzawa (1965) and Lucas (1988), a lot of research has been devoted to the study of the dynamics of two sector models with agents that have to decide on the optimal allocation of human capital across the production and education sectors.Footnote 1
 One of the most widely studied extensions of the Uzawa framework was introduced by Lucas (1988) and assumes human capital externalities in the production of goods: the average human capital stock increases total factor productivity, but this is not taken into account by individual agents when making economic decisions. It is a well known result that in such a model the competitive equilibrium does not coincide with the social optimum. In the absence of public intervention, time devoted to accumulate human capital and the growth rate at the steady state are too low. However, there may exist policies that allow to decentralize the first best outcome. Several papers have addressed this question in Uzawa–Lucas theoretical setups where the utility is derived only from consumption. For example, García-Castrillo and Sanso (2000) prove that the first best could be reached under a direct subsidy of the time devoted to education funded through a lump-sum tax and a tax on human capital income. In a similar model, Gómez (2003) shows that lump sum taxation can be avoided and that the optimal solution can be achieved by taxing labor income and subsidizing the investment into human capital. Bethmann (2007) develops a closed form solution and shows that the optimal allocation is reached by taxing labor income and subsidizing capital income. Gómez (2008) studies the optimal policy in a two-sector endogenous model with consumption and leisure externalities in the utility function and physical and human capital externalities in the production sector.Footnote 2
 In this paper we extend the model economy in Gómez (2003) with agents that value both consumption and leisure. Our analysis considers subsidies that depend on foregone income while studying which might be funded with revenues obtained by taxing consumption, labor and capital incomes, and through lump sum taxes. We show that when agents face labor-leisure choice, the combinations of taxes and subsidies that decentralize the social optimum are different from the ones discussed above. One design of the optimal policy can set consumption, labor and capital income taxes to zero, and finance the subsidy by a lump sum fee. Other designs may involve combinations of consumption, capital income and lump sum taxes with subsidies to labor income and foregone income while studying. We perform our analysis in a representative agent infinite horizon model with general utility and production functions. Nevertheless, a discrete version of the model allows us to present an analytical solution for a certain combination of functional forms for the utility and production technology. Finally, some papers in this literature have studied the model assumptions under which the balanced growth path is unique and determinate. Benhabib and Perli (1994) discuss the multiplicity of equilibria and transitional paths in the Uzawa–Lucas model with externality in human capital. They show that if the externality is high, there always exists a continuum of equilibria. Under some conditions the balanced growth path can become indeterminate, too. Ladrón-de-Guevara et al. (1997, 1999) consider a model without externalities and show that by including leisure in the utility function multiple balanced growth paths arise. We show that local and/or global indeterminacy might also arise in the social planner’s solution when the externality in human capital is large. In those cases the optimal subsidies to foregone earnings and taxes should be designed in a way that working, leisure time and consumption allocations are the ones that lead to that particular social planner path where the welfare is maximized. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The model and its main properties for the competitive and social planner equilibria are stated in Sect. 2. The optimal policy is derived in Sect. 3. Dynamic patterns are discussed in Sect. 4. Final conclusions are summarized in Sect. 5.",3

(2011) (henceforth BCFL) find an interesting fact that under two parametric restrictions, the continuous-time stochastic two-sector endogenous growth model with human and physical capital has a closed-form solution path. This is definitely an important extension of Lucas (1988) and Boucekkine and Ruiz-Tamarit (2004), that are deterministic. Most of the existing literature on the continuous-time stochastic growth models (e.g. Smith 2007) focus on the one sector models. BCFL provide a new insight on the analysis of the endogenous growth models with stochastic productivity shocks. However, BCFL has one weakness in the derivation of the value function. They argue that it is a function of both the current and the initial values of the state variables. According to Wälde (2011a); Wälde (2011b), the value function must be a function of only the current state variables as long as the stochastic technology term follows the geometric Brownian motion. This paper obtains a different value function by following Wälde (2011a). I also adopt a guess-and-verify method to determine the value function, but the function is independent of the initial state variables. BCFL assume that the coefficient of the relative risk aversion (\(\phi \)) is equal to the capital share (\(1-\alpha -\gamma \)) and that the efficiency of human capital accumulation (\(\eta \)) is equal to the sum of the discount factor (\(\rho \)) and the human capital depreciation rate (\(\beta _{H}\)). This paper shows that the first assumption is not needed to obtain the closed-form solution path. However, several additional inequality constraints are needed to ensure that the time devoted to the final good production is within the interval [0,1]. In the following, Sect. 2 summarizes the model. Section 3 obtains the value function and the optimal path. Section 4 concludes the paper.",7

If consumers care about the environmental quality of the good (and there is evidence that they do; Kuhn 2005), then how does this information get transmitted to consumers?Footnote 1
 Three possible groups could provide this information: the firm that sells the good, the government, and environmental groups (i.e., a non-governmental organization that aims to improve the state of the environment). Starting with the firm, Mahenc (2007); Mahenc (2008) demonstrates under which conditions a firm can use the price of a good to signal environmental quality. In this case, the marginal cost of producing a good should be increasing with its environmental quality, and the firm’s profit should be increasing with consumers’ perception of environmental quality. Another instrument at the firm’s disposal is ecolabeling, which Ibanez and Grolleau (2008) show firms can use to inform consumers. Government-firm interactions also have been studied extensively. For example, Maxwell et al. (2000) study the effect of (future) mandatory pollution regulation, Amacher et al. (2004) provide a theoretical analysis of ecolabeling, and Petrakis et al. (2005) examine information provision as a public policy instrument. In contrast, the role of environmental groups (EGs) as information providers has not received much attention. Most literature considers how EGs influence the behavior of firms, such as through the effects of boycotts (Baron 2003; Innes 2006) or the threat of boycotts (Diermeier and Baron 2007). This focus has neglected the myriad of activities that EGs engage in. In particular, EGs communicate with consumers in various ways, such as through advertisements or encouraging media coverage of their own activities (see Baron 2005). EGs generally try not only to persuade the consumer to adopt the organization’s viewpoint, but also to provide facts and information that the consumer may not have been aware of. As an example, consider the ‘Viswijzer’ (Dutch for fish guide) advertising campaign which features as its centerpiece an informative brochure that tells consumers which fish are on the brink of extinction, such that they may avoid consuming those species. Extensive advertising on Dutch television by the World Wildlife Fund promotes the informative brochure.Footnote 2 However, the product itself (i.e., the fish) does not display this kind of information, which means that this campaign is clearly distinct from (eco)labeling. Another example falls under a somewhat broader definition of advertising, namely Greenpeace’s attempt to inform consumers about toxic ingredient in Disney branded pajamas.Footnote 3 The strategy that this EG used was to (illegally) attach labels to pajamas, warning the consumers of the toxins present. This kind of guerilla advertising is clearly distinct from the conventional definition of labeling, in that the action is neither sanctioned by Disney nor are there any controls over the accuracy of the label. In both these examples, the visible activities by the EG require time, effort, and money. Therefore, the EG can use such instruments to signal the severity of the situation. To model this phenomenon, I extend the standard industrial organization framework of vertical product differentiation to environmental damage and asymmetric information about that damage (i.e., consumers are unaware of the level of damage). I first consider a case in which the firm cannot signal the level of damage through price or advertising (by assuming that marginal costs are independent of the damage level). I then introduce an EG that might choose to advertise with a certain intensity. The analysis reveals that the EG can signal the level of damage through its advertising. The EG chooses to advertise if a firm is producing a good with a high level of damage. Advertising harms “bad” firms instead of praising “good” ones.Footnote 4
Ex ante advertising benefits both the firm and the consumers. Although in this respect information transmission by the EG is useful, I show that from an ex ante perspective, the EG itself does not necessarily benefit. Even if I drop the assumption that marginal cost is independent of damage level, the conclusions do not qualitatively change, though this extension does identify when the EG is more efficient at signaling than the firm, namely, when environmental problems are not severe. Finally, I consider a variant of this model, in which environmental damage is chosen by the firm, and information acquisition by the EG is endogenized. Under certain conditions, there exists an equilibrium where the firm randomizes between low and high damage and the EG acquires information (with positive probability). The EG advertises if it acquires information and the firm chooses high damage. Therefore in all three specifications I investigate, advertising campaigns by the EG occur in equilibrium. My approach is related to several strands of the literature. First, the informative advertising model I propose relates to the auditing model presented by Feddersen and Gilligan (2001), who study a duopoly situation in which firms are price-takers. In their model, the EG can investigate a firm and discover how damaging the production process is, and then transmit this information to consumers. However, Feddersen and Gilligan suppose that information must be gathered, whereas I propose that information primarily needs to be disseminated. Both approaches emphasize the difficulty the EG faces when it tries to convince the public. Because Feddersen and Gilligan study costless investigations, their model relies on the concept of cheap talk to transmit information. The possibility of cheap talk represents an artifact of their model. Crawford and Sobel (1982) investigate the conditions under which an informative equilibrium arises in general cheap talk games and conclude that though such an equilibrium can exist, it is only possible if the disagreement between the receiver and the sender is not too large. Applied to the situation here, though the EG and consumer may agree that low environmental damage is preferable, consumers also want to keep price as low as possible. Feddersen and Gilligan eliminate this factor by making the firms price-takers. Second, Baron (2005) examines a situation in which EGs (and firms) cannot directly communicate with consumers: All information is dispersed through the news media. The results indicate that the media are biased and the EG has an incentive to conceal information that is unfavorable to its interests. I study direct communication between EGs and consumers instead and show that there are situations in which the EG would like to conceal information. Third, the model I propose is similar to the model used in Heijnen and Schoonbeek (2008), but they study persuasive advertising. In their model, consumers are aware of the level of environmental damage, and the EG uses advertising to increase the marginal disutility it causes to consumers. In equilibrium, firms preempt the EG’s advertising campaign by producing a cleaner good. In the final variant of my model in which firms can choose the level of environmental damage, I observe preemption (to some degree) as well. Fourth, my approach relates to the theoretical industrial organization literature where prices and advertising signal product quality (Bagwell and Ramey 1988; Milgrom and Roberts 1986). Bagwell and Ramey (1991) and Hertzendorf and Overgaard (2001) also address the case of two competing senders of information, similar to the model presented here.Footnote 5 However, their senders are two firms, whereas I investigate a firm and an EG as senders. In turn, this research contributes to the signaling literature by investigating signaling by an outsider, namely, the EG that becomes informed and may benefit from passing this information on to consumers. The remainder of this article is organized as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the model. Then in Sect. 3, I present the equilibria of the model, before outlining the results in Sect. 4, including the effect of advertising on the EG, the firm, and consumers. Section 5 introduces differences in marginal costs, and then I consider endogenous information acquisition in Sect. 6. Section 7 concludes.",7

Hence, providing information that can reduce such uncertainty is typically the aim of a substantial part of the sellers’ marketing activities. Concretely, the sellers may provide detailed descriptions of their products, clarify how the buyers can benefit from them, and/or allow the buyers to physically inspect the products, or to run preliminary tests. This paper investigates a model of these activities where the seller chooses the conditional probability distributions characterizing an information system. The information system allows the buyer to receive a private signal, potentially correlated with her valuation. In the spirit of the literature on “rational inattention”—see Sims (2003)—the mutual information of the information system is used to measure the “quantity of information” (or information processing capacity) that the seller invests to make the conditional distributions more responsive to the buyer’s valuation, and to thereby make more precise information available. No restrictions are imposed on the conditional distributions of the signal, and any given quantity of information is generally associated with a continuum of different information systems. The paper establishes two related results: The equilibrium information system is noisy, and generally “non-neutral,” in the sense that (a) the probability of a correct signal differs across the buyer’s possible valuations, and (b) the probability of trade differs from the probability of a valuation exceeding the cost of production. The value of the optimal information system, for the seller, is a concave function of the quantity of information provided. In equilibrium, if the expected surplus under the default probability measure is either very high or very low (and negative), the seller provides no information, and exchange respectively takes place either with probability \(1\), at the price justified by the prior beliefs, or with probability \(0\). For intermediate values of the surplus, the seller provides noisy information and chooses the highest price that the buyer is willing to accept if she observes a favorable realization of the signal. If the seller does provide information, the general conditional distributions of the signal allow her to trade off the probability of a favorable signal against the increase in the valuation of the product, if the buyer observes the same signal, even with a constant quantity of information. Depending on whether the default expected valuation is relatively high or relatively low, compared to the cost of production, the seller’s priority can be either a high probability of trade, or a large increase in the buyer’s valuation, upon observation of a favorable signal. Hence, in the former case, the seller tends to be “bold,” namely to choose a large unconditional probability of a favorable signal, and pays special attention to limiting the probability of an unfavorable signal being sent to a high valuation-buyer. In the latter case, the seller tends to be “cautious,” namely to choose a small unconditional probability of a favorable signal, and is especially careful to limiting the probability of a favorable signal being sent to a low valuation-buyer, to boost the effect of such a signal on the buyer’s willingness to pay. The downside, in the two cases, is respectively represented by a diluted impact of a favorable signal on the buyer’s willingness to pay, and by the small number of positive recommendations issued. The paper suggests that non-neutral information provision can be an equilibrium phenomenon, and can in fact be consistent with maximization of the expected surplus from trade—as it is the case in the model studied in the paper—even if the seller is effectively committed to the informational strategy announced, by assumption. In general, commitment could be guaranteed by an outside information provider, with a reputational concern. In the presence of incentives to overstate the probability of a high valuation, the seller’s credibility would be more heavily strained in the case of products that are relatively unlikely to be a good match for the buyer. On the other hand, the same incentives may even be functional, within limits, for the sellers of products that are relatively likely to match the buyer’s preferences. Thus, resorting to a third-party information provider might be a more useful option for sellers facing situations of the former type. This implication can complement the implication of (Lewis and Sappington (1994), p. 320) that, if we consider products with a relatively high cost of production, we should expect the sellers to invest substantial amounts of resources to explain the characteristics and the uses of the products that they sell. The investigation of the endogenous commitment opportunities which could be created by the observability of the seller’s record as an information provider could be an interesting topic for future research. The information on record could be used either by the potential buyers, in a setting with repeated trades, and/or by a supervising public authority with the power to levy penalties and to grant rewards. The non-neutrality of the optimal information system, identified in the paper, highlights the potential importance of the consistency with the announced informational strategy as a criterion to evaluate the information provided. The model builds on Lewis and Sappington (1994), where the information systems available to the seller are subject to restrictions that make it possible to order them linearly by their informativeness. The choice of the information system has no direct payoff consequences, such as a cost, but only indirect consequences: More precise information increases the dispersion of the valuations corresponding to the different buyer types. Hence, it increases the prices that some buyer types are willing to pay, but can also create informational rents. In a number of settings studied in the paper—including a model with two buyer types, providing the closest counterpart to the model of the present paper—the seller either refrains from providing information, or provides as much information as possible, in equilibrium. Also, the adoption of a relatively noisy information system can lower the seller’s profit. Essentially, more precise information lowers the price(s) that a buyer who receives unfavorable information is willing to accept, and a small improvement in the precision may be insufficient to make a price that is only accepted upon receipt of favorable information a part of the seller’s optimal strategy. As Lepis and Sappington (1994, p. 317, footnote 16) observe, this result is similar to the non-concavity result established by Radner and Stiglitz (1984) in a setting with a single strategic player and costly information. By contrast, in the present model—as I mentioned in Sect. 1.1 above, and as I explain in more detail in Sect. 3.2 below—the value of information is a concave function of quantity. The different features of the two models essentially depend on the fact that our seller—unlike the seller in Lewis and Sappington (1994)—can choose among different information systems even for a given quantity of information. This situation is reminiscent of the statement in (Chade and Schlee (2002), p. 446) that “the Radner-Stiglitz nonconcavity emerges only by severely constraining the set of information structures available to decision makers.” Saak (2006) shows that in a setting with unit demand, a seller with access to costless, general information structures would only allow the buyer to know if her match-value is greater or smaller than the cost of production. Johnson and Myatt (2006) consider restrictions under which the effects of different informational strategies (and marketing strategies in general) can be classified with reference to “rotations” and “shifts” of the demand function. Essentially, rotations and shifts respectively correspond to the provision of information about idiosyncratic match-values and of “hype” information, related to the availability and the quality of the product. Similarly to the case in Lewis and Sappington (1994), in the absence of cost differences, the seller typically chooses extreme informational strategies, in equilibrium. In Anderson and Renault (2006), a cost that the buyers must bear to visit the seller’s shop creates a potential hold-up problem, and can thereby induce the seller to provide only a limited amount of information about the match-value, and possibly also to make a price commitment. Related problems are considered in Villas-Boas (2004), in connection with the seller’s choice of the optimal product line, and in Bar-Isaac et al. (2010), where the seller can affect the transaction cost faced by the buyers. Board (2009), Ganuza (2004) consider auctions where the auctioneer and the buyers respectively have private information about the object being sold and the own willingness to pay for the different possible types of the object. Information disclosure can soften competition, via its effect on the dispersion of the valuations. With relatively few bidders, the seller may thus release an amount of information smaller than the amount required to maximize the expected total surplus; the gap tends to disappear as the number of bidders increases. Grossman and Shapiro (1984), Hamilton (2009), and Meurer and Stahl (1994) consider the effects of competition on information provision in markets with horizontal differentiation. In models of ex-ante vertical differentiation, the buyers’ expectation that a monopolist would only withhold unfavorable information can lead to full disclosure, if the cost is negligible—see Grossman (1981), Grossman and Hart (1980) and Milgrom (1981). On the other hand, disclosure of costly information is only beneficial for the sellers of products with quality above an endogenous threshold (Jovanovic, 1982). The effects of competition on the sellers’ incentives to disclose quality are investigated in Milgrom and Roberts (1986), Board (2009), and Levin et al. (2009), among others. The literature on quality disclosure and certification is surveyed in Dranove and Jin (2010). Sun (2011) considers disclosure to heterogeneous buyers who are uncertain both about the quality of a product and about their valuations for it. The equilibrium may feature a trade-off between the information of the two types available to the agents. Koessler and Renault (2012) provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which full disclosure is the unique equilibrium outcome in a model that also features twofold ex-ante uncertainty. The information-theoretic criterion used in the present paper to assign an explicit cost to general information systems could be used to explore interesting extensions of these papers, in future research. Suen (2004) and Burke (2008) consider settings where, given the prior beliefs and the payoffs of the agents, asymmetric error probabilities make information more valuable, as in the present paper. In Suen (2004), some information providers transform a continuous signal into a binary signal by using exogenous, heterogeneous thresholds. The providers’ reports differ in a (random, but) systematic way, and a decision-maker optimally chooses a provider whose report is relatively likely to confirm her prior beliefs. This choice is justified by the fact that only realizations of the binary signal that both the decision-maker and the provider regard as unlikely, corresponding to extreme realizations of the underlying signal, can possibly induce the decision-maker to change the default decision, and can thereby make the report valuable, ex-ante. In Burke (2008), the information providers may “bias” their reports, by choosing an asymmetric distribution of a given total probability of a correct signal across states; competition between two providers exacerbates the distortions, compared to the monopoly benchmark, essentially by forcing each provider to target a specific segment of the audience. The main feature of the present paper, in comparison with Burke (2008) and Suen (2004), is the use of a criterion rooted in the information-theoretical literature, such as mutual information, to assign a cost to general information systems. This modeling strategy allows me to avoid restrictions that can otherwise be required to reconcile tractability and comparability, but that can be difficult to justify, in general. A related paper by Ganuza and Penalva (2010) investigates a number of measures that—similarly to mutual information—focus on the variability of the conditional distributions if the prior beliefs are held fixed. A measure called supermodular precision, according to which a signal \(\phi \) is more informative than another signal \(\phi ^\prime \) if the difference between any two quantiles of the distribution of the conditional expectation is smaller under \(\phi ^\prime \) than under \(\phi \), is used to investigate costly information provision by a seller auctioning an object. In the setting of the present paper, each information system features at most two distinct realizations of the willingness to pay for the product, ex-post. Hence, two non-degenerate information systems can only possibly be ranked if they feature an identical probability of a favorable realization of the signal; otherwise, for each distribution, we can always find a pair of quantiles that coincide under that distribution, but not under the other one. A comparison between the information measures in Ganuza and Penalva (2010) and mutual information, in general settings, could be an interesting topic for future research. Mutual information is considered by Cabrales et al. (2012) in connection with the problem of an investor choosing a portfolio of risky assets. The assets’ prices and the returns are such that no arbitrage opportunities exist under the prior probability measure. Under some restrictions on preferences, the investor’s willingness to pay for a signal is necessarily measured by the mutual information between the signal and the state of the world. The model is presented in Sect. 2. The equilibrium and the non-neutrality of the information system are respectively characterized in Sects. 3 and 4. Section 5 contains some concluding remarks, and indicates possible topics for future research. All proofs are in the Appendix. The numerical examples on which the figures are based were developed with the help of wxMaxima, which was also used to verify the calculations; the files are available from the Author upon request.",2

It is a discrete representation of hyperbolic discounting, or time-inconsistent impatience, i.e. discounting the near future more heavily than the distant future. By contrast, time-consistent preference can be described as exponential discounting,under which the marginal rate of substitution of consumption between any two points of time depends only on the time between them. Intuitively, early in life, the quasi-hyperbolic discounter does not save as much as the exponential discounter, owing to her stronger impatience to consume immediately. Consequently, she cannot accumulate enough wealth to support herself after stopping work, has to delay retirement, and thus works for a longer time compared with the exponential discounter. This trade-off relation between saving level and retirement age under quasi-hyperbolic discounting is discussed by Laibson et al. (1998). But present bias also has a further, and opposite, effect on the retirement decision. Retiring early means sacrificing future consumption to avoid the immediate disutility of labor effort. The quasi-hyperbolic discounter with a given accumulation of savings is more tempted to retire, and the sophisticated response is to therefore save even more early in life, knowing that the temptation to retire early will later prove irresistible and the savings will be needed (Diamond and Koszegi 2003). So the predictions of these separate studies are that present-biased consumers will either under-save or retire early, but not both. The aim of this paper is to show that quasi-hyperbolic discounting consumers can indeed both under-save and also retire early. Although the saving behavior and retirement behavior of quasi-hyperbolic discounters have been empirically investigated separately, they have thus far not been examined jointly. Eisenhauer and Ventura (2006) find that wealth accumulation is negatively related to hyperbolic discounting in Italy and that hyperbolic discounters are less likely to utilize commitment devices to control their choices. Fang and Silverman (2007) show that un-married mothers in the US fail to maintain sufficient labor supply under quasi-hyperbolic discounting. By relating wealth level and labor supply to discounting styles, under-saving jointly determined with early retirement can be indirectly shown. In this context, the present analysis helps explain this as-yet underexplored phenomenon. A number of empirical studies discuss recent trends in under-saving or early retirement. For example, Attanasio (1993) uses a CEX data set provided the Bureau of Labor Statistic tapes of the Consumer Expenditure Survey to show that aggregate personal saving has declined in the US since the 1980s. Bosworth et al. (1991) show that the private saving rate in the US has declined steadily over past 20 years. Gendell (2001) shows that the average age at retirement declined in the 1990s, while Gruber and Wise (2002) demonstrate that workers have been leaving the labor force at younger and younger ages in recent years. These empirical studies imply the co-existence of lower saving level and earlier retirement. However, previous studies cannot explain this phenomenon because they claim that earlier retirement always follows higher saving level. My alternative model may help understand these seemingly paradoxical empirical phenomena. This paper employs a three-period quasi-hyperbolic discounting model with endogenous labor supply. Saving level is determined in the first period and retirement age in the second period. This setup is different from that presented by Diamond and Koszegi (2003) in that the labor supply chosen in the second period is continuous. Following O’Donoghue and Rabin (1999), two types of consumer can be distinguished: (i) those who can foresee her time-inconsistent preference (defined as “sophisticated consumers”) and (ii) those unaware of such problems (defined as “naïve consumers”). Saving level and retirement age under quasi-hyperbolic discounting are compared with those under exponential discounting. Following O’Donoghue and Rabin (1999), the outcome of time-consistent preference is considered to be optimal from the long-run perspective, and the definition of under-saving and early retirement is derived accordingly. Furthermore, how a wage tax and an interest subsidy affect consumer welfare is investigated. This paper thus extends the model by including government policy which aims to optimize the consumer’s long-run well-being. This paper makes four principal findings. First, if and only if the present-biased marginal utility decreases as present bias strengthens, quasi-hyperbolic-discounting consumers, whether sophisticated or naïve, save less and retire earlier than exponential discounters. This result shows the co-existence of under-saving and early retirement. Second, two examples of utility function (i.e., constant absolute risk aversion (CARA) and logarithmic) are shown to exhibit this necessary and sufficient condition. With these two functional forms, the consumer definitely under-saves. However, consistent with the finding of Diamond and Koszegi (2003), quasi-hyperbolic-discounting consumers may retire either earlier or later. Third, a necessary and sufficient condition is provided under which the government improves consumer welfare by imposing a proportional wage tax. An interest subsidy definitely improves consumer welfare. Fourth, because the discounting effect of the present-bias parameter can increase or decrease labor supply, the long-run Phillips curve relation may display a negative relation or a stagflation between unemployment and inflation. This paper makes the following original contributions to the body of knowledge in this area. A necessary and sufficient condition for under-saving and early retirement is derived, and two examples of utility function are used to obtain closed-form solutions to the utility maximization problem with present bias, and demonstrate comparative dynamics with respect to the present-bias parameter. Furthermore, the model is extended to include a proportional wage tax and an interest subsidy and their effects on consumer welfare when the government’s budget constraint is satisfied are derived. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical model. Section 3 presents the saving and retirement behavior of naïve consumers. Section 4 discusses the solutions to the problem of sophisticated consumers. Section5 analyzes how representative consumer welfare is affected by a wage tax and an interest subsidy. Section 6 discusses on the results of this analysis and explores how these results work upon the long-run Phillips curve relation. Section 7 concludes.",11

Plans involve actions of our future selves. Putting off vacuuming the house may please today’s you, but may not go down too well with the you of tomorrow. Indeed, come tomorrow, you might well find yourself looking for an excuse to postpone the chore, letting some future you take responsibility. But as we all know, procrastination, even over seemingly menial tasks, can snowball into significant welfare losses.Footnote 1 This paper reverses this proposition, however. What if your failure to commit to yesterday’s plan actually produces higher utility? If plans for future consumption offset anticipations of present value, revising a plan may increase utility all told. You may in fact find it better to consume less today than you had planned or anticipated yesterday. In this scenario, the well-known self-control problem of procrastination becomes one of self-deception. And the question is not how to improve your self-commitment record, but to find an environment which helps you revise your plans. Now self-deception could be said to be a contradiction in terms. It seems to rely on a logical inconsistency, knowing and not knowing at the same time. And self-deception can be extremely harmful in a competitive environment. Trivers (2011) takes an opposite view. Self-deception, he contends, is widespread in the animal kingdom and there is an evolutionary push toward self-deception. The main explanation for self-deception, he adds, is that you fool yourself for better to fool others. There is, moreover, an immunological upside of an overly positive self-evaluation. True or not, neither explanation has any immediate bearing on economic theory. What we want to do in this paper is to show that beneficial self-deception occur in one-agent intertemporal consumption scenarios. In other words, self-deception for your own good is not limited to the animal kingdom; we need to add homo economicus to the list as well. The following example provides the intuition. Sheila plans to make a cake last three days. On the first day she cuts it into three pieces of different sizes. While eating the first day’s ration, she savors the thought of tomorrow’s helping, the larger of the two remaining two slices. But when tomorrow comes, Sheila discovers that she’d prefer to save the biggest piece for the final day because she’ll have an extra day to mull over the enticing prospect of the big slice to come. It is important to note the conflict of interest between the Sheila of Day 1 and the Day 2 counterpart. For Day 1-Sheila, her commitment to her plan is arguably essential for the utilities she enjoys on the first day. However, Day 2-Sheila’s commitment to yesterday’s plan is less evident. After all, Sheila may argue, yesterday is history, and so is Day 1-Sheila. What concerns her now is getting as much utility as possible from the two remaining slices of cake. She could save the biggest slice for third and final day, of course. But then again, her second day self may begin to waver in her commitment to the plan, or feel remorse for deviating from it. This may or may not be sufficient to induce Sheila to proceed as planned. The key observation is that whatever Day 2-Sheila does, Day 1-Sheila is not worse off. In short, there is a potential upside of non-commitment in this intertemporal consumption problem. But that immediately raises the question of why the first day Sheila can believe that she will consume the biggest piece the following day, when it is better for the second day Sheila to deviate. There must be some kind of self-deception at work. This is where we are heading. Our starting point is the much used Samuelson’s discounted utility model (Samuelson 1937). As this is a discounted sum of instantaneous utility functions, it involves a premise of total amnesia, as if we were to plan a sequence of sensations of no value to us except in the heat of the moment. In medical parlance, the economic agent invoked by Samuelson’s DU model is suffering from Korsakoff’s syndrome.Footnote 2 The paper generalizes Samuelson’s DU model to allow for utility from memories and anticipations. Two types of agents are considered. The first has preferences as implied by the standard Samuelson utility model (0-korsakoffs); the other a rudimentary memory (1-korsakoffs). A 1-korsakoff remembers a consumption plan the time period it is made, and may harbor (positive) anticipations regarding the next period’s consumption. But she has no recollection of past consumption or yesterday’s plan. A 1-korsakoff can be viewed as the first step towards an agent with full recollection.This rudimentary memory affects intertemporal choice. 1-korsakoffs tend to be time-inconsistent, and repeated revisions may cut a path to higher long-run utility. This paper connects with the literature on self-deception and self-control. Gul and Pesendorfer’s (2001) seminal contribution shifted attention of inconsistencies of intertemporal choice away from preferences over consumption bundles, to preferences over a class of decision problems. Their axiomatic treatment of preferences allows for “Set Betweenness,” i.e. a preference for limiting future choices. This provides fertile ground for studying temptations and the cost of self-control. Noor (2007) found the implications of future temptations to be mixed. Agents who are aware of their self-control problems may not take advantage of commitment opportunities. The possibility of indulging temptation in the future is itself a source of temptation. Kopylov and Noor (2010) consider self-deception in a fairly explicit form, because their model allows for the agent to rationalize actions that eventually will lead to temptation. Arguing along a similar vein, Sarver (2008) agents seeks to reduce potential regret. Halevy (2008) studies diminishing impatience and argues that positive time preference is deeply connected to uncertainty. Fudenberg and Levine (2012) show also that timing is essential when it comes to understanding the cost of self-control. An agent may resist a one shot temptation, but give in to temptation if it is permanent or extends over a number of time periods. The economic agents that we shall be considering bear a closer resemblance to those modeled by Loewenstein (1987), Caplin and Leahy (2001), Bernheim and Thomadsen (2005), Epstein (2008) and Kőszegi (2010), inasmuch as anticipatory feelings affect intertemporal choice. The model presented here contrasts with this literature, as commitment and self-control may stand in the way of utility-increasing revisions of consumption plans. The self-deception considered here relies on the agent not fully understanding her future preferences and actions, and partly resembles in structure potential information aversion as considered by Epstein (2008). Moreover, our results also differ from the game theory approach of Asheim (1997). He introduces revision-proof strategies as a refinement of subgame-perfectness. If an agent becomes aware of her self-control problems, she can limit her decision problem by only considering plans she will actually follow. In our model, self-deceiving behavior is conditional on non-revision-proof consumption plans. This paper’s contribution to the study of self-deception and intertemporal choice is threefold. First, it extends the Samuelson DU model so as to facilitate a comparison of agents with differing mnemonic capacities. Second, it considers a simple, but critical distinction where anticipation of consumption is connected to plans of consumption, not future consumption per se. Third, it adds to the potential downside of commitment and self-control. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we define k-korsakoff preferences in a T-period consumption scenario of one continuous good. Section 3 considers consumption of one indivisible good that is to be consumed over a given number of time periods. The discussion draws heavily on the agent types, naïfs and sophisticates, introduced by O’Donoghue and Rabin (1999). Whereas naivete tends to yield poor long-run outcomes, the results presented here extend the potential downside of sophistication. Sophisticates have less opportunity to revise repeatedly, and as a result may to get lower long-run utility in comparison with naïfs. In Sect. 4 we discuss a model, the life span uncertainty model, which provides an example of benign self-deception among sophisticates. The model is an abstraction of the following scenario. Upon retirement we decide to spend a year in Rio. But which year? While we know we will not live forever, we do not know how many years we have left. As time passes and our general health deteriorates, we want to go before it is too late. In a stylized version of this consumption problem, we show that sophisticates can achieve the same long-run utility as naïfs. In other words, a little uncertainty regarding the number of time periods facilitates utility increasing revisions even for sophisticates. Section 5 concludes.",1

Most earlier contributions associate wider objectives with public firms, thus ignoring the case of private-sector altruism (see Lakdawalla and Philipson 2006; Philipson and Posner 2009), but I focus on behaviour rather than ownership. The significance of the topic is illustrated by the existence of wider objectives in public firms in the UK (Vickers and Yarrow 1988, pp. 127, 130–134), Argentine (Xu and Birch 1999), Finland (Miettinen 2000), the U.S. (Martin 1959), and France (Sheahan 1966), and by private retail co-ops in Scandinavia (Willner 2006) and private providers of health-care and education in the US (Philipson and Posner 2009). New markets are also becoming (potentially) mixed because of nationalisation (to avoid bankruptcy) and liberalisation (De Fraja 2009). The blocked public health-insurance option represents a recent example from the US political agenda (see Krugman 2009). Private and profit-driven firms are often believed to be less costly. But wider objectives are controversial also without higher costs, because they can create a competitive advantage that may crowd out other firms (Lakdawalla and Philipson 2006), as also argued in the case of the US public option (The Guardian, 29.9.2009). Philipson and Posner (2009) argue that antitrust legislation should apply to all firms, claiming that the deadweight loss is increasing in altruism. Charities are recommended to get no special treatment (i.e. VAT exemptions) also in a recent EU document (European Commission, 6.12.2011). Firms with low returns caused by wider objectives have even been seen as subsidised and hence as a predatory danger to private firms (Monsen and Walters 1983, p. 120), rather than as potential anti-trust tools like in the mixed-oligopoly literature.Footnote 1
 This crowding-out effect (the Cournot-paradox; see Nett 1993) has necessitated assumptions such as public-sector inferiority and increasing marginal costs to rule out exit among the profit maximisers. However, they reduce the predicted benefits of wider objectives (Newbery 2006). Moreover, altruists may be private, public firms are not always inefficient (see Sect. 6), and increasing marginal costs seem to be an exception rather than a rule (see Sects. 5.2 and 6).Footnote 2 It would be more reasonable to assume a combination of social and commercial objectives.Footnote 3 But this would be technically equivalent to an imperfectly competitive restraint on output (Philipson and Posner 2009), and would also reduce the predicted benefits, at least if marginal costs are given. While altruism among public or private firms (and possible tax exemptions) would have no positive impact in a free-entry equilibrium with increasing marginal costs (Lakdawalla and Philipson 2006), it is on the other hand a stylised fact that entry is often sluggish even in the presence of profit opportunities (Geroski 1995).Footnote 4 There is therefore a need to analyse the impact of altruism on welfare and corporate performance under the realistic assumptions of persistent oligopoly and agency problems (and hence endogenous marginal costs). I also ask whether entry should be encouraged under such circumstances. Agency models have been used before for analysing the cost impact of ownership and competition (De Fraja 1993; Willner and Parker 2007; Martin 1993; Beiner et al. 2011), but in a mixed-oligopoly setting they have usually been applied on strategic delegation rather than cost efficiency (see Barros 1995; Goering 2007; Saha and Sensarama 2008; Heywood and Ye 2009; Kopel and Brand 2012).Footnote 5 This is the first contribution on welfare effects in the presence of endogenous cost distortions in a mixed oligopoly with constant marginal costs and asymmetric information. It turns out that the welfare impact of altruism is positive if the market can remain mixed, contrary to Philipson and Posner (2009) and Matsumura (1998). Moreover, while the impact of a mixed oligopoly is at most limited if marginal costs are given, its positive welfare effect is now strengthened because of reductions in marginal costs. This also suggests that the mixed-oligopoly literature should not only focus on profit margins, but also on cost and quality distortions. It also follows that the non-profit maximising firm would survive without subsidies as long as the oligopoly remains mixed. The critical weight for output (or consumer surplus) that would provoke exit is increasing in the variance of the random component of the marginal costs, the manager’s risk-aversion, and her disutility of effort. To encourage entry can be a beneficial, but only if firms are few and if the degree of altruism is low. The next section introduces the ingredients of the model. Section 3 presents a benchmark version with given marginal costs, to illustrate the limited impact of altruism. Section 4 focuses on the main version with endogenous marginal costs, and some restrictive assumptions are relaxed in Sect. 5. Section 6 presents concluding remarks, including and a discussion of controversial predictions. Proofs relating to Sects. 3 and 4 are presented in Appendix A (included), but the proof of Corollary 1 and technical details related to Sect. 5 are included in Appendix B (available as Electronic Supplementary Material).",8
109.0,2.0,Journal of Economics,05 October 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-012-0307-3,Price competition between subsidized organizations,June 2013,Jan Bouckaert,Bruno De Borger,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The revenues of many firms and organizations do not only stem from the prices they charge to their customers. In many instances, other sources of income represent a considerable fraction of their direct revenues. For example, theatres, operas, museums, and other artistic organizations compete for audience while receiving significant subsidies from diverse governmental agencies and sponsoring firms.Footnote 1 In most countries, universities and other institutes of higher education directly compete for students, but at the same time they benefit from considerable government funding.Footnote 2 In some industrial sectors, firms fight for customers while receiving government subsidies for making use of environmentally-friendly production techniques. Of course, outside sources are not limited to government subsidies. For example, it is not unusual for sports leagues to allocate funds from a common revenue source, like broadcasting rights, among their league members. For the competing league members, this often constitutes a considerable part of their revenues. A government may have a variety of reasons for granting subsidies: (i) It may subsidize artistically related activities to prevent the local cultural heritage from disappearing; (ii) Institutes of higher education may be subsidized to support economic growth or, for distributional reasons and to limit social exclusion, to further expand participation rates; (iii) Governments may provide subsidies when there is a social concern about the output level of a monopolistic firm;Footnote 3 (iv) Subsidies may be granted to cope with negative externalities. For example, governments may subsidize clean-producing firms in order to promote the use of renewable energy sources. Finally, private organizations may also have specific incentives to provide funding. The sports leagues referred to above redistribute common broadcasting revenues among their league members mainly to preserve the degree of competitive balance between the different competing teams. They subsidize the weaker league members at the cost of the stronger teams. The allocation of subsidies to firms or organizations in a particular sector can take many forms.Footnote 4 In this paper, we study the competitive and welfare effects of different allocation rules for subsidizing, or distributing funds to, competing organizations. We develop a stylized model with two price-competing firms offering a differentiated product, and we consider the effects of two subsidy systems. In the first one the government provides a fixed per unit subsidy. The second system assumes that a fixed subsidy budget is available for the sector as a whole; allocation to individual firms is then based on their market shares in industry output.Footnote 5 Within this setting, we have two specific but important objectives. First, we analyze the effects of both subsidy systems for prices, output, profits, and welfare. Second, we study the implications of the two different types of subsidies for the long-run incentives to collude. We obtain the following results. First, we show that the per-unit system is more efficient in the sense of Anderson et al. (2001a, b): holding the total subsidy budget constant, a per unit subsidy results in more fierce price competition than a market-share based subsidy. As a result, the per unit subsidy generates a larger market output and is, therefore, more effective at stimulating participation than a market-share based subsidy. Firms enjoy larger profits under the market-share based system. Total welfare is higher for the per unit subsidy. Second, we find that variations in a per unit subsidy have no effect on the incentives to collude. However, increasing the budget available for a market-share based subsidy decreases the incentives to collude. We show that this implies there is less potential for collusion in a market-share based system. Third, interestingly, our results imply that a trade-off between short-run and long-run objectives may exist: a market-share based system performs worse if the objective is to stimulate participation or short-run welfare, but the long-run benefit may be that there are lower incentives to collude. Finally, when the conditions for collusion hold under both subsidy systems, we find that the per-unit system overall performs better since its collusive price is always lower than the collusive price under the market-share based system. While real-world subsidies typically involve complex allocation rules, examples of subsidies that are broadly consistent with one of the systems just described are frequently observed in practice. Examples of per-unit production subsidies are found in international trade (see e.g. Collie 2000), in the cultural sector (Van der Ploeg 2006), and in education (Jacobs and Van der Ploeg 2005). A prominent education example is Denmark’s “taximeter” model, in which universities get funding per passing student (see Kalpazidou et al. 2007). Examples of market-share based subsidy systems are also observed in education (for example, the funding of universities in Belgium), in environmental economics (output-based refunding of environmental taxes in the US and Sweden (Fischer 2003; Gersbach and Requate 2004), and in international trade (Krishna et al. 2001). To the best of our knowledge, a formal comparison of the effects of per-unit and market-share based subsidy systems is not available in the literature. First, a number of papers have explicitly focused on per-unit subsidies. For example, in an early paper Hansmann (1981) studied the implications of subsidies for the behavior of artistic organizations (museums, theatres, etc.) under various different objective functions. He considers different types of subsidies (lump-sum and various other subsidies like a per-unit price subsidy, or a matching subsidy per dollar of revenues raised through donations) and analyzes the effects on ticket prices, output, and welfare. More recently, Fethke (2005, 2006) offers a theoretical framework of competitive behavior in the subsidized market for public higher education; his focus is on a per-unit enrollment subsidy. Second, several papers have focused on market-share based subsidy schemes. Krishna et al. (2001) study market access requirements (MAR), whereby an importing country voluntarily agrees a minimum share of its home market for a good from a foreign country. They look at a subsidy scheme where each targeted firm gets a subsidy proportional to its individual share of the market, provided the market access requirement is met at the aggregate level.Footnote 6 Output-based refunding of environmental taxes in imperfectly competitive markets is another example of this type of subsidies (see, e.g., Fischer 2003; Gersbach and Requate 2004). Under this system, producers are taxed according to their emissions, and total revenues are refunded based on the firm’s market share in total output. Third, at least one study has formally compared a closed-ended with an open-ended subsidy. Fuest and Tillessen (2005) focus on subsidies to support entrepreneurial investment. However, the closed system they consider is of a totally different nature than the market-share based system studied in this paper.Footnote 7 Moreover, although our per unit subsidy can in principle be interpreted as an open-ended system, our comparison studies market outcomes and welfare for a given budget. Finally, the most detailed study of the implications of taxes and subsidies in a differentiated oligopoly is probably (Anderson et al. 2001a, b). They specifically study the relative efficiency of ad valorem and per-unit taxes, defining the relative efficiency of the two tax systems according to whether a system yields higher tax revenues (lower subsidy costs) for given outputs or, alternatively, higher output for given tax revenue (subsidy costs). They show, among others, that ad valorem taxes are (both for Cournot and Bertrand competition) welfare superior to unit taxes if production costs are identical across firms; cost asymmetries make the case for ad valorem stronger under Cournot, but under Bertrand the opposite may hold. Although the current paper also deals with alternative forms of subsidies, it differs from Anderson et al. (2001a, b) on several accounts. We compare a per unit subsidy with a subsidy system where the available budget is allocated according to firms’ market shares; they study per-unit versus ad valorem subsidies. Moreover, we study both the welfare effects and the implications of different subsidy systems for the incentive to collude. A formal comparison of the effects of per-unit and market-share based subsidy systems may be important for several reasons. One is that subsidy systems widely differ across countries, even within the same sector. As noted above, the Danish system of education finance comes closest to a per unit subsidy, whereas other countries have opted for what is better described as a market-share based system, or a complex mixture of the two. Moreover, recent policy changes in some countries could be interpreted as a shift away from one system in the direction of the other. It is then useful to understand the effects of such policy changes.Footnote 8 Another justification for the analysis of the current paper is that very little is known about the long-run effects of different financing arrangements on the structure of the industry. To the extent that different subsidy systems have different implications for the incentives to collude, ways of funding that hamper long-run competition may be less desirable, independent of their effects on pricing and output in the short-run. Our model highlights that different subsidy schemes may significantly alter the strategic behavior between organizations. However, the analysis is highly stylized and simplifies many of the complexities of existing subsidy schemes. For example, the basic version of the model focuses on price competition between profit- or revenue-maximizing organizations. This assumption may not be suited for all subsidized organizations we observe. Hansmann (1981) has argued that many artistic companies (theatres, etc.) probably do not care too much about profit; instead, they may care about quality, attendance, revenues, etc. Similarly, the appropriate objective function for institutes of higher education is likely to be highly multi-dimensional (see, e.g., Winston 1999). We do think that profit or revenue maximizing behavior by the relevant firms or organizations may serve as a useful benchmark. Price competition in the US higher education market has increased significantly (see e.g. Bok 2004; Winston and Zimmerman 2000); moreover, the further globalization of education is likely to result into more tuition competition between European universities. Similarly, although large sports teams no doubt are also interested in winning games and drawing large audiences, their entry on the stock market in the UK and France, among others, suggests that profit maximization will become the rule rather than the exception, be it within the limits set by the league (Szymanski 2003). We therefore believe that our model does capture important ingredients of a broad range of subsidy systems. However, to allow for possible other organizational objectives apart from profit, we also briefly discuss an extension of the model in which the firm also cares for the consumer surplus of its customers (see Sect. 4.3 below), The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we present the structure of the model and explain the properties of the per unit and market-share based subsidy systems. Section 3 derives the market outcomes under Bertrand competition for each of the two subsidy systems. Section 4 reports on a detailed welfare analysis of the two subsidy systems. In Sect. 5 we consider the implications of the two types of subsidies for the incentive to collude on the output market. We summarize our conclusions in Sect. 6.",3
109.0,2.0,Journal of Economics,12 July 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-012-0296-2,Price competition and innovation in markets with brand loyalty,June 2013,Robert C. Schmidt,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It is a widely held belief that firms often benefit from a large customer base. Switching costs are a possible explanation for this phenomenon.Footnote 1 However, the intuition can be misleading, because the size of a firm’s customer base has strategic effects. If an increase in the size of a firm’s customer base induces more intense price competition, a firm may actually prefer to have a smaller customer base in a market with loyal or locked-in consumers. The incentives to invest in a large customer base are, then, limited. This is an important insight, as market share targets are often at the core of firms’ business strategies. Although the idea that a firm may suffer from a large customer base has been mentioned in the literature (Klemperer 1995), little effort has been made to analyze whether it can be obtained under plausible conditions. In an analysis complementary to this paper, Schmidt (2010) shows that a non-monotonic relation between the size of a firm’s customer base and profit can be obtained with only a minimum of assumptions, such as homogeneous goods and (sufficiently) low switching costs. This paper extends the analysis and considers markets where some consumers are fully locked-in at one of the suppliers, e.g. due to (sufficiently) high switching costs, while other consumers can switch their supplier at no cost. In this generalized Bertrand model, outcomes depend both on current prices and on the initial market split (reflecting the distribution of market shares in a previous period). It is shown that there exists no pure strategy equilibrium in this model. Hence, firms use mixed pricing strategies in equilibrium, and outcomes are characterized by price dispersion.Footnote 2
 In the model, the relation between the size of a firm’s customer base and (expected) profit is found to be non-monotonic for a large set of parameter values. In particular, when most consumers can switch at no cost, so we are only a small step away from a standard Bertrand model without locked-in customers, profits are minimized for an even ex-ante market split. This is in sharp contrast with the main result in Schmidt (2010), where price competition is least intense, and hence, profits are maximized for an even market split. The reason for these diverging results is that there are two opposite effects. On the one hand, if the size of, say, firm 1’s customer base increases and firm 2’s decreases, then firm 1 becomes a less aggressive player that seeks to exploit the monopoly power over the locked-in consumers in its customer base. On the other hand, firm 2 becomes a more aggressive player, that tries to attract additional customers. Whether price competition intensifies due to a shift in the initial market split depends on which of these effects dominates. In this model, starting from an even market split, the first effect dominates if the fraction of locked-in consumers is sufficiently small. As a result, a V-shaped relation between customer base size and profit obtains, which implies that both firms prefer a skewed market split to an even one. In Schmidt (2010), the second effect dominates. Starting from an even market split, a firm always suffers from an increase in the size of its customer base as price competition, then, intensifies. These contrasting findings have implications for the nature of competition in an earlier market stage (“period 1”), where consumers are not yet attached to any of the firms. In Schmidt (2010), it is shown that there exists a symmetric equilibrium outcome in the first period of such a two-period game. In contrast, in this paper, firms coordinate on an asymmetric split that leads to higher second-period profits. Furthermore, while in Schmidt (2010), profits in the first period are positive, in this paper, firms are unable to obtain positive profits in the first period, because each firm has an incentive to become the dominant firm in the market. The equilibrium price of the firm that attracts the entire market demand in period 1 is, thus, negative, so some of the profits achieved in the second period are dissipated by the earlier competition for market shares. However, unless all consumers are locked-in in the second period, the profit aggregated over both periods remains positive. Overall, the presence of locked-in consumers allows firms to achieve higher profits than in their absence. The discounted industry profit is maximal when roughly half of the consumers are locked-in in period 2, while the remaining consumers can switch the supplier at no cost. When most consumers are locked-in in period 2, then competition in period 1 becomes so intense that most profits are dissipated by firms’ struggle for future market shares. The model also allows for asymmetries in firms’ marginal costs. This allows us to explore some effects that can arise when firms are able to obtain exclusive access to a marginal cost-reducing innovation, in a market with brand loyalty. To this end, the initial market split is treated as given, and firms’ profits are analyzed as a function of their marginal cost. The goal of this exercise is to determine how the size of a firm’s customer base affects its incentives to innovate. If the value of an innovation stems from the cost savings that it induces, then a firm with a larger customer base may have a higher incentive to innovate than a smaller firm. However, this is not generally true, because the innovation affects the endogenous probability of gaining or losing customers. If the firm that obtains an innovation is more likely to lose customers, its incentives to innovate are lower. Our results indicate that whenever the cost-reduction induced by the innovation is sufficiently large, then it is the firm with the larger customer base that has higher incentives to obtain the innovation. However, if the innovation reduces costs only marginally, then it is the firm with the smaller customer base that is more eager to innovate, if the mass of locked-in consumers is not too large. There is a sizable literature that analyzes the relation between firm size and R&D activity.Footnote 3 Some theoretical contributions (e.g. Budd et al. 1993) allow for inertia in firms’ technologies. Our model offers an alternative view on the value of process innovations. If many consumers are locked-in due to high switching costs, and the initial market split is asymmetric, then the sheer size of the larger firm’s customer base can make this firm more eager to innovate.Footnote 4 Despite price dispersion in equilibrium, this firm is sure to serve a large fraction of market demand also ex-post, which implies that this firm can benefit more from cost-savings induced by the innovation. In markets with locked-in consumers, the possibility to innovate may, therefore, induce more concentrated market structures over time.Footnote 5
 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the basic model and characterizes the equilibrium outcome for the second period (with locked-in consumers). In Sect. 3, we analyze under what conditions a firm prefers to have a larger customer base. Section 4 endogenizes the initial market split by deriving the equilibrium outcome for the first period where consumers are not yet attached to firms. Section 5 discusses firms’ incentives to innovate. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes. All proofs are relegated to the Appendix.",7

Following the finding by Aspremont et al. (1979) that the original model with linear transport costs does not result in a valid Nash equilibrium, several remedies have been proposed. Among these remedies is the use of a finite reservation price (Economides 1984), which is also used in the circular version of the model (Salop 1979). The reservation price may be interpreted as the utility gained from consuming the good or as an outside good. Economides (1984) shows that for a sufficiently low reservation price, the spatial duopoly game turns into a local monopoly game. Böckem (1994) confirms this finding for the model with quadratic transport costs. Hinloopen and van Marrewijk (1999) show that for intermediate values of the reservation price unique pure strategy equilibria exist where the market is fully covered, i.e. the firms serve all consumers. Woeckener (2002) establishes that if reservation prices are uniformly distributed, duopoly firms choose welfare maximizing locations. Throughout the literature, the reservation price is generally considered to be exogenous. At the same time, it crucially impacts the outcomes of the model, as can be seen from e.g. Economides (1984), Böckem (1994), Hinloopen and van Marrewijk (1999), Chen and Riordan (2007). In reality, consumers are unlikely to have exogenous reservation prices, but rather base their reservation prices on the observed price of substitute goods. Moreover, the model with linear transport costs and an exogenous reservation price predicts mill prices that do not depend on the transport costs per unit of distance, which seems to be rather unrealistic.These issues raise the question what would happen if the assumption of exogeneity was dropped. Our contribution to the literature is just that; we develop a version of the Hotelling model with linear transport costs and an endogenous reservation price. We endogenize the reservation price in a way that is consistent with Hotelling’s spatial metaphor and that can also be found in real life settings, i.e. the price of a webshop competing with bricks-and-mortar shops. The webshop bears no transport costs, but has a fixed penalty, regardless of the consumer’s location.Footnote 1 We may think of this penalty in terms of a uniform shipping cost, or in terms of customers valuing the fact that they can hold or try on goods in actual stores. In a product differentiation context, we can think of the webshop as the outside good or composite good, and view the penalty as the amount by which it is different from the good under analysis. Several authors have addressed the issue of competition between webshops and bricks-and-mortar shops in the context of spatial competition. Bouckaert (1999) analyzes free entry in a Salop type model, where firms can choose between entering as a store or a mail order business (or webshop). Bouckaert finds that at most one webshop enters and if it does, each bricks-and-mortar shop faces localized competition from the webshop alone. Moreover, he finds that the presence of a webshop reduces the number of bricks-and-mortar shops in equilibrium. Legros and Stahl (2002) also use a Salop framework to analyze competition between local and global firms. In line with Bouckaert, they find that increased competition from the global market leads to lower variety in the local market. The impact of global competition on prices is ambiguous. Cheng and Nault (2007) model a Salop framework with multiple bricks-and-mortar shops and a potential entrant, where either the entrant or one of the retailers will start selling over the internet first, once the technology becomes available. Who enters first depends on the entry cost advantage and whether the market is covered by the bricks-and-mortar shops. The discussion above reveals an additional contribuiton of our paper to the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to situate the webshop in a linear rather than a circular market. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the model, followed in Sect. 3 by a characterization of the equilibria that follow from the model. Section 4 provides a brief conclusion.

The same counterclockwise orientation is found if we plot the employment rate against the output/capital ratio, as Fig. 2 shows. Cycles in employment rate and the wage share in the US (1956–1998). Sources Piketty and Saez (2003) (Labor Share), annual average of BLS (2009a) monthly data (Employment Rate) Growth cycles in the US (1963–2003). Sources Extended Penn World Tables (3.0) (2008) (output/capital ratio), BLS (2009a) (employment rate) 
The presence of such cyclical behavior in the relevant series has been the object of several studies, beginning with the seminal contribution by Goodwin (1967). In his paper, Goodwin developed a model of the labor share and employment rate based on Lotka–Volterra predator–prey dynamics in which cycles arise endogenously through distributional conflict between capital and labor, and through the role of unemployment as a discipline mechanism on wage demands by workers. The narrative goes as follows. High employment generates wage inflation which, as long as real wages increase more than labor productivity, increases the wage share in output. The resulting decrease in the profit share, it is argued, will act in reducing future investment and output. Lower labor demand will then correspond to lower output, leading the way to lower wage inflation or even wage deflation thus lowering the labor share. But a higher profit share will produce a surge in investment, which will generate higher employment, thus improving workers’ bargaining power and consequently wages. At this point, the wage share has increased, and the cycle can repeat itself. It is well known that Goodwin’s dynamical system generates counterclockwise closed orbits, that is perpetual cycles starting from any initial condition, and a feature that is crucial for generating the type of observed dynamics is the hypothesis that real wages grow with the employment rate. Such an assumption was justified appealing to Phillips curve considerations, but a modern empirical counterpart to it can be found in the wage curve observed first by Blanchflower and Oswald (1990). The streamlined elegance of the Goodwin growth cycle has generated a careful literature focusing on its mathematical properties (only a few examples in this Journal are Flaschel 1984; Sportelli 1995; Velupillai 1979), but also a handful of contributions addressing the empirical relevance of the Goodwin dynamics for advanced capitalist economies. Harvie (2000) analyzes growth and distribution in ten OECD countries, finding qualitative support for counterclockwise oscillations, but rejects the quantitative implications of the model regarding its long-run equilibrium predictions. Furthermore, as also emphasized by Flaschel and Groh (1995), the cycles do not have the periodicity of the usual business cycles and they are not closed orbits. More recently, Barbosa-Filho and Taylor (2007) look at counterclockwise cycles in the labor share and capacity utilization (which obviously correlates positively with employment) for post-war United States, and argue that the underlying mechanism is distributional conflict just as in the Goodwin model. Finally, Kauerman et al. (2008) use non-parametric estimation techniques to look at counterclockwise cycles in the US, both in the short run and the long-run. The details may vary, but the bottom line is that the qualitative behavior of employment-distribution dynamics conforms with the Goodwin narrative of distributional conflict, although actual cyclical patterns appear to shift over time due to structural change (Mohun and Veneziani 2006). These empirical challenges, as well as the presence of structural shifts in the growth cycle, call for refinements of the basic Goodwin framework. A first, important—although neglected in the original Goodwin (1967) contribution—dimension of the links between growth and distribution is the particular pattern of technological change one finds in the data when looking at advanced capitalist economies. The basic observation, made first by Kaldor (1961), is that technological progress increases the productivity of labor inputs but not of capital inputs. In other words, technical change is biased toward labor. While the bias of technology might be the result of non-economic forces—perhaps just a result of chance, as argued by Arrow (1970)—a more appealing explanation builds on grounding a particular direction of technical change on firm behavior. When looking at ways of reducing unit production costs, firms face a menu of available technological improvements that can in principle augment the productivity of every input, but actual firm choices should be guided by relative input costs. This is the main thrust of the literature on induced bias in innovation,Footnote 1 on which papers incorporating endogenous technical change in the Goodwin model such as Shah and Desai (1981), and later van der Ploeg (1987) built on. The particular bias of technological progress observed in the data is linked to distributive shares, in that technical change will be directed toward augmenting the productivity of the factor becoming more expensive. Induced bias proved to be quite fruitful in recent developments such as Foley (2003), where the Goodwin framework is extended to analyze environmental issues, and Julius (2005) who studied the Shah and Desai-like dynamics arising from a special case of Foley’s model. Findings common to this whole literature are that induced innovation bias produces a long-run pattern of technical change that is Harrod-neutral (purely labor augmenting) and endogenously determines constant factor shares in equilibrium, thus not only matching, but also explaining, the basic Kaldor (1961) facts of economic growth. At the same time, induced bias acts toward ‘stabilizing’ Goodwin’s closed orbits, eventually determining convergence of the dynamics to the long-run equilibrium of the economy.Footnote 2

Footnote 3
 One question that so far has received little attention in the Goodwin tradition concerns what are the behavioral premises, as well as the institutional features, that are capable of generating the aggregate dynamics under consideration. Such a quest for microeconomic foundations has the scope of highlighting the role that institutional and/or policy factors can play in shaping growth and distribution patterns when the response to changing policy parameters is the result of self-interested, objective function-maximizing behavior by economic agents. Starting from such considerations, this paper deals with the role of labor market institutions in determining the evolution of real GDP per worker, factor shares, capital accumulation, and employment. As such, it provides behavioral grounds that bridge the literature stemming from Goodwin’s contribution with the growth and distribution approach of Marglin (1984) and Foley and Michl (1999), with the ultimate scope of extending and refining a growth model rooted in the Classical tradition into a framework that is qualitatively consistent with the observed dynamics of advanced capitalist economies such as the United States, and can be used for policy purposes. The accumulation and innovation model I build in this paper is centered around the assumption that workers and firms bargain axiomatically à la Nash (1950) over wages and productivity, taking into account the fact that firms face trade-offs in augmenting the productivity of different factors. As far as production is concerned, I assume full capacity utilization and mainly focus on the non-substitution (Leontief) case, in which labor and capital enter production in fixed proportions, in order to depart as little as possible from the previous studies on the subject.Footnote 4
 The main implications of the present analysis are that economic decisions on wage determination, innovation and capital accumulation eventually boil down to a two-dimensional dynamical system in output/capital ratio and the employment rate. The dynamics of the economy evolve so as to ensure a Harrod-neutral path of technical progress, and a constant long-run employment rate which adjusts so as to ensure the constancy of factor shares at the long-run equilibrium. Convergence to the equilibrium path of growth and distribution occurs cyclically. These oscillations are shown to be qualitatively consistent with the available empirical evidence for post-war United States, and can be verified numerically through simulations. Therefore, the present contribution provides microeconomic foundations compatible with the aggregate behavior observed in the data and analyzed in the literature. More importantly, the behavioral foundations I propose allow to isolate the growth and distribution effects of one institutional and one policy variable, respectively the bargaining power of workers and the unemployment compensation. At an equilibrium of the model, an increase in the workers’ contractual weight induces a higher long-run rate of labor-augmenting innovations, at the price of higher long-run unemployment. An increase in the unemployment compensation also pushes the economy toward higher labor productivity growth, although it determines higher structural unemployment. However, in both scenarios the cyclical convergence to the new equilibrium can produce Goodwin-style overshooting in the employment rate before the economy settles down again on its long-run path. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, I first describe the economic environment, given by the technology for output production and the wage-productivity bargaining structure. Crucial to the model is to determine endogenously an outside option available to workers during wage negotiations. I do so in Sect. 2.3, drawing from contemporary treatments of equilibrium unemployment (Shapiro and Stiglitz 1984; Pissarides 2001). In the baseline version of the model, there is no unemployment compensation. I then turn to savings and accumulation in Sect. 2.4, define and study the market equilibrium pattern of the economy in Sect. 2.5. In Sect. 3, I then turn to studying both analytically and in simulations the aggregate dynamical system that arises in equilibrium, and work through comparative dynamics exercises for varying exogenous parameters. Finally, I work out several extensions in Sect. 4 to include the effects of unemployment compensation, variations in capacity utilization, workers’ savings, as well as to introduce capital/labor substitution. Section 5 concludes. Most of the results in this paper are stated as propositions: proofs, as well as an account for the parameters used in the numerical simulations, are provided in the Appendices.",14

109.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,28 August 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-012-0298-0,"Federalism, education-related public good and growth when agents are heterogeneous",July 2013,Floriana Cerniglia,Riccarda Longaretti,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"More than 40 years have passed since economists first formally addressed the theory of fiscal federalism. Richard Musgrave, in 1959, gave a definition of fiscal federalism as a system whose purpose “is to permit different groups living in various states to express different preferences for public services; and this inevitably leads to differences in the levels of taxation and public services” (Musgrave 1959, p. 179). Hence, the more heterogeneous the federal population, the greater the need for decentralization. This argument was substantiated by the seminal works of Tiebout (1956), Olson (1969) and Oates (1972). Since these path-breaking studies, the theoretical literature has comprised a large amount of papers (for surveys see Oates 1999 and Ahmad and Brosio 2006) which confirm this first insight: that is, with varying tastes and incomes of all citizens in a country, central and uniform provision—as opposed to decentralized provision—may result in a loss of welfare as the distance between the deciders and beneficiaries of the public goods increases. However, in most of the literature on fiscal federalism, the heterogeneity argument, which implies economic gains and benefits, has been mainly explored within a static setting. Instead, in this paper we intend to explore the heterogeneity issue in a dynamic setting, our purpose being to study the effects of decentralization on economic growth. This dynamic analysis is one of the distinctive contributions of our paper. We believe that the linkage between decentralization and growth requires investigation because in recent decades decentralization policies have been hugely promoted in many countries, especially in the developing world, in order to foster and enhance growth (see Bardhan 2006). Nevertheless, at present there is no simple answer to the question “does federalism promote growth?”, and to tell the truth only very recently economists have sought to identify in more detail some potential transmission channels for an impact of fiscal federalism on economic growth.Footnote 1 We therefore believe that the link between decentralization and growth warrants further research. To the best of our knowledge, the only theoretical papers that tackle this issue are those by Brueckner (2006); Hatfield (2009), Imi (2005), Lejour and Verbon (1997), Lessman (2009, 2011), Koethenbuerger and Lockwood (2010), and Chou and Yang (2012). These last four papers are quite similar to each other in the sense that the distinctive feature is that the impact of federalism on economic growth is analyzed via a tax competition mechanism that works through an endogenous growth model. Basically, the novelty of these studies is that the well-known fiscal externality generated in a tax competition modelFootnote 2 can be offset when an endogenous growth model is considered. So, these models under different features show that tax competition between countries (or local governments in a federal union) will lead to higher economic growth. Instead, the source of economic growth in Brueckner (2006) is the targeting of public spending on the preferences of two different groups of individuals (young and old) who live into two different jurisdictions. So, federalism, by allowing public good levels to be tailored to the different demands of young and old individuals, increases the incentive to save. This incentive leads to an increase in investment in human capital and hence fosters economic growth. As we will explain below, our paper is related to Brueckner (2006), but we depart from and extend Brueckner’s analysis in many respects. The empirical research on the link between decentralization and growth has been more intense than the theoretical inquiry. However, the results are mixed: some papers—for instance Davoodi and Zou (1998) and Ezcurra and Pascual (2008)—do not find robust evidence of a relationship between decentralization and growth; on the other hand, other papers (see Thiessen 2003) have found more robust evidence that fiscal federalism affects growth.Footnote 3 Whatever the case may be, a review of the empirical literature shows that these conflicting results may be due to the different measures of fiscal decentralization that can be used, as well as to samples, estimation methods, etc. Most importantly, however, it seems that the empirical works are prevented from testing the decentralization-growth nexus properly mainly because of a lack of clear theoretical explanation as to why one should expect this relationship to exist. In order to tackle the issue theoretically, in this paper we build an endogenous-growth model with overlapping generations and heterogeneous agents. We extensively modify Brueckner’s paper in two respects. Firstly, in Brueckner, heterogeneity across individuals—and therefore across jurisdictions—is only age-related. In other words, heterogeneity is modeled in an ad hoc way, given that the young individuals and the old individuals live in separate jurisdictions, so that there are only two jurisdictions. Therefore the transmission mechanism of the benefits of decentralization on growth in Brueckner can be labeled as a “Tiebout mechanism”Footnote 4. By contrast, in our model, heterogeneity is captured by the initial level of human capital and all individuals are completely heterogeneous. This allows us to study the effects of intra-jurisdiction heterogeneity on growth. Hence another distinctive contribution of our paper with respect to Brueckner’s is that it studies the link between decentralization and growth in an environment where heterogeneity lies along two dimensions: inter-jurisdictional and intra-jurisdictional. Secondly, we modify Brueckner’s analysis by considering a publicly provided public good which is related to the educational process or accumulation of human capital. This public good can be conceived for instance as consisting in the training programs which may be chosen by governments to improve the educational process in the economy or, put differently, the human capital of a country. Policies (both at federal and local level) aimed at improving a country’s human capital are widely observed in practice. Brueckner himself suggests this analysis as an extension of his model left for further research. The argument that the better targeting of human capital in a decentralized scenario could be growth enhancing was originally and informally suggested by Oates (1993). Our set-up allows us to formalize Oates’ idea in detail. We conduct the analysis considering three scenarios. First, we start by assuming an idealized economy where heterogeneity across individuals coincides with heterogeneity across jurisdictions, so that the provision of the public good is tailored to suit individual preferences. In a sense, as we say in the paper, this economy may be conceived as a world à la Tiebout (one individual in each jurisdiction), and for an economy of this kind we obtain a provision of an education-related public good in each jurisdiction that perfectly fulfills individual demands and therefore this coincides with the efficient provision of the public good. Secondly in the analysis we consider a centralized economy or a unitary system where a uniform level of public good is provided regardless of heterogeneity across individuals. This allows us to compare the performance of the centralized economy with a world à la Tiebout. These two scenarios obviously are two extremes or benchmark scenarios and they may be seen as two preliminary steps to introduce the main focus of our paper which is the decentralized economy. As third step in the paper, we consider, more realistically, a third scenario, which we call a decentralized economy or a federalist system. By developing this third scenario, we partition the heterogeneous individuals into a finite number of jurisdictions with the aim of studying the rates of growth in an economy in which both inter-jurisdictional heterogeneity and intra-jurisdictional heterogeneity are present. Our aim in analyzing these three scenarios is to identify a transmission channel between (de)centralization and growth. The first scenario that we analyze, the idealized Tiebout world, is similar to Brueckner’s framework, where intra-jurisdiction heterogeneity is completely neglected. We show that, in the idealized Tiebout world, where education-related public good levels are tailored to the human capital of heterogeneous agents, human capital accumulation is higher, and this leads to higher growth with respect to the centralized economy. In fact, in the centralized economy the opposite happens: the level of the public good cannot be tailored to individual needs and this mismatch is a source of inefficiency and the growth rates are lower. Turning the attention to the main focus of our paper, that is the decentralized economy, our results show that the benefits of decentralization on growth for a jurisdiction are higher, the richer and more heterogeneous is the jurisdiction. In particular, decentralization of the public good may enable a poor region to grow at higher rates as long as heterogeneity in the distribution of human capital offsets the low average of human capital. We also demonstrate that a poor and not sufficiently heterogeneous region would be worse off by decentralization in terms of growth rates, but very interestingly the dynamics of interpersonal inequality within a region (proxied by intra-jurisdiction heterogeneity) would slow down with respect to centralization. Another very interesting prediction of our paper is that, under certain conditions, the decentralized economy could exhibit a catching-up phenomenon by the poor region with the richer one. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model. Section 3 describes the Tiebout world. Section 4 presents the centralized economy. Section 5 analyzes the decentralized world, and Sect. 6 concludes and presents some stylized facts that give us encouraging evidence of the empirical predictions of our model.",10
109.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,15 July 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-012-0294-4,On inferior inputs and marginal returns,July 2013,Paolo Bertoletti,Giorgio Rampa,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"An “inferior” input is one the demand for which decreases with output, at given prices. Clearly, this feature is a property of the cost-minimizing “conditional” demand system, \(\varvec{x}(\varvec{w}, y)\), where \(\varvec{x}\) is a vector of \(n\) inputs whose positive prices are given by \(\varvec{w}\), and \(y\) indicates the output level.Footnote 1 We will discuss the case for an inferior input by assuming that the production function \(y=f(\varvec{x})\) is twice differentiable, strictly increasing and (locally) strongly quasi-concave. Accordingly (see e.g. Avriel et al. 1988, paragraph 4.3), at any interior solution \(\varvec{x}(\cdot )\) is differentiable, and input \(i\) is (locally) inferior if and only if \(x_{iy} = \partial x_{i}/\partial y\,<\,0\). In spite of its simple definition, the case for an inferior input has not yet (as far as we know) received a convincing interpretation in terms of the underlying technology. For a given level of output, at an interior solution the optimal input mix will equate the Marginal rates of technical substitution (MRTSs, which are given by the ratios of marginal productivities) to the corresponding price ratios. Accordingly, the question of the existence of an inferior input concerns the way these rates change across isoquants (i.e., for changes in the output level). It is easy to make a graphical argument for inferiority in the two-input case (see e.g. Katz and Rosen 1998, chapter 10, Figure 10.16), but surprisingly difficult to relate it to properties of the production function. However, it has long been known (see Hicks 1946, chapter VII; Samuelson 1947, chapter IV; Puu 1971) that, under (strong) concavity of the production function, an input is inferior if and only if it is “regressive”, i.e., if a rise in its price increases the profit-maximizing level of output \(y(p, \varvec{w})\), where \(p\) is the output price. The simple reason is that an input is inferior if and only if a rise in its price decreases the marginal cost. This fact is easily established by Shephard’s Lemma, whereby the derivative of the cost function \(c(\varvec{w}, y)\) with respect to input prices is equal to the demand system, i.e., in matrix terms, (the operator \(\varvec{D}\) stands for the set of first derivatives), and thus it must be the case that where \(c_{y} = \partial c/ \partial y\) is marginal cost. The result given in (2) is a nontrivial implication of cost minimization. Its simple economic intuition is that an increase in the price of an input will actually raise the marginal cost if and only if that input l is not substituted away upon increases in output. As a further consequence, under (strong) concavity of the production function, all inputs must be “normal” (that is, their demand must increase with respect to output) if they are not “competitive”,Footnote 2 i.e. if all the cross derivatives of the production function are non-negative (technically, this property is equivalent to the requirement of supermodularity of the production function, if this is twice differentiable: see e.g. Quah 2007).Footnote 3 This comes from the fact that the Jacobian of the profit-maximizing demand system, \(\tilde{\varvec{x}}(p, \varvec{w})\), with respect to input prices, is given by: where \(\varvec{D}^{2}f(\varvec{x})\) is the Hessian of the production function and \(p\) the output price. Now, if all the off-diagonal elements of \(\varvec{D}^{2}f(\cdot )\) are non-negative, a clear-cut conclusion concerning the substitutability properties of \(\tilde{\varvec{x}}(\cdot )\) follows. In fact, it is well known that in that case its inverse \(\varvec{D}^{2}f(\cdot )^{-1}\) must be a non-positive matrix (see e.g. Takayama 1985, chapter 4, and in particular Theorem 4.D.3, p. 393). That is, according to terminology introduced by Hicks (1956), under concavity all inputs must be gross
\(p\)-complements (i.e., \(\partial \tilde{x}_i /\partial w_{j}\,<\, 0,\; i,j = 1, {\ldots }, n)\) if they are all gross
\(q\)-complements (\(f_{ij}=\frac{\partial ^2f}{\partial x_i x_j } \ge 0, i, j = 1, {\ldots }, n, i \ne j\), where \(f_{ij}\) is the cross derivative of the production function with respect to inputs \(i\) and \(j)\): see e.g. Bertoletti (2005). Since it follows that if no cross derivative of the marginal products is negative, then \(\varvec{D}_{\varvec{w}}y(\cdot )\,<\, \mathbf 0 \) and no input can be regressive. In other words, any regressive input \(j\) must have at least a gross \(p\)-substitute (i.e., there must exist an input \(i\) such that \(\partial \tilde{x}_i /\partial w_{j}\,>\,0\)), otherwise the profit-maximizing level of output could not increase. This result is often, and to some extent misleadingly, stated through the assertion that a necessary but not sufficient condition for an input to be inferior is that (some) inputs are competitive (see e.g. Epstein and Spiegel 2000, Proposition 1, p. 505). This assertion has apparently shaped the search for technologies that exhibit inferior inputs: see Epstein and Spiegel (2000) and Weber (2001). In the next section, we will discuss the conditions for obtaining an inferior input under the assumption (which is standard for analyzing cost-minimizing behavior) of bare (strong) quasi-concavity of the production function. This weaker assumption is necessary because we want to focus on the case of increasing marginal returns, which seems, as far as we know, to have attracted no attention in the literature. Intuitively, an input is inferior if at a larger productive scale it should be economically substituted. From (2), this can be interpreted as requiring that the marginal productivities of all inputs be raised by an increase in the inferior input price, subsequent to input adjustment. We will illustrate the case for inferiority without “competitiveness” among inputs (meaning negative cross derivatives of marginal productivities) by considering a simple class of additive functional forms for the production function in the case of two inputs, with the normal input (there must be at least one) exhibiting increasing marginal returns. The point we make also applies to the case of many inputs, on condition that the input with increasing returns enters the production function additively, and in the two-input case to any sign of the cross derivative under certain restrictions. These results provide an economically meaningful rationale for the existence of inferior inputs, namely their association with the existence of increasing returns with respect to another input, and suggest that the case for inferiority could be stronger than is commonly thought.",4

Furthermore, bounds of rationality (for instance, endowment effects, framing effects, biases, etc.) may preclude smooth reversions of resource allocations. On top of that, according to Stiglitz (2000, p. 1459), “there are natural irreversibilities associated with the creation of knowledge: history has to matter.” Differentiating from such lines of inquiry, we shall address the irreversibility of sequences of choices of producers and consumers. It is the aim of the present contribution to argue about the relevance of the order with which basic effects drive sequential economic choices, so that reversing such an order may not re-establish initial conditions (choices). Definitely, we shall tailor an analytical framework for the commutativity (Fig. 1) of independent and finite substitution effects (“SUE” henceforth) and output/income effects (expansion effects, “EXE” henceforth), so as to address a facet of the irreversibility of microeconomic choices which the extant literature does not seem to encompass. Perhaps, Bogetoft et al. (2006) represent the closest perspective to the one we shall be dealing with, in which the order of effects and the benchmark role of homotheticity are at stake. Weber (2010) argues about the reversibility of the compensated-income function. The ‘nuisances’ generated by income effects are well known to be rooted in the inherent entanglement between EXE, price changes and SUE. On the one hand, producers’ and consumers’ optimization problems are 0-homogeneous in expenditure/income and prices (for instance, doubling both income and prices has no effect on the solution bundle; we shall denote such a property by “0-h”). On the other hand, price changes onset both EXE and SUE according to Slutsky equations: the variation in an optimal bundle can be decomposed as the superposition of a notional infinitesimal EXE and a notional infinitesimal SUE, being the order of such fictitious effects inherently irrelevant (Cowell 2005, p. 87). In fact, applied Slutsky equations typically employ functional forms lacking generality,Footnote 1 thereby setting inherent limits to the analysis of EXE and SUE. A commutative diagram for EXE and SUE (a truism for the infinitesimal effects in Slutsky equations) Furthermore, comparative statics deals, by definition, with commuting effects: definitely, the first order Taylor expansion of a function \(g(x,y),\)
 entails a (commutative) sum of contributions which reverse their signs together with the ‘driving effects’ \(h\) and \(k\); so to say, comparative statics is bound to the commutativity of infinitesimal effects (recall, according to Baumol (1973), “We have become used to comparative statics arguments whose results are remarkable for their banality”). As is well known, once finite effects are at stake, the commutativity represented in (1) may not hold anymore, as manifested in the problem of the commutativity of vector fields in the theory of dynamical systems, which we shall employ in our approach to global (i.e. defined on all of bundle space), independent and finite EXE and SUE, so as to fix the homotheticity benchmark in terms of scale symmetry, and then measure the departure from such a benchmark in terms of the Lie bracketFootnote 2 of expansion and substitution flows, thereby tailoring a unified approach to both finite and infinitesimal effects. We shall be concerned with the microeconomics of both single output producer’s and consumer’s choices, between which we shall not differentiate unless suggested by the sharpness of the arguments; we shall therefore generally employ the following unifying conventions. By the term input we shall refer to both production inputs and consumption goods, and employ \(x\) and \(y\) to denote both the inputs and the variables representing the quantities of such inputs.Footnote 3 By expansion paths we shall refer to both output and income expansion paths. We shall denote both isoquants and indifference curves by the expression level
curves. By budget constraint and marginal rate of substitution (MRS) we shall denote corresponding notions for producers and consumers. SUE shall be typically parametrized by the input ratioFootnote 4
\(\kappa =y/x\) or MRS (equivalent to price ratio by FOC). Our manifold shall be the space \(\mathcal{B }=(0,\infty )\times (0,\infty )\) (endowed with the natural differentiable structure) of the combinations (bundles) of inputs \(x\) and \(y\): we shall disregard problems admitting ‘corner’ solutions (thereby ruling out perfect substitutability), which would force us to introduce more ‘costly’ geometry (manifolds with boundary) without correspondingly beneficial insights. For the same reasons we shall disregard multioutput settings. Objective functions shall be smooth and convex, so as to make sense of the following arguments. Our geometric approach is meant to help escape the straitjacket of comparative statics, which is well suited for addressing local conditions (typically FOC) and at the same time ‘myopic’ with respect to global conditions, like the ones represented in the definition of normal and luxury goods. As long established, it is the global picture of expansion paths which establishes whether a good is luxury or not; the slope of Engel curves at a single point cannot tell luxury. Needless to say, our framework is not meant to deviate from the mainstream of microeconomic analysis, but rather to take a natural step for embracing Engel curves and expansion paths in a global framework, in which additive and scaling expansion flows on input space tailor EXE and their commutation properties with SUE. Our differential geometric approach compares, to some extent, with the one employed by Williams (2008) in the analysis of communication in mechanism design. In turn, our geometrical perspective deepens the benchmark relevance of homothetic symmetry. In fact, our approach enlightens the relevance of the independence of technical and allocative inefficiencies, with respect to which Bogetoft et al. (2006) set forth a reversed decomposition of overall efficiency which counters the standard approach named after Farrell (1957), thereby raising concerns about the consistency of such measures. “From a conceptual point of view, we suggest that the interpretations associated with the notions of technical and allocative efficiency are more ambiguous if the size of the effects depends on the order of decomposition” (Bogetoft et al. 2006, p. 451). Such an instance, as will be seen, can be given a fundamental microeconomic status, accounting for the consistency of decompositions in the benchmark case of homothetic problems; in fact, according to Chambers and Mitchell (2001), “Homotheticity may be the most common functional restriction employed in economics.” The plan of the rest of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we introduce our first proposition on commutativity and homotheticity. In Sect. 3 we introduce vector fields and Lie brackets. In Sect. 4 we set forth our global picture for EXE and SUE and their commutation setting, and tailor our main proposition. In Sect. 5 we apply such a framework to Farrell decompositions. A final section sketches possible avenues for future research. A pair of appendices collect technical results supporting main arguments.",5

Along with full privatization, partial privatization also has been a major focus of interest in the mixed oligopoly theory from both real and theoretical aspects. In the real world, partial privatization has been one of the key reform methods for public firms and is widely seen in both developed and developing countries.Footnote 1 Furthermore, from theoretical aspects, Matsumura (1998) shows that partial privatization increases welfare more than full privatization: partial privatization is desirable in terms of welfare. In recent years, several analyses of the optimal degree of privatization from these aspects have been conducted in various settings: product differentiation Fujiwara (2007), foreign ownerships of private firms or international competition (Cato and Matsumura 2012; Han and Ogawa 2009; Lin 2007; Lin and Matsumura 2012; Wang and Chen 2010, 2011), conjectural valuations (Heywood and Ye 2010), and competition between two domestic public firms (Saha 2009). These previous works show that the optimal degree of privatization can be affected by several factors: the substitutability of the products, the number of firms, the share of foreign ownership, etc. At the same time, recent years have also seen studies associated with the environmental problem in a mixed oligopoly (Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón 2006; Beladi and Chao 2006; Cato 2008; Chen and Wang 2010; Kato 2006, 2011; Naito and Ogawa 2009; Ohori 2006a; Ohori 2006b; Pal and Saha 2010; Wang and Wang 2009; Wang et al. 2009). The appearance of these works can be attributed to the escalation of environmental problems, such as acid rain, global warming, and air and water pollution, in the world. In countries that suffer from environmental problems or have high interest in environmental problems, regardless of whether they are developed or developing, mixed oligopolies can be widely observed.
 Here, we pick up China as an example of the environmental problem in a mixed oligopoly, particularly focusing on the relationships between privatization and the environment. Table 1 shows the increase in \(\mathrm{{CO_2}}\) and \(\mathrm{{SO_2}}\) emissions in China from 2004 to 2006, while Table 2 gives the decline in the number of public firms and the increase in the number of private firm during the same period. It can thus be said that these exists the possibility that privatization worsened the environment in China.Footnote 2
 As for the theoretical aspects, in the works on environmental problems in an oligopoly, all players have traditionally been assumed to be private profit-maximizers. However, when considering a mixed oligopoly, the public firm too can be regarded as an important player. In the mixed oligopoly theory, the objective of the public firm is different from that of the private firm, and is often assumed to be welfare maximization. This difference in the objectives of the public and private firms can affect the equilibrium outcome and the effect of the environmental policy to a large extent. As such, we can see the growing interest for environmental problems in a mixed oligopoly. Taking into consideration the above two streams of researches on mixed oligopoly, we pose the following question from the theoretical aspects. How does the degree of environmental damage affect the optimal degree of privatization? Since the welfare-maximizing public firm takes into consideration environmental damage, the optimal degree of privatization may be affected by the degree of environmental damage. As for studies with motivation similar to ours, we have Naito and Ogawa (2009), Wang et al. (2009), and Pal and Saha (2010) who consider the optimal degree of privatization in an environmental problem under emission tax in the domestic market.Footnote 3 These studies provide deep insight about the relationships between the emission tax and the optimal degree of privatization.Footnote 4 However, in these studies, lots of effects determine the optimal degree of privatization, and thus, it is somewhat difficult to understand the basic property for the optimal degree of privatization in an environmental problem. In order to see the basic property in the simplest framework, we do not consider any environmental policies and any abatement investment to reduce its emission in our model. If the emission tax is considered, the optimal degree of privatization is influenced not only by the direct effect of the environmental damage but also the indirect effect through the emission tax. Thus, the effects on the optimal degree of privatization are more complicated. Moreover, if environmental policies other than the emission tax are considered, the optimal degree of privatization might differ (Kato 2010). As for the abatement investment, this is a specific endogenous variable in the environmental problems. Comparing the optimal degree of privatization in the environmental problem with that in other models, we can see the differences more clearly when the firms cannot invest any abatement effort. Furthermore, Naito and Ogawa (2009) show that full nationalization is optimal for the government when firms can invest abatement effort under no environmental regulation. This result strongly depends on this setting: the private firm does not abate its emissions under no environmental regulation.Footnote 5
 Our analyses have another characteristic that is different from Naito and Ogawa (2009), Pal and Saha (2010), and Wang et al. (2009). We consider two types of ownerships of the private firm: (\(h\)) the private firm is perfectly owned by domestic private investors and (\(f\)) it is perfectly owned by foreign private investors. The aforementioned previous works limit their analyses to the case where the public firm competes with a domestic private firm. In the real world, globalization is resulting in competition becoming more multifaceted: the public firm does not always compete with a domestic private firm (Matsumura et al. 2009; Wang and Chen 2010, 2011). Meanwhile, in the literature on the mixed oligopoly theory, we often observe different results between (\(h\)) and (\(f\)).Footnote 6 From both real and theoretical aspects, we explore the optimal degree of privatization for the two cases: (\(h\)) and (\(f\)). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the basic model of a mixed duopoly in an environmental problem. Section 3 derives the equilibrium outcome in cases (\(h\)) and (\(f\)) and compares them. Section 4 compares our results with those in some related works, and concludes. Detailed calculations for the equilibrium outcome in each case and the proofs of the propositions are given in the Appendices.",24

Such a situation may arise, for example, if a firm can reduce pollution, if a region provides goods but cannot exclude its use by inhabitants from neighboring regions, if a country takes measures against climate change, if an individual decides on household production in a partnership, etc. This paper addresses the question under which circumstances an efficient provision of the public good is achieved in a noncooperative framework where unconditional transfers between players are possible. We analyze a game between two players in which only the second player is capable of producing a public good, facing a price that may deviate from marginal cost due to existing taxes or subsidies. The first player can affect the decision of the second player only by making an unconditional transfer. According to the reaction function of the second player, the first player perceives a (marginal) personal price of the public good. In this framework, it is shown that public good provision satisfies the Samuelson efficiency rule if and only if the sum of the price of the public good for the second player and the perceived price of this good for the first player add up to the resource cost. This summation property is known from the Lindahl equilibrium in which all agents unanimously prefer the same level of the public good at personalized prices (see Walker 1981 for a mechanism design approach). However, in the textbook Lindahl model efficiency is lost when moving to a sequential game structure (Myles 1995, ch. 9). By contrast, the Lindahl equilibrium can be implemented when agents announce subsidy rates for contributions of others before the provision decisions are taken (Danziger and Schnytzer 1991; Althammer and Buchholz 1993; Varian 1994). Further, it is well known that government subsidies increase the private supply of public goods in many frameworks (Andreoni and Bergstrom 1996). A second interesting property of the efficient solution is that the perceived price of the public good for the first player will under mild conditions always exceed the price of the second player. As these two prices have to add up to the resource cost to restore efficiency, the personal price of the second player has to fall short of half of the resource cost. My contribution bears some relation to the analysis of monopolistic provision of a public good. Güth and Hellwig (1986) argue that a profit-maximizing monopolist faces the same problem as the government to extract information on the demand curve of the consumers. They show that profit-maximizing mechanisms will involve an undersupply of the public good. The inefficiency will also not vanish if the number of buyers becomes large (Rob 1989; Mailath and Postlewaite 1990; Hellwig 2003) and arises also under alternative institutional settings (Martimont and Moreira 2010). In contrast to this main strand of the literature, the current approach does not exhibit information asymmetries and communication is extremely limited. This setup is realistic when there are high transaction costs of standard bargaining procedures, that may, for example, stem from a risk of a breakdown of the mutually beneficial relationship between the players. The remainder of this note is organized as follows. After introducing the model in Sect. 2, first-best allocations and equilibrium outcomes are characterized in Sect. 3. The main results on the Lindahl property and the price structure for achieving a first-best allocation are collected in Sect. 4. After presenting an application to the theory of household taxation in Sect. 5, the concluding Sect. 6 indicates possibilities for extensions and further applications.",
110.0,2.0,Journal of Economics,07 October 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-012-0313-5,On the rationalizability of observed consumers’ choices when preferences depend on budget sets: comment,October 2013,Robert H. Frank,Matthew G. Nagler,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In a recent article in this journal, Bilancini (2011) demonstrates under reasonably general conditions that certain non-traditional assumptions about preferences can render the theory of revealed preference effectively unusable. The principal focus of his analysis is the assumption of price-dependent preferences or, more generally, that preferences depend on budget sets. But he makes a similar point regarding the interdependent preference assumption, which holds that the utility an individual receives from a given consumption bundle often depends on the consumption bundles chosen by others. Bilancini’s finding leads him to declare that “assuming that preferences depend on budget sets is illegitimate  under the scientific commitments of revealed preference theory” (p. 275, emphasis added) and that interdependent preferences “may not be safe from a methodological standpoint” (p. 277). Some readers might be tempted to infer from these statements that if something must be abandoned, it is not the theory of revealed preference, but the new assumptions about preferences. First introduced by Samuelson (1938, 1948), and later extended by Houthakker (1950) and Afriat (1967), the theory of revealed preference provides testable implications for rational consumption behavior given observed sets of budget and choice observations.Footnote 1 Perhaps the core application of the theory is the ability to infer that anything a person does, given the situation (e.g., the relevant values of prices and income), maximizes his utility. Thus one consumption bundle leads to higher welfare than another if the first bundle is chosen under circumstances in which the second bundle was also affordable. Varian (1982, 2012) has classified and demonstrated a number of other practical applications of the theory, including the prediction of demand under new budget configurations, the measurement of auction values, and measurement of the welfare effects of price discrimination. The recent and ongoing revolution in behavioral economics has resulted in a number of modifications of the standard model of decision-making behavior that raise questions about the normative implications of revealed preferences. People may change their choices based on criteria that seem manifestly irrelevant to welfare, such as the way options are framed or the time at which the choice is presented. To cope with these issues, modified versions of revealed preference theory have been introduced that allow its limited application or that simply acknowledge its irrelevance under certain circumstances (Koszegi and Rabin 2008; Bernheim and Rangel 2009). Bilancini’s reflection on price-dependent and interdependent preferences is not the first such examination of these particular issues. Pollak (1977) draws a distinction between “normal” and “market” prices which, coupled with his relative price hypothesis, provides a basis for accounting for price-dependent preferences in a way that is consistent with revealed preference theory, albeit with some potential complications for actual application.Footnote 2 His separate discussion of endogenous tastes is relevant to the more general issue of reconciling both price-dependent and interdependent preferences with traditional demand and welfare analysis (Pollak 1978). More recently Balasko (2003) has shown that most properties of the standard equilibrium model can be extended to the model where preferences depend upon prices. What all these approaches have in common is that they find that some modification of revealed preference theory, or some re-framing of what the non-traditional preferences in question imply, is needed to allow one to fit the other. In this note we do not challenge Bilancini’s claim that non-traditional preference assumptions may be inconsistent with revealed preference theory. Rather we argue that the most sensible response to that observation cannot be simply to abandon all non-traditional assumptions about preferences. As scientists, our goal must be to understand the economic choices of actual people. It is necessary to weigh revealed preference theory’s ability to help us do that against the corresponding contribution of assuming non-traditional preferences—something Bilancini has not done. We argue that the case for acknowledging fundamental weaknesses in revealed preference theory is in fact far stronger than the case for abandoning the non-traditional assumptions that Bilancini characterizes as illegitimate and unsafe.",2

The former aims to prevent or reduce anthropogenic processes that (are believed to) affect climate change, e.g., emission of greenhouse gases (GHG), thereby preventing or delaying its harmful consequences. The latter is concerned with reducing or eliminating climate change induced damages once they occur.Footnote 1 Examples of adaptive measures include using artificial snow making in the Alps, the construction of levees to prevent flooding of plain areas as a result of rising seawater, or the development of crop varieties immune to pathogens that are likely to flourish with changes in certain climate characteristics. Since the atmosphere is a global, open-access and common resource, preventive policies, such as reduction of global GHG emission, require concerted and coordinated international effort, in which the scope of a single country to influence policy is limited (Dockner and Long 1993; Barrett 2003). On the other hand, a country can significantly affect climate change-induced damages that may be inflicted upon it by undertaking appropriate adaptive measures well in advance. From the vantage point of countries that are vulnerable to irreversible consequences of climate change, proactive adaptive policies may well be preferred to mitigation policies.Footnote 2 In this work we focus on adaptive climate policies. The situation considered is that of a “small” country under threat of a catastrophic damage that may be induced by abrupt climate change. The climate change process is exogenous (to the country) and the onset of the abrupt catastrophic event is uncertain. An adaptation policy entails investing in a particular sort of capital that will reduce the damage inflicted by the calamity when it occurs. This investment consumes resources and entails real costs but yields benefits only after the catastrophe occurs. The policy design problem involves the investment and buildup of the adaptation capital in light of the delicate tradeoffs between the (certain) investment costs prior to occurrence and the benefits after (the uncertain) occurrence. The damage inflicted by a catastrophic climate change can assume different forms, shapes and scales, depending on the nature of the catastrophe (rise in seawater, disease outburst, extended drought) and on the afflicted location (see the taxonomy of events-damages in de Zeeuw and Zemel 2012). Following Karp and Tsur (2011), we assume that the event reduces income by a certain share from the occurrence date onwards. The innovation here is to make this reduction a function of the stock of the adaptation capital at the occurrence date. The flow of investment benefits can then be associated with the reduction in the expected income loss vis-à-vis the expected loss that would have been realized without the investment (or under different investment policies). We characterize the optimal investment policy and show how it depends on preferences (time discounting and aversion to intergenerational inequality), the (exogenous) catastrophic hazard, the marginal productivity of preventive capital, and the scale and severity of the damage. We find that for stationary economies (without technical change), investment in adaptation capital may not always be warranted, depending on time preferences, risk aversion, the catastrophic hazard (occurrence risk) and the severity of the ensuing damage. When undertaking adaptation measures is warranted, which is always the case for truly catastrophic damages, the optimal adaptation capital process converges monotonically to a unique steady state. In contrast, growing economies should always engage in adaptation and eventually build the corresponding capital stock to the point beyond which it is no longer effective. The intuitive explanation is rather simple. A larger economy stands more to lose in case the event strikes and, at the same time, can more easily afford to relinquish the resources needed to invest in adaptation capital. For stationary economies growth is (at best) transitional, whereas a growing economy gets larger and larger as time goes by. A similar effect of economic growth on climate policies was found in the context of mitigation policies (abatement of GHG emission), namely, for a stationary economy optimal emission reaches a steady state, whereas for a growing economy emission should eventually be diminished to achieve a zero hazard (see Tsur and Zemel 2009). The present work complements this line of study and provides a basis for extensions that will investigate the effect of economic growth on mitigation–adaptation tradeoffs.Footnote 3

Sections 3 and 4 characterize the optimal policy for stationary and growing economies, respectively, and provide insights into some salient properties.

The same approach is adopted here, however emphasis is given to a specific transaction cost, namely the cost of information, e.g. the cost of search, data gathering and processing of market information. The basic monetary model we encounter in strategic market games incorporates outside money that it is introduced by the imposition of a cash-in-advance constraint. This sort of money emphasises on its transactions role whereas the store of value function has been neglected due to the static character of the game. Hence, it enables us to scrutinize the role of transaction costs and their disturbing role in forming policy decisions. In specific, we argue that the monetary policy affects the overall cost of traders not only by the variations to the quantity of money but also by the associated information cost. The argument is simple. As long as the price expectations of traders are affected by the quantity of money, any change will incur additional expenses to the traders for the market price revelation. Originally, the basic market mechanism is extended so as to incorporate, first inside money via credit provided by an outside Bank, and second information costs. The provision of credit by a Bank was first introduced by Shubik and Wilson (1977), and later used by Shubik and Tsomocos (1992) and Dubey and Geanakoplos (1992, 2000).Therefore, the role of the Bank is twofold; first the Bank has the exclusive authority to issue fiat money and second, it is responsible to provide credit to traders. Furthermore, the presence of the Bank has a prominent role for the existence of the monetary equilibrium, since it guarantees positive value for the fiat money. Regarding to the information cost, no attempt has been made to be modeled in detail, and for the ease of exposition it is imposed in a linear form. With some laborious manipulations we could let the information cost be convex. In addition, the model provides some useful insights for the effect of monetary policy on the transactions technology which is specifically associated to the information of traders. By comparative statics, we examine how the monetary policy affects the structural knowledge of traders (Kurz 1994a, b) when the traders have rational expectations and their beliefs are formed in a monotonic way. Both assumptions are demanding in the ability of traders to gather and process market information. On top of that it is not provided the process of learning by which the Rational Expectations equilibrium is attained. Kurz (1994a) suggested as alternative concept the rational belief equilibrium that may accommodate a non stationary element in the formation of beliefs, stemming from the forecast error of traders. This approach is less demanding in information and provides the dynamics where beliefs formation affects the equilibrium outcome. The emphasis on the market inefficiencies stemming from the market information makes rational beliefs, as in this model, consistent with an active role for the monetary policy. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides some basic preliminary notation and definitions. Section 3 depicts the onetary model whereas Sect. 4 unfolds the information effect of monetary policy. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",

These intermediate inputs are crucial in a sense that the production of final product is not possible without them. At the same time, the local companies could invest into the development of new technology that will allow the production of crucial intermediate inputs domestically. This paper explores how the governments of developing countries might use trade policy in order to stimulate new technology adoption in their countries. The vertically integrated markets were modelled by Spencer and Jones (1991, 1992) and Wang et al. (2011) among others. The typical setup is that vertically integrated foreign company supplies both intermediate and final goods to the home country. A tariff on final good imposed by home country induces foreign firm to supply intermediate good. Tariff on intermediate good causes the price of intermediate good to increase, according to Wang et al. (2011). According to Spencer and Jones (1992), the increase in the tariff imposed on final good causes the decrease in the price of intermediate good, when the foreign firm is integrated. Though the effect of increase in the tariff on final good is opposite in the case the foreign firm is not integrated. In modelling technology adoption, I follow Crowley (2006), which is based on Reinganum (1981) and Fudenberg and Tirole (1985). Crowley (2006) demonstrated that antidumping duty on imports of firms from country with positive technological shock leads to earlier technology adoption by both import-competing and exporting firms relative to the free trade case. At the same time, the safeguard tariff that is applied to both country with positive technological shock and country without that shock, accelerates the technology adoption by import competing firms in country imposing the tariff. While it slows down the technology adoption by exporting firms against which the tariff was introduced. Further, Mukunoki (2010) studied the effect of formation of PTA on the technology adoption in the setup of three countries among which one country has old technology. The main finding is that the formation of FTA between the country with old technology and the developed one speeds up the technology adoption and the realization of multilateral free trade. At the same time, the formation of CU between these countries delays the technology adoption and the realization of multilateral free trade. This paper combines the modeling of vertically integrated markets in line with Spencer and Jones (1991) with the technology adoption, which is done similar to Crowley (2006). The contribution of this paper is to analyze the factors influencing the timing of technology adoption in vertically integrated markets. The domestic firm is dependent on a foreign vertically integrated firm for supplies of a intermediate good before the technology adoption and can produce the intermediate good after the technology adoption. Tariff regulation influences the timing of technology adoption that, in turn, affects the country’s welfare. Initially, when the cost of technology adoption is significant, the optimal tariffs are the ones maximizing country’s instantaneous welfare. With the decline in the cost of technology adoption over time, the government should start to stimulate the technology adoption by the domestic firm. It is done through a lower tariff on imports of final good, which decreases the protection of domestic firm from foreign competitor. Also, the higher tariff on imports of intermediate good decreases the profit of domestic company and provides additional incentives for earlier technology adoption. The remainder of this paper includes: Sect. 2, which develops the model, and explores the properties of the equilibria before and after technology adoption; Sect. 3, which provides results on the timing of technology adoption and describes the underlying mechanisms behind stated results, and Sect. 4, which provides conclusions.",1

In the sense that an ad valorem tax produces lower prices compared to an equal-revenue unit tax, this tax is the better choice of the two. Suits and Musgrave (1953) show this, in general, for the case of monopoly. Subsequently, Delipalla and Keen (1992) demonstrate the result in oligopoly. However, under perfect competition, there is no reason to prefer one of the two kinds of consumer taxes. With the exception of Schröder (2004), the two taxes have not been compared on an equal yield basis in monopolistic competition. It is of obvious interest, in theory and maybe even more practically, whether one can establish, under reasonable assumptions, that ad valorem taxes are better than unit taxes in monopolistic competition. On the other hand, when the superiority of ad valorem taxes can be traced back to one, or a few, crucial assumptions, these assumptions must surely be realistic.Footnote 1 Otherwise the implications will be met with some scepticism. I want to argue that this applies to Schröder’s result on taxes in monopolistic competition by showing how some key assumptions generate the results. Monopolistic competition has been discussed formally by Spence (1976) and Dixit and Stiglitz (1977). A common thread in these analyses is that consumers have a preference for product variety. In this regard, there is a set of products that are close but yet imperfect substitutes. Limited substitutability gives each firm some monopoly power but entry and exit drive profit to zero. Schröder applies the Dixit–Stiglitz model, but in a variant with two decisive characteristics. First, taxes will not affect the way income is distributed upon different sectors. Second, demand per variety has constant price elasticity, in turn resulting in mark-up pricing with a constant mark-up. As we explain, together with the zero profit restriction, this fully explains why ad valorem taxes are the better choice. We show that the price under ad valorem taxation is lower than the price under an equal-revenue unit tax whenever (1) firms use mark-up pricing with a constant mark-up, (2) firms pay a fixed cost independent of actual production, (3) entry and exit drive per-firm profit to zero, and (4) consumers spend some fixed proportion of income on taxed goods. Moreover, the result can be strengthened, allowing for positive non-decreasing marginal production costs. Our proposition on the superiority of ad valorem taxes encompasses in addition to standard Dixit–Stiglitz model of monopolistic completion also oligopoly. In this meaning Schröder’s results are not specific to monopolistic competition and they might not be robust in other types of monopolistic competition models.Footnote 2

Andersen,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A significant upward trend in the age composition of the population (ageing) is a global phenomenon driven both by falling fertility and increasing longevity. It is widely known that these changes will have large consequences for public finances. It has become standard to assess the financial consequences in terms of fiscal sustainability (see e.g. European Commission 2009). Fiscal sustainability indicatorsFootnote 1 are based on projections for public expenditures and revenues, and thus the budget balance, given demographic projections, and yield the permanent change in the budget balance (in % of GDP) ensuring that the intertemporal budget constraint of the public sector is met. Since the demographic trend usually causes a downward trend in the budget balance, such calculations imply that fiscal sustainability is ensured by establishing sufficiently large budget surpluses for an initial period to finance deficits arising later.Footnote 2 This is sometimes denoted a consolidation or pre-savings strategy (see e.g. IMF 2004; European Commission 2006, 2009) since it implies that public finances are sufficiently consolidated to manage budget deteriorations in the future due to the changing demographic structure of the population. Such analyses build on the premise that welfare schemes are not strict PAYG-schemes. Differences between expenditures and revenues in a given period of time are possible as long as the intertemporal budget constraint is met. Via the budget balance (and therefore the debt level), there is effectively a transfer of resources over time and thus generations (see e.g. Gordon and Varian 1988). This raises important normative questions concerning the appropriate way of addressing changing demographics. This applies not least to changes in longevity, which implies that different cohorts have different circumstances and thus utility options.Footnote 3
 Computations of fiscal sustainability are often associated with normative statements on the needed policy changes. However, the sustainability indicator is a positive metric of the orders of magnitude based entirely on the intertemporal budget constraint, and therefore it does not have any immediate normative interpretation (see e.g. Andersen 2012). Often the consolidation strategy is motivated in terms of tax smoothing (Barro 1979). The argument being that tax distortions are minimized by keeping distorting tax rates constant letting variations in expenditures and revenues be absorbed via the budget balance. Applying this reasoning to the ageing problem requires a once and for all change in policy which immediately improves the budget and therefore implies pre-funding of demographic trends. While the tax smoothing argument per se is important, it does not follow that consolidation of trends driven by e.g. increasing longevity should be pre-funded. Having marginal tax rates constant across time and generations does not imply anything about the (net) tax burden which should rest on given generations. This paper takes a first step in addressing the normative question on intergenerational redistribution and risk sharing across cohorts with different options in terms of longevity. In a seminal paper Calvo and Obstfeld (1988) addressed intergenerational redistribution in an OLG model with an age dependent survival rate under a utilitarian criterion. They found that the optimal allocation entails consumption smoothing across generations; i.e. the same consumption level for all agents across age and time.Footnote 4 If there is heterogeneity in the population concerning survival rates, the utilitarian optimum implies redistribution from groups with high mortality (low longevity) to groups with low mortality (high longevity), cf. Sheshinski (2006). A similar mechanism is at stake when different generations have different longevity (Auerbach and Hassett 2002, 2007). In the empirically relevant case of a trend increase in longevity (see Christensen et al. 2009 and Oeppen and Vaupel 2002), this line of reasoning supports pre-saving or consolidation to ensure consumption smoothing across generations. This implies redistribution from current generations with short longevity to future generations with longer longevity. However, in the above mentioned work retirement is not endogenized. It is a restrictive (implicit) assumption to take the retirement age to be exogenous when longevity changes. In modelling retirement this paper builds on a tradition based on Crawford and Lilien (1981). Retirement is modelled as a labour supply decision on the extensive margin involving a trade-off between the consumption possibilities generated by postponing retirement and the utility gain from more leisure upon retirement. In a setting where longevity is allowed to change, the assumptions made about the age dependent disutility from work are crucial. A key issue is whether increases in longevity are adding more healthy years to life (see e.g. OECD 2006) as there is support for.Footnote 5 Healthy ageing makes it possible to retire later without necessarily incurring higher disutility from work, and a specification in accordance with healthy ageing is adopted in this paper. Addressing the problem of distribution and risk sharing across generations with different longevity raises a difficult modelling problem. A comparison of (steady-state) allocations under different longevity (survival functions) assumptions is not capturing the problem that there is redistribution across different cohorts with different longevity. Analysing this problem easily becomes rather complicated. This paper presents a simple workhorse model to analyse this problem.Footnote 6 The model is a simple extension of the basic two-period OLG model allowing for varying longevity across generations and endogenous retirement. It is shown that retirement plays a crucial role when longevity is increasing. It is well known from the literature that a utilitarian planner aims at consumption smoothing based on the marginal utility of consumption. A trend increase in longevity implies a larger consumption need tending to increase the marginal utility of consumption. However, it also affects the scope for working, and under a notion of healthy ageing it is shown that the social optimum also has work smoothing in the sense that the relative retirement age is constant (the deterministic case) across generations. This is crucial for the extent of redistribution taking place since cohorts with longer longevity have larger consumption needs, they are also going to work longer, and therefore in part contributing to the financing of this larger consumption need. However, it is shown that a constant relative retirement age is not sufficient to imply that intergenerational redistribution remains unaffected by trend changes in longevity. In the case of a trend increase in longevity, a utilitarian planner will front-load some financing (pre-saving) to be capable of achieving the desired consumption and work smoothing. Stochastic cohort-specific longevity raises the issue of intergenerational risk sharing, which in general goes in the same direction as life annuities; that is, cohorts turning out to have a high longevity are compensated at the expense of cohorts turning out to have a relatively short longevity. It is shown that it is possible to separate intergenerational redistribution and risk sharing by making the cohort-specific retirement age dependent on expected longevity. This paper focuses on longevity, savings, retirement and social security. Therefore, a number of simplifying assumptions are made to highlight the role of longevity. This includes exogenous changes in longevity,Footnote 7 a constant marginal product of labour (deterministic) and a small open economy assumption implying an exogenous interest rate (making it possible to disregard feedbacks to rates of return and the capital stock). The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 sets up the overlapping generations model with different and stochastic life expectancy for different generations and endogenous retirement. The social optimal allocation across generations is considered in Sect. 3. Issues of intergenerational distribution and risk sharing are addressed in Sects. 4 and 5, respectively. Section 6 offers a few conclusions.",7
111.0,1.0,Journal of Economics,30 October 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-012-0317-1,Optimal size of the government: the role of the elasticity of substitution,February 2014,Manuel A. Gómez,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In his seminal work Barro 1990 introduced the flow of government expenditure, which is financed by a distortionary income tax, as a productive input to private production. Thus, public policy has two opposite effects on growth which, under Cobb–Douglas technology, offset each other if the tax rate on income is equal to the elasticity of public spending in production. Furthermore, this growth-maximizing tax rate also maximizes intertemporal utility in a second-best sense. The empirical literature, however, provides evidence against the unitary elasticity of substitution implicit in the Cobb–Douglas specification, and in favor of a more general constant-elasticity-of-substitution (CES) specification (e.g., Klump et al. 2007; León-Ledesma et al. 2010). The departure from the assumption of a unitary elasticity of substitution has important consequences on many issues in growth theory as, among others, the level of macroeconomic variables and the growth rate (Klump and De La Grandville 2000; Irmen and Klump 2009; Xue and Yip 2012), the existence of endogenous growth (Palivos and Karagiannis 2010), the effect of biased technical change (Blanchard 1997), multiple equilibria (Azariadis 1996), (in)determinacy of equilibria (Guo and Lansing 2009; Wong and Yip 2010), the speed of convergence (Turnovsky 2002), or the dynamics of the saving rate (Gómez 2008a). This paper adds to this literature by analyzing the implications on the optimal fiscal policy of assuming a non-unitary elasticity of substitution in the (Barro 1990) model of endogenous growth with productive public services. As Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992) argue, almost all public services are subject to some degree of congestion, so that the pure public good should be viewed as only a benchmark. Hence, following Turnovsky (1996, 1997), we allow for different degrees of congestion in public services (see also, e.g., Eicher and Turnovsky 2000; Gómez 2008b). First, we analyze the equilibrium dynamics of the decentralized economy. Next, we characterize the first-best outcome that a benevolent central planner would implement. Then, we study the tax rate on income that maximizes long-run growth and the one that maximizes the representative agent’s utility—i.e., the second-best solution—in the market economy, and compare them with the first-best solution. Our main result is that the interplay of assuming a non-unitary elasticity of substitution and allowing for different degrees of congestion has significant consequences on the optimal fiscal policy. The standard (Barro 1990) result on the equality between the growth-maximizing, welfare-maximizing and first-best income taxes holds if and only if production is Cobb–Douglas or there is proportional congestion. If congestion is non-proportional—or in the absence of congestion—the first-best income tax is lower (greater) than the second-best welfare-maximizing and the growth-maximizing income taxes if the elasticity of substitution is below (above) unity. Furthermore, if the elasticity of substitution is below unity we show that the welfare-maximizing income tax is lower than the growth-maximizing tax rate. This relation is reversed, under mild conditions—e.g., in the absence of congestion—if the elasticity of substitution is above unity. The first-best solution can be decentralized as a market equilibrium only in the presence of proportional congestion, when the second-best outcome coincides with the first-best solution. Otherwise, the first-best solution cannot be decentralized, and the first-best long-run growth rate is greater than the maximum long-run growth rate attainable in the decentralized economy. Intuitively, income taxation has two opposite effects on growth. On the one hand, it lowers growth because it reduces the private marginal return to capital which discourages private investment. On the other hand, the public services provided stimulate growth. The individual agent ignores the externality caused by congestion which would lead to over-accumulation of capital. If congestion is proportional the negative effect of the income tax exactly offsets the effect of the externality and, therefore, the growth-maximizing income tax is equal to the first-best income tax. However, with a lower degree of congestion—or without congestion—the negative growth effect of the income tax dominates, and the first-best income tax is no longer optimal for growth-maximizing in the market economy. If capital and public services are substitutes, reducing public services will result in individual agents increasing the stock of capital. Hence, the individual agent can partly avoid the negative net effect of taxation by substituting away from public services. Thus, the growth-maximizing government size would be lesser than the first-best one. If capital and public services are complements, an increase in public services may lead to more capital accumulation. Hence, the growth-maximizing government size would be greater than the first-best one. In the borderline Cobb–Douglas case, the growth-maximizing and the first-best income tax rates coincide. Given that the second-best welfare-maximizing income tax has to balance the effect on the long-run growth rate and the effect on initial consumption, it will generally lie between the first-best and the growth-maximizing tax rates. Related work has been made by Devarajan et al. (1996) and Ghosh and Gregoriou (2008), but they have only analyzed the welfare-maximizing solution. Recently, Misch et al. (2012) studied the relationship between the welfare- and growth-maximizing solutions in a variety of models with productive services.Footnote 1 However, they do not obtain general analytical results for the CES specification and must rely instead on numerical simulations. In addition, all of these works consider the simplest case in which public services are subject to proportional relative congestion and, as we show, allowing for different degrees of congestion has crucial implications. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 studies the first-best solution attainable by a social planner. Section 4 analyzes the growth- and welfare-maximizing income tax and compares them with the first-best solution. Section 5 concludes.",4
111.0,1.0,Journal of Economics,05 November 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-012-0322-4,Coalitional fairness in interim differential information economies,February 2014,Chiara Donnini,Maria Gabriella Graziano,Marialaura Pesce,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The problem of a fair distribution of resources among agents has been widely investigated and many notions of fair allocation have been adopted to evaluate equity. Since Foley (1967), one of the most extensively studied concept has been the one according to which an allocation is fair if it is envy-free and efficient. Under an analysis conducted on the individualistic level, an allocation is said to be envy-free if each individual prefers to keep his bundle rather than to receive the bundle of another agent. It is known that in a pure exchange economy, fair allocations always exist (see Theorem 2.3 in Varian 1974). This is so, simply because any competitive allocation, resulting from an equal sharing of the total initial endowment, is fair. This result has been generalized in Svensson (1983). On the other hand, when production is allowed, envy-freeness may be incompatible with efficiency and therefore the set of fair allocations may be empty. The same problem arises when agents are asymmetrically informed at the time of contracting. Recent papers by de Clippel (2008), Gajdos and Tallon (2002), exhibit the tension between the concepts of envy-freeness and efficiency in models that explicitly encompass uncertainty. The incompatibility may occur if the allocation is judged before or after the realization of uncertainty, as well as according to an interim stage evaluation. Stronger notions of equity require that bundle comparisons are allowed between groups of agents according to a coalitional envy concept. This approach is introduced by Varian (1974), (see also Vind 1971) and, on a slightly different base, by Gabszewicz (1975). An allocation is coalitional fair (briefly c-fair), if no coalition envies the aggregate bundle, and this is Varian’s definition, or, and this is Gabszewicz’s approach, the net trade of another coalition. In both cases, differently from individual fairness, the efficiency is implicitly satisfied and the existence is guaranteed under standard assumptions. Moreover, despite of differences due to technical requirements about the measures of potentially envious coalitions, c-fair allocations introduced in both papers provide a complete characterization of competitive market equilibria (see also Yannelis 1985; Zhou 1992, for analogous results). The aim of this paper is to identify Gabszewicz’s coalitional fairness notion as a suitable criterion to evaluate allocations on an equitable basis when agents are asymmetrically informed. As in Wilson (1978), we assume that the true state of nature is commonly known at the time of implementing the contracts, focusing on interim fairness notions. The straightforward extension to differential information economies of the c-fairness criterion introduced by Varian cannot serve the same purpose since, when uncertainty is involved and agents are asymmetrically informed, a fair allocation (and, a fortiori, a c-fair one) may not exist, as shown by de Clippel (2008). Therefore, we extend to our context the coalitional fairness notion introduced by Gabszewicz (1975), so that an allocation is qualified c-fair if it is not possible to find an alternative allocation such that in each state of nature a coalition of agents can redistribute among its members the net trade of a disjoint coalition and each of them, using his own private information, is better off. Our main result shows that this set of c-fair allocations is non-empty. We do it by proving that c-fair allocations of a differential information economy correspond to c-fair allocations of an auxiliary Arrow-Debreu exchange economy with uncertainty and symmetric information. Agents of the auxiliary economy are defined by adapting the idea used by Harsanyi (1967–1968) to define Bayesian games. A type-agent is a couple \((t, E)\), where \(t\) is an agent and \(E\) is an event of his information partition. The future state of the fictitious economy is uncertain, but each type-agent has no private information. Moreover, since contracts are contingent on the future state of the economy, standard Arrow-Debreu equilibrium notions can be applied. We adapt this representation in the framework of mixed markets and prove that there is a natural correspondence between the original and the auxiliary economy, which preserves c-fair allocations and constrained market equilibria. This allows us to conclude that the set of c-fair allocations is non-empty, since it contains the set of constrained market equilibria. In general, this inclusion may be strict, and it becomes an equivalence under additional assumptions. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we present the model, describe main ideas and state our results. Proofs are collected in the final section.",5

Firms split their production process and outsource activities, from product design to assembly. This split expands vertical inter-firm relationships and trade in customized parts. In such vertical relationships, the “hold-up problem” appears to be crucial (Klein et al. 1978). The canonical example goes as follows. A buyer commissions a supplier to produce a tailor-made input. Either the supplier or both the buyer and the supplier make ex ante non-contractible and relationship-specific investments to transact. At the (re)negotiation stage, investors are locked into the relationship and risk not receiving ex post the overall return of their autonomous investments. Two potential economic inefficiencies result from the hold-up problem. The investors may under-invest in specific assets (Grossman and Hart 1986) and/or waste resources to protect her investment returns. Following the classification introduced in Che and Hausch (1999), autonomous specific investments can be either ‘selfish’, when they generate a direct benefit only for the investor, ‘purely cooperative’, when the direct benefit only goes to the partner of the investor, or ‘hybrid’, when it offers direct benefits to both parties. A first stream of the literature concentrates on selfish investments and shows that simple renegotiable fixed-price contracts can solve the hold-up problem (Chung 1991; Aghion et al. 1994; Edlin and Reichelstein 1995, 1996; Nöldeke 1995).Footnote 1
Che and Hausch (1999) concentrate on purely cooperative and hybrid investments. They show that with purely cooperative investments contracting has value only if the parties can commit not to renegotiate, while renegotiable contracts offer no advantage over a simple ex post negotiation. They also show that renegotiable contracts can be valuable when investments are hybrid. In all the literature we have referred to investments are autonomous, i.e., each party decides independently from the other and one party’s investment has effect even if the other decides not to invest. In this paper we study the value of partial commitment to solve the hold-up problem for joint investments. Joint investments require an explicit cooperation between the parties: one party investment generates benefits only if the other party also invests, so that investments are complementary. In that setting, we show that with joint investments renegotiable contracts are always potentially valuable, but never able to restore first best incentives for both parties. This result echoes the hybrid case of Che and Hausch where a simple contract is also potentially valuable without restoring first best incentives. However, the setting is different. They coined as purely cooperative or partly cooperative (i.e., hybrid) investments that are autonomous.Footnote 2 Thus, a restriction of the Che and Hausch’s investments lies in their lack of joint work. In our setting, firms cooperate in the sense that their investments are complementary. Considering joint investments may help to understand how cooperation emerges in Japanese procurement practices. Our framework roughly fits some stylized facts about the Japanese buyer–supplier relationships. First, parties trade in customized parts, which require autonomous and joint relationship-specific investments [see among others Asanuma (1985a, b), Asanuma (1989); Aoki (1988), Nishiguchi (1994), Qiu and Spencer (2002) and Spencer and Qiu (2001)]. As an example of joint investments, Japanese car manufacturers cooperate with suppliers to design parts of the final product.Footnote 3 They coordinate tasks, share information and meet each other. This cooperation is typically linked to joint investments, which are the source of productivity improvements over time. Second, Japanese practices tend to differ from American ones in key areas such as quality control and price determination. However, characterizing Japanese arrangements as informal and cooperative and Western arrangements as formal and antagonistic is a coarse generalization. In fact, the difference is blurred, as Western firms have adopted many Japanese practices [see e.g Cusumano and Takeishi (1991)], while Japanese firms contract with their partners (Asanuma 1985a, b, Nishiguchi 1994). Based on a survey of automobile manufacturers, Cusumano and Takeishi (1991) provide evidence of the contractual nature of the Japanese buyer–supplier relationships. They find that, for each new model of car, parties sign a new contract. “The most common contract (62 % of the sample) is 4 years, corresponding to the average model life-cycle” (Cusumano and Takeishi 1991). Given that the average total duration of a Japanese buyer–supplier relationship is about ten years, this means that parties sign up to three different contracts by relationship. Third, these contractual arrangements provide room for renegotiation. Parties write basic renegotiable contracts establishing basic rules covering a range of items including price determination, payment, delivery, property rights, the supply of materials and quality issues (Nishiguchi 1994). Finally, these contractual arrangements also promote cooperation. The typical contract sets a target price for each input produced. Buyers then cooperate and help suppliers to reach their targets (Cusumano and Takeishi 1991; see also Nishiguchi 1994). Therefore, overall Japanese firms seem to rely on partial commitment to their relationships and ex post bargaining to promote cooperation and joint investments. Our result also echoes the literature on the value of partial commitment devices in other strategic and decision-theoretic environments. For instance, Colombo and Merzoni (2006, 2008) stress the value of partial commitment to a relationship in terms of the duration of contracts, while Amador et al. (2006) show the value of commitment devices that partially limit the freedom of choice with time-inconsistent preferences. Our contribution is also related to McLaren (1999), who distinguishes joint from autonomous investments. However, the latter are assumed to be not relationship specific. This implies parties can pay an additional fee to adapt the tailor-made input to an alternative buyer. Under this assumption, a non-renegotiable fixed-price contract gives optimal incentives for autonomous investments, but not for joint work. Ex post bargaining is thus required to foster cooperation, as the supplier can always get the buyer to share the costs ex post. We assume instead that autonomous investments are relationship-specific and we find that a fixed-price contract is valuable to promote cooperation.Footnote 4 However, this result is not necessarily in conflict with McLaren (1999). In fact, in both settings, the possibility of bargaining ex post fosters cooperation: although the present setting underlines the value of contracting as partial commitment, contract incompleteness leaves room for renegotiation.Footnote 5
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present the model, a simple two-stage game between a buyer and a supplier. In Sect. 3, we establish two benchmark outcomes to compare our results: the first-best and the ex post bargaining (without an initial contract). In Sect. 4, we show how a formal fixed-price contract arrangement may foster cooperation. Finally, in Sect. 5, we conclude.",3

111.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,11 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-012-0327-z,Partial ownership and cross-border mergers,April 2014,Frank Stähler,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"This paper explains partial ownership by information asymmetries. The model applies to both vertical and horizontal cross-border mergers: A foreign firm considering an acquisition of a local firm does not know the productivity of the potential target, because it is private information of the target firm. The productivity of the target determines the scope of merger gains. If the foreign firm specified only the acquisition price, it would suffer from the lemons problem: unless the acquisition price is very high, only the low productivities will accept, but the high productivities will reject. Hence, the firm would discriminate against high productivities if foreign ownership has to be complete. Alternatively, the merger proposal could be made dependent on the future performance of the target, like future output. However, takeover contracts based on future performance are rare, and the reason is the limited liability of the previous owner. Since the future profitability of a target may be uncertain, it is sensible to assume that a previous owner cannot be held responsible for after merger losses so foreign firms cannot claim a part of the acquisition price back if their expectations are not met. But if performance-related contracts cannot be written, the foreign firm may still use partial ownership as a screening device. A productive target can be expected to accept a high share of after merger profits as a compensation for accepting partial ownership of the foreign firm even if the sales price for foreign partial ownership is not large. Conversely, a less productive target will not accept this offer, as it correctly anticipates that after merger profits will be small. Hence, leaving a part of the future after merger profit to the target may qualify for a proper screening scheme. The background of this paper is that cross-border mergers have become a hotly debated issue since countries have experienced several merger waves. The World Investment Report estimates a value of US$ 297 billion of cross-border mergers and acquisitions in 2003, compared to US$ 151 billion in 1990 (see UNCTAD 2004). It is not only this substantial figure but also the size of individual mergers which makes this foreign direct investment (FDI) mode important. For example, the largest single FDI inflow to Germany was by far the takeover of Mannesmann Mobilfunk, a local cellphone company, by British Vodaphone in 2000.Footnote 1 The substantial share of cross-border mergers in FDI demonstrates that combining assets across countries has been expected to lead to large expected merger gains.Footnote 2 However, not all mergers are success stories, and even substantial merger losses do happen from time to time,Footnote 3 demonstrating that a foreign firm does not always know the size of after merger gains when specifying the merger proposal. The obvious reason is asymmetric information between a foreign firm and a local target, and this is the first starting-point of this analysis. The second starting-point is the observation that mergers do not necessarily imply a complete takeover by the foreign firm. For example, Asiedu and Esfahani (2001) show that the degree of foreign equity participation rises with foreign assets. Partial ownership is a universal feature of FDI in general and mergers in particular, meaning that mergers are not equivalent to complete takeovers. Furthermore, information asymmetries are found to be most important when it comes to cross-border merger activities and if these activities affect private instead of publicly listed targets. Several empirical papers like Martynova and Renneborg (2006) have demonstrated that partial ownership is universal in mergers. López Duarte and García-Canal (2004) and Garcia et al. (2002) demonstrate the importance of partial acquisition strategies for Spanish multinational firms as a response to information asymmetries. Shen and Reuer (2005) demonstrate that, ceteris paribus, private targets are less preferred compared to public firms because they offer less information on assets. Desai et al. (2004) investigate the determinants of partial ownership of foreign affiliates of U.S. firms. Henceforth, our analysis is primarily geared towards the case of a foreign firm which wants to merge with a private target whose shares are concentrated in the hands of a few or a single owner and are not diversified.Footnote 4
 In summary, our model discusses how partial ownership as a screening device may solve the problem.Footnote 5 The innovation of the paper is that a share agreement is scrutinized in a principal-agent framework which may allow the principal (i.e. the foreign firm) to capture the whole surplus. If the principal cannot capture the whole surplus, we arrive at the interesting result that partial ownership leads to discrimination against intermediate productivities, if at all. In both cases, ownership is endogenous, and the endogenous ownership share is always different from zero and one.Footnote 6 After having discussed the implications of the basic model, we will demonstrate how our model extends to the case that the foreign firm negotiates simultaneously with all potential target firms. This is not the first paper dealing with cross-border mergers. The international economics literature has mainly dealt with the impact of mergers on international trade patterns. Barros and Cabral (1994) and Horn and Levinsohn (2001) discuss the impact of trade policies on mergers. Neary (2007) discusses the role of mergers as a result of comparative advantages in a general equilibrium setting. Horn and Persson (2001) determine the equilibrium ownership of firms by a cooperative approach of coalition formation. Qiu and Zhou (2006) discuss the effects of information sharing and/or output coordination on the performance of an international merger. Other papers have dealt with mergers as a certain mode of foreign direct investment and compare the merger incentive with greenfield investment or the incentive to form a joint venture (see Bjorvatn 2004; Chowdhury and Chowdhury 2001; Das 1999; Raff et al. 2012). Kabiraj and Chaudhuri (1999) compare the welfare effects of domestic and cross-border mergers under different assumptions on market structures. There is also an extensive literature on cross-border joint ventures, pronouncing that shared ownership in joint ventures is important if the joint venture is subject to moral hazard and adverse selection (Balakrishnan and Koza 1993; Chi 1996), if agency costs increase in the foreign share of a joint venture (Nakamura and Yeung 1994) or if foreign intangible assets are substantial (Nakamura and Xie 1998).Footnote 7 The difference from this paper is that those papers do not consider different degrees of partial ownership whereas this paper will endogenize the degree of partial ownership.Footnote 8 Konrad and Lommerud (2001) and Fuest (2005) have endogenized ownership as a means of a multinational firm to alleviate a hold-up problem and to reduce the burden of corporate taxation, respectively.Footnote 9
 Mergers have also received a lot of attention in the finance literature. One strand of this literature has dealt with the division of merger gains after a profitable target has been identified by an investor.Footnote 10 Another strand of this literature has dealt with the optimal behavior of potential investors before a merger might be found profitable.Footnote 11 This literature thus emphasizes the strategic effects of partial ownership during and before merger negotiations take place. Furthermore, numerous papers have emphasized the crucial role information asymmetries play for the method of payment in a merger deal.Footnote 12 These papers either deal with the case of an uninformed seller not exactly knowing the value of an equity offer or with the case of two-sided information asymmetries. They focus on the type of payment (cash versus equity). Partial ownership is not considered as endogenous, and is not a strategic variable in merger negotiations as this paper will show.Footnote 13
 Our model has some features in common with share contracts (see Bhattacharyya and Lafontaine 1995; Canjels et al. 2001; Dai 2004, and for a general treatment of wealth-constrained agents, see Lewis and Sappington 2000a). The difference is that share contracts assume a binding wealth constraint for the partner who is (still) carrying out future actions, whereas our model considers a target whose owner will not take any independent future action once the merger deal is done. The basic model is closest to Hviid and Prendergast (1993) who also consider a target with private information and a merger proposal as a take it or leave it offer. The difference is that both firms are already rivals in a market, so the market performance can be given by a Bayesian equilibrium. A rejected proposal signals a high profitability of the target and increases the target’s profit and decreases bidder’s profit. In our model, the foreign firm is a newcomer to the local market, and to our knowledge only one paper has dealt with partial ownership as a screening device in a share model of adverse selection. Raff et al. (2009) discuss why multinational firms often share ownership of a foreign affiliate with a local partner. Their model predicts that the multinational’s ownership share is increasing in its productivity, and they show that their results are consistent with data on the ownership choices of Japanese multinationals. Their analysis assumes the existence of a separating equilibrium whereas this paper will scrutinize the existence and characteristics of both pooling and separating equilibria. This paper thus focusses on the role of incomplete information as the only market imperfection. Other imperfections like financial constraints, incomplete contracts and capital market imperfections could also give rise to partial ownership, as could governmental restrictions. We see our approach complementary to these possible explanations but it seems that asymmetric information could play a more important role in particular for cross-border mergers. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model, and Sect. 3 determines the equilibrium offer of the foreign firm. It also demonstrates that the results are similar if the foreign firm negotiates with all potential target firms simultaneously. Section 4 presents two examples for a horizontal merger in a Cournot market, and Sect. 5 concludes the paper. For convenience, technical details and proofs have been relegated to the appendix.",5

For example, it was reported Footnote 1 on February 24, 2012, that Apple acquired Chomp, a company that produced a search engine (application software or an “app”) compatible with Apple’s iPhone (a brand name for Apple’s smartphone). According to Cournot’s (1838) analysis, a merger of two companies that produce complementary goods coordinates (or “internalizes”) pricing decisions that are otherwise made independently, resulting in a lower price of the composite good [see e.g., Varian (2010), Chapter 35]. A merger makes all players happier: the lower price unambiguously enhances consumer welfare, and the merged firm’s profits are higher than the sum of the two firms’ profits. An important point that is missing in Cournot’s (1838) analysis is that, in the example above, the two products are “unidirectional” complements rather than strict complements. In the cases of strict complements (such as CPUs and OSs, printers and toner cartridges, etc.), each product is indispensable: one product is useless without another. However, Chomp’s search engine is useless unless it is used together with an iPhone, not vice versa. In fact, product complements often have unidirectional relationships. Other examples outside of the IT industry include cars and GPS car navigation systems, cable TVs and accompanying optional channels, and so on. It is not straightforward to obtain the same implication as Cournot’s (1838) when evaluating mergers of firms of unidirectional complements. The aim of this paper is thus to study Cournot’s (1838) old question in the cases of unidirectional complements. In considering unidirectional complements, it is important to take into account explicitly that not all consumers choose to consume a composite good or nothing. This is because if all consumers do so, the situation is no different from the demand of a composite good of strict complements in Cournot’s (1838) analysis. Thus, in studying unidirectional complements in a model à la Cournot (1838), one needs to introduce consumers who are satisfied with the use of iPhones only. In this paper, we study the effects of a merger of two monopolists of unidirectional complements: one firm producing a base good, and another firm producing an optional good. We assume two monopolies to contrast our analysis with Cournot’s (1838).Footnote 2 Following the necessity described above, we assume that there are two types of consumers: (i) those who consume one unit of the base good only (having zero valuation of the optional good), and (ii) those who consume one unit of the composite. It is shown that a merger of the two firms raises the price of the base good, resulting in lower consumer surplus for the group of those who purchase a base good only, if and only if the average willingness to pay of the group of consumers purchasing a composite good (or nothing) is sufficiently low. This result is in sharp contrast to Cournot’s (1838) classical implication that a merger of firms producing strict complements makes all consumers strictly better off. The paper is organized as follows. After reviewing the related literature in the next section, we present the model in Sect. 3. Section 4 then studies the price and welfare effects of the merger of firms producing unidirectional complements. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",6
111.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,20 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-012-0328-y,Outsourcing versus technology transfer: Hotelling meets Stackelberg,April 2014,Andrea Pierce,Debapriya Sen,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In this era of globalization it has become increasingly common for firms to outsource their required inputs rather than produce them in-house. While many factors influence a firm’s decision to outsource, it can be argued that outsourcing is primarily driven by cost considerations.Footnote 1 A firm will choose to outsource if the input supplier can offer a price that is lower than the firm’s in-house cost. This will be the case if the supplier has a cost advantage in one or more factors of production. Such advantages can be interpreted broadly as the supplier having a superior production technology. For example, the supplier may be able to hire skilled labor at a relatively low wage or it may possess advanced machineries. It is therefore plausible that as a mode of production, transfer of technology across firms could be an alternative to outsourcing. In fact, like outsourcing, technology transfers have also grown substantially in recent years.Footnote 2 As outsourcing and technology transfer serve the same purpose of enabling one firm to use the cost-efficient production process of another firm, a natural question is, what would make firms choose one of these contracts over another? A closely related question is, what are the relative effects of these contracts on the consumers? This paper seeks to address these questions in the context of imperfectly competitive markets. There could be different possible reasons for firms to prefer outsourcing over technology transfer. For instance, the superior technology may be labor intensive and difficult to transfer due to imperfect mobility of labor. Additionally, transfer of technology may involve other barriers such as intellectual property rights laws or large initial investments that firms may want to avoid. On the other hand, technology transfer enables a firm to produce its inputs in-house using the superior technology which gives it complete control over its production. So a firm may prefer technology transfer to maintain a higher quality standard or to avoid the risk of relying on an external supplier for its inputs. Apart from these reasons, strategic considerations play an important role in determining the nature of input production decisions of firms. Such considerations are particularly dominant when an input-seeking firm competes with its supplier in the final good market. Exploring the differences in the strategic aspects of outsourcing and technology transfer contracts in duopolies, this paper characterizes situations where firms would adopt one of these contracts over the other. We also study the consequences of these contract choices on consumers. We carry out our analysis in a Hotelling duopoly model with two firms \(A\) and \(B\) who are locatedFootnote 3 at two different end points of the unit interval in the final good market \(\varphi .\) Consumers are uniformly distributed in this interval and incur linear transportation costs for traveling to the end points. Any consumer buys at most one unit of \(\varphi \) from either \(A\) or \(B.\) We consider a production process where an intermediate good \(\eta \) is required to manufacture \(\varphi .\) Each firm can convert one unit of good \(\eta \) into one unit of good \(\varphi \) at zero cost. Both \(A\) and \(B\) can produce \(\eta ,\) but firm \(B\) has a lower cost due to a superior technology. Outsourcing (firm \(A\) orders \(\eta \) from firm \(B\)) and technology transfer (firm \(B\) transfers its technology to firm \(A\)) are two contracts that naturally arise in this situation. We study these contracts by considering unit-based pricing policies for both cases, where the unit price is determined through negotiations between firms \(A\) and \(B.\) Under an outsourcing contract, firm \(A\) can place any order with firm \(B\) at the agreed upon price. Under a technology transfer contract, firm \(A\) uses the superior technology of firm \(B\) by paying a price for each unit of production, i.e., the technology transfer contract is based on a unit royalty.Footnote 4 We denote \(\omega \) to be the effective unit cost of firm \(A\) in any contract and compare these contracts by fixing \(\omega .\) We show that these two contracts generate different strategic interactions between firms and consequently result in different prices in the final good market. Specifically we show that compared to the case of no contracts, prices in the final good market never rise under outsourcing (Proposition 2) while this is not necessarily the case under technology transfer. There are always weakly Pareto improving outsourcing contracts that make both firms better off and no consumers worse off compared to the situation of no contracts. Moreover if the cost difference of firms is sufficiently large (i.e., firm \(B\)’s technology is sufficiently superior), there are strictly Pareto improving outsourcing contracts that make both firms as well as all consumers better off compared to the case of no contracts (Proposition 3). On the other hand, there are no Pareto improving technology transfer contracts: whenever both firms prefer technology transfer over no contracts, there are always some consumers who pay a price in the final good market that is higher than what they paid in the absence of either contracts (Proposition 4). Comparing outsourcing and technology transfer contracts by fixing \(\omega \) (the effective unit cost of \(\eta \) for firm \(A\)), it is shown that there is a conflict between the incentives of firms and the interest of consumers. For any \(\omega ,\) (i) if both firms prefer outsourcing over technology transfer, there are always some consumers who prefer technology transfer over outsourcing and (ii) if both firms prefer technology transfer over outsourcing, there are always some consumers who prefer outsourcing over technology transfer (Proposition 5). It is also shown that if the supplier firm \(B\) has a relatively large bargaining power in negotiating the terms of a contract, then both firms prefer technology transfer while all consumers prefer outsourcing (Proposition 6). An outsourcing order from \(A\) to \(B\) is equivalent to an endogenous capacity building by \(A\) prior to competition in the final good market. As firm \(A\)’s capacity is in effect built by its rival firm \(B,\) the volume of this endogenous capacity plays an interesting role of information transmission. It credibly informs \(B\) that \(A\) is committed to maintain a specific market share, which establishes \(A\) as the Stackelberg leader in the final good market.Footnote 5 This is where Hotelling meets Stackelberg. The Stackelberg leadership effect generated by the outsourcing contract is the novel feature of our model. Wauthy (1996) and Boccard and Wauthy (2005) also study the role of capacities in the Hotelling location model, but they consider exogenous capacities. Capacity is endogenous in the well-known model of Kreps and Scheinkman (1983) [KS]. However, firms choose their capacities independently in KS, so unlike our model there is no prior information transmission. As capacities are either exogenous or independently chosen by firms, the Stackelberg leadership effect is absent in these papers. To see the impact of Stackelberg leadership, observe that when the contracted unit price \(\omega \) of the intermediate good \(\eta \) is small, the Stackelberg leader’s market share is larger than \(A\)’s market share under no contracts. This large share is sustained in equilibrium by a lower price of firm \(A\) in the final good market \(\varphi .\) Given that \(A\)’s commitment of Stackelberg market share is credible, \(B\)’s equilibrium price is also set lower and prices of both firms fall. This results in lower profit in the market \(\varphi \) for firm \(B.\) So \(B\) would accept such an outsourcing contract only if it can obtain a large supplier profit from \(\eta \) to compensate for its losses in the market \(\varphi .\) This happens when firm \(B\) is sufficiently more efficient compared to firm \(A.\) The upshot is that when the cost difference of two firms is sufficiently large, there are strictly Pareto improving outsourcing contracts: both firms prefer outsourcing over no contracts and both set a lower price for \(\varphi \) that makes all consumers better off [Proposition 3(I)(a)]. Under technology transfer, firm \(A\) acquires \(B\)’s superior technology and produces \(\eta \) itself using this technology. As a result, firm \(B\) knows the quantity of \(\eta \) produced by \(A\) only when it receives its payments for technology transfer. As these payments are received after profits are realized in the final good market, the informational aspect in outsourcing is completely absent under technology transfer. Moreover since firm \(B\)’s payments from the transfer depends on the demand of \(A,\) it has an incentive to ensure that \(A\)’s demand is not too small. This creates a distortion that raises the effective cost of \(B\) which in turn adversely affects prices in the market \(\varphi .\) Due to this distortion, technology transfer contracts that are preferred by both firms necessarily make some consumers worse off. Consequently, unlike the case of outsourcing, there are no Pareto improving technology transfer contracts in relation to the situation of no contracts [Proposition 4(III)(c)]. It should be mentioned that the distortive effect of royalty contracts is well known in the literature. Our analysis is closely related to Matsumura et al. (2010) who also consider technology transfer among firms in a Hotelling model. However, they focus on optimal contracts from the viewpoint of the efficient firm, while our objective is to characterize the market outcomes for all values of \(\omega \) and compare these with the corresponding outcomes under outsourcing. To sum up, the difference between outsourcing and technology transfer in our model is driven by two factors: first, the information transmission and the subsequent Stackelberg leadership effect that leads to lower prices under outsourcing is absent under technology transfer, and second, outsourcing orders are obtained upfront before firms set their prices, so outsourcing has no distortive effect. The paper is organized as follows. The related literature is discussed in Sect. 2. We present the model in Sect. 3. Three contractual settings—no contracts, outsourcing and technology transfer, are studied in Sect. 4. Comparison of outsourcing and technology transfer contracts is carried out in Sect. 5. We conclude in Sect. 6. For the proofs of most of the results, we refer the reader to the Appendix of the working paper version of the paper Pierce and Sen (2012).",5

112.0,1.0,Journal of Economics,16 January 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-012-0330-4,Second chance offers in auctions,May 2014,Aniruddha Bagchi,Brett Katzman,Timothy Mathews,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"In a recent article in The New Yorker about art dealer Jeffrey Deitch it was noted that, “When two buyers compete for a picture, bidding the price up and up, Deitch may have access to a similar work that he can offer to the underbidder” (Tomkins 2007). In practice, Deitch is not alone in adopting the strategy of using information previously revealed by bidders when attempting to sell a subsequent item, as more and more sellers are using such “second chance offers” when selling multiple units. In addition, sellers can also use second chance offers when a winning bidder defaults, thereby saving time and resources by not holding an entirely new auction. Whether because multiple units are available or because of bidder default, this mechanism has become such a popular option that eBay has altered its rules to formally allow for “second chance offers.” Our paper develops an IPV model where the seller is able to credibly commit to a second chance offer rule where a take-it-or-leave-it offer is made to the highest losing bidder at a price equal to their bid.Footnote 1 Our model can accommodate both the multi-unit and defaultinterpretations and shows that not only does bidder behavior in both second price and English auctions differ from the standard “bid your value” dominant strategy,Footnote 2 but that bidding in the two types of auctions is no longer strategically equivalent. The main reason that a second chance offer alters bidding behavior is that neither the second price nor English auction is isomorphic to the Vickrey (1961, 1962) auction when there is a possibility of a second chance offer and thus it is not dominant for a bidder to simply bid his value in these auctions. Ultimately, because information contained by bids in each auction can subsequently be used to set the second chance offer price and because each auction releases information differently, bidding behavior differs as well. While our paper is the first to analyze this specific form of second chance offer, other types of second chance offers have been examined. Salmon and Wilson (2008) compare using an auction and second chance offer to sell two goods to simply using a sequence of two second price auctions. Their model is similar to ours in that the seller makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the second highest bidder from the auction. However, their model differs qualitatively in that the seller does not pre-commit to the form of the second chance offer. Thus, equilibrium bids in their model must involve mixed strategies since bidders realize that their values could be directly inferred from a pure strategy bid (through inversion of the bid function) in which case the seller would simply extract all of their surplus through the second chance offer. Mixing does not surface in our model as the seller is able to pre-commit to the take-it-or-leave-it pricing rule before the auction and thus bidders can build the second chance offer price into their strictly increasing bid functions. Joshi et al. (2005) also examine the impact of augmenting an auction with a second chance offer. They focus on determining the degree to which bidders would be better off if it were possible to prevent the seller from observing their individual identities, their exact bids, or both in an initial auction for a single item (after which \(k\) identical items are offered to the \(k\) highest losing bidders at the price at which each bidder chose to drop out of the bidding process). Bidders in their model know with certainty that \(k\) second chance offers will be made, whereas in our model there is uncertainty regarding the possibility of receiving a second chance offer (represented by an exogenous probability \(p\)). In a related paper, Sun and Vora (2009) consider second chance offers in first price auctions. In that model, the second chance offer is a randomization between a fixed-price and the bidder’s bid at the initial auction. Once again, unlike our model, Sun and Vora (2009) assume that the seller will be making the second chance offer with certainty. Our assumption of uncertainty about whether or not the second chance offer will be made reflects a number of real world settings. The applicability of our model concerns whether real-world sellers can credibly commit to the take-it-or-leave format of the second chance offer modeled here and whether or not that offer can be fully anticipated. Clearly eBay provides one such example because winning bidders do not always default, but also because sellers sometimes have multiple units to sell. However, application of our model is not limited to eBay. For example, several state procurement procedures require that, should a winning bidder default on a contract, the contract be awarded to the second highest bidder, at a price equal to their bid, without reopening the bidding process. The credibility and uncertainty behind our second chance offers lead to vastly different conclusions than the papers cited above. Our results however, are closely related to those of Jeitschko (1999) where, although second chance offers are not considered, there is uncertainty regarding the possible auction of a second unit. Focusing on second price auctions, Jeitschko shows that when there is a possibility that a second unit will be auctioned later, bids in the first auction are shaded below what they would be if there were no possibility of a second unit being auctioned, but higher than what they would be if it were known for certain that a second unit would be sold. Our model produces a similar result when there is a possibility that a second chance offer will be made (rather than a second auction being conducted) although equilibrium bidding in our model differs drastically from that in Jeitschko (1999). Our paper begins with a formal statement of the model in Sect. 2. Section 3 defines the bidder’s maximization problems for first price, second price, and English auctions when a second chance offer may follow the auction. Bayes-Nash equilibrium bid functions are derived for each auction. Section 4 follows with a detailed analysis of how bidder behavior differs in second price and English auctions (when a second chance offer will be made with an exogenous probability \(p\)) and then shifts focus to the expected revenue generated by each auction for a seller who faces risk averse bidders.Footnote 3 We compare the revenue generating properties of the three auctions studied in Sect. 3 with a fourth: the multi-unit (Vickrey 1962) auction. This allows us to couch our revenue results in terms of the well established literature on revenues in standard single unit IPV auctions with risk averse bidders. The famed Revenue Equivalence Theorem implies that all standard IPV single unit auctions deliver equal levels of expected revenue when bidders are risk neutral. However, it is well known that revenue equivalence ceases when bidders are risk averse. Holt (1980) was the first to explain why, showing that (1) risk averse bidders bid more aggressively in standard first price auctions than do risk neutral bidders and (2) the dominant strategy of bidding one’s value in second price and English auctions is impervious to bidder risk aversion since these auctions are isomorphic to the Vickrey (1961) auction in the single unit IPV model. As Klemperer (1999) sums up, “\(\ldots \) since the standard auctions were revenue equivalent with risk neutral bidders, a risk-neutral seller faced by risk averse bidders prefers the first-price auction to second-price sealed bid or ascending auctions.” (see Klemperer 2004 or Krishna 2010 for a detailed discussions on auctions with risk averse bidders). With second chance offers, the revenue equivalence theorem continues to apply under risk neutrality, in which case expected seller revenue is equal in all of the auctions that we consider. However, if bidders are risk averse (with CRRA preferences), bids and thus expected revenues in first price, second price, and English auctions increase with the degree of bidder risk aversion. Thus, our results for second price and English auctions differ from those in the standard single unit IPV model where bids are unaltered by the level of bidder risk aversion. The lack of dominance in our model stems from the fact that second price and English auctions are no longer isomorphic to the Vickrey auction. Specifically, because the second chance offer is made to the second highest bidder at their bid, a “first-price” component is added to these auctions and dominance is lost. In essence, by using a second chance offer, the auctioneer entices risk averse bidders to bid more aggressively (than if they were risk neutral) and is thus able to capture some of the revenue enhancing properties of standard first price auctions, even when using second price and English auctions. The second chance offer variant of the Vickrey auction allocates the first unit to the highest bidder for a price equal to the second highest bid if there is no second chance offer made. If a second chance offer is made, then the two highest bidders are allocated units and both pay the third highest bid. By design, this produces a dominant strategy of bidding one’s value that is impervious to the degree of bidder risk aversion. Therefore, the Vickrey auction is revenue dominated by the other three auctions considered, all of which engender more aggressive bids than when bidders are risk neutral. Further, the precise impact of risk aversion on bidding is more substantial in second price auctions than in English auctions and thus second price auctions outperform English auctions in terms of expected revenue when there is a possibility of a second chance offer. Finally, we point out that first price, second price, and English auctions each set the second chance offer price equal to the second highest bidder’s bid. But, only the first price auction sets the auction price equal to the auction winner’s bid. This leads us to speculate that when bidders are risk averse the first price auction will generate higher expected revenue than either a second price or English auction. Unfortunately, the first price equilibrium bid function is vastly different from the second price and English bid functions, and each bid function is relatively complex. As a result, no general conclusions can be made about the revenue ranking of the first price auction to these other two auction formats. While we are able to provide several numerical computations that support our speculation regarding the revenue dominance of the first price auction, in the end the only general conclusion that we can make about the first price auction with the possibility of a second chance offer is that it revenue dominates the Vickrey auction.",2

Prior to taking their actions, each player performs an assessment of the project that yields a private signal of quality. The agent’s payoff upon submission is determined by the evaluator’s decision; the evaluator’s payoff is determined by the quality of the projects that he accepts. Making the proposal incurs a cost on the agent in the form of a submission fee.Footnote 1
 The situations that are captured by the above setting are abundant and diverse. A possible example is that of a firm interested in undertaking a project, such as the development of an economic activity in an environmentally sensitive area, that requires filing a costly application with a regulatory agency. In this case, the firm is concerned with the agency’s decision of whether to approve the proposal, while the regulatory agency is usually concerned with the social welfare implications of that activity. Other examples are the introduction of a new product with potential undesirable effects, a merger, a patent application, or the submission of an article to an academic journal. The main objective of this paper is to study the effect of the submission fee, in its role of instrument of control of the level of self-screening exerted by the agent, on the expected quality of projects implemented by the evaluator. Several recent papers, starting with Leslie (2005), investigate the optimal submission fee problem in the context of the submission of articles for review to academic journals, and show that these optimal fees are strictly positiveFootnote 2 because they reduce the burden on the journal editors and referees by discouraging long-shot submissions.Footnote 3 In these earlier papers, the evaluator can perfectly learn the quality of an article upon submission, and the optimal fee is chosen so as to balance a trade-off between the cost of evaluation and the need to accept a certain minimum number of articles. In a variety of real-world applications of project-screening, though, the evaluation of a project is imperfect at the time when the decision on whether or not to be accepted is made, and the project’s quality is revealed only after it is implemented. In this paper we examine a model of two-sided incomplete information where not only the agent’s, but also the evaluator’s assessment of the project is imperfect. In this case, while a higher submission fee increases the quality of projects that the agent submits, it also lowers the evaluator’s standards of acceptance. Since under this specification, the expected quality of projects that are implemented is determined by the screening of both the agent and the evaluator, this raises the question of whether and when a higher submission fee is beneficial. We show that a higher submission fee increases the expected quality of projects that are implemented if and only if the elasticity of the likelihood of a high-quality project as inferred from the evaluator’s minimum quality standard is higher than the elasticity of the likelihood of a high-quality project as inferred from the fact that the evaluator accepted a project. Intuitively, the effect of the increase in the submission fee on the expected quality of projects that are implemented is determined by the corresponding effect on the likelihoods of a high quality project as inferred from the facts that (i) the agent submitted a project, and (ii) the evaluator accepted it. A higher submission fee increases the former likelihood, but decreases the latter. The effect on the former likelihood can be elicited from the evaluator’s decision problem, as a function of the elasticity of the likelihood of a high quality project as inferred from the evaluator’s minimum quality standard. This is because this minimum standard is determined in the evaluator’s problem precisely by the expected quality of projects that are submitted, and thus can act as a sufficient statistic for the agent’s information structure in a neighbourhood of the agent’s equilibrium strategy. Thus, the effect that we investigate can be elicited locally from the evaluator’s information structure. The necessary condition for a higher submission fee to increase the quality of projects that are implemented is not always satisfied for generic information structures. Thus, while a higher submission fee does increase the expected quality of projects that are submitted, it may decrease the expected quality of projects that are implemented. In particular, this occurs if for the given project-screening mechanism, the evaluator’s effect on the quality of the projects that are implemented (i.e., the elasticity of the likelihood of a high-quality project as inferred from the fact that the evaluator accepted a project) is highly responsive to the change in the quality of projects submitted for review. From a policy perspective, this implies that in those situations where evaluation is imperfect and where there is reason to believe that the evaluator may infer information from the agent’s decision, then when studying the optimal submission fee problem, one has to account for that fact that an increase in the perceived quality of projects submitted for review may come at the expense of the evaluator’s own judgment of the project. For instance, this suggests that if a regulatory agency’s rulings are susceptible to be highly influenced by a firm’s decision to proceed with an application for permit of an economic activity, then higher application costs may have a negative impact on the quality of projects that are implemented. From a formal point of view, the closest paper to ours is Taylor and Yildirim (2011), which studies a model in which an agent chooses the amount of effort to exert in generating a project, and investigates the moral hazard effects of the potentially available public information. We consider the effort level as sunk, and the agent’s decision to be whether to submit a project as a function of the available public and private information. Miquel-Florensa (2010) examines an optimal allocation problem in a signaling game where a budget constrained applicant can employ the amount of resources expended on the application to signal the quality of his proposal. The principal does not posses any information about the quality of the project, but can use several instruments to influence the applicant’s decision so as to solve a trade-off between better project screening and loss of resources spent on the application process. Ottaviani and Wickelgren (2009) analyze the trade-off between ex-ante and ex-post approval of an activity when the evaluator may reconsider his approval at the time when the quality of the project is revealed. Boleslavsky and Cotton (2011) study a model in which an evaluator has to select one of several competing proposals, and investigate the effect of the limited capacity on the incentives of the proposers to produce information. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we introduce the model. In Sect. 3 we solve for the equilibrium of the game. Section 4 contains the main results of the paper, while Sect. 5 concludes. Most proofs are presented in the Appendix.",3

Simple models of quantity or price competition with endogenous entry show that increasing the size of a market the number of firms tends to increase but in a less than proportional way.Footnote 1 This is due to the fact that larger markets attract more firms and strengthen competition, which reduces markups: this limits the entry opportunities on one side, and requires an expansion of individual production on the other side. Such a relation between market size and market structure has found a certain empirical support (see Bresnahan and Reiss 1987; Campbell and Hopenhayn 2005, and Etro 2009) and has relevant implications: for instance, entry tends to be procyclical while markups are countercyclical, which has an impact on the business cycle in a dynamic context, and opening up to trade induces business destruction at the local level while inducing gains from competition.Footnote 2 The consequences may be even more radical in markets where firms endogenously invest in fixed costs of R&D and advertising, because larger markets may induce larger investments and reduce entry rather than increase it. This possibility has been forcefully pointed out by Sutton (1991, 1998), claiming on empirical grounds, that many sectors characterized by intensive R&D and advertising activity may face an upper bound on the number of firms and exhibit even a decreasing number of competitors when the market size is large enough. However, while the upper bound emerges in a variety of theoretical models, the inverse-U relation between market size and number of firms does not emerge naturally in basic models available in the literature. In this note I provide a simple theoretical foundation for such an inverse-U relation, within a model where firms invest in R&D and (simultaneously or sequentially) choose their market strategies. It is an example based on Cournot competition, homogenous goods, linear demand and a quadratic cost-reducing technology: what emerges is that an increase of the market size induces the inverse-U pattern conjectured by Sutton for the number of firms, but reduces always the price and increases R&D investment and production of each firm. The first theoretical analysis of EMSs with endogenous sunk costs has been provided by Dasgupta and Stiglitz (1980). They considered Cournot competition between firms producing a homogenous good and choosing how much to invest in R&D to reduce the marginal costs of production. Their example with isoelastic demand and cost functions shows that a larger market size is associated with a proportionally larger investment in cost reduction, so that the endogenous number of firms remains invariant. Nevertheless, since the marginal cost is endogenous and decreasing in the investment, the equilibrium price is always decreasing in the size of the market. These outcomes justify the same focus of the EMS approach (also without endogenous sunk costs) on markets with a small number of competitors (even when the size of the market is global), and they are consistent with two traditional insights: larger markets generate lower prices and higher production (and R&D investment) per firm. Tandon (1984) has replicated the analysis of Dasgupta and Stiglitz (1980) considering a very specific example of linear Cournot model with endogenous entry and sunk costs to confirm that the number of firms is independent from the size of the market. Sutton (1991) has obtained a similar results on the basis of a model in which firms compete in quantities and invest in quality. Only recently, Vives (2008) has been able to extend the analysis of endogenous sunk costs to general profit functions under quantity and price competition. He has shown that an increase in the size of the market increases always individual investment and production, but has ambiguous effects on the number of firms, which suggests that the earlier examples were rather peculiar. For instance, in the case of CES utility with price competition, Vives (2008) has derived an equilibrium number of firms, which is increasing in the relative market size, as in standard models without endogenous sunk costs. However, examples of the opposite case, that is fewer firms in bigger markets, or of non-monotone patterns have not emerged in the theoretical literature, leaving the Sutton hypothesis as a mere theoretical possibility. The idea that there is a maximum number of firms for different sectors independent from their size has found additional support in the celebrated result by Sutton (1991): under rather general modeling assumptions, he has shown that there is a lower positive bound to market concentration in the presence of endogenous sunk investments.Footnote 3 These investments are essential for the result because the number of firms remains constant only when the endogenous sunk costs increase proportionally with the size of the market. Sutton (1991) has also emphasized the possibility of a non-monotone relation between size and entry, but has obtained such a relation only through a shift of regime from a traditional one with zero endogenous investment for all firms (where a larger size increases the number of firms) to an “escalation” phase in which market expansion leads to higher investments and higher concentration (a larger size reduces the number of firms). A wide empirical literature, has also verified the Sutton hypothesis of an inverted-U relation between market size and number of firms for markets with endogenous sunk costs. The initial reference is (Sutton 1991, 1998), whose empirical analysis is entirely aimed at showing the existence of a lower bound on concentration in a number of global markets (such as those for automobiles, aircrafts, electronic computing equipment, semiconductors, organic fibres, drugs, cereals and so on). Recently, Ellickson (2007) has looked at the supermarket industry in the U.S. and shown that “the minimum level of concentration is highest in the smallest markets, decreases for a range, and then hits a lower limit beyond which it does not fall and might even increase” (p. 52). In this note, I provide the simplest theoretical foundation for an inverse-U relation between market size and number of firms in a textbook Cournot model with homogenous goods, linear demand and standard functions of R&D activity. In particular, I generalize the example introduced by Tandon (1984) in many directions and show that, as long as the exogenous fixed costs are positive, the EMS is naturally characterized by an inverted-U relation between market size and number of firms, in line with the hypothesis of Sutton (1991). To understand the rationale for this non-monotone relation we should examine how the equilibrium strategies change in markets of different sizes (notice that there is no dynamic in our model, therefore our comparisons should be seen as cross sectional results). First of all, we obtain that R&D investment increases more than proportionally with the size of the market because its marginal profitability increases. In small markets with few firms and low investment, the mark ups are high enough that an increase in demand is able to expand production and profits as much as needed to attract a larger number of firms. However, in larger markets with many firms, high investments and low mark ups, an increase in demand cannot expand production enough to increase profits and attract more firms. For a given high number of firms, an expansion of the market is going to increase the entry costs more than the gross profits, which in equilibrium requires a smaller number of active firms. Once again the price is decreasing in the size of the market and the production of each firm is increasing in it, as in all the earlier models. This work is related to the recent revival of the literature on EMS, which has analyzed implication of markets with endogenous strategies and entry decisions in different partial and general equilibrium fields, both with exogenous and endogenous sunk costs. Relevant contributions considering preliminary investments or commitments by firms in markets with endogenous entry include Vives (2008), Erkal and Piccinin (2010), (Etro 2006, 2011a), Ino and Matsumura (2012), Žigić (2012), Anderson et al. (2012) and Cato and Matsumura (2013). Applications to general equilibrium issues with related discussions of the impact of market size on the structure of the markets, on the number of firms and on the markups include (Peretto 1999, 2003) and Etro and Colciago (2010). The linear Cournot model with quadratic investments in cost reductions is analyzed also in Etro and Cella (2013) for the case of uncertainty and asymmetric information on the productivity of the managers engaged in the cost reducing activity. The next Sect. 2 reviews the past results of the literature, Sect. 3 presents our example, derives its implications and extends it to a more general cost reduction technology. Section 4 extends the model to sequential decisions on R&D investment and production, and Sect. 5 concludes.",2

In the single-output case, the rate of technical change as defined by Solow (1957) measures the rate at which output can increase as time elapses holding inputs constant. This proportional change is indeed equal to the partial logarithmic derivative of the production function with respect to time. Caves et al. (1981) generalized Solow (1957) measure to the case of multi-output technologies where two alternatives can be considered. First, the output-based measure, which is defined as the common rate that technological improvements allow all outputs to increase over time holding inputs constant and second, the input-based measure, defined as the common rate at which all inputs can decrease over time holding outputs constant. Since a common rate of change in either outputs or inputs is assumed in the above definitions, the aforementioned measures of the rate of technical change are referred to as radial or proportional. 
Caves et al. (1981) shown in addition that the radial output- and input-based measures of the rate of technical change are related one another through the scale elasticity. In particular, the output-based measure is less (greater) than the input-based measure under decreasing (increasing) returns to scale while they are equal under constant returns to scale.Footnote 1 Even though Caves et al. (1981) employed a transformation function to derive this result, it can be shown that holds for all other function representations of multi-output, multi-input technologies, such as the Shephard-type input and output distance functions.Footnote 2 On the other hand, the primal (i.e., input- and output-based) measures can also be linked with the dual (i.e., cost-, revenue- and profit-based) measures of the rate of technical change.Footnote 3 It has been shown in particular that the cost- and the input-based measures are equal to each other (Caves et al. 1981; Atkinson and Cornwell 1998) as are the revenue- and the output-based measures (Fulginiti 2010). Moreover, the input- and the output-based measures are related to the profit-based measure by means of the scale elasticity (Bernstein 1994; Karagiannis and Mergos 2000), which has also a pivotal role in linking the alternative dual (i.e., cost-, revenue- and profit-based) measures of technical change (Karagiannis and Xepapadeas 2009). The main objective of this paper is to develop measures of the rate of technical change for the class of directional distance functions. We not only consider output- and input-based measures as was done for the other function representations of the technology, but we develop both radial (proportional) and directional measures of the rate of technical change. The former are analogous to the conventional measures considering radial changes in inputs and/or outputs such that their proportions remain unchanged while the latter deal with non-proportional changes in either inputs, outputs or both along the direction of the reference vector. We show that the proposed three primal directional measures of the rate of technical change are related one another through the translation elasticity.Footnote 4 We also derive relations between the primal and the dual directional measures of the rate of technical change and we show that are also linked to each other with the translation elasticity. Finally, we relate radial and directional measures by means of the normalized (by the value of the direction vector) dual functions. Even though the choice between directional and radial measures is by and large an empirical matter closely related to the study under consideration, there are several cases where the radial measures do not suffice to provide plausible estimates of the rate of technical change. For example, in the presence of undesirable outputs, such as pollution or non-performing loans, the output-based radial measure provides implausible estimates of the rate of technical change as it fails to credit expansion of good outputs and to debit bad outputs production. Instead it measures the proportional increase of both good and bad outputs that is made possible by technical change from a given input bundle. In contrast, the output-based directional measure provides more reasonable estimates of the rate of technical change as allows for simultaneous increases in good outputs and decreases in bad output. Another example refers to the case of specialized and diversified firms: e.g., some power plants may produce only electricity, others produce only heating and some may produce both. For the specialized firms, the radial measure due to its proportional nature could only account for the expansion of the currently produced outputs neglecting the possibility that technical change may favor the development of more diversified production plans. However, the directional measure due to its additive nature can accommodate that option.",5

In addition to the conventional positive effects on factor productivity and private investment, more recent evidence suggests that access to infrastructure may have a significant impact on health and education outcomes.Footnote 1 Moreover, this impact tends to be magnified through interactions between health and education themselves. Better health has been shown to have a large impact on the ability to learn and study; conversely, more educated parents tend to take better care of themselves and their children. Since the seminal contribution of Boserup (1970), the role of women in promoting growth and development has also occupied centre stage in policy debates. For instance, Coulombe and Tremblay (2006) found that investment in women’s human capital has been more important for growth in today’s industrialized countries than investment in men’s human capital. At the same time, however, it has been well documented that women trail men in a number of dimensions—formal labor force participation, access to credit and infrastructure, entrepreneurship rates, and income levels. In today’s low- and middle-income countries for instance, the labor force participation rate for women is only 57 women workers earn about three-quarters of what men earn. Gender differences in education, work experience, and job characteristics explain some fraction of that gap; in Sub-Saharan Africa, 54 of girls do not complete even a primary school education (Herz and Sperling 2004). In a related literature, it has been found that illiterate women have more children and that mothers’ education has a positive effect on child survival, education and nutritional status. Indeed, because of better nutritional knowledge, more educated mothers tend to adopt safer health and hygiene practices, which improve their children’s health and survival (see Glewwe 1999; Morrison et al. 2007). In Africa, children of mothers who receive five years of primary education are 40 age five, and educated mothers are about 50 immunize their children than uneducated mothers. As documented by Blackden et al. (2006), gender inequality (particularly with respect to education and access to formal sector employment) remains a significant constraint to growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.Footnote 2
 The key issue that this paper addresses is at the intersection of these two agendas: it focuses on how improved access to infrastructure affects women’s time allocation decisions and how, in turn, changes in these decisions affect the process of growth and economic development. The impact of infrastructure on women’s time allocation has been documented in a number of empirical studies, including Ilahi (2000), Riverson et al. (2006), and Blackden and Wodon (2006). On average, women in rural Sub-Saharan Africa spend between 0.9 and 2.2 h per day on collecting water and firewood. Better access to infrastructure may enable women to devote more time to market activity, thereby promoting growth; at the same time, it may lead to improved learning monitoring (in the case of electricity, for instance) as well as improved child care practices (including breast feeding), which may strengthen the health status of children and their ability to learn.Footnote 3 Put differently, there are opportunity costs to market activity, and these should be taken into account when assessing growth effects. Accordingly, this paper develops a three-period, gender-based overlapping generations (OLG) model with public capital to explore the implications of infrastructure on women’s time allocation and growth. Gender-based OLG models are relatively few in the literature; among the notable exceptions are Ehrlich and Lui (1991), Galor and Weil (1996, 2000), Zhang et al. (1999), Lagerlöf (2003), Greenwood et al. (2005), Greenwood and Seshadri (2005), and De la Croix and Vander Donckt (2010). None of these contributions, however, addresses the kind of issues that we consider here. Greenwood et al. (2005) and Greenwood and Seshadri (2005), for instance, focus on technological progress in the market, and technological progress in the home, as determinants of fertility and female labor force participation.Footnote 4 Our focus here is on the specific impact of access to public infrastructure services (whose supply can be directly influenced by policy decisions) on female time allocation choices, and its interactions with women’s health, education outcomes, and economic growth. Our model differs from the existing literature in several other ways as well. First, women’s time in the model is endogenously allocated not only to market work, but also to home production, child rearing, and own health care. In existing contributions, rearing time is typically considered exogenous, whereas time devoted to own health care is generally ignored—even in OLG models where interactions between health and growth take center stage, as for instance in Chakraborty (2004), Hashimoto and Tabata (2005), Finlay (2006), Bhattacharya and Qiao (2007), Tang and Zhang (2007), and Chakraborty et al. (2010). Endogenizing mothers’ rearing time is important because in the model such time is productive—it helps to shape education and health outcomes. Second, the model accounts not only for the productivity effect of public infrastructure (as in many other contributions) but also for its effects on home production and human capital accumulation.Footnote 5 As documented by the World Bank (2008) for instance, greater access to electricity can decrease significantly the amount of time that women spend on household production activities such as cooking, collecting firewood, and fetching water. Thus, in contrast to existing studies, but in line with the evidence alluded to earlier, we are able to highlight the key role that infrastructure may play in human development, both directly and indirectly. To the extent that access to infrastructure affects the time devoted by mothers to home production and caring for themselves and their children, it will also exert indirect effects on long-run growth. Third, health outcomes exhibit serial dependence, in the sense that health status (and productivity) in adulthood depends to a significant extent on health outcomes in childhood. This is consistent with a number of empirical studies, such as Case et al. (2005), World Health Organization (2005), Schady and Paxson (2007), Smith (2009), and Verropoulou and Joshi (2009).Footnote 6 Such dependence gives a crucial role to mothers’ time allocation in shaping the future of their children.Footnote 7
 Our key results can be summarized as follows. The effect of government provision of infrastructure on growth depends not only on conventional productivity effects on marketed output, but also crucially on its impact on women’s time allocation, human capital accumulation, and the strength of congestion effects. Improved access to infrastructure induces women to reallocate their time away from home production activities and toward productive uses—which include not only market work but also time spent caring for themselves and their children. This may help trigger a process through which a poor country may escape from a low-growth trap. However, if women substitute time away from child care, persistence in health outcomes may lead to lower productivity in adulthood. In addition, if health improvements lead to higher life expectancy and savings, and thus a faster rate of private capital accumulation, the benefits from increased access to public capital may be mitigated by congestion effects—which in turn may affect women’s time allocation.Footnote 8 In the absence of complementary (possibly microeconomic) measures, a “ Big Push” policy involving a reallocation of public spending toward infrastructure investment may not succeed in triggering a shift to a high-growth path and sustained improvements in health and productivity. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.Footnote 9 Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 derives the steady-state growth rate and examines the properties of the model. In particular, we examine how access to infrastructure affects fertility and women’s time allocated to home production and market activity. Section 4 examines the possibility of multiple development regimes resulting from threshold effects associated with life expectancy and health outcomes, which may themselves result from how access to infrastructure affects the home production technology. Section 5 discusses whether an increase in public spending on health, education, or infrastructure may allow a country to escape from a low-growth equilibrium. The last section provides some concluding remarks.",14

Tippit,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The topics of fraud or breach of contract in the literature on asymmetric information and principal–agent relationships have long been posed as actions possibly taken by the agent (in both ex post and interim manners), since it is the agent that is in possession of the relevant information and more disposed to commit fraud or deception with regard to this information. The prevention of fraudulent agency is therefore a primary concern in the literature, and the response commonly ascribed to principals in this situation is generally ‘monitoring and enforcement’ of contracts and/or the construction of optimal contracts in such circumstances.Footnote 1 Very little consideration has been given to the possibility that the principal employ fraud or breach of contract for improving the outcome for themselves in response to the agent’s advantage. Leading up to the failure of the US mortgage market in 2007–2008, studies of ‘abusive lending practices’ and ‘predatory lending’ became more frequent, especially in legal scholarship.Footnote 2 Economic analyses of the subprime mortgage market and payday lending existed, but the foundational theoretical work on credit markets with asymmetric information lent little to understanding why lenders might defraud borrowers.Footnote 3
Engel and McCoy (2005) suggest that models, such as Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) or Bester (1985), lost relevance due to changes in home lending markets that reoriented the asymmetry of information, from one of borrower privilege to one of lender privilege. For example, the problem of ‘reduced documentation’ in the sub-prime lending market did not make sense according to the standard models of asymmetric information in lending: the lender can only benefit from additional information, not less information. In the unfolding housing crisis, Golding et al. (2008) characterize lender deception as motivated by the “extraction of rent” but do not provide a formal demonstration of this point, nor do they provide references to the theoretical foundation for this idea. Durkin and Elliehausen (2011) spend considerable time reviewing the economics of information literature to provide justification for the Truth in Lending Act of 1968, but they never point to the disconnect in asymmetric information models and policy crafted to address opportunistic lending practices. An exception, Bond et al. (2005), provide a model of ‘predatory lending’ in the context of an asymmetric information between a borrower and lender, in both competitive and non-competitive markets. They contrast their work with a body of literature on ‘competition for imperfectly informed consumers,’ which does not easily fit the lending market and translates to borrowers as being irrational.Footnote 4 Instead, they propose that borrowers are rational, but they lack “the private information regarding their future incomes residing with their current lenders.” Our paper presents a similar relationship of borrowers to information: lenders create an information asymmetry with regard to the terms of the loan contract. This is consistent with reports about questionable lending practices and circumstances surrounding US mortgage markets leading up to 2008 (see Anderson 2004; Carr and Kolluri 2001; Lacko and Pappalardo 2007). We consider the possibility that a principal may misrepresent some element of the prospective contract in response to the agent’s privileged information. We are expanding the credit market model of Bowles (2003), which is used to demonstrate the possibility of inefficient allocations of credit in the presence of wealth inequality among borrowers with different quality investment projects. The model can be altered for the hidden-state situation rather easily, but the hidden-action model is retained here for sake of continuity and expansion of the ideas in Bowles (2003). Principal–agent relationships have an inherent conflict of interest, and the possibility of a breach of contract foreseen by either party precludes the possibility of a contract; but the existence of third-party enforcement can restore this possibility. Let us consider a middle-ground. Can the possibility of breach exist in the midst of third-party enforcement? There are several routes one can take in entertaining this possibility: we can imagine that both parties are aware of the presence of a legal system, but that one party can ‘purchase’ the lack of enforcement. In other words, imagine that a borrower does not anticipate a breach of contract due to the existence of third-party enforcement and the lender can sustain the borrower’s naivety at a cost. Call this costly activity paid for by the lender, lender deception: it is a costly way of producing (indiscreetly) an asymmetry of information with regard to the existence of a breach of contract under the guise of an already existing legal system. We will consider the possibility that the principal (lender) has at their disposal some mechanism by which the distribution of economic rents due to the information asymmetry can be adjusted for their advantage. Typically, to achieve such alterations, the principal’s mechanism is an alternate contract, whereby they appropriate either a larger share of rent or increase the rent and appropriate a share of greater absolute size. We will propose a situation where the potential economic rent is fixed and the principal commits ‘undetectable fraud’ in order to extract a share of the agent’s economic rent. Thus, instead of costly monitoring or costly auditing, we propose a model where the principal ‘produces ignorance’ in the agent in response to their information advantage. Section 2 outlines the lending model with collateral, as well as the structure of the borrower-lender interaction assumed for it. Section 2.2 considers the outcomes of two extreme market conditions, the monopoly and competitive market cases. Section 2.3 formalizes the theory of deception for the determination of the amount of deception chosen by a lender in both market conditions. Section 3 considers the welfare effects of deception and the distribution of rents under different market conditions and across different borrower characteristics. The section ends with comments and recommendations for further possible research.",2
113.0,1.0,Journal of Economics,18 July 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-013-0359-z,Regulating harmless activity to fight crime,September 2014,Florian Baumann,Tim Friehe,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There is a consensus in the field of public economics that governments should intervene in private decision-making in some areas, since market outcomes would otherwise prove unsatisfactory. For example, when firms’ activities imply environmental pollution, the use of policy instruments (such as environmental taxes aimed at the internalization of the corresponding external effects) can be welfare-enhancing (Pigou 1920). Similarly, the public-good nature of national defense justifies government involvement (Samuelson 1954). However, with regard to criteria of efficiency, it is commonly agreed that decisions regarding goods or activities with purely private repercussions should be left to the market’s ‘invisible hand’. This paper establishes that government regulation of individual decisions may be welfare-enhancing even when the direct repercussions of the goods or activities in question are purely private. In our framework, the rationale for such regulation lies in the interdependence between the activity with purely private direct consequences and criminal involvement, where the latter imposes external costs on society. In other words, we consider goods or activities that have only private direct effects (i.e., impose no expected external harm) but, if combined with criminal undertakings, influence the offender’s crime engagement.Footnote 1 The interdependence may be such that the two activities are either substitutes or complements, when evaluated from the individual’s point of view. Regulation of the private good or activity offers the policy maker an instrument that can indirectly address crime. In seeking to increase the level of deterrence, the policy maker can either choose to fight crime directly (by increasing the probability of detection and/or the sanction level) or indirectly (by making substitutes for criminal involvement more desirable and complements less attractive). The direct approach is associated with high costs; however, the indirect approach entails costs as well. Specifically, the costs associated with the indirect approach are related to the distortion of the decisions made by law-abiding citizens; clearly, the lower the utility obtained from the harmless and law-abiding use of the activity in question, the lower the indirect costs. In other words, if a good is bought or an activity is undertaken primarily because of the effect it is expected to have on an individual’s involvement in crime, then the societal costs of regulation will be tolerable in most circumstances. As a result, whether or not governments seek to regulate individual decisions with purely private direct consequences in order to influence criminal involvement will depend on the relative size of the respective crime-fighting costs and the costs resulting from the crime itself.Footnote 2 There is reason to believe that the costs of the direct approach to crime have reached levels that warrant (at least partial) utilization of alternative approaches.Footnote 3 For instance, (Kleiman (2009), p.2) reports that the United States spends about $200 billion per year on detecting and punishing criminals. Furthermore, there are indications that the effects of spending more on traditional methods of law enforcement will be limited due to strictly diminishing returns (Kennedy 2010). In the real world, governments indeed intervene in decisions that at first glance seem to have purely private consequences. This is particularly true in areas in which the relationship between the decision and criminal undertaking is obvious. For instance, the private use of police radios is a violation of the German telecommunications law (TKG). It seems intuitive that this activity would offer advantages to non-law-abiding individuals, although it is likely that the majority of interested radio operators only seek entertainment. Another example is individual participation in certain kinds of organizations. As a consequence of the terrorist attacks of 9/11, several jurisdictions have sought to hamper the expansion of certain organizations, almost to the extent of outlawing membership in them (Cole 2008). However, many modern (Western) societies support other kinds of organizations, in particular religious organizations, in one way or another.Footnote 4 The support of the state can be explained by church programs that serve the community (such as day-care centers) and, significantly, by the possibility that religious involvement might influence moral norms (by reinforcing commandments such as “thou shalt not steal” and “thou shalt not kill”, for instance). In addition to church membership, other activities can also potentially influence morality, including education and child-rearing.Footnote 5 Moral norms influence individual behavior by imposing an intrinsic punishment for engaging in amoral behavior, even when there is no one else present to observe or punish the offender (see, e.g., Elster 1989). As a result, engaging in an activity that is likely to enforce morality is generally associated with a reduction in the net benefits obtained from crime, all else equal (see, for example, Shavell 2002 and Kaplow and Shavell 2007). On a different note, it could be argued (in particular, for adolescent offenders) that crime is at least in some instances undertaken because it is exciting and requires a show of courage. By subsidizing amusement parks, climbing parks, go-kart tracks, and the like, the government may be able to offer affordable alternative ways to experience risk-taking and prove one’s mettle to others. Whereas the previous two examples make reference to purportedly substitutionary relationships between the extent of the activity in question and benefits from crime, copyright-infringing technology may be considered to be an example of complementary interdependence. Technologies such as file-sharing engines, DVD writers, and photocopiers have many harmless uses, but are also employed to appropriate intellectual property in one way or another. Finally, it can be argued that one reason for the regulation of drug use is the association between drug (ab)use and crime, given that the external effects of (certain) drugs are disputable (MacDonald 2004). If we presume, for example, that intoxicated offenders incur lower psychological costs when breaking the law, then permitting drug use may increase the prevalence of crime. Similar arguments that apply to alcohol regulation have been proposed in the literature (see, e.g., Carpenter and Dobkin 2011). In considering these various examples of regulations regarding activities and goods, it is noteworthy that the interventions are subject to significant cross-country variation. For example, the ownership of guns and large knives is highly restricted in Germany, but regulation in the US is much looser (although this varies from state to state). It seems that the valuation of the cost imposed on law-abiding citizens versus the effect on crime deterrence has resulted in different outcomes across countries. There are also certain activities that are associated with a high incidence of crime, but that governments have nevertheless refrained from strictly regulating. For instance, Rees and Schnepel (2009) establish that the host communities of college football games experience sharp increases in a variety of crime categories. In light of the variety and inconsistency of application, we seek to provide a simple framework for the analysis of cost-benefit considerations related to the regulation of harmless activity. Our set-up is quite straightforward. Individuals obtain utility from two goods and, in order to finance consumption, decide how much time to allocate to crime and lawful employment. The individuals differ in their moral scruples or psychological costs related to law-breaking; consequently, there are always some law-abiding citizens. The interdependence between the activity with purely private direct consequences and crime is integrated by allowing the harmless activity of consuming one of the goods to influence the expected payoffs from crime (in addition to a possible interaction via the time constraint of the individual). Should the government decide to regulate this activity, the decisions taken by both law-abiding and non-law-abiding individuals will be influenced. Since the government is unable to distinguish between law-abiding and non-law-abiding individuals (except when the crimes of the latter group are detected), this information asymmetry permits only a uniform ex-ante intervention with respect to the harmless activity under consideration. In terms of how the policy maker will influence the extent to which individuals engage in the harmless activity, we restrict our discussion to the case in which the relative price is changed by a tax or subsidy, relegating the possibility of introducing regulatory standards for future research. However, it is likely that the imperfect information of regulatory agencies and the preference for a light intervention (due to the consumption of the good by many non-criminals) will often work in favor of the price instruments studied here. Given its focus, this paper is related to several different branches of the literature. The policy maker in our study considers intervening in decisions regarding a harmless activity because it is interrelated with crime, i.e., an activity that creates negative external effects for others. As a result, the present paper contributes to the vast literature on achieving the internalization of external effects by means of economic policy. A central feature of the present study is that the harmless activity is not necessarily associated with crime, and thus changing its price also has repercussions on lawful and harmless activity. This distinguishes our treatment from the analysis of the utilization of polluting inputs by firms and corresponding regulations in contributions to the field of environmental economics, for example. Table 1 provides a more comprehensive taxonomy of activities in order to clearly distinguish the goods/activities considered in the present analysis from those treated in other contributions to the literature. In particular, the paper contributes to the literature on optimal law enforcement, a field that has recently been surveyed by Polinsky and Shavell (2007). In this body of work, it has been considered that offenders may invest in avoidance activities that influence the probability of detection (Innes 2001; Langlais 2008; Malik 1990; Nussim and Tabbach 2008, 2009; Tabbach 2010). Avoidance activities are generally complementary to criminal activity, because more crime increases the marginal benefit of avoidance. As explained in Table 1, avoidance activities have neither a direct utility effect nor do they directly impose (expected) external harm; in addition, they only arise in combination with criminal activities. Our approach is related to this branch of the literature, in that the harmless activity we consider may also impact the detection probability; however, a critical difference in our approach is that the activity itself provides utility (see Table 1). This implies that a decrease in the extent to which individuals engage in the harmless activity connotes direct welfare losses. In contrast, pure avoidance only serves the purpose of lowering the expected sanction for the perpetrator; thus, attempts to restrict its utilization bear no direct negative repercussions for society. Furthermore, the consequences of avoidance are usually restricted to the detection probability or the level of the sanction, whereas we additionally consider the influence of the harmless activity on the benefits from crime.Footnote 6 Our discussion also differs from contributions on safety regulation because the activity we consider in addition to crime does not impose expected harm on others (except for its interdependence with crime), whereas regulated activities generally have direct repercussions on others (see, e.g., Shavell 2004). For instance, regulations governing the use of hazardous substances and workplace design have obvious consequences for others. Similarly, our approach is distinct from analyses of gun ownership, since such studies usually assume that guns are purchased only to commit criminal offenses or for the purpose of defense against crime (Mialon and Wiseman 2005; Bac 2010). In contrast, we are interested in the case in which the consumption of a good or activity promotes well-being in its own right (i.e., without any relation to criminal contexts). This is also applicable to gun ownership, since many people enjoy collecting weapons or shooting as a sport. Finally, the goods/activities considered here can be distinguished from private goods/activities without any interaction with crime. For example, eating in a restaurant instead of cooking at home (where both activities imply a rather similar use of time) may be regarded as a purely private activity that lacks any interrelation to crime. Because we consider the allocation of time between legal and illegal opportunities, this paper is also related to Ehrlich (1973); the first study to examine this aspect, and subsequent extensions of the concept. Another body of literature related to our study addresses the topic of taxing complements to leisure and subsidizing substitutes to leisure as elements of optimal taxation (Atkinson and Stiglitz 1976; Corlett and Hague 1953, and, more recently, Kaplow 2010). This research is also related to the informational aspects of our analysis, with information asymmetry about an individual’s type being present. The policy maker may prefer to distort individuals’ decisions with respect to observables (in our case, consumption) in order to affect unobservable decisions. To the best of our knowledge, the question of whether harmless activities should be regulated as means of optimizing law enforcement has not been addressed elsewhere in the literature. The balance of the article is as follows: In Sect. 2, we examine decentralized individual decision-making and explain the comparative statics of the private optimum. Section 3 elaborates on the policy maker’s problem with respect to private decision-making, and Sect. 4 concludes.",3

We investigate a quantity ceiling regulation as a quota policy. We find that the tax policy dominates the quota policy in free entry markets. Taxation and quotas are major alternative policies for regulators in many situations such as international trade, environmental damages and resources control, and industry policies. Many studies compare the two policies in various contexts and some of them investigate this problem in the context of oligopoly.Footnote 1 In this paper, we consider a Cournot oligopoly model with free entry.Footnote 2 We compare specific taxation policy and quota policy that restricts the upper limit of output of each firm. First, we present results of short-run analysis as a benchmark. We investigate an oligopoly market in which the number of firms is given exogenously. We show the equivalence of two policies with respect to the equilibrium aggregate quantity and welfare. Next, we present results of long-run analysis. We show the equivalence of two policies with respect to the equilibrium aggregate quantity. We find, however, that specific taxation dominates volume quotas from the welfare viewpoint. This is because quotas increases the number of entering firms and increases the welfare loss caused by excessive entries pointed by Mankiw and Whinston (1986) and Suzumura and Kiyono (1987).Footnote 3 Note that, in our model, a welfare function (or a government preference function) is defined as a weighted sum of consumers’ and producers’ surpluses, the governmental tax revenue, and externality. Thus, a variety of preferences of government can be represented by the function. Our main result holds for any preference of government that can be represented by the function. In the literature, many works have already pointed out that welfare implications of public policies in free entry markets are in sharp contrast with those in non-entry markets.Footnote 4 Our result suggests that this is true in the context of tax-quota policies, too. The quota policy is more harmful than the tax policy in free entry markets.",11

The study of the welfare implications of price discrimination may be traced back to Robinson (1933), and Schmalensee (1981), assuming that firms operate with constant marginal costs. The contributions in this strand of the literature discuss the existence of an output effect, of uncertain sign, and a misallocation effect, which is always negative. The former effect depends on whether total output varies with discrimination, and the latter effect arises because of the fact that discrimination induces the monopolist to transfer output from the market with greater marginal valuation to the market where marginal valuation is lower. Schmalensee (1981) concludes that the net welfare effect will be positive only if total output expands, although this does not constitute a sufficient condition for welfare to improve. Later, Varian (1985) generalizes this result to interdependent markets and increasing marginal costs and Schwartz  (1990) proves this result for decreasing marginal costs. More recent contributions have studied particular aspects of the effect of price discrimination on welfare. For instance, Aguirre et al.  (2010), assuming constant marginal costs, present sufficient conditions for price discrimination to have a positive effect on welfare. Assuming a risk-averse monopolist operating in markets with demands that are subject to uncertainty and possibly correlated, Anam and Chiang (2006) find that it is possible to observe a decrease in output together with an increase in welfare. A similar result was obtained in Eckel and Smith (1992), studying the problem of a multiproduct monopoly facing random, correlated demands. Our contribution is to stress the fact that non-constant marginal costs, together with demand uncertainty may reverse the established relationship between output and welfare. Specifically, we will show that introducing a small level of uncertainty in just one of the markets may lead to a decrease of expected output with price discrimination while expected welfare increases. Central to our analysis is the interplay between non-constant costs and demand uncertainty. Assuming increasing marginal costs, demand uncertainty leads to an increase in the monopolist’s expected cost. Thus, a new effect appears in the analysis, which we will refer to as a cost effect. In order for this cost effect to appear, two conditions are necessary: non-constant marginal costs, and the monopolist choosing prices before demand is realized. In this setting, price discrimination provides the firm with an additional degree of freedom, which it may use to reduce costs, given that marginal costs are non-constant. The relevant question is whether this cost effect may more than offset the sum of the negative output and misallocation effects. In this article, we present an example in which this is the case. Hence, our result applies to markets in which the monopolist is unable to adjust prices facing demand fluctuations within a given market, but may price discriminate across markets. In the presence of increasing marginal costs, the monopolist may be able to reduce expected costs under price discrimination by reducing total expected output. We will see by means of an example that this cost reduction may more than offset the negative output and misallocation effects of price discrimination. In this paper, we depart from the usual assumption of constant marginal costs. While it is reasonable to assume constant marginal costs for some given range of production, variations in demand may introduce a wide dispersion in the range of production, which makes the assumption of constant marginal costs less plausible. Additionally, uncertainty itself may be a factor making other relevant costs, such as marketing, organizational costs, or stocking costs grow more than proportionally with output. For instance, analyzing the particular case of inventory costs, Chopra and Sodhi (2004) argue that using inventory to cover a high level of demand risk costs much more than covering a low level of demand risk. Thus, an industry that has a constant marginal cost structure may become one with an increasing marginal cost structure due to the necessity of accumulating and keeping stocks facing demand uncertainty. In fact, non-constant marginal cost are common in industries such as electric power generation. In this particular industry, producers have large plants, such as nuclear plants, capable of servicing a significant proportion of total demand. However, if demand increases above a certain level, then producers may make use of smaller gas or coal plants so as to service this additional demand. The marginal cost of these plants is much higher than that of nuclear plants. Furthermore, storing electricity is still technically difficult, inefficient and costly.Footnote 1
 On the demand side, producers of electricity usually have two kind of customers: on the one hand, industrial companies that buy large amounts of electricity, and on the other, households or small firms whose consumption levels are lower. In this market, price discrimination is key for the electricity producer to maximize profits. Furthermore, demand is highly uncertain, especially household demand, since it depends on factors such as the weather and other factors that cannot be foreseen by the producer. Additionally, there is an important seasonal component of demand, although this demand variability is not of uncertain nature. Many other markets include submarkets with demands that have different degrees of uncertainty. Consider, for example, the market for water. Usually, water prices for households, industry and agriculture differ, given that the latter is highly dependent on the amount of rainfall. Another example is that of an ice-cream producer. There are regions with relatively stable weather, and thus, relatively stable demands, and other regions in which the demand of ice-cream depends on more uncertain weather. Moreover, hotels, airlines, or rental car companies try to charge different prices for different types of customers. In this industry, demand from occasional customers is more uncertain at least during non-vacation periods. Thus, there are many examples of industries where firms face different demand functions in different submarkets and with different degrees of uncertainty. Finally, we would like to emphasize that our results also apply to settings in which demand variations are not caused by uncertainty. In particular, our analysis would also apply to demand subject to seasonal fluctuations. As long as demand fluctuates, and marginal costs are increasing with output, the cost effect appears. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the concept of the cost effect.

(2001) find that in 17.5 % of all M&As, the acquiring firms reported a less than \(-5~\%\) announcement return. Similar results are shown in the numerous M&A event studies found in the literature. Studies have shown that, for up to five years following mergers, acquiring firms (that is, the combined acquirer and target firm) earn a statistically significant, abnormal, negative return. This is the post-merger underperformance puzzle widely known in the literature. On the other hand, a positive abnormal return on shares is often observed for the target company, known as the “acquisition premium”. Such value destroying M&As are also documented by the popular media. For example, the Economist reports: “ ...there is the old, nagging question about whether mergers make business sense. Much navel-gazing followed the great merger frenzy of the 1990s, as the board of directors–their own mergers in ruins–solemnly dusted down old studies showing that mergers usually destroy value. Only this week, the Boston Consulting Group put out research showing that, of 277 big M&A deals in America between 1985 and 2000, 64  % destroyed value for the acquirers’ shareholders.” (The Economist 2006, July 12, Vol. 368, The Return of the Deal) 
Stigler (1950) first realized that it might be advantageous for firms to stay outside a merger since outside rival firms can free-ride on the lessened competition due to merger. Salant and Reynolds (1983) formally modeled this free-riding effect in a Cournot setting which is known in the theoretical literature as the “merger paradox”.Footnote 2
 In the current paper, a sequential bargaining model where a target firm makes a proposition to each potential acquirers is used to interpret the value destroying M&As when the possibility of pre-empting rivals is of primary concern. When the target firm sequentially presents propositions to the two acquirers, the first potential acquirer may end up overpaying the target firm (value-destroying M&A) since it does not know the rival acquirer’s synergy which is the rival’s private information. When the first potential acquirer turns down this take-or-leave-it offer, the second candidate acquirer always makes nonnegative gains from the bargaining process. When the first acquirer accepts the offer, the rival firm may gain or lose. In the current paper, it is also shown that overpaying does exist and that it serves as the main source of value destroying in a merger. In particular, in this paper, we show that the winner’s curse like overpaying never occurs in a simultaneous competitive bidding process but that it may arise in the target firm initiated sequential negotiations; and if the merger is successful, then it is never value destroying for the combined firm. Thus the acquirer’s overpayment is not the ‘winner’s curse’ that resulted from the post-announcement competitive bidding but rather is due to the strengthened bargaining power the target gains from the sequential negotiation process. In contrast, most existing studies on the merger paradox attempt to disprove the value-destroying nature of mergers. There is however another strand of literature that accepts the paradox and offers interpretations as to why value-destroying mergers take place. These include various interpretations in management, finance and economics literature.Footnote 3 One explanation for such puzzles is firms’ pre-emptive motives, for example in studies by Molnár (2007), Akdogu (2011), Fishman (1988), Toxvaerd (2008) and Fridolfsson and Stennek (2005). If a merger confers strong negative externalities to firms outside the merger, then it is better to become an “insider” than an “outsider”. This pre-emption theory says that the pre-emption can be optimal even if the acquiring firm has to overpay relative to the increase in the combined profits of the merged firm. This is because by pre-empting an outside rival firm’s bid, the acquiring firm avoids a larger (hypothetical) loss that would result from this rival merger. Such overpayment results obtained in Molnár (2007), are based on the assumption that synergiesFootnote 4 are public information and pairwise symmetric. In realistic situations, however, synergies may be private information and asymmetric, meaning the synergy gained from a merger can be firm specific. Furthermore, such overpaying is vulnerable to collusion among the bidders in the competitive bidding setup. In Akdogu (2011), the synergy is private information but a negative externality is assumed exogenously, hence overpaying is a natural consequence. However, a merger does not necessarily only result in a negative externality, i.e., the positive externality may outweigh the negative one depending on the degree and nature of the synergies. On the other hand, the literature on pre-emption perceived that being an outsider may be disadvantageous to a merger (Akdogu 2011; Brito 2003; Molnár 2007). Akdogu points out that there “must be an intuition that losing a target to a competitor is costly.” Nevertheless, empirical studies confirm that overpaying (through competitive bidding) is the main source of the post-merger underperformance puzzle.Footnote 5 The fact that overpaying persists,Footnote 6 together with the theoretical result of the nonexistence of overpaying in the competitive bidding models lead us to rethink the setup of the M&A models. In the current paper, we consider that the target firm approaches potential acquirers sequentially, negotiating on a one-on-one basis. More rigorously, we show that overpaying occurs in the sequential setup, but never arises in the traditional simultaneous competitive bidding setup, when synergies are private information. And the result is invariant to the auction forms because of revenue equivalence theorem. The finance literature on these cumulative abnormal returns on the acquirers and targets has mainly focused on the post-public announcement period of the takeover process. A recent study by Boone and Mulherin (2007) reveals that the process during the pre-public announcement takeover period is much more competitive and sophisticated than previously thought. In particular, they find that half of the target firms privately contacted multiple potential buyers prior to the public announcement (21 bidders on average). That the target firms initiated the sequential negotiations in corporate takeovers is nothing new.Footnote 7 A large proportion of corporate takeovers begin with target firms negotiating with bidders on a one-on-one basis. If the negotiation succeeds, target shareholders should benefit in the form of higher abnormal returns. Notice that, in fact, most M&As are friendly. The Economist
Footnote 8 reports that only 4 % of deals struck in the year 2000 were deemed hostile or unsolicited, and even during the hostile days it was still below 20 %. Furthermore, studies show that target firms’ management often manipulates the takeovers to benefit themselves for example, by negotiating large cash payments, special bonuses, or golden parachutes (see e.g. Hartzell et al. 2004, among others). Several theoretical studies show that the method a firm’s sale has some impact on the expected wealth changes for target shareholders (e.g., Hirshleifer and Png 1989; Bulow and Klemperer 1996; Ye 2008). Bulow and Klemperer (1996) prove that the single bidder negotiations may outperform simultaneous bidding when bidders’ signals are not independent. Povel and Singh (2006) show that targets can profit from a sequential one-on-one negotiation mechanism when bidders have asymmetric valuation. They consider a timing similar to ours in which the target firm sequentially solicits bids from potential buyers. The key difference is that their framework is in a common value environment, while ours resembles a private value setting. Our results, therefore, complement those of Povel and Singh (2006) and Bulow and Klemperer (1996). In summary, this paper complements the existing literature on pre-emptive M&As in the following ways. First, we show that, in the presence of private information on synergies, a competitive bidding process does not lead to overpaying the target firm. Second, the current model uses a sequential-bargaining model to interpret value destroying M&As. In some cases, the sequential bargaining setting results in overpaying. But in the current paper, the intuition differs significantly in that overpaying does not occur ex ante to an acquirer, whereas in existing preemptive models overpaying systematically persists. Third, in some papers mergers are triggered by changes in industrywide market conditions, such as demand shocks, where in our model mergers occur in equilibrium in the absence of exogenous triggers. Related to the current paper, Zhao (2009a) argues that transaction costs and/or an empty core may explain why some profitable mergers do not take place. Zhao (2004) shows that, in a Bertrand setting that mergers that attain sufficiently large cost savings will reduce the outsiders’ profits. We show that in a Cournot setting, such synergies can also reduce an outsider’s profit, and thus, mergers tend to be pre-emptive. Zhao (2009b) considers the optimal number of firms in the presence of scale economies, which has implications on an antitrust authority’s position over merger applications, regardless of whether a particular merger is profitable or not. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model. Section 3 gives the nonexistence results of a simultaneous bidding environment. Section 4 extends the basic model to multiple bidders and production differentiation. Section 5 concludes.",3

Such infrastructure consists of physical facilities (e.g., railways, schools, hospitals) and public services (e.g., transportation, education, medical services). An essential aspect of infrastructure provision is that it is a multi-stage process. A public facility is designed, built, and operated over a long period of time as it delivers services to the public. Inevitably, an infrastructure project involves many kinds of uncertainty. Risk sharing between public authorities and private contractors is thus a key factor for a successful project. The government must find an efficient procedure for procurement. The purpose of this paper is to compare the performance of two procurement mechanisms, bundling and unbundling, and to investigate the choice problem of a mechanism. In many construction projects, a public authority has the option of choosing between a bundling method called “design-build” and an unbundling method called “design-bid-build.” Under the design-build method, a private party called a design-builder, which may be organized by a group of companies, is responsible for performing tasks of both design and construction.Footnote 1 Similarly, contractual arrangements called “public-private partnerships (PPPs)” are characterized by bundled tasks. Under the design-bid-build method, the two tasks are separated. Architects draw the initial design, and then bidders are invited to submit bids for the construction. While unbundling methods have been employed traditionally in public procurement, there is a recent trend towards bundling methods. There is an ongoing debate about the two methods. It is often said that the bundling method transfers risks from public authorities to private parties so that the private parties are motivated to invest more. However, the risk transfer may become excessive and, as a result, the public authority must pay a higher risk premium in exchange for shifting the burden of risk to private parties. See Gibson et al. (2007) and Iossa et al. (2007) for more about these methods and detailed arguments in the debate. It remains an open question, theoretically and practically, which of the bundling and unbundling methods is most desirable for a public authority and for society. We analyze the procurement problem in a two-stage auction model with risks. A risk-neutral buyer procures a public infrastructure project from risk-averse suppliers. The investment stage is followed by the production stage. In a bundling mechanism, the buyer holds a single auction. In an unbundling mechanism, the buyer holds two sequential auctions. Each auction adopts a first-price format. A distinctive feature of our model is that it has two categories of production risks. The first category is an aggregate risk. The risk is common to all suppliers. The second one is an idiosyncratic risk. The risk is specific to each supplier. Each supplier’s production cost is affected by the two risk factors as well as by the cost-reducing investment. After the cost-reducing investment is made, the realized value of the aggregate risk is commonly known to all suppliers, and each supplier privately knows the realized value of the idiosyncratic risk to him. 
Yescombe (2007) provides many examples of aggregate risk and idiosyncratic risk in construction projects. He classifies risks into several categories related to sites, construction, and completion. Site risks including ground conditions are typical examples of aggregate risk. If the geology of a site turns out not to be as expected, then piling is required for foundations. Design risks in the category of completion are other examples of aggregate risk. If there is a flaw in the design drawings, then all builders are damaged. Market uncertainty such as fluctuations in material prices, political uncertainty, and climate conditions are other examples of aggregate risk. Many uncertain elements in economic, financial, labor and organizational conditions of construction companies constitute idiosyncratic risk to them. For instance, a construction company may be uncertain of the technical ability of its hired subcontractors. If the subcontractors are not able to do the construction work properly, then the constructor must bear additional costs. The main result of this paper is as follows. The bundling mechanism is optimal for the buyer and also socially desirable if the aggregate risk is below certain thresholds. The result may not hold true for the idiosyncratic risk. Key factors leading to the result are the differences in risk sharing, information rents, and investment incentives between the bundling and unbundling mechanisms. In the bundling mechanism, all the risks are assumed by a single supplier, the winner of the auction. The buyer has to pay a high risk premium to the winner, while the mechanism implements the efficient investment. In contrast, the unbundling mechanism provides little incentive for the investment due to a moral hazard problem. The buyer must pay risk premia for the idiosyncratic risk indirectly through the payment of information rents. The buyer pays no risk premium for the aggregate risk because the risk is transferred from the suppliers to the buyer through the second-stage auction. Therefore, a decrease in the aggregate risk is beneficial to the buyer and society only in the bundling mechanism, unlike the idiosyncratic risk. A decrease in the idiosyncratic risk reduces the information rents in the unbundling mechanism if the idiosyncratic risk is exponentially distributed. Based on the result above, we can provide the following policy recommendation on the choice of procurement mechanisms: A public authority should not lump all possible risks together, but classify them into aggregate risks and idiosyncratic risks. A low aggregate risk for a project is a strong reason to choose a bundling method from the viewpoints of both the public authority and society. On the contrary, when a project’s idiosyncratic risk is low, it may be recommended for the authority to choose an unbundling method rather than a bundling method. 
Kay (2009) reports a real case of a construction project that is relevant for our result. During 1996–2004, a new metro system called Tren Urbano was constructed in Puerto Rico. The 10.7-mile metro line connects the cities of San Juan, Guaynabo, and Bayamón. The Puerto Rico Highway and Transit Authority (PRHTA) split the civil work into seven sections, and employed design-build methods (i.e., bundling) in all sections. Prior to requesting proposals for the design-build contract, the PRHTA investigated geotechnical conditions significantly. The research outcome was shared by prospective bidders, and it reduced aggregate risks to them. This paper is related to several previous studies in the literature which also considered the choice problem of bundling and unbundling mechanisms. Hart (2003) presents an incomplete contract model and shows that a bundling mechanism gives a supplier strong incentives for socially productive and unproductive investments. His result is supported experimentally by Hoppe et al. (2013). Li and Yu (2011) present an auction model similar to ours, and examine how the optimality of a bundling mechanism is affected by the competition among suppliers. Martimort and Pouyet (2008) show that the buyer’s optimal choice is a bundling mechanism if a quality-enhancing effort in the first stage reduces production costs. In a second-price auction model, Grimm (2007) shows that the buyer always prefers a bundling mechanism with subcontracting to an unbundling mechanism in the case of risk-neutral suppliers. Unlike all works mentioned above, this paper focuses on risk sharing between the buyer and suppliers in the choice of a procurement mechanism, and shows that aggregate risk and idiosyncratic risk have different effects on the choice of mechanism. Finally, our result is closely related to the “yardstick competition effect” studied by Auriol and Laffont (1992). As in their regulation model, the unbundling mechanism in our model has the yardstick competition effect in the sense that information on aggregate risk is revealed to the buyer through the second-stage auction. Owing to the information revelation, the unbundling mechanism becomes beneficial to the buyer. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a two-stage auction model. Sections 3 and 4 characterize an equilibrium of the model under each mechanism. Section 5 gives the main results. Section 6 discusses an extension of the model. Section 7 is the conclusion. All proofs are given in the Appendix.",1

This dependence of the individual salary on the respective performance is in general justified by incentive motivations, for instance, to reduce free-riding behavior; see Prendergast (1999). However, providing incentives through a highly sensitive performance based compensation scheme may result in detrimental consequences. In the context of a rank-order tournament model where effort is non-observable, Lazear (1989) argues that higher competitive pressure might induce agents to sabotage each other (which reduces the performance of others) instead of increasing their individual performance. The existence of this potentially destructive reaction to performance based compensation schemes will naturally affect the optimal design of those schemes. In Lazear (1989) the wage spread is the key parameter that can be controlled by the firm to influence the performance (and sabotage activity) of the agents. Under this assumption it is shown that wage compression might be profit increasing if agents have the option of sabotaging others. However, this assumption takes salaries as not being related to the economic performance of the whole firm. In fact, performance related compensation schemes frequently do not only depend on the relative individual performance but also on the overall performance of the firm, work group, etc. Examples are compensation schemes for executives that partially consist out of stock options that depend on the share price (and therefore also on the economic performance) of the relevant firm, or research recognition programs where the bonus of a researcher/department does not only depend on the individual/departmental research record but also on the overall research performance of the university.Footnote 1 Another important example are partnerships, where partners actually own and work for the firm at the same time and therefore have to share the jointly produced surplus according to specific rules. Those examples suggest that the competed ‘prize’ (e.g. salary increase, bonus etc.) might not be a fixed amount but also depend on the performance of the relevant agents. Therefore, in this paper the competed prize is interpreted as a jointly produced output that depends on the aggregated performance of all agents. The problem of providing incentives for workers is then transformed to the specification of a sharing rule that determines how the jointly produced output is shared among the agents.Footnote 2 Using a cooperative production model that incorporates a jointly owned production technology also enriches the analysis because the usual notion of pareto-efficiency can be used in this context, i.e., the question can be raised whether a sharing rule exists that induces a non-cooperative equilibrium which leads to a pareto-efficient allocation (output-labor-sabotage combination).Footnote 3
 The model that is introduced below is therefore based on a cooperative production set-up where individuals have to decide their respective amount of non-contractable labor that determines their individual level of input.Footnote 4 The vector of input contributions is assumed to be the only observable and contractable information.Footnote 5 The cooperative production technology transforms the provided total amount of input contributions into a single and divisible output. This output is shared among the individuals according to a parametrized sharing rule where the parameter specifies the sensitivity of the sharing rule with respect to the relative input contributions of the individuals. The sharing rule adopted here has a simple and intuitive interpretation because it is specified as a linear combination between equal and proportional sharing. The non-standard element of the model is the additional strategic option of each individual to sabotage the labor contribution of others which will affect the input contributions of the sabotaged individuals. From an individual strategic perspective a sabotaging agent decreases the input of the sabotaged individual which yields a higher relative input share (and therefore also a higher relative output share) for the sabotaging agent. At the same time exerting sabotage reduces total output which also implies that sabotage is inefficient from a social welfare perspective because zero sabotage would (ceteris paribus) increase joint output. These two effects induce a strategic trade-off for each individual that is highly dependent on the sensitivity of the sharing rule with respect to the input contributions of the individuals.Footnote 6 Therefore, the individual decision on whether to exert sabotage (and if yes, how much) but also the decision on the level of productive labor depends in particular on the specification of the sharing rule. In the following section an illustrative numerical example is presented to show that sharing rules can be constructed that induce zero sabotage and at the same time the pareto-efficient level of production. These sharing rules consist of appropriate mixtures between equal and proportional sharing and therefore balance the trade-off between sabotage and productive labor activities. This insight is then used in the analysis of a more general theoretical model to derive general conditions on the sharing rule (more precisely: restrictions with respect to its sensitivity parameter), that guarantee the existence of an equilibrium where all agents refrain from sabotage. The question whether a sharing rule exists in the general model that induces zero sabotage and simultaneously the pareto-efficient level of production is complex and can only be partially answered. The underlying theoretical model is formulated in rather abstract terms that allow alternative interpretations of the relevant framework. For instance, the set up could be interpreted as a stylized economy where the jointly produced total surplus has to be distributed as individual income. In this framework the parametrized sharing rule can be interpreted as the level of tax-based redistribution: Equal sharing would coincide with a 100 % income tax and full redistribution while proportional sharing could be interpreted as no redistribution/taxes at all where individual income solely depends on the relative individual provision of inputs.Footnote 7 The underlying question is then: How much redistribution is necessary in an economy such that individuals refrain from sabotaging others? As the objective of this study is the analysis of sabotage in a cooperative production framework, there are two areas of related literature: On the one hand there are models that focus on sabotage in different competitive situations where contested prizes are generally assumed to be constant and the winner is usually determined according to a simple rule.Footnote 8 On the other hand there are studies based on a cooperative production framework as in Sen (1966), or Israelsen (1980), where a jointly produced output is shared among its contributors. In those types of models the contested prize (output) depends on input contributions (because it is produced) and is then distributed according to some sharing rule. However, the possibility of sabotaging others (to increase the individual relative contribution by affecting negatively the contribution of others) is not addressed in those types of models. Hence, extending a cooperative production model with a sabotage option allows to analyze the relation between the specific sharing rule and the decision to sabotage others which also has implications for pareto-efficiency. A model that is closely related is Beviá and Corchón (2006) where a sabotage game is introduced in a cooperative production set-up with heterogeneous players and a very general class of sharing rules. However, in their model labor and sabotage activities are assumed to be costless. Additionally, the agents are forced to distribute their entire fixed labor time either to productive labor or to destructive sabotage activity, i.e., agents can only control the proportion of labor versus sabotage that they contribute. These assumptions limit the individual labor-sabotage decision and are therefore relaxed in the model presented here: The individual decision of exerting labor and/or sabotage is now separated by inducing a disutility on each activity.Footnote 9 This has implications for the definition of the efficient allocation because exerting zero sabotage is not a sufficient condition for pareto efficiency, i.e., inefficient over- or underproduction might be observed even it there is no sabotage in equilibrium. Hence, the restrictions on the optimal sharing rule are more demanding because zero sabotage is not sufficient for obtaining efficient allocations. Moreover, for reasons of analytical tractability the model set-up is more specific than in Beviá and Corchón (2006) in the sense that homogeneous agents have access to a cooperative production technology as in Sen (1966), extended by the additional strategic option of directed sabotage as in Konrad (2000). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In the next section an illustrative two-player example is presented to demonstrate the main insights. The general model is introduced in Sect. 3, where the pareto-efficient consumption-labor-sabotage allocation is characterized in Sect.  3.1, while the non-cooperative equilibrium and its relation to the pareto-efficient allocation is analyzed in Sect. 3.2. Some extensions, that include an alternative objective function and a different class of sharing rules are discussed in Sect. 4. The final section concludes by addressing potential limitations and further research possibilities.",
113.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,01 December 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-013-0384-y,Strategic delegation in consumer cooperatives under mixed oligopoly,November 2014,Michael Kopel,Marco A. Marini,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In this paper we contribute to the understanding of compensation practices in consumer cooperatives—a particular form of non-profit organizations—and try to shed some light on the differences to their for-profit rivals. In particular, we provide a reason why a consumer cooperative (henceforth Coop) might be less prone than a profit-maximizing firm (henceforth PMF) to pay variable bonuses to a manager and to rely on fixed wages instead. The key point here is that Coops and other nonprofit firms may have a preference to recruit managers who are intrinsically motivated to advance the firm’s organizational goal (e.g., Frey 1997; Bénabou and Tirole 2002, 2003; Frey and Benz 2005; James and Harvey 2005; Murdock 2002). Coops are enterprises operating in the retail industry which, by law or statutory rules, should act on behalf of their consumer-members.Footnote 1 Since, ultimately, customers are the main Coop’s stakeholders, they are commonly entitled to democratically elect their representatives, who participate in general meetings and, directly or indirectly—usually through a board of directors—recruit the CEOs running the firm. The wide diffusion of Coops worldwide suggests that this form of organizational governance is important. In 2008 more than 3,000 Coops were active in Europe with a turnover of approximately 70 billion Euro and 25 million consumer-members (EuroCoop 2008). Also Japan reports a large number of consumer cooperatives, serving 25.8 million members and producing a turnover of approximately 30 billion Euro in 2009 (JCCU 2009). Switzerland, Finland, Italy, Spain, as well as many other European countries similarly possess well-established consumer cooperative movements. In recent years, the scale of operations of this type of firms has reached a considerable dimension and most of existing Coops can be currently portrayed as enterprises competing oligopolistically with conventional PMFs, thus giving rise to a special form of mixed oligopoly.Footnote 2
 The principal-agent relationship between Coop members, its board of directors, and the manager of the Coop has been discussed quite intensively in the literature on Coop corporate governance (see e.g. Spear 2004; Nilsson 2001; Cornforth 2004; Sykuta and Cook 2001; Richards et al. 1998). Concerning CEO compensation, empirical work has repeatedly shown that—in contrast to PMFs—Coops do not provide high-powered incentives to their managers. For example, Hueth and Marcoul (2009) find that “... the cooperative governance structure is likely to result in less reliance on explicit performance incentives.” (p. 1220). Instead, Coops seem to rely to a much higher degree on the intrinsic motivation of its managers and workers, on implicit contracts (enforced by social ties between the CEO and board members) and on subjective performance evaluation (Leete 2000; Ittner et al. 2007; Tirole 1994, 2001). Colter and Nolan (2006) find that compensation in Coops is mainly related to the size of the Coop and that contingent pay and bonuses are uncommon and small compared to the base salary. Colter (2011) remarks that, “..there are managers who much prefer to have not a bonus at all.” Trechter and King (1995) discover that bonuses of Coop managers were mainly related to size measures like sales or total assets and less dependent on profitability. Trechter et al. (997) report that Coop boards are skeptical of ex ante bonus programs. These observations for CEO compensation in Coops are in line with the findings in the broader literature on (other) non-profit organizations, see e.g. Frumkin and Keating (2010), Brandl and Güttel (2007) and Hallock (2002). To motivate these findings, two main reasons have been advanced. First, from an agency perspective, using low-powered incentives for the managers in nonprofit organizations is the board’s optimal response since the objectives of a NPO are difficult to quantify (Hallock 2002; Preyra and Pink 2001). Since the goals are vague and ill-defined and the danger of giving dysfunctional incentives is high, the use of pay-for-performance is restricted (Theuvsen 2004; Spear 2004). Additionally, in Coops the heterogeneity across members makes it difficult to agree on performance targets, which results in low-powered incentives for CEOs (Hueth and Marcoul 2009). Second, from a management perspective, using low-powered incentives is indicated since pay-for-performance based on financial measures does not fit with a nonprofit’s mission (Frumkin and Keating 2010). Strong extrinsic financial incentives are against the principle of fairness and might crowd out intrinsic motivation of individuals who have (been) selected to work non-profit organization (Spear 2004; Theuvsen 2004; Brandl and Güttel 2007). We believe that, although important, any explanation for low-powered incentives in Coops (and other nonprofit organizations) which is based only on these two perspectives provides an incomplete description of the governance and behavior of organizations competing in oligopolistic mixed markets. The argument which we pursue in this paper is that product market competition and strategic interaction between firms shape incentive contracts and governance as well. In the last years, several empirical papers have shown that this interaction plays an important role (e.g. Karuna 2007; Cunat and Guadalupe 2005; Vroom and Gimeno 2007). Furthermore, the literature on incentives (e.g. Sengul et al. 2012; Kopel and Löffler 2012; Kopel and Brand 2012) has demonstrated how incentive contracts for managers or, more general, organizational governance can be used as a strategic device to obtain a competitive advantage and market leadership.Footnote 3 Therefore, the question remains why Coops would not want to use higher-powered incentive contracts to guide their managers’ market behavior and to influence their rivals’ expectations in oligopolistic interaction, but rather use fixed wage compensation. To the best of our knowledge, no formal work has addressed this strategic incentive issue. The only work worth mentioning is Feng and Hendrikse (2012), who introduce a multi-tasking agency model and argue that Coops might have efficiency advantages if interdependencies between upstream and downstream activities exist. At the end of their paper, they only briefly address strategic incentive effects, but provide no detailed analysis (see, similarly, Feng and Hendrikse 2009). In the present paper, we close this gap in the literature and analyze a strategic incentives game between a PMF and a Coop. More precisely, we consider a Coop and a PMF interacting in a Bertrand duopoly with differentiated goods (e.g. Marini and Zevi 2011; Drivas and Giannakas 2010; Giannakas and Fulton 2005; Fulton and Giannakas 2001). Both the Coop and the PMF owners can either delegate the price choice to an externally recruited manager or, alternatively, select one of their own core stakeholders to run the firm. For the Coop, such an internally selected manager might be one of the consumer-members, for the PMF one can think of an investor-manager. Following the strategic incentives literature, we assume that if an external manager is recruited, her compensation is determined by an explicit performance contract based on observable and verifiable performance measures, in our case profits and sales revenues.Footnote 4 The owners of the firm (or the board) can design the manager’s contract to obtain a competitive advantage in this situation of strategic interaction.Footnote 5 The results of our analysis are in line with empirical and anecdotal evidence. In equilibrium, the PMF owners distort the preferences of the external manager by means of a bonus-based incentive contract. In contrast, the owners of the Coop (the consumers) find it more beneficial in terms of member value not to use high-powered incentives via a profit-and-sales based incentive contract, but rather rely on an internal member-manager who is paid a flat wage. Summarizing, our model demonstrates that if one focuses on the strategic impact, it is not indicated for a Coop to use the same type of compensation policy for its manager as a PMF. In terms of strategic interaction, the intuition is that a Coop, by recruiting an agent (e.g., a consumer-owner) whose preferences are aligned with the organizational objective, is per se highly expansionary in term of output. Therefore, the Coop does not need to rely on a manager who sets prices aggressively to expand market share and quantity. Furthermore, employing an external manager only interested in monetary rewards based on sales and profits leads to distorted incentives with respect to the Coop’s goal, which after all is the welfare of its members. Summarizing, our contribution to the literature is twofold. First, we show that Coops do not have strategic reasons to use incentive contracts when they can attract and recruit intrinsically motivated agents to run the firm. This is of interest in the light of some recent trends in Coop management. For example, a research report of the Center of Cooperatives (see Lang 2002) based on responses of industry experts concluded that: “[e]xisting compensation programs are not seen as adequate to attract chief executives comparable to those of investor-oriented firms.”, and, “Cooperative management must have compensation programs adequate to attract chief executives comparable to those of investor-owned firms.” (p. 27). New generation Cooperatives and other hybrid organizational structures emerge and are competing head-to-head with profit-maximizing rival firms (Katz and Boland 2002; Kopel and Brand 2012), and therefore consider providing high-powered incentives to their managers as well. According to our results, the performance schemes in Coops should be adopted with great caution. Second, our paper complements a line of research which considers strategic incentives in mixed oligopolies with a public firm or hybrid organizational structures (e.g. Kopel and Brand 2012; Bárcena-Ruiz 2009; Heywood and Ye 2009; Goering 2007, 2008; White 2001). The paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces a mixed duopoly model with strategic delegation in which a Coop and a PMF compete in prices and supply differentiated goods to consumers. Section 3 presents the main results of our paper. Section 4 concludes.",16

To reconcile this individualistic theory of the consumer with the reality of individuals’ life in a family setting, Samuelson (1956) and Becker (1981) created seminal models, known as unitary models in their respective economic research on the family. They assume that a family acts as a unit and has a single unified set of interests.Footnote 1 Following these seminal works, a considerable number of studies have been done on decision making within the family. The literature on family decision making starts from the assumption that a family consists of two individuals who make their own decisions in the family, each according to his/her own utility. Thus, the decision mode in these models can be cooperative or non-cooperative. In non-cooperative approaches, Konrad and Lommerud (1995, 2000) and Leuthold (1968) consider the level of household public goods to be determined by the Nash equilibrium of a non-cooperative game. In the cooperative approaches, Manser and Brown (1980) and McElroy and Horney (1981) set up a model with family demands as the solution of a cooperative bargaining game. In the cooperative bargaining game, individuals pursue their common interests given their relative bargaining positions inside the household; these are affected by outside opportunities, the institutional environment, and spouses’ relative characteristics. The collective model (Chiappori 1988, 1992; Browning and Chiappori 1998) also involves a cooperative approach. It assumes that the decisions are made such that the outcomes are Pareto efficient, and is more general than the cooperative bargaining model.Footnote 2
 In the analysis of family economics, many studies focus on the gains from marriage arising from the sharing of public goods. This implies the division of labor to exploit comparative advantage. Thus, many studies have focused on substitutability in the provision of household public goods (see, for example, Lundberg and Pollak 1996; Apps and Rees 2009), but little attention has been given to complementarity in the provision of household public goods in the context of family economics. In reality, many data show the synchronization of leisure activities between partners. For example, Sullivan (1996) uses the 1985 UK time-use survey, a diary survey with instant enjoyment information, and finds that partners report higher levels of satisfaction when they synchronize their working schedules, thus maximizing the potential time they can spend in leisure activities together. Hamermesh (1999), Hallberg (2003), and Jenkins and Osberg (2005) find that the synchronization of leisure activities between partners is greater than random male-female pairing would predict. This example makes it clear that married couples enjoy a higher utility from leisure spent together than leisure individually or with another person. Using the American Time Use Survey, Connelly and Kimmel (2009) find that the husband’s and wife’s leisure hours appear to have a complementarity relationship. Given these findings, in contrast to the stylized model, we set up a simple model with the strategic complementarities that arise in the organization of social leisure in a household production model following Becker (1965) and Corneo (2005); that is, in our model, leisure is an input in the production of the public good “time together.” In the present analysis, we employ the dynamic aspect of family decision making developed by Chiappori et al. (2009) and Konrad and Lommerud (2000) because in the real world, a man and a woman make several decisions before getting married. Specifically, we set up a two-stage game model in which a man and a woman simultaneously decide their education levels in the first stage. After each agent completes his/her education level, the man and the woman meet and become a couple. In the second stage, the husband/wife decides his/her contribution to household public goods, taking his/her education level in the first stage into account. In our analytical model, we consider two cases for the equilibrium in the second stage: the non-cooperative equilibrium and the cooperative one. In the non-cooperative game, we apply the game of Konrad and Lommerud (1995, 2000) and Leuthold (1968) into our complementarity model and derive the provision of household public goods as a solution of a Nash equilibrium. In the cooperative game, we assume that a couple maximizes its joint utility function. It assumes away any influence of bargaining power–for instance, the role of the wife’s labor force participation in bargaining. We assume that the two spouses are equally important, and nothing is modified even if we take into account their relative Pareto weight. Thus, our model does not compare a general cooperative model to the non-cooperative model. The purpose in examining the non-cooperative equilibrium is to characterize the cooperative equilibrium. It is important to understand the characteristics of decision modes within the family because of the appropriate design of the policy. We firstly show that the leisure provision of the husband or wife depends on his or her wage rate, and it decreases with an increase in the wage rate for a given level of the spouse’s wage rate. This coincides with the following empirical facts. By using the eight waves of the European Community Household Panel-ECHP (1994–2000), García, Molina, and Navarro (2007) report that highly educated individuals have less leisure time (or satisfaction levels) than low educated individuals. Costa (2000) also shows that low-wage workers reduced their market work hours relative to high-wage workers between the 1890s and 1991. We next show that the non-cooperative equilibrium results in overinvestment in education. We attempt to determine a policy to alleviate this inefficiency by applying a labor law. Reduced working time is a challenge for our policy design, because this was one of the original objectives of labor law.Footnote 3
 The basic model also extends to a Stackelberg game. In the Stackelberg model, we show that a leader can earn a higher wage and enjoy more leisure time. In the real world, the census data on the gender wage gap show that men earn higher wages than women in many countries. For example, in 2010, the wage level of a woman was 70.6\(\,\%\) of that of a man in Japan (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan 2011), 81.2\(\,\%\) in the U.S. (United States Department of Labor 2011), 80.6\(\,\%\) in the U.K. (Office for National Statistics 2011), 81.6\(\,\%\) in Germany (Statistisches Bundesamt (2011)), 85.4\(\,\%\) in France (Ministry of the Economy, Finance, and Industry 2011), and 86.0\(\,\%\) in Sweden (Statistics Sweden 2011). In addition, the empirical studies of O’Neill (2003), Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer (2005), and Del Bono and Vuri (2011) identify wage gaps between couples. Further, Beblo and Robledo (2008) use the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and show that those who earn higher wages enjoy more leisure time than those who earn lower wages. Thus, we set the husband as the leader of the Stackelberg model. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is divided into three subsections: Subsect. 2.1 analyzes the second-stage outcomes, Subsect. 2.2 derives the education choices in the first stage, and Subsect. 2.3 examines policy. Section 3 extends the basic game by using a Stackelberg game framework. Section 4 concludes the paper.",

Bikhchandani et al. 1998 and Chamley 2004a). An important contribution to that literature is made by Zhang (1997). Zhang analyzes a model of endogenous timing in which agents can invest at any point in time in either of two projects. The cost of investing, and the profitability of each project are not known ex-ante, but each agent receives a private signal of which project will be more profitable and is also told, crucially, the precision of that signal. The equilibrium proposed by Zhang is intuitive and consists of a function mapping signal precision into a time to invest. The less precise is an agent’s signal then the longer he will wait before investing. The first agent to invest will, therefore, be the agent with the most precise signal. In deriving these results Zhang assumes that all agents will necessarily imitate the first investor (or no agent subsequently invests). This is called an investment cascade. The first contribution of the current paper, however, is to demonstrate that an investment cascade need not occur in the model considered by Zhang. It will occur if and only if the cost of investing takes extreme values. From a welfare perspective this finding is important because investment cascades result in less revelation of information and therefore less chance of agents choosing the optimal project. Avoiding an investment cascade is thus a good thing. The fact that an investment cascade need not occur also means that the equilibrium proposed by Zhang is incorrect. The second contribution of the current paper is to derive a revised equilibrium and show that it is qualitatively similar to that proposed by Zhang. Most of the literature on endogenous timing has treated the decision of whether or not to invest in a given project with different agents having different information on its profitability (e.g. Chamley 2004a). Zhang is a rare exception in treating the decision of whether or not to invest in a project A or project B with different agents having different signals about which option is profitable. A key contribution is to capture the strategic incentive to delay investment because of differences in information precision. These issues are still relatively unexplored in the literature but seem fundamental and can be studied, as a first approximation, independent of how one ‘creates’ or ‘motivates’ an information or investment cascade. This paper builds on Zhang’s contribution by furthering our understanding of these important issues. We proceed as follows: Sect. 2 explains the model, Sect. 3 looks at information cascades, Sect. 4 at equilibrium behavior and Sect. 5 concludes.",

As pointed out by Coase (1966), in this industry public policy might have an important role in regulating the quality and diversity of the programming available as well as the level of advertising. However, despite the empirical relevance of the presence of publicly-owned platforms in the media industries of many Western countries, there is a surprising lack of research on this form of public intervention in broadcasting markets. Nevertheless, there are some recent exceptions: On the theoretical side, Kind et al. (2007) consider a mixed broadcasting oligopoly with horizontal differentiation and show that a welfare-maximizing publicly-owned TV channel generates less advertising than private channels if and only if the degree of horizontal differentiation of the TV platforms is sufficiently large. The said authors focus only on the case of horizontal differentiation, but Maestre and Sánchez (2013) consider a mixed duopoly with both horizontal and vertical differentiation but with exogenous qualities, showing the crucial relevance of the quality gap between platforms in the welfare results. On the empirical side, Alcock and Docwra (2005) develop a stochastic oligopoly model for the Australian broadcasting market, and Bel and Domènech (2009) analyze advertising prices in the Spanish broadcasting industry. Our contribution here is related to recent empirical literature dealing with the importance of platform’s quality in television markets. In particular, the work by Beard et al. (2001) estimates that the increase in consumer gains due to a quality increase is almost exactly counterbalanced by reductions due to price increases. Chu (2010) studies the cable television market and finds that satellite entry typically causes cable platforms to raise quality and lower prices. Finally, Imbs et al. (2010) study television prices across European countries and regions. They show that a large fraction of international price gaps corresponds to quality differences. On the theoretical side, advertising in broadcasting media industries with private platforms has been extensively analyzed in recent literature.Footnote 1 Most of these earlier papers focus on the combination of advertising and horizontal product differentiation between private platforms in two-sided markets. In particular, Gabszewicz et al. (2004) and Anderson and Coate (2005) consider the influence of platform substitutability on the equilibrium and socially optimal levels of advertising; Gantman and Shy (2007) analyze the profitability of improvements in advertising quality and Peitz and Valletti (2008) compare the levels of advertising intensity and content differentiation under two different scenarios: pay-tv and free-to-air. In a recent paper Lin (2011) considers a private duopoly with endogenous choice of quality by TV platforms, and analyzes different outcomes depending on the presence of free-to-air or pay-TV platforms. The aim of our paper is twofold: First, we analyze the combined role of the endogenous choice of platform quality and the presence of a publicly-owned platform in the broadcasting industry. In earlier papers (Armstrong 2005) and more recently (Crampes et al. 2009) analyze the effects of endogenous quality improvements in broadcasting industries. In particular, Armstrong compares the equilibrium quality levels between the free-to-air duopoly regime and the case of subscription, while (Crampes et al. 2009) analyze the effects of endogenous quality improvements under free entry. However, these earlier papers assume competition between symmetric private platforms while we consider the case of a publicly-owned platform competing with a private one.Footnote 2 We compare the equilibrium levels of platform quality and advertising under private and mixed duopoly competition, and show that the results differ drastically from one scenario to the other. Second, we also consider the effects on platform quality and welfare of recent policies that tend to eliminate advertising as a source of financing for publicly-owned platforms. This aspect of our analysis is related to some recent controversial policy decisions within the EU. Particularly remarkable is the decision by the French government to eliminate advertising as a way of financing the public TV platform in France. A similar decision was subsequently made by its counterpart in Spain. In both cases the governments have established taxes on the revenues of private TV and telecom platforms as a replacement source of financing. This decision has been investigated by the European Commission but the European Court of Justice eventually ruled that France could continue to apply a special tax on telecoms and media companies to finance public television without advertising.Footnote 3 Based on this decision, the European Commission has withdrawn the charges against the Spanish tax system for implementing the same policy.Footnote 4
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 presents a spatial duopoly market with private platforms and endogenous choice of advertising and quality. Section 3 analyzes a duopoly model where one of the competitors is a publicly-owned platform that maximizes welfare. Section 4 analyzes the controversial policy decisions in the EU by France and Spain to eliminate advertising as a source of financing for their public platforms. Section 5 considers the advertising, platform quality and welfare comparisons between the three regimes and Sect. 6 concludes.",12
114.0,2.0,Journal of Economics,28 December 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-013-0387-8,Market concentration and persuasive advertising: a theoretical approach,March 2015,Nelson Sá,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The relation between advertising intensity and market concentration has long been the subject of much discussion in literature. This paper brings three theoretical contributions to that debate. First, it identifies conditions for the emergence of a non-monotonic link between persuasive advertising intensity and concentration without requiring any form of collusion. Second, it generates a simple tool to empirically assess these conditions. Third, it describes how intertemporal effects may scale or even change that relationship. These results are of primary interest to an industrial organization audience, given the nature of the problem evaluated here, while at the same time the analysis and modelling take in often unexplored general equilibrium mechanisms. 
Kaldor and Silverman (1948) are acknowledged as the first to identify an inverted U-shape relation between advertising intensity and market concentration, after examining more than one hundred English industries. The conventional interpretation for this result is epitomized by Greer (1971) in terms of reverse causality. The competitive escalation of advertising leads to greater concentration, while higher concentration also bolsters the effectiveness of advertising by weakening price competition. However, at some point, the emergence of oligopolies with low firm numbers may facilitate the tacit reduction of heavy promotion, eliminating some of its cross-cancelling effects. Bagwell and Lee (2010) derive appropriate theoretical conditions under which firms in retail markets would collude and pool at zero advertising, saving on current and future marketing expenditures. The empirical relevance of this argument is far from settled though. Scherer (1980) suggests that difficulties in monitoring advertising efforts make collusion hard to achieve in reality. Symeonidis (2003) surveys manufacturing industries in the U.K. to conclude also that collusion is less probable in activities with higher advertising intensity. Multiple empirical studies have further analyzed this problem. Esposito et al. (1990) stress the intertemporal stability of an inverted U-shape association over the 1963–1977 interval, making it robust to changes in the nature of advertising (print to broadcasting). Lee (2002) notes that a quadratic relationship between the Herfindahl index and advertising intensity in Korean manufacturing industries applies only to consumer goods, as opposed to producer goods. This reinforces a point previously made by Buxton et al. (1984) and Uri (1987), using manufacturing data from the United Kingdom and the United States, respectively. In contrast, Gisser (1991) examines 445 industries in the United States to verify that the inverted-U hypothesis breaks down in favor of a monotonically increasing association under relatively elastic demand curves. Willis and Rogers (1998) study food and tobacco manufacturing markets to uncover a J-shaped relationship between industry advertising intensity and market concentration, in particular when leading firms are equally sized. All this evidence indicates, as noted in the empirical survey carried by Leahy (1997), that the precise nature of these links is not yet resolved. This paper raises two questions. First, under which conditions can we identify a well defined relationship between advertising intensity and market concentration? Second, how is this relationship affected by general equilibrium dynamics? To answer this, a model with love of variety preferences is developed, simultaneously yielding advertising intensity, price-cost margins and equilibrium concentration. Market entry is subject to exogenous fixed costs and market power is enabled by endogenous sunk costs embodied in advertising outlays. These are persuasive in nature, enhancing consumer brand loyalty and decreasing price elasticities of demand. This approach is consistent with the view fostered by Comanor and Wilson (1979) that advertising undertaken by firms increases the willingness to pay and relaxes price competition. Under such conditions, the perception of variety by consumers emerges as part of the equilibrium in the form of endogenous preferences. It may be noted that the precise way advertising shapes utility is not consensual. Stigler and Becker (1977) suggest that tastes should be treated as stable over time. They interpret advertising as a simple input which, along with other market goods, yields the commodities that are ultimately chosen by consumers. This methodological stance is further developed in Becker and Murphy (1993) by means of a model featuring advertising and advertised goods as complements in the utility function. All decisions are thus uniquely subject to changes in prices and incomes. In contrast, Dixit and Norman (1978) postulate advertising as a taste shifter, affecting demand elasticities in a way not too dissimilar to the one described here. It is not the purpose of the current paper to settle this debate. There may be significant implications on welfare assessments from the use of distorted preferences, but the focus of this model lies rather on identifying compelling structural effects on prices, quantities and entry mechanisms. The modulating effect of persuasive advertising over tastes has been used in different contexts in the industrial organization literature, in particular within Hotelling-type models of product differentiation under duopoly. Bloch and Manceau (1999) assign to advertising the role of shifting the distribution of consumer preferences towards a given brand. von der Fehr and Stevik (1998) allow for varied effects on the utility function, either increasing the willingness to pay, changing the ideal product variety or enhancing perceived product differences. A model of vertical differentiation is explored by García-Gallego and Georgantzís (2009), analyzing campaign-induced fluctuations of social consciousness taste parameters. One relevant feature of that framework is that market coverage and structure may themselves change because of adjustments in reservation prices, though outcomes are restricted to either monopoly or duopoly. The focus on sunk costs as joint determinants of conduct and structure draws parallels with the work of Sutton (1989); Sutton (1991); Sutton (1998). There are also points of contact with a broad theoretical literature on two-stage oligopolies, where first-stage investments (frequently on research activities) are followed by quantity or price competition. A good overview of such models can be found in Bolle (2011). Some of them widen the range of relevant market features along similar lines to this paper. Vives (2008) examines the role of product substitutability (as a proxy to competition intensity) over cost reduction expenditures per firm. Sacco and Schmutzler (2011) explore also the impact of product differentiation on process innovation outlays by means of a linear Cournot duopoly. However, these determinants remain exogenous, just as the number of firms. The present model departs from these examples by providing an integrated treatment of endogenous market concentration and price-cost margins, built upon first stage expenditures on persuasive advertising. In what concerns general equilibrium, Gary-Bobo and Michel (1991) are among the first (and few) to use such a framework to describe the effect of advertising strategies on aggregate demand and the resulting impact on individual pricing and quantity decisions. Nonetheless, their model is static and considers only informative advertising within a set of purely homogeneous goods. Our paper suggests that intertemporal mechanisms can generate new links between advertising and concentration. The structural parameters driving these vectors affect overall rates of return in the economy and the ideal timing of consumption expenditures, scaling the market in different ways. This is especially relevant in that it may skew or even reverse the results yielded by a partial equilibrium analysis. These new theoretical insights are valuable in themselves, besides helping refine empirical strategies and avoid possible sources of estimation bias. The main results may be described as follows. A decreasing ratio of operational profits and advertising cost elasticities with respect to perceived quality is shown to be a necessary condition for the emergence of a non-monotonic relation between advertising intensity and market concentration. Competitive advertising enables firms to accommodate increases in sunk cost parameters, pushing up the corresponding intensity at lower levels of concentration. As the relative difficulty of attaining higher price-cost margins rises, the response to negative cost structures becomes increasingly dominated by firm exit, rather than building up advertising outlays. Both these effects contribute to a drop in advertising intensity at the industry level within higher stages of concentration. This result is singularly robust in that it equally arises through alternative channels, according to different fundamentals (exogenous or endogenous sunk cost parameters) that may independently prompt changes in concentration levels, each of them with distinct effects on perceived quality and price-cost margins. In addition, unlike Greer (1971) and the subsequent literature he inspired, declining advertising intensities do not require here any collusive arguments, emerging rather from the free operation of market forces. This is an important point, the more so given the uncertain evidence regarding the actual prevalence of collusion in advertising driven industries. If anything, this behavior would only serve to reinforce the quadratic nature of the relation just described. The model also suggests a simple tool to appraise the ratio of operational profits and advertising cost elasticities using observable variables. These consist of a simple ratio of advertising outlays to a per period measure of fixed operational costs. At a dynamic level, the findings are worth noting as well. Higher advertising costs under partial equilibrium compress price-cost margins and push firms out of the market, increasing concentration levels. However, that is not necessarily the case when general equilibrium mechanisms are taken into account. As market power is reduced, aggregate demand and final production increase. This enables more intermediate producers to break even and pushes down capital rates of return in the economy. Accordingly, households save less and reallocate more expenditures to the current period, expanding market capacity for each value of firm level advertising. Under a non-decreasing ratio of operational profits and advertising cost elasticities, this effect may reverse the original market concentration outcome and, consequently, its own relation to advertising intensity. Even when that is not the case, the market scaling derived from endogenous adjustments in consumption timing is still enough to skew the curve linking advertising to concentration. In general terms, this illustrates how the evolution of this locus may be determined by more than industry specific factors. The rest of the paper is organized in the following manner. Section 2 describes the theoretical model. Section 3 examines how sunk costs affect market concentration and advertising, as well as the general equilibrium links between these variables. Section 4 explores in more detail the relation between advertising intensity and market concentration. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",2

Keeley (1990), Hellmann et al. (2000) and Repullo (2004), among many others, argue that high competition in the deposit market reduces a bank’s incentives for prudent behavior through the reduction of a bank’s expected profits. A plethora of measures thus have been adopted by the prudential regulators to promote safety of the banking systems in the developed and emerging economies. Following the recommendations of Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, different forms of minimum capital requirement and deposit rate ceiling, or a combination of both (Hellmann et al. 2000; Repullo 2004) are applied in order to curb banks’ incentives for risk taking. On the other hand, deposit insurance is in use to enhance depositors’ confidence and prevent systemic financial crises (Diamond and Dybvig 1983). The main purposes of this paper are to analyze the nature of the association between market power and bank risk taking when banks compete in a monopolistically competitive deposit market, and then exploit such association to study the effects of bank mergers and deposit insurance on the risk taking behavior. To this end, we analyze a model of locational competition à la (Salop 1979). Banks collect deposits from the potential depositors by offering deposit rates and invest their total funds (deposits plus equity capital) either in a prudent or a gambling asset, and the depositors incur a per unit transport cost to travel to a bank in order to deposit their funds.Footnote 1 No bank can commit to the choice of the degree of investment risk (safe or risky) since this decision is taken after the depositors have deposited their funds. In our model, risk neutral banks are subject to limited liability. The gambling asset offers an expected return lower than that of the prudent asset, but has a higher return if it succeeds. The above characteristics of the assets make the banks prone to choose a risky investment which creates a moral hazard problem at the bank level. We show that in equilibrium there is a negative association between market power and bank risk taking. The intermediation margin of the banks is increasing in the ratio of the transport cost to the number of banks. Hence, as in Salop (1979), we use the transport cost relative to the number of banks as the measure of market power. For very low levels of market power, an equilibrium emerges in which all banks invest in the gambling asset offering a high deposit rate. If market power is very high, then a gambling equilibrium ceases to exist, and the banks invest in the prudent asset and offer a lower deposit rate, which is referred to as a  prudent equilibrium. For an intermediate level of market power, both of the aforesaid equilibria exist. We also analyze the effect of bank merger on the equilibrium risk taking. Merger between banks increases banks’ intermediation margin and makes gambling less likely. In other words, merger can be viewed as a substitute for prudential regulation that aims at guaranteeing financial stability. Finally, we study the effect of the introduction of a deposit insurance scheme on the equilibrium of the banking sector.Footnote 2
Diamond and Dybvig (1983) argue that deposit insurance serves to protect the depositors in face of bank failure and to enhance depositors’ confidence that prevents bank runs. We show that, when per unit insurance premium is low, such a scheme exacerbate the risk-enhancing moral hazard problem by making gambling by the banks more likely which conforms to a number of empirical findings. The negative association between market power and bank risk taking has been established, among many others, by Matutes and Vives (1996) and Repullo (2004). Our work is similar to that of Repullo who considers a dynamic model of banking based on spatial competition à la Salop (1979) with insured depositors to show that for very low level of market power, low intermediation margins reduce banks’ franchise value and induce banks invest only in the gambling asset. Our model differs from Repullo (2004) in the following aspects. We consider a model of static bank competition. We believe this to be adequate in order to analyze the effects of market power since, in the long run, free entry washes away monopoly rents that the banks enjoy in the short run. Hellmann et al. (2000) consider a model of bank competition to argue that a minimum capital requirement alone cannot serve as an effective prudential regulatory instrument, and this has to be combined with a deposit rate ceiling in order that efficiency can be achieved. Repullo (2004) shows that a risk-based capital requirement can undermine banks’ incentive for risk taking and promote safety. Our model also retains similarity with the work of Matutes and Vives (1996), which considers a model of bank competition where depositors have beliefs about the probability of failure of the banks, and banks can choose to invest in different assets with different degrees of riskiness that depends on the market share of each bank. It is the presence of depositors’ beliefs what generates consistency requirements that should be fulfilled in any equilibrium. Our model also imposes similar consistency requirements on the equilibria. Since we avoid the complexity added by the existence of such beliefs, these requirements boil down to a no gambling condition requiring that if a bank makes its clients believe that it is going to invest in the prudent asset, in equilibrium it indeed does so. In a seminal paper, Boyd and De Nicolo (2005) suggest that the above mentioned negative relationship between market power and risk taking can be reversed if one considers simultaneous interaction between the deposit and the loan markets in which the borrowers, rather than the banks, choose the riskiness of a bank’s investment. In an extension of the basic model we also introduce a loan market where the borrowers choose the investment strategy. The main difference of our model with that of Boyd and De Nicolo (2005) is that these authors consider homogeneous competition in both the deposit and the loan markets, whereas in the present context competition in these markets are heterogeneous. We show that higher market power of the banks in the loan markets induces more risk taking, but this behaviour does not depend on the market power the banks enjoy in the deposit market. The paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2 we describe the basic model with uninsured deposits. The following section describes and characterizes the equilibrium of the banking sector, and studies the effect of market power on social welfare. Section 4 analyses the effects of bank merger and deposit insurance on the banks’ risk taking behavior. Finally, in Sect. 5 we analyze the effects of loan contracts on risk taking. The paper concludes in Sect. 6. Proofs of our main results are presented in the appendices.",7

Coniglio,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"For the readers the journey starts with an analytical framework for modelling individual (or family) migration over the life cycle (Kennan and Walker, Chap. 2). Based on previous studies conducted by the authors, the chapter provides an effective tool for understanding the forces shaping the dynamics of migration over time and across multiple destinations. Unfortunately, a wide applicability of the framework developed is, at least at the moment, constrained by the lack of individuals’ life cycle information in most datasets currently available. Chapter 3, by Constant and Zimmermann, contains an excellent survey on the economics and policy of the—rather broad—‘circular migration’ category. The authors emphasise potential benefits and costs of circular migration for all the parties involved (sending and receiving countries, immigrants and their families) and discuss how policies that try to regulate, or even stop, circularity might often backfire (as in the case of US and Germany). In Chapter 4, Grignon, Owusu and Sweetman look at the international migration of a particularly important type of workers, i.e. health professionals. A greater emphasis is placed—contrarily to the bulk of existing studies—on the relatively less investigated perspective of developed countries. Vulnerability of migrants is the common thread of the following two chapters. Edmonds and Shrestha (Chap. 5) focus on independent child labour migrants, while Friebel and Guriev (Chap. 6) address the issue of human smuggling. Both contributions provide a comprehensive summary of the existing studies and a rich set of considerations on future research priorities.",

Cotten,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"There is often a sizable gap between the predictions of traditional theory and the way people actually behave. Individuals cheat on their taxes less (Andreoni et al. 1998), free-ride less (Ledyard 1995; Chaudhuri 2011; Vesterlund 2012) and divide wealth more evenly (Blanco et al. 2011; Bolton et al. 1998) than would be optimal if each were the self-interested agent often postulated.Footnote 1 However, these observations can be explained by relaxing the assumption that individuals are purely self-interested. Indeed, the seminal works by Fehr and Schmidt (1999) and Bolton and Ockenfels (2000) have shown that much of this seemingly anomalous behavior is consistent with individuals who have social or other-regarding preferences (ORP).Footnote 2
 There is also experimental evidence that other-regarding preferences toward consumers can affect competition. In a meta-analysis of oligopoly experiments Engel concludes that “[w]hen subjects know that they are playing against human buyers, collusion rates plummet” (2007, p. 537). One possible explanation for this finding is that managers have social preferences toward human buyers that are effectively turned off when the demand side of the market is computerized.Footnote 3
 In this paper, we theoretically investigate the implications of other-regarding preferences on price competition and tacit collusion. The firms in our model are run by managers who derive utility from consumer welfare as well as their own individual financial gain. One might interpret the managers as having a conscience since they receive disutility when consumers are harmed by high prices.Footnote 4 We find that collusion is less likely with other-regarding managers, and that these managers will collude at lower prices than managers who are purely self-interested. As such, we provide a formal explanation for Engel’s (2007) observation that experimental collusion rates are lower when buyers are human. Our analysis also yields results that are contrary to standard thinking about tacit collusion. For example, managers with other-regarding preferences must be compensated with a sufficiently large share of profits in order for collusion to be sustained.Footnote 5 In fact, the managers’ optimal collusive price is increasing in their share of profits. Managerial profit sharing can thus function as a facilitating practice, inducing collusion by overriding the managers’ concern for consumers.Footnote 6
 We also find that a reduction in the number of firms can harm consumers even if the firms are already tacitly colluding. While it is well-known that increases in market concentration can harm consumers either through a lessening of competition (unilateral effects) or by making it easier for firms to coordinate their actions (coordinated effects), our results suggest another channel through which increased concentration can raise prices. In particular, we demonstrate that with other-regarding managers the optimal collusive price is decreasing in the number of firms. Hence, increases in industry concentration may increase not only the risk of collusion, but also the harm when collusion is sustained. Our broader perspective on managerial behavior positions our work at the intersection of multiple literatures. First, there is a rich body of research examining the factors that affect collusion in product marketsFootnote 7. We add to this literature by demonstrating that the preferences of managers toward others can be an important element in sustaining collusion, a factor that has generally been ignored. In doing so, we also contribute to the literature exploring the implications of other-regarding preferences on both market outcomesFootnote 8 and cooperation.Footnote 9
 Perhaps closest to our work are papers that allow firms to have preferences over profits and total industry output, which is a proxy for consumer welfare. Willner (2013), for example, studies competition in a static oligopoly with an altruistic firm in the presence of an agency problem.Footnote 10 He finds that, contrary to earlier findings, social welfare increases with the degree of altruism. Philipson and Posner (2009), discuss antitrust policy in the not-for-profit sector arguing “that the main efficiency rationale for applying antitrust law to FP [for profit] firms ...is equally applicable to NFP [not-for-profit] firms... [e]ven when producers care about the welfare of consumers rather than just about their own profits” (page 2). While Philipson and Posner (2009) do consider collusive behavior among non-for-profit firms, they do not consider the sustainability of collusion as we do here. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 sets up the model. Section 3 analyzes the model and presents the results. Section 4 provides a discussion of our analysis, and Sect. 5 concludes the paper. Technical proofs of the results are in the Appendix.",1

Problematically, most studies subsequent to Aghion and Howitt (1998) seminal contribution assume linear utility or a constant exogenous savings rate for model simplification purposes, e.g., Acemoglu et al. (2006), Aghion and Howitt (1998, Ch. 3), Cozzi (2005), Cozzi and Spinesi (2006), Howitt (1998), Howitt (1999), Howitt (2000), Howitt and Mayer-Foulkes (2005), Minniti (2010), Segerstrom (2000), and Vandenbussche et al. (2006). Further, while some studies do analyze an extended version of Aghion and Howitt’s (1998, Ch. 3) model under CRRA preferences, e.g., Howitt and Aghion (1998), Zeng (2003), and Zeng and Zhang (2002), they primarily focus on the steady-state analysis. Hence, we investigate a transition of the more general form of the Aghion and Howitt (1998, Ch. 3) economy.Footnote 1 In doing so, we find that their model produces three cases of the evolution of an economy if the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is sufficiently low, as discussed below. We analyze Aghion and Howitt’s (1998, Ch. 3) model in the situation where unskilled labor can be used in the final good sector and skilled labor can be used in both the intermediate good (manufacturing) and research sector. We find that if the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is sufficiently low, we are able to discern three patterns concerning the evolution of wage inequality.Footnote 2 These are: (a) skill-biased technological change, i.e., technological progress leads to a widening of wage inequality; (b) unskill-biased technological change, i.e., technological progress leads to a contraction of wage inequality; and (c) unbiased technological change, i.e., technological progress is independent of wage inequality. Further, we find that these patterns of evolution depend on the productivity of the research sector. First, if research productivity is sufficiently high, (a) skill-biased technological change will characterize the economy. In this case, skilled labor over time tends to find employment in the research sector. In other words, the rate of creative destruction (rate of innovation) increases over time. This leads to growth in wage inequality. Second, consider the case where research productivity is sufficiently low to characterize (b) unskill-biased technological change. In this case, both creative destruction and wage inequality contract over time. Finally, if research productivity has a specific value, that is, the knife-edge case, both creative destruction and wage inequality remain constant, even though the economy is out of the steady state. This coincides with the case of (c) unbiased technological change. Under these transition patterns in Aghion and Howitt’s (1998, Ch. 3) economy, we successfully account for the shift in the trend of wage inequality in the US economy that begins in the 1970s. According to Van Reenen (2011), wage inequality during this period is U-shaped, with a decrease in wage inequality from the mid-1930s to the mid-1950s, followed by relative stability until the 1970s, and thereafter increases in wage inequality up until the mid-2000s. Conducting comparative dynamics of an unexpected permanent increase in research productivity in any research sector, which we interpret as the arrival of new general purpose technologies (GPTs),Footnote 3 our model successfully characterizes the U-shaped evolution of wage inequality previously observed in the US. We suppose that an economy characterizes the contraction of wage inequality at first, as observed in the US during the period from the mid-1930s to the 1970s. Under these circumstances, we show that the arrival of new GPTs in the 1970s, i.e., the information technology (IT) revolution, caused an instantaneous widening of wage inequality at the same time as the wage rate for skilled (unskilled) labor increased (decreased) because of the increase in research productivity. Afterwards, wage inequality gradually increased, with the wages of both skilled labor and unskilled labor continuing to increase over time. Consequently, we find the IT revolution entirely changed the central property of technological change from dynamically unskill-biased to skill-biased. Our paper relates to earlier studies that also investigate why wage inequality expanded after the 1970s in the US, even though the relative supply of skilled labor increased during the period. The implication is that the relative demand for skilled labor increased more rapidly than the relative supply of skilled labor. Under these circumstances, many studies have analyzed why the relative demand for skilled labor increased after the 1970s. However, our results differ from these studies in at least two respects. First, we derive the condition where the transition of wage inequality expands or contracts. In contrast, existing studies focus on the condition where wage inequality expands or contracts in the steady state. For instance, Acemoglu (1998, 2002) argues that the larger relative supply of skilled labor in the 1970s induced innovation in skill-biased technology, which led to an increase in the steady-state level of wage inequality, but only if the elasticity of substitution between skill-intensive goods and unskill-intensive goods was sufficiently large. Similarly, Nahuis and Smulders (2002) derive the condition where the steady-state level of wage inequality expands following increases in the supply of skilled labor, but only where the appropriability of the returns to research activity is significant. Second, our model theoretically explains the location of the bottom of the U-shaped wage inequality curve in the 1960s. We explain this using the productivity of the research sector given the arrival of new GPTs. In contrast, most preceding studies focus only on the widening of wage inequality after the 1970s, although Jacobs and Nahuis (2002), and Nahuis (2004) also analyze the effect of GPTs on wage inequality, as here. For the most part, they conclude that the arrival of IT accounted for a widening of wage inequality because skilled labor had a comparative advantage in dealing with GPTs. This closely relates to our result. However, we additionally conclude that GPT can successfully account for the shift in the trend of historical wage evolution begun in the 1970s, i.e. U-shaped wage inequality.Footnote 4 Specifically, our model characterizes the growth of wage inequality in a transition following a major surge in research productivity, even though the model produces the negative growth of wage inequality before the positive productivity shock. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the general equilibrium model in Aghion and Howitt (1998, Ch. 3). Section 3 analyzes the dynamic equilibrium in which there are three patterns of the evolution of an economy equipped with both types of factor-biased technological change. Section 4 investigates the impact of new GPTs in the model by comparing the results from the model with the empirical facts. Section 5 concludes.",3

An early study conducted by Kuznets (1955, 1963) presented the hypothesis that income inequality initially increases, and subsequently decreases, with economic development.Footnote 1 Following Kuznets, many studies have investigated the relation between income distribution and growth (e.g., Alesina and Rodrik 1994; Bertola 1993; Galor and Zeira 1993; Perotti 1993, 1996; Persson and Tabellini 1994).Footnote 2 In the 1990s, through these theoretical and empirical studies, a broad consensus was formed that inequality can be negatively associated with economic growth. Several empirical studies have produced countervailing evidence against this consensus (e.g., Baliscan and Fuwa 2003; Barro 2000; Deininger and Squire 1998; Forbes 2000; Li and Zou 1998). These studies appealed to empirical evidence such as a non-robust or positive relation between economic growth and inequality found in rich countries as reasons to challenge the consensus. However, subsequent empirical research has pointed out various methodological and data problems in these studies and have revealed a negative relation between inequality and economic growth (e.g., Knowles 2005; Rehme 1999, 2000, 2003a, b). One key to answering this complicated question regarding the relation between inequality and economic growth is found in the nonlinearity of those relations. Indeed, some theoretical studies have presented a nonlinear relation between inequality and economic growth, thereby contributing to the clarification of the issues over empirical findings (e.g., Corneo and Jeanne 1999; Rehme 2007; Tamai 2009).Footnote 3 However, these works did not specifically examine the role of a pure redistributive transfer in the relation between inequality and economic growth. In this paper, we examine the relation between endogenous redistributive policy, wealth inequality, and economic growth in an endogenous growth model with heterogeneous wealth endowment.Footnote 4 The shape of pre-tax wealth distribution might play an important role in determining an endogenous redistributive policy. Moreover, an endogenous redistributive policy might affect the shape of post-tax wealth distribution. Both the shape of wealth distribution and of an endogenous redistributive policy influence the equilibrium growth rate. Consequently, the endogenous redistributive policy links wealth distribution to economic growth. We focus on two endogenous redistributive policies: one is based on the max–min social objective (Rawlsian social welfare) and another is based on majority-voting. The former case is often taken to represent the social optimum under egalitarianism. See for example, Okuno and Yakita (1981). However, that assumption is not without problems as shown by, for example, Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980, Ch.11), and Rehme (1999, 2003b). In this paper, I follow the broad belief that the two objectives are equivalent and assume that the Rawlsian objective indeed represents a (comparatively more) egalitarian welfare criterion. The latter case portrays a natural representation of the realistic determination process of redistributive policy and fits into the existing literature such as that of Alesina and Rodrik (1994), Persson and Tabellini (1994), and subsequent studies. Making a comparison between two regimes clarifies an important influence of redistributive policy on the link between inequality and growth. In our model, wealth inequality is evaluated using the Gini coefficient of pre-tax wealth distribution or post-tax wealth distribution. Then, a Rawlsian redistributive policy generates a negative relation between post-tax inequality and growth. Nevertheless, the possibility of an inverted-U relation between post-tax inequality and growth exists in the case of majority voting. The difference of criteria for policy-making causes a different response of redistributive tax to the condition of wealth inequality. Thus different relations arise between inequality and growth through redistributive taxation. Median household’s behavior is affected by a structural change in pre-tax wealth distribution less than the behavior of the poorest household. If the poorest household preference is reflected in a redistributive policy, then the link between the pre-tax and post-tax Gini is monotonic because they benefit from redistributive taxation. However, the link between pre-tax and post-tax Gini is not monotonic under majority voting because the benefit from a redistributive policy is weakened by the negative growth effect of redistributive taxation, which is greater on the poorest households. Consequently, an endogenous redistributive policy plays a key role in determining the relation between inequality and growth. This paper provides a theoretical explanation that complements some recent studies by analyzing the links between endogenous redistributive policies and economic growth. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents a description of our model, solves the model, and characterizes the equilibrium dynamics. Section 3 examines the Rawlsian redistributive policy and the redistributive policy through majority voting; it also examines the growth effects of exogenous shocks through redistributive taxation. Section 4 analyzes the relation between wealth distribution and economic growth. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes this paper.",3
115.0,2.0,Journal of Economics,19 July 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-014-0411-7,Entrepreneurial finance and economic growth,June 2015,Paolo E. Giordani,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The process of innovation in capitalistic economies is fraught with several market frictions and failures. The most commonly known source of failure is the so-called problem of “appropriability”, first clearly stated by Arrow (1962). Since a new idea has a non-rivalrous nature, some form of intellectual property rights may be necessary to provide inventors with the right incentives to spend time and resources in the discovery process. A second, and probably less extensively investigated, source of market failure is concerned with the process of financing innovation, that is, with the problem for the innovator of gathering enough funds to finance her entrepreneurial venture. This paper focuses on this second issue. Both microeconomic theory and empirical evidence have long recognized the potential obstacles hidden in the process of financing innovation, suggesting that inventors may be financially constrained.Footnote 1 Theoretical arguments, proposed to explain financial market imperfections in the innovation sector, range from transaction costs and tax advantages to agency costs due to informational asymmetries between the innovator (agent) and the financier (principal). While these aspects are common to any financing relationship, a number of additional elements suggest that frictions can be even more severe for innovative investments. First, innovations are “unique” events, and the process aimed at producing them is an uncertain and largely unpredictable economic activity (Cozzi and Giordani 2011). Secondly, as most of the R&D expenditure is on intangible assets (such as scientists’ wages), this expenditure provides bad collateral for the financier (Almeida and Campello 2004). Finally, a quality-signaling strategy, which could be used to attenuate the problem of asymmetric information between the entrepreneur and the financier, is hardly implementable in the market of innovation: inventors may be reluctant to signal the quality of their own project, as they may reasonably fear that competitors steal their new idea (Bhattacharya and Ritter 1983). On the other hand, macroeconomic literature, and in particular endogenous innovation-driven growth theory, usually abstract from the problem of financing innovation (see for instance, Romer (1990); Aghion and Howitt (1992); Grossman and Helpman (1991a, b) and subsequent developments). In such models, a frictionless financial market exists that channels resources from savers to the R&D process, revealing the true value of each innovation. The process of innovation is depicted as a routinized and essentially predictable process. This paper casts a bridge between these two streams of literature. It develops an endogenous growth model where the financing process of innovation is characterized by market frictions, and it analyzes the welfare implications of these frictions. In particular, we construct a scale-free endogenous growth model with horizontal innovation (Romer 1990; Grossman and Helpman 1991b; Jones 1995a, b). The economy is characterized by three sectors: (1) a final good sector, in which a final good is produced competitively employing labor and an array of intermediate goods; (2) an intermediate good sector, in which each intermediate good is produced and sold by a monopolistic firm, and (3) an “industry of new ideas”, which employs labor to introduce new varieties of intermediate goods. Technological progress is embodied by the increase in the number of intermediate good varieties introduced into the market. The peculiarity of our growth model lies in the way technological progress occurs: a new intermediate variety is the outcome of a successful process of search and matching between entrepreneurs (or innovators), who come up with new ideas and capitalists (or financiers), who select what they believe are the most promising ideas and help launch them in the market. In particular, entrepreneurs and financiers meet pairwise and, once a successful matching has occurred, they bargain over the distribution of the monopoly rents associated with the “discovery” of the new intermediate good variety. The model studies the occupational choice of economic agents. Agents have to decide whether to work in the final good sector or in the “industry of ideas”. In this last case, they can choose to devote their time to come up with a new idea, and hence to become entrepreneurs. Alternatively, they may opt for screening and selecting the most valuable ideas deserving financial funds, in which case they become capitalists. We find the employment allocation across the three occupational possibilities of this economy along the balanced growth path: manufacturing, entrepreneurial and capitalistic activities. This allocation is found by imposing that, at equilibrium, the expected returns from each of these activities be identical. We show that the financial market for innovation is characterized by a complementary relationship between entrepreneurs and financiers, in that the number of entrepreneurs is increasing in the number of financiers, and viceversa. The intuition for this result is straightforward: a higher number of financiers simply raises the entrepreneur’s chance of having her own project being selected and financed, and thus it raises the incentive to become entrepreneur, and viceversa. Because of this thick market externality, we cannot exclude the possibility that the economy admits multiple stationary equilibria. The equilibrium employment allocation is then compared to the optimal allocation obtained through the welfare analysis. The amount of total labor resources that the market allocates to entrepreneurial innovation is sub-optimal and, moreover, it is inefficiently distributed between entrepreneurs and capitalists. In particular, in addition to the usual externalities associated with the class of horizontal innovation models à la (Romer 1990), our model allows us to evaluate the welfare effects of the search frictions in the market for innovation. As we will clarifly in Sect. 5, the occupational choice of each economic agent affects the payoff and the choice of all other agents. In particular, the entry of an entrepreneur stimulates the entry of capitalists (“easy matching effect”) and discourages the entry of additional entrepreneurs (“stepping on toes effect”), and a symmetric reasoning applies to the entry of a capitalist. Moroever, the fact that the allocation of the monopoly rents is made according to a Nash bargaining process between entrepreneurs and financiers introduces an additional source of frictions: the bargaining power of each agent does not necessarily reflect their marginal productivity in the innovation process. The overall effect on the market of innovation, which is not internalized by either entrepreneurs or capitalists when making their choices, may be positive or negative. As a result, total market-driven innovative efforts may be higher or lower than optimal. The existence of these external effects is an additional reason for the policy maker to intervene in the innovation sector. The modeling strategy that we follow in this paper is meant to capture some salient features of the financial market for innovation. In the words of (Phelps 2009, p. 50), “the classical supply-and-demand apparatus does not apply to the core market of capitalist economies—the capital market, particularly the market for capital going to entrepreneurs’ innovative projects”. It takes time and resources for an entrepreneur to find and convince a financier about the profitability of her business venture. At the same time, it takes time and resources for a financier to find the innovative project that she believes is worth financing. The financial market for innovation is then, probably, better represented as a decentralized market where heterogeneous entrepreneurs and financiers meet bilaterally according to a matching technology. Again in the words of (Phelps 2009, p. 52), “the capital market is a sort of matching process that matches a financier to an entrepreneur who the former sees as having a model compatible with his own model”. The search and matching process is a modeling tool that allows us to represent succintly all frictions characterizing the process of financing innovation—such as information imperfections, or the entrepreneurs’ and capitalists’ heterogeneities in skills, location, beliefs etc.Footnote 2
 This representation of the financing relationship is also especially apt to describe the practical functioning of the modern venture capital (VC) industry, where a financed entreprenerial project is the result of a meeting between an entrepreneur submitting her business plan, and a VC fund that is expected to bring managerial and/or technical expertise together with financial investments (see for instance Gompers and Lerner (1999)). Venture capital is a relatively novel model of innovation financing, and it complements the more traditional, corporate R&D model. A debate is open as to whether entrepreneurial finance is going to replace corporate R&D as the new standard of financing innovation. On the one hand, the former still represents a tiny fraction of the latter (Lerner 2010). On the other hand, evidence suggests that entrepreneurial investments are growing faster and are more productive than R&D investments.Footnote 3 Moreover, they are disproportianately concentrated in the most innovative industries (ICT, biotechnology and, more recently, energy and environment). Our model can be interpreted as a first attempt to introduce, into an endogenous growth model, a role for the venture capital sector as the engine of economic growth. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 further discusses the related literature. Section 3 describes the model, while Sect. 4 characterizes the balanced growth path(s) of the economy and carries out the comparative statics analysis. Section 5 carries out the welfare analysis and discusses the policy implications. Section 6 concludes with a few remarks.",12

Therefore, it is crucial to understand its determinants. Competition and innovation are intimately connected. This relation is twofold. On the one hand incentives to innovate are driven by the competitive situation. On the other hand successful innovations affect and thus change the market structure. The link between product market competition and innovation has been studied for a long time. The classic contributions of Schumpeter and Arrow shaped the corresponding polar positions of competition hindering innovation (often attributed to Schumpeter) on the one hand and competition spurring innovation (often attributed to Arrow) on the other hand.Footnote 1 Research on this issue deals with the fundamental question whether higher intensity of competition leads to higher or lower innovative efforts by each firm. In addition to the question whether incentives to innovate are increasing or decreasing with more intense market competition the question on the endogenous evolution of the market is to be addressed. Leaving aside changes in the number of firms (due to entry, exit or mergers and acquisitions), this reduces to the question on the evolution of differences between incumbent firms. Is one firm becoming more and more efficient leaving other firms behind or do we see neck-and-neck competition? Casual observations and empirical evidence suggest a process of action-reaction in markets, i.e., market leadership is constantly changing hands. In theoretical analyses different modeling strategies lead to widely differing conclusions.Footnote 2
 However, most of this literature seems to leave out some important aspects. It neglects that past experience in R&D usually has an impact on current success. Considering only one innovation project or several projects separately omits the fact that a level of technological competence may be valuable for following projects. On the one hand, the success in preceding projects helps in securing income. Beyond that, the pure experience of these projects improves performance in other projects. This is due to experience, learning-by-doing, users’ feedback etc. Our approach tries to identify the effect of experience in R&D in a stylized model designed to capture the essentials of the problem. We develop a dynamic model with history dependency. History affects market opportunities, i.e., previous actions and outcomes determine the range of available actions and outcomes. This is modeled in a way that a firm’s investment in R&D does not only increase the chance of making a discovery, but additionally increases the R&D knowledge stock.Footnote 3 This knowledge stock is a measure of firm’s past R&D effort and allows modeling learning, i.e., firm’s past experiences add to its current capabilities, and organizational forgetting in R&D.Footnote 4 Learning-by-doing has been observed in many empirical works.Footnote 5 In practice learning may occur when the innovation activities of a firm are adjusted due to past experiences or when innovation projects are cumulative, i.e., sequential and building on each other. An example would be an investment in laboratory equipment which could be used for other than the current project or gained experience of the researchers. Organizational forgetting in R&D on the other hand is a phenomenon that has been shown in more recent studies and is also crucial for R&D.Footnote 6 Sticking to the idea of knowledge capturing the experience of the workers, organizational forgetting would be the result of turnover and layoffs. When there is organizational forgetting, a firm’s accumulated knowledge depreciates over time. As described, firms’ continuous investment in R&D creates the permanent possibility of a successful innovation. These innovations come in successive steps, i.e., a step has to be completed to proceed. Due to the “step-by-step” innovations a technological laggard must first catch up with the leading-edge technology before battling for technological leadership in the future. This in turn implies that if we do not see a process of increasing dominance then every once in a while competition will be neck-and-neck and therefore the escape competition effect will be strongest.Footnote 7 With respect to the product market, we assume the industry to be characterized by a duopoly where firms are competing in prices. The incumbent firms simultaneously engage in R&D in order to decrease their relative costs. The main research focus of the model where history and dynamics are essential is the effect of experience on the firms’ incentives to invest in innovation activities. How does this effect influence the evolution of market structure over time? What are the effects of competition in innovation on market structure? Does one firm become increasingly dominant by being more successful in R&D, i.e., do we see a process of increasing dominance, or is there a process of action reaction, in which market leadership is constantly changing hands? Above all we wish to discover when competition in innovation is most intense. Starting with the benchmark case without learning we show that relaxing the usual assumption of imposing imitation adds strategic effects. Usually it is assumed that the follower at least catches up with the frontier technology with one successful innovation. Without this exogenous possibility of immediate imitation the leader’s R&D effort is increasing with the lead while the laggard’s effort is decreasing. The industry’s leader is trying to avoid competition in the future while the reduced prospect of moving ahead diminishes incentives for the follower. Nevertheless, leaders always invest less and hence a process of action reaction results. Allowing for knowledge accumulation via learning-by-doing adds another effect. If one firm has accumulated enough knowledge, its chances to successfully innovate are increased and therefore further R&D effort is less rewarding. The leading firm can afford to rest on its laurels and hence, in steady state the firm invests less the higher the technological lead. The knowledge effect outweighs the increased incentive for the leader to innovate in order to avoid competition. This may induce the follower to catch up. With respect to product market competition our findings are in line with Arrow’s position of competition spurring innovation. In our framework we clearly find that due to the effect of knowledge accumulation the incentives to perform R&D are increasing with the intensity of competition. As mentioned earlier, the relation between competition and innovation has been studied for decades and hence literature on this issue is very extensive. However, neither theoretical nor empirical research has led to a clear result on this link. In empirical literature some support for the theory that predictions are highly specific to characteristics of innovations and the mechanism to protect the value created by new technologies can be found. One reason why empirical studies have not generated clear conclusions about the relationship might be a failure of many of these studies to account for different market and technological conditions (see for example Cohen and Levin 1989 and Gilbert 2006, for surveys). We will discuss this issue in the lights of the results of our model in the respective sections. Regarding economic theory, in addition to Sutton’s work on industrial market structure (Sutton 1991, 1998, 2007), the voluminous literature dealing with static models (see for example Vives 2008; Belleflamme and Vergari 2011 and Bondt and Vandekerckhove 2012 for important recent advances), this paper is especially related to the literature on dynamic evolution of oligopoly.Footnote 8
Budd et al. (1993) present a work that analyzes whether the gap between two firms in a model of dynamic competition tends to increase or decrease. While modeling the gap in terms of an abstract (bounded) state of competition parameter without modeling the product market explicitly they find that the gap tends to evolve into the direction where joint payoffs are greater. This most often results in a process of increasing dominance. Cabral and Riordan (1994) provide further indications of increasing dominance. Segal and Whinston (2007) study the effects of antitrust in a dynamic R&D model based on “winner-take-all” competition. Denicolò and Zanchettin (2012) develop a model of leapfrogging where an incumbent competes against potential entrants in a sequence of patent races. Due to the replacement effect the leaders’ share in total R&D as well as the size of their lead decreases within each leadership cycle. Articles analyzing industry evolution when there is learning-by-doing like Dasgupta and Stiglitz (1988) and Cabral and Riordan (1994, 1997) usually simply model cost reduction as a function of output decisions.Footnote 9 Basically, firms learn by producing not by researching and developing. That means it becomes less costly for the leader to gain higher profits as the lead widens. With this way of modeling R&D is complementary with production. Besides, organizational forgetting cannot be modeled in these frameworks. Our work is also related to the literature on patent races (see Reinganum 1989, for an early summary). Due to the endpoint that players are aiming for, usually the property of increasing dominance results. This characteristic remains in multistage race models, where several stages are introduced into a patent race, as there is still a definite end.Footnote 10 To the best of our knowledge Doraszelski (2003) was the first to introducing knowledge accumulation into patent races. However, his model builds on a patent race à la Reinganum (1989) where the firm that makes the innovation first is awarded a patent of positive value and the game ends. Hence, product market competition is not modeled and questions concerning the relation of competition and innovation cannot be addressed. Additionally, the game cannot be solved analytically. In contrast, we model step-by-step innovation and product market competition. Thus, there is no endpoint firms are aiming for and a successful innovation always enhances the firms’ market position such that innovation incentives are driven by the way that firms’ profits rise and fall as competition evolves. The aim of this analysis is to gain insights into the forces at work in the general case where profits vary with the state of competition. Regarding dynamic step-by-step innovation, our work is most closely related to and extends the works of Aghion et al. (2001) and Acemoglu and Akcigit (2012). Although our model builds on these papers, it also differs from them in significant ways. Most importantly, our main research regards the effect of experience in R&D. Therefore, we extend the model to learning-by-doing and organizational forgetting. Besides, we do not imply the strong assumptions on imitation as Aghion et al. (2001) and Acemoglu and Akcigit (2012). These authors assume the follower at least catches up with the frontier technology with one successful innovation.Footnote 11 Thus, in contrast to our model strategic incentives to perform R&D are absent. Acemoglu and Akcigit (2012) show numerically, based on the model of Aghion et al. (2001), that optimal intellectual property rights policy provides more protection to firms that are technologically more advanced as this policy strengthens the escape competition effect. Obviously, R&D by firms that are sufficiently ahead is encouraged just as well as effort by companies with a limited lead because of their prospect of reaching levels of gaps associated with higher protection. That is to say, the effect of avoiding competition that is absent in the basic model is introduced by means of intellectual property rights policy. Based on the work of Aghion et al. (2001), (2005) analyze the relationship between product market competition and innovation. However, they only allow for two possible states (one step behind and neck-to-neck). In a related work Hörner (2004) develops a model allowing a firm to be an arbitrary number of steps ahead or behind. His contribution and the effect of a firm being sufficiently far ahead suggests that an analysis à la Aghion et al. (2005) with only two possible states leaves out some aspects. Unfortunately, Hörner does not model product market competition. Our work differs from all of the above papers as we consider the effects of learning-by-doing and organizational forgetting in R&D with firms competing on the product market. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the basic model. Section 3 provides an analysis of optimal R&D when accumulation of knowledge is not possible. In this section we also compare our result to the one of the related framework of Aghion et al. (2001). Section 4 analyzes the equilibrium R&D investment when the effect of knowledge accumulation is at place and compares it with the benchmark case without knowledge. Section 5 concludes while the appendix contains the proofs of the results stated in the text.",10
115.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,11 September 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-014-0417-1,Competing R&D joint ventures in Cournot oligopoly with spillovers,July 2015,Antonio Tesoriere,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"R&D cooperation has become increasingly important in the last 30 years, and is now a common means for organizing R&D in industries like IT, telecommunications, electronics, biotechnology, software, and chemicals (Hagerdoon 1996; Hagerdoon et al. 2000; Caloghirou et al. 2003). Underlying the vast literature on non cooperative vs. cooperative R&D is the claim that R&D cooperation may be beneficial for society for at least three reasons. First, it requires the integration of otherwise overlapping activities and hence encourages R&D efficiency at the industry level. In addition, it takes into account the direct (that is to say, non pecuniary) effects of individual research on the aggregate profit of the venture, which is positive under technological externalities. Finally, it may create synergies and hence provide firms with a superior R&D technology. A widely accepted and robust result is that for technological externalities above a threshold, R&D cooperation results in a larger level of R&D investment and a lower price in the product market than R&D competition. This point has been illustrated at length, but almost exclusively for the case in which R&D cooperation is represented by a unique, industry-wide R&D cartel (e.g., see d’Aspremont and Jacquemin 1998; Suzumura 1992; Kamien et al. 1992; Leahy and Neary 1997; Amir 2000; Amir et al. 2003, among many others).Footnote 1 Surprisingly, the case of R&D cartel competition has received very little attention in the literature. However, the observed pattern of R&D cartelization in many industries is very complex. Clodt et al. (2010) report that in the software industry of the late 90s, the top ten firms in terms of number of R&D agreements ranged from Microsoft, with 89 partnerships, to Oracle, with 25. Similarly, Gugler and Siebert (2007) report that between 1989 and 1999 there have been 244 R&D joint ventures in the semiconductors industry, with average number of participating firms of 2.99. Analogous evidence is found for other high tech industries. These networks of cooperative relations are typically centered on a few leading firms, which often are competitors at the R&D phase. An example of competition among R&D cooperatives in the early 80s is that between the research joint venture including Boeing, Mitsubishi, Kawasaki, and other firms, and the Airbus consortium. A more recent and often reported example is the competition between three consortiums of firms for the development of the HDTV system in the US.Footnote 2
 An important exception in the literature is the paper by Kamien and Zang (1993), which studies competing R&D cartels. In that paper, R&D cartels exploit cooperative synergies, in the sense that the spillover rate within an R&D cartel is \(1\), while that between R&D cartels is \( \theta \le 1\). This form of cooperation is often called Cartelized R&D Joint Venture (henceforth RJV). For the case of linear demand in the product market, Kamien and Zang show that effective R&D, and hence consumer surplus, is the highest under either the industry-wide RJV or exactly two competing RJV’s, depending on whether \(\theta \) is respectively larger or smaller than a threshold. To my knowledge, no other study has elaborated on this result,Footnote 3 and many important points that have been extensively analyzed for the case of industry-wide R&D cooperation remain open for that of R&D cartel competition. This paper considers a simple model of R&D where firms participate to competing R&D cartels and then compete in a Cournot market for an homogeneous good. It provides an evaluation of alternative cartel structures ranging from industry-wide cooperation to R&D competition in terms of R&D results, consumer surplus, industry profit, and social welfare. It also compares equilibrium and second best levels of R&D, and hence outlines the policy implications of the results. This paper extends Kamien and Zang in three directions. First, it adopts a relatively general demand function, using conditions from the recent theory of Cournot markets that weaken the usual assumption of linear demand in a substantial way (e.g., see Amir 1996; Vives 2001). This also allows to represent the results in terms of the negative of the slope of the reaction function at the equilibrium in the product market, \(\rho \), which is here interpreted as a measure of contestability of that market through R&D. Second, besides consumer surplus, the paper also considers a second best criterion of evaluation, wherein the level of R&D is set to maximize social welfare conditional on the subsequent Cournot equilibrium.Footnote 4 Social welfare accounts for an important source of welfare variation, arising from R&D duplication, which is often mentioned as a key determinant of R&D cooperation, but is ignored by the consumer surplus approach. Third, and relatedly, the paper studies the cases of both cooperative synergies and the lack of thereof, which is here interpreted in terms of R&D coordination between separate R&D labs. Finally, the paper extends the results in Kamien and Zang, providing conditions for ranking different cartel structures in terms of total profits and social welfare. The implications of R&D cartel competition depend both on the standard of evaluation and on whether there are synergies or not. For the case of no cooperative synergies, the equilibrium level of R&D investment and hence consumer surplus is monotone in the number of R&D cartels. It is maximized under industry-wide cooperation if the spillover rate is above a threshold level, which is decreasing in \(\rho \). On the other hand, equilibrium industry profit decreases as the number of R&D decision makers increases. Due to these possible competing effects of varying the number of competing cartels, the welfare rank of alternative cartel structures depends on the spillover rate. For the case of synergies, equilibrium consumer surplus is in general non monotone in the number of RJV’s. Provided this number is larger than two, consumer surplus is decreasing. However, consumer surplus is maximized by the industry-wide RJV only if the natural spillover rate is above a threshold level. This is an extension to the case of general demand of the result in Kamien and Zang mentioned above. A total profit and a social welfare comparison of different RJV structures is not immediate. The paper provides two sufficient conditions for industry profit and welfare to decrease with respect to the number of RJV’s. When the social planner can implement the desired number of R&D labs as well as the level of R&D activity, then the optimal R&D policy is to set a unique, joint R&D lab and then subsidize R&D accordingly. As discussed in Sect. 5, this result is not robust to relaxing the constraint of symmetric R&D profiles, in which case the optimal policy might deny access to R&D to a subset of firms. Relative to second best R&D, inefficiencies in terms of both under and overinvestment are possible, both with and without synergies. However, the cases in which equilibrium R&D is socially excessive are limited to low spillovers and a relatively large number of R&D cartels. This paper considers the effect of R&D cartel competition for a given cartel structure of the industry and hence ignores the issue of R&D cartel formation. Although firms in general participate to R&D agreements on a voluntary basis, the study of exogenous R&D cartels is important for at least two reasons. First, it is necessary to understand the incentives of candidate members to join a cartel and is hence preliminary to any study of endogenous agreements. Second, and more important, it provides a guidance to the antitrust treatment of R&D cooperation, which usually allows courts to directly affect the pattern of cartelization of the industry. While past guidelines have often explicitly suggested to block industry-wide cooperation in favour of smaller, competing projects, more recent decisions have favoured industry-wide arrangements (Grossman and Shapiro 1986),Footnote 5 and it is common opinion that the vast literature on the matter has contributed to this change. Besides Kamien and Zang, the analysis is also close to other studies of industry-wide R&D cooperation vs competition which this paper treats as special cases. Notably, the paper extends some of the results in Suzumura and Leahy and Neary (1997) to the case of R&D cartel competition. The model is described in Sect. 2. Sections 3 and 4 consider the case of no synergies and synergies, respectively. Section 5 considers the scope of application of the results. “Appendix” collects the proofs and derives some intermediate results invoked in the main text.",7

“What is worse than a monopoly? A chain of monopolies.” (Tirole 1988, p. 175) Paul Pollack, the CEO of the global corporation “Unilever”, implements a “sustainable living plan” (The Economist 2012, p. 68) into its firm mission to generate a sustainable profit in the long-run.Footnote 1 Critics of the shareholder value approach argue for a modern management which should concentrate on a broader company mission with additional goals like “customer satisfaction” (p. 68), instead of the exclusive concentration on (short-term) shareholder value. The trend toward more social actions by firms, which is very often summarized as “Corporate Social Responsibility”, is confirmed by diverse surveys [e.g. KPMG (2011); Ernst and Young (2011); UN Global Compact and Accenture (2010); McKinsey and Company (2007); Economist Intelligence Unit (2007)]. Since the beginning of this millennium the debate on firms’ social responsibility has been discussed more frequently in the scientific community. For example, Jensen (2001, 2002) points out the importance of firm’s stakeholders which should additionally be considered in firm’s decision making process. Therefore, he redefines the firm’s objective which he calls “Enlightened Value Maximization”. The arguments of Porter and Kramer (2011) are in the same line. They indicate the firm’s responsibility to care also about societal needs. As a consequence, they illustrate the importance of “creating a shared value”. An organizational architecture is created by Bromberger (2011), because within a “hybrid-organization” an entrepreneur “can operate as both a for-profit and a nonprofit” (p. 49). For Husted and Allen (2011) the combination of for-profit goals and non-profit goals is even implemented in the firm’s strategy they call “Corporate Social Strategy”, because both shareholders and stakeholders neither solely concentrates on profit nor on social benefits. The organizations’ challenge is to find “the right balance” (p. 20). An upcoming analytical stream of literature started by Goering (2007) deals with mixed duopolies where a profit-maximizing firm (henceforth PMF), which is exclusively concentrated on its profit, competes against a socially concerned firm (SCF). The SCF maximizes in addition to its own profit a share of consumer surplus. Goering (2007) and Kopel and Brand (2012) analyze a mixed duopoly with a PMF and a SCF where both firms can offer strategic incentives to their manager. In line with this articles, Kopel and Brand (2013) explain why SCFs pay low-powered incentives to their executives. A mixed market model without managers is analyzed by Goering (2008),Footnote 2 whereby a SCF competes either against a PMF or a public firm, which maximizes total welfare. This analysis contains also a triopoly with all three different types of firms. The double marginalization in a bilateral monopoly is explored originally by Spengler (1950). Goering (2012) starts to analyze the impact of firms’ social concern on a bilateral monopoly.Footnote 3 His analysis is concentrated on a perfectly coordinated marketing channel,Footnote 4 introduced by Jeuland and Shugan (1983). The analytical framework developed by Goering (2012) is completed in Brand and Grothe (2013). Due to the fact that Goering (2012) and Brand and Grothe (2013) are analyzing a perfectly coordinated marketing channel, the double marginalization problem is solved ex ante by the assumption that the manufacturer is able to absorb the whole retailer’s profit. This assumption is relaxed within our framework. The rest of the model used by Goering (2012) is unchanged. At first, we examine the impact of a given level of social concern on the double marginalization problem. Afterwards, social concern is used strategically by means of firms’ endogenously chosen levels of social concern. As a result, our analysis combines the double marginalization problem with firms’ social responsibility. In detail, we want to answer the following research questions: First, how does firms’ social concern change the classical double marginalization problem? Second, for which firm does it pay off to be socially responsibly? Third, which effect has firms’ social responsibility on quantity, price, consumer surplus and total welfare? Through the analysis of our model we get three main results. First, not only in an oligopoly, even as pointed out by Manasakis et al. (2007), Kopel and Brand (2012) and Kopel and Brand (2013), also in a bilateral monopoly firms’ social responsibility can be chosen strategically. The result confirms the empirical findings made by Hillman and D.Keim (2001), McWilliams and Siegel (2001, 2011), Siegel and Vitaliano (2007) and Fernández-Kranz and Santaló (2010). Second, socially concerned firms soften the double marginalization problem although a perfectly coordinated marketing channel solves this problem more efficiently than firms’ social responsibility. Nevertheless, if perfect coordination is not possible, the implementation of a broader firm mission results in a Pareto improvement. Third, the fact that impact of the retailer’s social concern affects the equilibrium values twice as much as the manufacturer’s social responsibility is in line with Fisman et al. (2005, 2006). Their empirical studies show that firms selling their products to end-consumer are more often socially concerned than firms without any connection to the final market. In summary, our model gives further insights into a bilateral monopoly when firms have the choice to be socially concerned. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 introduces the model setup and Sect. 3 summarizes the results. The last section concludes our findings.",44

Schmalensee (1976), Gaudet and Salant (1991) and Kimmel (1992) are examples of early papers that revealed that cost reduction can harm an individual firm’s profitability in a Cournot oligopoly setting. Zhao (2001) extended this logic to society, showing that a small cost reduction by an inefficient firm may well reduce social welfare in an \(n\)-firm Cournot oligopoly with linear cost and demand. Smythe and Zhao (2006) generalized this result to the \(n\)-firm Cournot oligopoly case with non-linear cost and demand. These findings have clear implications for policies relating to the support of inefficient firms. For example, the effect on the world’s social welfare of aid to inefficient firms in developing countries may well be negative, as is the impact of providing support to inefficient “national champions” in times of economic crisis. We add to this literature by analyzing \(n\)-firm Cournot strategic delegation games. Strategic delegation games depart from the standard assumption of profit maximization. Since the contributions of Vickers (1985), Fershtman and Judd (1987) and Sklivas (1987), two-stage strategic delegation games have been developed in which the owner of the firm decides in the contract stage of the game about his manager’s incentives, which impact the latter’s behavior in the market stage of the game. The original models assumed sales delegation: that is, the owner decides on the manager’s remuneration as a weighted combination of the profits and sales obtained in the market stage of the game. Later, other types of strategic delegation anchors have been introduced, such as relative performance (Miller and Pazgal (2002)) and market share (Jansen et al. 2007; Ritz 2008). In the current paper, we model strategic sales delegation games. We first generalize the method of Zhao (2001) for the classical profit maximization \(n\) firm Cournot oligopoly case, and express the results in terms of the effects of both small and large cost reductions. We show that, in an \(n\)-firm strategic sales delegation Cournot oligopoly, a cost reduction of an inefficient firm is more likely to be associated with firm exit and welfare loss than in the benchmark case of a classical profit maximization \(n\)-firm Cournot oligopoly. From this, we conclude that if a government decides to offer financial support to an inefficient firm, either at home or abroad, that then a condition as to managerial incentives should be part of the policy package.",1

For instance, foreign investors hold 27.3 % of the shares in the partially privatized Japanese telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT). Similarly, Japanese investors also hold large amounts of stock issued by foreign telecommunications companies.Footnote 3 Clearly, how the structure of the international cross-ownership of firms affects strategic privatization policy merits careful consideration. However, despite a substantial literature concerning the effects of international cross-ownership of firms on strategic trade policies and trade patterns dating from seminal work by Lee (1990), Dick (1993), and an extensive literature on mixed oligopoly with foreign competitors that starts with Corneo and Jeanne (1992, 1994), this important issue remains only partly addressed.Footnote 4
 More concretely, consider the possible further privatization of Airbus, the largely state-owned European aerospace and defense corporation. If the European governments owning Airbus contemplate an SIP as a means of privatization, they must think carefully about how they should sell shares in Airbus to a private sector that may have already invested heavily in stocks issued by its most important rival Boeing, a private US firm.Footnote 5 How, then, will the possibility of the international cross-ownership of firms affect the possible privatization of Airbus? A similar question arises in relation to the Japanese government contemplating the further sale of shares in the already partially privatized NTT and JT. It, too, has to consider the fact that the targeted private sector has already invested heavily in stocks issued by the foreign rivals of NTT and JT. Our aim is to examine this important question using a simple model of international mixed oligopoly, where the domestic firm is a partially privatized public firm operating in the same market as privately owned foreign firms.Footnote 6
 Using our simple model, we show that the structure of the international cross-ownership of firms emerges as a critical determinant of privatization policy. In the case of international Cournot competition in a third market, an increase in the domestic ownership of foreign firms can impede privatization, whereas an increase in the foreign ownership of the privatized domestic firm can promote privatization. This arises primarily because the government needs to balance two conflicting incentives, i.e., increasing the profits of the partially privatized public firm and increasing the profits of the foreign firm partly owned by domestic residents. An increase in the intensity of privatization shifts production from the foreign firm to the domestic firm, and thus increases the profits of the latter. However, this increase in profits is at the expense of the domestic residents owning shares in the foreign firm. Hence, when there is an increase in the domestic ownership of the foreign firm, the home government is motivated to protect the interests of domestic residents by rendering the domestic firm less aggressive (through a reduction in the level of privatization), thus increasing the profits of the foreign firm. In contrast, an increase in the foreign ownership of the domestic firm diminishes the domestic welfare incentive to increase the profits of the foreign firm, thus promoting further privatization. Conversely, under Bertrand competition, it would always be optimal for the home government to pursue complete nationalization. This is because, unlike the Cournot case, there is a convergence of interests between the firms under Bertrand competition, such that a less aggressive domestic firm benefits both the domestic and international firms. This is especially the case when domestic residents also own shares in the foreign firm. Consequently, under Bertrand competition, the home government always chooses to nationalize the domestic firm completely. These findings suggest that depending on the type of competition, the effects of the international cross-ownership of firms on the privatization process can be completely different. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that under Cournot competition, domestic ownership of foreign firms renders neither complete privatization nor complete nationalization optimal under moderate conditions. Put otherwise, our results suggest that under Cournot competition, domestic ownership of foreign firms may prevent governments from adopting policies aimed at either a complete privatization or a complete nationalization of their industries. Our analysis thus offers a novel explanation, at least in part, for the common observation that governments worldwide appear to refrain from applying complete privatization in the modern era of globalization. In terms of background, our analysis mostly relates to the extensive literature on mixed oligopolies.Footnote 7 In early work, Matsumura (1998) considers partial privatization and examines optimal state ownership in a domestic context.Footnote 8 Since then, a number of studies have considered competition between partially privatized domestic firms and private foreign firms.Footnote 9 Recently, evidence has emerged of a strong interdependence between privatization policies and strategic trade policies.Footnote 10 For instance, using a mixed oligopoly model for two countries, in each of which there is a public firm and a private firm, Han and Ogawa (2008) show that integration in the product market can limit privatization. Alternatively, Long and Stähler (2009) demonstrate that when a partially privatized domestic firm and a foreign firm compete à la Cournot in a third market, the optimal export subsidy increases with state ownership, whereas in the case of Bertrand rivalry with differentiated goods, the optimal export tax increases with state ownership. Lastly, in an important recent contribution, Lin and Matsumura (2012) consider the setting where a partially privatized domestic firm competes with a number of domestic and foreign private firms. Under this setting, they examine how the foreign ownership of partially privatized domestic firms affects privatization policy and show that a higher ratio of foreign investor stockholding in a partially privatized firm can promote privatization, whereas the increased penetration of foreign firms in the product market can retard privatization. Nonetheless, despite being a widely observed phenomenon in the age of globalization, the domestic ownership of private foreign firms has not been explicitly considered in the literature.Footnote 11 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first analysis concerning the interdependence of the international cross-ownership of firms and privatization policy.Footnote 12
 Our paper also relates to the vast empirical literature on privatization, which generally shows that the magnitude of privatization varies greatly by industry.Footnote 13 Our results also contribute to this stream of the literature by generating some testable predictions concerning the direction of privatization policy. Namely, given the domestic ownership of foreign firms, (i) depending on the characteristics of the market under consideration, the direction of privatization policy can be opposite, and (ii) neither complete privatization nor complete nationalization may hold. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the basic model and the main results. We consider both Cournot and Bertrand competition, and their outcomes are briefly compared. Section 3 examines the robustness of the main results. This section also analyzes the cases where the two firms compete in the home market, as well as the effects of an asymmetric cost structure. We conclude the paper in Sect. 4.",13

One motivation for this analysis is Apple’s entry into the ebook market on the basis of the agency model (retail pricing by the publishers with Apple keeping a share) while Amazon, which enjoyed a monopoly before Apple’s entry, kept publishers on the “wholesale model”. The peculiarities of this market are addressed in Foros et al. (2013). In spite of a similar motivation and a similar demand framework, objective, set up, and most of the questions and results in this paper are different and presumably complementary to Foros et al. (2013). The major differences are: First, to account for potentially substantial contributions of retailer(s). Recent management literature, e.g., Dawar (2013), stresses that downstream activities are gaining strategic importance. Second, the focus on upstream–downstream oligopolistic interactions in a more general setting beyond the ‘Apple’ case. Third and related to above, the assumption of simultaneous moves because that allows treating all firms symmetrically. A sequential game requires asymmetry with respect to strategic leverages and in particular with respect to commitment power. Commitment power is also needed for more complicated contracts such as nonlinear tariffs. Therefore, the assumptions of symmetry and simultaneous moves allow restricting the analysis to linear tariffs. Fourth, Nash competition at all stages. The combination of the above mentioned items distinguishes this paper from the extensively explored field of vertical relations (with and without product differentiation) as sequential games and/or bargaining models dominate. Fifth, comparing retail monopolies and duopolies, which leads to the surprising conclusion that upstream firms can benefit from facing a retail monopoly. A major reason for considering simultaneous moves is the focus on interactions between upstream and downstream oligopolies beyond the topical case in order to address inter alia the following questions: Which of the two kinds of pricing arrangements, wholesale or agency, is more profitable and to whom, first under a downstream monopoly and then under an oligopoly? Is downstream competition (always) beneficial for an upstream oligopoly? What about the possibility of an asymmetric equilibrium within a symmetric setup, choosing wholesale for one and retail pricing for the other retailer? What happens if upstream firms choose different pricing strategies? The answers to the above questions can be applied to study the relations among non-competitive suppliers and non-competitive and effort providing retailers such as those between supermarket chains and their suppliers (e.g., dairies and breweries), between luxury (and other branded) goods and selected retail chains. In order to address all of the above questions it is necessary that different pricing modes are possible. This is presumably not the case in all vertical relations like the one between the (oligopolistic) electronics industry that uses similar inputs from its oligopolistic suppliers to assemble TVs, mobile phones, computers, etc. However, even in such cases, the results reported under wholesale pricing seem applicable. The model considers upstream and downstream oligopolies (for simplicity duopolies) within a differentiated goods framework such that a consumer can decide among four products differentiated along suppliers and retailers. In the motivating case of Amazon and Apple the differentiation of otherwise identical products (say a John Irving novel) is clear due to differences of the required hardware. One crucial feature of this analysis is that cooperation, which is assumed in most of the related IO literature in at least one of the upstream–downstream relations, is eschewed. Instead non-cooperative behavior of all (four) players—an upstream duopoly and a downstream duopoly—is assumed. Another and crucial extension is that the retailers are not passive but provide a value enhancing task. These extensions turn some conventional wisdoms upside down. One reason is the possibility of morale hazard on behalf of the retailer(s) in particular under retail price arrangements. This was already noted in Romano (1994), which allows also upstream moral hazard but restricts the analysis to a single firm downstream and upstream with the latter dictating the terms of the contract; recently, Gabrielsen and Johansen (2013b) shows that retailers’ moral hazard leads to commitment problems for an upstream monopoly selling to two retailers. Although the above sketched model is set up along familiar IO frameworks, its focus and results are different. Horn and Wolinsky (1988) considers bilateral relations between upstream and downstream, Cournot competition in the downstream market and (bilateral) Nash bargaining between supplier and retailer, which affect the profitability of an upstream merger. Naylor (2002) finds the unusual effect that downstream profits can increase with the number of retailers. Matsushima (2006) shows that this can also arise under Nash interactions between downstream and upstream firms and free entry into the upstream sector. This possibility arises also in this paper but for different reasons. In the related marketing literature, Choi (1991) considers simultaneous moves as well as Stackelberg setups with two manufacturers selling to one retailer (wholesale) that is extended in Lee and Staelin (1997) for retail competition (and for general demand functions).Footnote 1
Rey and Stiglitz (1995) considers upstream and downstream competition in wholesale prices but focuses on how exclusive territories reduce intrabrand competition. Rey and Verge (2010) considers four ‘products’ differentiated along the manufacturer and retailer dimension but assumes that all the bargaining power is with the manufacturers (\(=\) upstream). The upshot is that retail price maintenance (RPM) limits competition and can generate monopoly pricing. Dobson and Waterson (2007) in contrast finds that RPM is not universally undesirable in a four product demand framework, which will be used in this paper too, and bargaining. Gabrielsen and Johansen (2013a) is a recent paper that differentiates products according to manufacturer and retailer. It assumes that one of the two brands (\(=\) upstream producers) is competitively supplied and focuses on seller versus buyer power and RPM versus two part tariffs (confirming the concern against RPM), while this paper focuses on Nash outcomes. Many papers eschew competitive settings and assume either bargaining in such bilateral oligopolies, e.g., Björnerstedt and Stennek (2007), Mills (2007), Richards and Patterson (2005) or focus on integration, e.g., Gaudet and van Long (1996) considers the prospects of downstream oligopolists pairing with upstream oligopolists in the case of a homogenous good, Jansen (2003), Milliou and Petrakis (2007) and Bourreau et al. (2011) on vertically integrated versus disintegrated downstream firms, on how retail power induces concentration, Inderst (2007). The upstream oligopoly’s strife to fix retail prices in order to avoid double marginalization is, however, not without costs if the retailers’ efforts can add value. The reason is that retail pricing allows the upstream firms to appropriate all rents in a non-cooperative setting. This eliminates not only double marginalization but also all efforts of retailers, which can lead to lower upstream profits. Indeed, as long as the retailers’ efforts are not too costly, double marginalization is less harmful and thus wholesale pricing should be the preferred policy of the upstream oligopolists. Hence, allowing for a contribution by retailers changes conventional wisdom between retail and wholesale pricing arrangements. Furthermore, retail competition need not benefit the upstream firms and it can be optimal for them to split their strategy even within an otherwise symmetric framework: use a wholesale pricing arrangement for one retailer and fix retail prices for the other. Of course, downstream firms will always prefer wholesale pricing in such a non-cooperative simultaneous move setting, i.e., in the absence of strategic advantages and corresponding commitment power. Summarizing, a number of concrete and testable (i.e., refutable) predictions are obtained. The presentation of the model (including benchmarks for comparisons), is followed by the analysis of a retail monopoly (Sect. 3) and then of a retail oligopoly (Sect. 4), where each section considers retail and wholesale pricing arrangements. In addition, Sect. 5 considers mixed pricing arrangements, downstream and upstream. All proofs are relegated to an “Appendix”.",9

As Seade (1980, p 483) observes: It is natural to disregard unstable equilibria as being unobservable, in particular in the context of a comparative-statics exercise, where any possible initial unstable equilibrium would be lost when perturbed and would not be regained subsequently. Let \((x_{1}^{*},x_{2}^{*})\) be some candidate equilibrium in a two-player game. A well-known necessary and sufficient condition for this equilibrium to be stable, is that the determinant of the concomitant Jacobian matrix is positive and that the trace of the Jacobian is negative (e.g. Dixit 1986). The latter condition is met in case all second-order conditions are satisfied. The former condition, also known as the Routh–Hurwitz stability condition, reads as: 
\(i,j=1,2\), \(i\ne j\), whereby \(\pi _{i}\) refers to subject \(i\)’s objective function. Underlying (1) is a myopic adjustment process: starting from any point \((x_{i},x_{j})\) each player \(i\) adjusts \(x_{i}\) as long as marginal profits of doing so are positive (Dixit 1986). Stability condition (1) guarantees that this adjustment process converges to \((x_{1}^{*},x_{2}^{*})\).Footnote 1
 Although simple in itself, it is quite easy to track down contributions to the literature that did not properly take into account condition (1). Overlooking the distinction between choice variables that are a strategic substitute or a strategic complements is one reason for these errors. Indeed, as this note illustrates, condition (1) can take a different form for strategic substitutes and strategic complements.",5

Particularly, some models assume price competition (Bertrand’s model) and others assume quantity competition (Cournot’s model). Sometimes it is assumed that firms produce homogeneous goods and sometimes that the goods produced are differentiated. Furthermore, there are contributions on both private oligopoly models and mixed oligopoly models. Finally, some models assume that firms make their decisions simultaneously (Bertrand and Cournot’s models) and other models consider that firms play sequentially (Stackelberg’s models). The order in which firms take decisions is considered very important because as Pal (1998) points out a sequential order of moves may give rise to significantly different results from those obtained in a simultaneous game. Therefore, the order of moves in which firms take decisions should be analyzed endogenously. By considering the observable delay game of Hamilton and Slutsky (1990), this paper analyzes endogenous timing in a mixed duopoly model, in which firms produce differentiated good assuming both Cournot and Bertrand competition. Recently, studies of mixed markets involving both private and public firms have become increasingly popular in the literature. This interest in mixed oligopolies is due to their importance to the economies in many countries of Europe, Canada and Japan, among others. Although the world wave of privatization has been observed since 1980s, competition between public, semi-public (partially owned by public sectors) and private firms exists in many sectors, among others, the airline, rail, telecommunications, natural gas, steel, electricity, as well as services including banking, hospitals and education. Since Merrill and Schneider (1966) seminal paper, the literature on mixed oligopolies has become richer and more diverse. Specifically, Matsumura (1998) shows that semi-public firms can emerge naturally in mixed oligopoly markets. Recent papers on partial privatization are, among others, Matsumura and Kanda (2005), Fujiwara (2007) and Lin and Matsumura (2012). Most of the existing literature on mixed oligopoly assumes either that firms make quantity or price choices, in either a simultaneous or a sequential game, and that the order of movements is exogenously given. However, some papers discuss endogenous timing in mixed oligopoly models. Some of them analyze endogenous timing assuming quantity competition and homogeneous goods for example, Pal (1998), who investigates this problem in a closed economy by using the observable delay game formulated by Hamilton and Slutsky (1990), Matsumura (2003), who considers only foreign firms in the analysis, and Lu (2006), who takes into account both domestic and foreign firms in the analysis. Other papers, analyze endogenous timing in a price competition setting, for example: Ogawa and Kato (2006), Bárcena-Ruiz (2007) and Méndez-Naya (2011)Footnote 1. The above literature on mixed duopoly shows that when firms compete in quantities and produce a homogeneous good, contrary to private duopoly, they make their decisions sequentially (Pal 1998; Matsumura 2003; Lu 2006). Under price competition (Bárcena-Ruiz 2007) shows that, once more contrary to a private duopoly model, the public and the private firms set prices simultaneously because of the dominant strategy for the two firms is to be the Stackelberg leader of the game, that is to say, both of them prefer to set prices as soon as possible. On the other hand, Méndez-Naya (2011) proves that a merger between a public and a private firm could change the timing of the game. The purpose of this paper is to complement existing literature on endogenous timing in mixed duopoly models by setting a general duopoly model in which firms may compete in either prices or quantities, the goods produced by the two firms may be either homogeneous or differentiated and, furthermore, there could be either a mixed duopoly model or a private duopoly one. Specifically, the endogenous timing of the game is analyzed by assuming that there is a private firm and a partly owned one. Matsumura and Ogawa (2010) and Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón (2010) have already analyzed endogenous timing in a mixed oligopoly model by using the (Hamilton and Slutsky 1990) observable delay game, however, their papers discuss quantity competition assuming homogeneous goods. Therefore, this paper complements the above mentioned papers by adding price competition and product differentiation. Specifically the role played by both the degree of privatization and the existing product differentiation on the endogenous order in which firms make their decisions is discussed. Following Pal (1998) and based on the (Hamilton and Slutsky 1990) observed delay game, it is proved that the endogenous timing of the game, in both a Bertrand and a Cournot setting, depends in a complex way on the existing relationship between both the degree of privatization of the partially privatized firm and the existing product differentiation. Furthermore, it is shown that the results obtained in the Cournot’s model are quite different to those obtained in the Bertrand’s model.",20

Gómez,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Factor substitution is a powerful engine of growth. This is the conclusion drawn from the influential work of Grandville (1989) and Klump and Grandville (2000), who find a positive relationship between factor substitution and growth and income per capita in the Solow model. The link between economic growth and factor substitutability has thereafter attracted a great attention of the literature (see, e.g., Klump et al. 2012, for a recent survey). This research has been stimulated by empirical work providing evidence against the unitary elasticity of substitution implicit in the Cobb–Douglas specification and in favor of a more general Constant-Elasticity-of-Substitution (CES) specification (e.g., Chirinko 2008; Klump et al. 2007; León-Ledesma et al. 2010). Thus, subsequent work by Miyagiwa and Papageorgiou (2003) shows that such positive relationship does not necessarily hold in the Diamond model. Irmen and Klump (2009) reconcile these findings by considering a generalized neoclassical growth model with possible asymmetries in savings out of factor incomes. They show that factor substitution has a positive ‘efficiency effect’ on growth via income but an ambiguous ‘distribution effect’ via factor income shares. However, the positive link between factor substitution and growth can be assured, in particular, if the saving rate out of capital income is not lower than the saving rate out of wage income. Xue and Yip (2012) present a comprehensive characterization of the growth-substitutability nexus in the Solow, Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans and Diamond models.Footnote 1
 This literature has relied on growth models in which the long-run growth rate is exogenously given. Therefore, factor substitution can affect the growth rate during the transition, but not the long-run growth rate.Footnote 2 Furthermore, the unique factors of production considered are capital and labor, so the analysis focuses on the effect of capital-labor substitution. A large empirical literature shows that other inputs are fundamental in production and, in particular, the productive role of certain types of public expenditure is well documented (see, e.g., the review in Romp and Haan 2007, and the meta-analysis in Bom and Ligthart 2014). In this paper we consider an endogenous growth model with productive public expenditure à la (Barro 1990). Thus, we examine the effect of the elasticity of substitution between private and public inputs on (endogenous) long-run growth.Footnote 3 An important implication of the introduction of policy variables is that it allows us to analyze the effect of factor substitution on the optimal fiscal policy as well. Furthermore, we also study the effect of the elasticity of substitution on welfare, which should be the ultimate goal of the analysis (e.g., Grandville 2009). We find that for two identical economies differing uniquely in the elasticity of substitution between private and public inputs, if the baseline government size is suboptimally low the first-best optimal government size and, in the presence of congestion, the optimal income tax rate will be higher in the economy with the higher elasticity of substitution. If the baseline government size is suboptimally high this result must be reversed: the first-best optimal government size and, in the presence of congestion, the optimal income tax rate will be lower in the economy with the higher elasticity of substitution. In any case, the high-elasticity economy will feature a higher first-best optimal long-run growth rate and welfare. This is due to the efficiency effect of Klump and Grandville (2000); i.e., a higher elasticity of factor substitution increases the productivity of inputs. This paper is also related to a large body of literature that, since the seminal work of Barro (1990), has analyzed from a theoretical perspective the effect of productive government expenditure in endogenous growth models (see, e.g., Irmen and Kuehnel 2009, for a recent survey). Because of its analytical simplicity, most of this literature has considered that production is Cobb–Douglas. However, a small strand of this literature combined public and private inputs through a more general CES technology. Devarajan et al. (1996) examine the effect of the composition of government expenditure on the long-run growth rate, whereas Ghosh and Gregoriou (2008) study the (second-best) welfare-maximizing solution in this model. Ott and Turnovsky (2006) derive the optimal tax structure in a model with non-excludable and excludable public inputs. Misch et al. (2013) and Gómez (2014) analyze the relationship between the growth-maximizing, (second-best) welfare-maximizing and first-best optimal income tax rates—or, equivalently, government sizes—and long-run growth rates in models with productive public expenditure/capital for given parameter values, including the elasticity of substitution.Footnote 4 Thus, neither of these works examine the effect of changes in the elasticity of substitution so, in particular, they do not need to use normalized CES production functions. This paper studies, instead, the effect of changes in the elasticity of substitution on the first-best government size, welfare and long-run growth. Therefore, following Klump and Grandville (2000), we have to normalize the CES production function. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model. Section 3 examines the effect of the elasticity of substitution between public and private inputs. Section 4 concludes.",9

Our aim is to investigate the impact of the bargaining powers of the regulator and of the firm on the scope for collusion between the parties. This approach generalizes the standard framework of ‘command and control’, where all the bargaining power is allocated to the regulator, and allows a broader analysis of the optimal institutional response to collusion. Regulatory intervention is usually thought of as the use of the government power to coerce for the purpose of restricting the firms’ decisions when unfettered competition turns out to be inappropriate. This is the case in relevant portions of electricity, gas, sanitation, telecommunications, transportation and water industries. The economic literature typically assumes that the regulator has the power to dictate a regulatory policy to the firm, and therefore regulation is modelled as the outcome of a ‘take-it-or-leave-it’ offer. In practice, however, regulation is generally a process of give-and-take rather than of take-it-or-leave-it. On the one hand, regulators issue rules in the form of administrative acts that fill in the details of the authorizing legislation. Given the general and vague policy aims provided by the legislation (a form of contract incompleteness), regulators are left with some power when they regulate firms. On the other hand, regulated firms generally do not comply in a fully passive manner with regulatory decisions. They may threaten to appeal against the regulator’s decisions in order to obtain some revisions. The desire to avoid a rule being repealed in the courts can determine the form of the rule that is finally adopted. More importantly, this is not the only means to directly affect the regulatory outcome. A regulator usually must fulfill some procedural requirements that restrict the exercise of policies in the form of command and control. The US Administrative Procedure Act (APA) of 1946 provides that rulemaking procedures may be either formal, with hearings resembling a court trial, or informal, with notice of rulemaking and public comments. Concerned parties are allowed to express their viewpoints by presenting evidence on the effects of the regulator’s actions and on questions of fact. Regulatory hearings are typically characterized by repeated revisions of rate proposals. In reaction to complaints, the regulator puts forward a new set of rules and amendments to the existing ones. Therefore, rulemaking is not usually the direct product of the regulator’s fiat, but it arises from a process of intensive scrutiny. This discussion suggests that regulation tends to be the outcome of a bargaining process. Empirical evidence seems to support this view. For instance, the presence of turnover costs can weaken the threat to replace an incumbent firm that is reluctant to accept a regulatory policy. Kahn (1988) observes that in utility sectors the relationship between a regulator and a regulated firm generally constitutes a bilateral monopoly that induces the parties to achieve a compromise. In their analysis of the features of the regulatory process in the US, Viscusi et al. (2005) emphasize the influence of private players (mainly, firms) on regulatory outcomes. Rossi (2011) explores the increasing scope for bargaining in regulatory relationships after the liberalization process.Footnote 1 In their seminal survey on optimal regulation, Armstrong and Sappington (2007, p. 1564) point out that the standard approach in the literature, which ignores negotiations between the regulator and the firm, “generally is adopted for technical convenience rather than for realism”. In our model the regulator is required to monitor the firm’s costs and to reveal its information to a political principal (Congress). As it is well established in the collusion literature (e.g., Tirole 1986, 1992), this raises the possibility of collusion between the firm and the regulator, which can manipulate its audit report to Congress in exchange for a side transfer from the firm. Frequent news reports of corruption and lax regulation suggest that collusion is a widespread phenomenon. Laffont and Tirole (1993, Ch. 11) emphasize that a regulated firm has several means to influence public decision making. For instance, it can bribe the regulatory officials through gratuities or the offer of job positions in the regulated firm after their retirement (‘revolving door’ phenomenon). Personal relationships can provide incentives for the regulatory staff to treat the regulated firm kindly. The firm may cater to the regulator’s concern for tranquility by refraining from criticizing publicly the regulatory management. As Estache and Wren-Lewis (2009) point out, the problems of collusion and corruption are particularly severe in developing countries. It is well known in the collusion literature that an efficient firm has a stake in collusion with the regulator. We show that this standard conclusion holds only if the regulator’s bargaining power is relatively high. The rationale behind our result lies in the trade-off the firm faces when colluding with the regulator. The benefit of collusion arises from the higher price the efficient firm is allowed to charge when the collusive regulator manipulates its information before Congress and reports that the firm is inefficient. However, a higher price shrinks the gains from trade the parties can share in the bargaining process. Since these gains are redistributed according to the parties’ bargaining powers, a powerful regulator reduces the gains the firm can appropriate. Hence, if the regulator’s bargaining power is significant enough, the firm’s benefit of a higher collusive price outweighs the cost of lower gains from trade, and the firm has an incentive to collude. Our result indicates that the scope for collusion crucially depends on the bargaining powers of the parties involved in the regulatory process. The bargaining power of a party can arise either from the authorizing legislation or from the regulatory environment that determines each party’s strength in the regulatory relationship. If the regulator can impose its decisions to a large extent, it enjoys a high bargaining power vis-à-vis the regulated firm and, in line with the classical approach of command and control, our analysis predicts that the efficient firm has a stake in collusion. However, we show that a sufficiently high bargaining power of the firm removes its incentive to collude. Afterwards, we derive the optimal institutional response to collusion. In a standard framework where incentive payments cannot discriminate between the regulator’s (honest or collusive) types, we characterize the conditions under which allowing collusion is preferred to deterring it (via an incentive payment or the shutdown of the inefficient firm). This can be the case when the regulator’s bargaining power is high enough. The reason for this result is that a powerful regulator increases the firm’s stake in collusion, which makes deterring collusion more costly. We find that allowing collusion can be also optimal when consumer demand is relatively inelastic, such as in markets for essential services (e.g., energy, sanitation). A rigid demand facilitates collusion since it reduces the losses in the surplus from trade due to a higher price, and therefore precluding collusion becomes more expensive. Then, we qualify our results in a more ideal environment where incentive payments can be made contingent on the regulator’s type or Congress does not have to delegate the regulatory task to a (possibly) collusive regulator and it can directly regulate the firm. We feel that the predictions of our analysis can shed new light on regulation as a bargaining process and provide a contribution to the practical and theoretical debate on collusion in regulatory relationships.",5

In oligopolies among private firms, it is well known that price competition is stronger, yielding lower profits than in the case of quantity competition.Footnote 1 In related literature, Singh and Vives (1984) endogenized the structure of competition (in terms of price or quantity), finding that firms often choose whether to adopt a price contract or a quantity contract. In a private duopoly in which both firms maximize profits, and assuming linear demand and product differentiation, Singh and Vives (1984) showed that a quantity contract is the dominant strategy for each firm when goods are substitutes. Cheng (1985), Tanaka (2001a, b), and Tasnádi (2006) extended this analysis to asymmetric oligopolies, more general demand and cost conditions, and vertical product differentiation, confirming the robustness of the results. However, these results depend on the assumption that all firms are private and profit-maximizers. Therefore, they may not apply to the increasingly important and popular mixed oligopolies, in which state-owned public firms compete against private firms. In most countries, there exist state-owned public firms that have substantial influence on their market competitors. Such mixed oligopolies occur in various industries, such as the airline, steel, automobile, railway, natural gas, electricity, postal service, education, hospital, home loan, and banking industries.Footnote 2 In addition, we have repeatedly observed how many private enterprises facing financial problems have been nationalized, such as General Motors, Japan Airline, and Tokyo Electric Power Corporation. Studies on mixed oligopolies involving both state-owned public enterprises and private enterprises have recently attracted more attention and have become increasingly popular. 
Ghosh and Mitra (2010) revisited the comparison between price and quantity competition in a mixed duopoly. They showed that, in contrast to the case of a private duopoly, quantity competition is stronger than price competition, resulting in a smaller profit for the private firm.Footnote 3 Then, Matsumura and Ogawa (2012) examined the endogenous competition structure. In their study of a mixed duopoly, when one of the two firms is public, a price contract is the dominant strategy for both the private and the public firm, regardless of whether goods are substitutes or complements.Footnote 4 However, in their analysis, they assume that one public firm competes against one private firm. In this study, we allow for more than one private firm and investigate whether the two aforementioned results hold in an oligopoly. First, we revisit this price-quantity comparison in mixed oligopolies. We adopt a standard differentiated oligopoly with a linear demand (Dixit 1979) and show that, regardless of the number of private firms, the Bertrand model always yields higher welfare. However, the profit ranking depends on the number of private firms. If the number of private firms is less than or equal to four, the Bertrand model yields a larger profit for each private firm. However, if the number of private firms is greater than or equal to five, the profit can be larger under Cournot competition. Here, the Bertrand model always yields smaller profits, regardless of the degree of substitutability, if the number of private firms is sufficiently large. Next, we endogenize the competition structure (i.e., price or quantity) using the model of Singh and Vives (1984). We show that Bertrand competition can fail to be an equilibrium when the number of private firms is greater than or equal to two. These results suggest that, in contrast to the case of private oligopolies, the results of mixed oligopolies depend on the number of the private firms, both in terms of price-quantity comparison and in terms of endogenous competition structure. Finally, we investigate a model with multiple public firms. In the literature on mixed oligopolies, it is standard to assume that only one public firm competes against a number of private firms.Footnote 5 Recently, studies have begun allowing for multiple public firms, such as Matsumura and Shimizu (2010), Bose and Gupta (2013), Matsumura and Matsushima (2012), and Matsumura and Okumura (2013). A typical example of multiple public firms is the financial market in Japan. In China and Russia, many industries have multiple public firms, such as the banking, energy, and transportation industries. We consider the case in which the number of public firms is same as that of private firms. With regard to Bertrand–Cournot competition, we find that Bertrand competition always yields a larger total social surplus and profit in private firms, regardless of the number of private firms. This result suggests that the profit ranking does not depend on the number of private firms, but instead depends on how the weight of private firms in the market increases. However, with regard to the endogenous competition structure, the equilibrium competition structure does depend on the number of private firms. When two public firms compete against two private firms, Bertrand competition can fail to be an equilibrium, which is a common result in models with one public and two private firms. With regard to the Bertrand–Cournot comparison, Scrimitore (2014) established an important contribution. She adopted the partial privatization approach of Matsumura (1998) and considered the optimal degree of privatization. Her findings show that under optimal privatization policies, Cournot competition can yield higher profits in private firms than in the case of Bertrand competition. The optimal degree of privatization is lower under Bertrand competition, and a lower degree of privatization leads to stronger competition. Here, the profit ranking can be reversed under optimal privatization policies. Our study shows that the profit ranking can be reversed even if we do not consider optimal privatization policies. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the proposed model, and Sect. 3 compares Bertrand and Cournot competition. Section 4 endogenizes the competition structure (i.e., a price or quantity contract). Then, Sect. 5 considers a case of multiple public firms. The proofs of the propositions can be found in Appendix B.",68

On the one hand, the classical utilitarian social welfare function suffers from the Repugnant Conclusion: for any large population, there exists a much larger population with a much lower welfare per head, but which yields a larger aggregate welfare than the former population, and which is thus regarded as strictly better under classical utilitarianism. On the other hand, average utilitarianism suffers from the Mere Addition Paradox: the addition, to some population, of a given number of persons with a welfare slightly lower than the initial average welfare is regarded as socially undesirable under average utilitarianism, even if the welfare of the initial population is left unaffected. Following Parfit’s pioneer work, utilitarian population ethics has been developed in various directions. The search for alternative social welfare criteria that can escape from the two counterintuitive results mentioned above has received a strong attention. That research program has produced various new social welfare criteria, such as critical-level utilitarianism (Blackorby and Donaldson 1984), number-dampened utilitarianism (Hurka 1983; Ng 1986), and critical-band utilitarianism (Blackorby et al. 2005).Footnote 1 Besides new utilitarian social welfare criteria, new paradoxes and impossibility results have also been produced (Arrhenius and Bykvist 1995; Bykvist 2007; Arrhenius 2013). Moreover, utilitarian population ethics has been applied to some complex ethical dilemmas, such as the treatment of future generations (Broome 1992; Arrhenius and Bykvist 1995), or the trade-off between the addition of new persons and the extension of the life of existing persons (Broome 2004; Arrhenius 2008). Most of the population ethics literature relies on an abstract representation of human societies, which is often reduced to two dimensions: (1) a population size; (2) a level of utility for each person. More recently, economists revisited utilitarian population ethics within economic environments, where other dimensions of life are modeled. Renström and Spataro (2011) applied the critical-level utilitarian criterion to the question of the optimal population growth in a dynamic overlapping generations (OLG) economy with physical capital accumulation, which was first formulated by Samuelson (1975) under average utilitarianism. Jouvet and Ponthiere (2011) revisited the trade-off between adding new persons and extending the life of existing persons in a dynamic OLG economy with a fixed living space. Boucekkine and Fabbri (2013) reconsidered Parfit’s Repugnant Conclusion within a dynamic economic model of endogenous growth. More recently, Bouccekine et al. (2014) examined the extent to which equalizing the consumption of all individuals in all generations can be the optimal solution to a utilitarian social planning problem consisting in choosing the optimal age structure dynamics under the constraint of a given initial age structure. Besides theoretical developments, the population ethics literature also evolves through the new challenges it faces. New phenomena can raise new ethical dilemmas. One of those new phenomena consists of the recent postponement of births. Since the 1970s, demographers have observed a significant postponement of parenthood. That postponement is illustrated on Fig. 1.Footnote 2
 Average age of women at first birth (period) In the case of Sweden, for instance, the average age of women at first birth has increased from age 24 in 1970 to age 29 in 2010. The postponement of births is a fundamental evolution of the last decades, which, as such, raises several questions, about its causes, its consequences, and about its social desirability. Is the postponement of births socially desirable? The goal of this paper is to study the social desirability of births postponement in the long-run. For that purpose, we study, within a dynamic framework, whether the postponement of births is socially desirable or not from the perspective of utilitarian population ethics. As this is well-known, utilitarian ethics answers questions about social desirability of actions or policies by means of the calculus of social welfare under those different actions or policies (without emphasis on individual choices). In the present context, we propose to examine how utilitarian population ethics criteria would rank histories that are equal on all dimensions except one: the timing of births. The problem can be presented as follows. Suppose that a life includes not one, but several fertility periods, during which one can give birth to children. The question that we ask is the following: which fertility profile is optimal from a utilitarian perspective? To illustrate the problem, Fig. 2 shows, for a lifetime equal to four periods and including two fertility periods (periods 2 and 3), two possible alternatives, coined “early births” and “late births” respectively. One can also refer to those two societies as two distinct islands, i.e.  Early Island and Late Island. The fertility rates n and m denote, respectively, the number of children born during the first and the second reproduction periods. As shown on Fig. 2, the fertility timing implies two major differences. A first difference concerns the coexistence time between the parent and the child. At each point in time, four generations coexist when births are early, whereas only two cohorts coexist when births are late. Moreover, whereas children can coexist with their grand-parents on Early Island, this is not the case on Late Island, where grandparents are dead when the grandchildren are born. Another difference lies in how the current cohort size is related to the past cohort size. In Early Island, the size of a newborn cohort is directly related to the size of the cohort that is born at the previous period. However, on Late Island, the size of a newborn cohort is related to the size of the cohort born two periods before, which generates a different population dynamics. Early births versus late births In order to study the social desirability of birth postponement, we will focus here on an economy with a fixed living space.Footnote 3 That living space is a common resource, which is used, at a given point in time, by all individuals who are alive at that time. One can regard that economy with fixed living space as a “spaceship economy”, in line with Boulding’s metaphor of the Earth as a spaceship (Boulding 1966). On that spaceship, individual welfare is assumed to depend positively on the available space per head, space being here equally distributed among the living individuals.Footnote 4 The positive effect of space per head on individual welfare can be interpreted in several ways. One may consider that space consumption matters for its own sake, so that a too large population can lead to welfare-reducing congestion (Marshall 1890).Footnote 5 Another interpretation consists of considering that space is used in production, so that a too large population can also reduce welfare through output reduction (Hardin 1968). The timing of births being an inherently dynamic issue, we will study the social desirability of birth postponement in a dynamic framework where distinct generations overlap with each others. The advantage of that framework is that it includes, in addition to information about population size and utility, information about the age-structure of the population, and on the duration of overlap between generations, which is most relevant for the issue at stake. We develop a T-period dynamic overlapping generations economy where individual temporal welfare depends positively on the available space per head, and where agents have children in one out of two reproduction periods. Then, we compare, by means of various utilitarian population ethics criteria, such as classical utilitarianism (CU), average utilitarianism (AU) and critical-level utilitarianism (CLU), two economies that have exactly the same initial conditions, the same longevity, but differ regarding the fertility timing: in one economy, all births take place early in life (i.e. Early Island), whereas in the other economy, all births take place later on in life (i.e. Late Island). The welfare comparisons are carried out in four stages. In a first stage, the comparison focuses on finite histories, i.e. histories where an equal finite number of life-periods is lived by humans. Then, in a second stage, we compare infinite histories, i.e. histories where an infinite number of life-periods is lived by humans, by focusing on histories with a constant long-run population size. In a third stage, the robustness of those comparisons is examined by introducing an additional determinant of human well-being: the coexistence time with descendants, which varies across the different births timing (see Fig. 2). Finally, we examine the social desirability of a sudden transition from an early births regime to a late births regime, which amounts to compare histories differing in the timing of births and in their starting points. Anticipating on our results, we first show, when comparing finite histories with an equal number of life-periods but different fertility timing, that CU, AU and CLU criteria select the same fertility timing, which is the one leading to the most smoothed population pattern over time. That optimal birth timing depends on the initial age-structure within the reproductive age-group. When the comparison focuses on infinite histories with constant long-run population sizes, the fertility timing recommended by CU, AU and CLU depends on the form of the temporal utility function, as well as on the initial age-structure. Those results are qualitatively robust to the introduction of coexistence concerns across generations, except insofar as those coexistence concerns push towards earlier births, in such a way as to allow for longer periods of coexistence between humans. Hence the socially optimal birth timing depends, at the end of the day, on how congestion and coexistence concerns are weighted against each other. Regarding the social desirability of a transition from an early births regime to a late births regime, we show that such a transition is, for an equal total number of life-periods, socially desirable when individuals have no coexistence concerns, but may be undesirable under strong coexistence concerns. In sum, the major contribution of this paper is to provide, by means of a general dynamic overlapping generations model, a formal analysis of the social desirability, from a utilitarian perspective, of the postponement of births. Our key findings are: (1) the social desirability of birth postponement depends, in general, on the postulated population ethics criterion; (2) the social desirability of birth postponement depends strongly on the initial age structure of the population; (3) the social desirability of births postponement varies also depending on the importance of spacial congestion and coexistence concerns within individual’s preferences; (4) the conclusions that can be drawn are sensitive to the precise framing of the model, in the sense that a study of the desirability of different simultaneous histories is not formally similar to a study of the desirability of a sudden transition from one births regime to another regime. By its findings, the present paper contributes to the recent renewal of the optimal fertility literature. In a canonical paper, Golosov et al. (2007) revisited the optimal fertility by extending Pareto efficiency to situations of varying population sizes. Their extension gave birth to two concepts: A-efficiency (focusing on the well-being of each individual alive in all situations under comparison) and P-efficiency (which treats alive and potential individuals in symmetric ways). More recently, Conde-Ruiz et al. (2010) proposed to revisit optimal fertility, by means of the concept of Millian efficiency (constrained A-efficiency). In comparison with the present study—which is based on utilitarian criteria—, those two recent papers rely on more general normative foundations. However, both Golosov et al. (2007) and Conde-Ruiz et al. (2010) rely on a framework with a unique fertility period, in the sense that individuals have all their children at the same point in their life. The present study, on the contrary, relies on a framework that allows also for the study of the optimal timing for births. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the framework. Section 3 compares histories with different birth timings, in the case of finite histories with an equal total number of life-periods. Section 4 compares histories with different birth timing in the case of infinite histories with a constant asymptotic population sizes. Section 5 considers an extended model where individuals value coexistence with their descendants. Section 6 examines the social desirability of a transition, at a given point in time, from an early births regime to a late births regime. Section 7 concludes.",

The objective of this paper is to examine the effect of LPs on collusion when demand is stochastic and firms cannot perfectly observe their rival’s choices. It is shown that an LP may affect both, the duration of the competitive price wars which are necessary for cartel stability, and the levels of demand uncertainty under which collusion is viable. While it is well known that no collusive agreement can be successful without the participating firms’ willingness to credibly punish deviations, there are instances where extremely hard punishments may be counterproductive. Such is the case analyzed in Green and Porter (1984), (GP hereafter) where in the presence of unexpected demand slumps it is preferable for cartel-participating firms unable to perfectly monitor each other’s actions to adopt strategies that are more lenient than the so-called “grim” (or “trigger”) strategy.Footnote 1 In the GP context, a firm observing low sales cannot distinguish whether they are due to a deliberate price cut by a rival, or simply to sluggish demand. Punishing to infinity destroys, potentially for no reason, an otherwise profitable cartel. At the same time, not punishing at all induces cheating on the cartel agreement with certainty. An intermediate solution is a strategy that calls for interrupting cooperation every time low sales are observed (independently of their origin), but only for a limited number of periods. GP shows that a long enough period of cooperation-interruption is sufficient to induce loyalty to the cartel agreement. This way, cooperation may be disrupted for a number of periods giving its place to price wars, but stays alive in the long run. In this paper we consider a supergame in which firms choose between competing and colluding. The demand is stochastic and a low demand state occurs with positive probability, while each firm cannot perfectly observe the price set by the rival. We show that leaving the LP available after an inspection has already been launched (post-investigation leniency) may have ambiguous effects on collusion. When negative demand shocks are frequent, post-investigation leniency may (a) reduce the duration of temporary competitive price wars, and (b) enlarge the set of negative-demand-shock probabilities for which the collusive agreement is viable. In other words, introducing leniency may in some instances enhance, instead of undermining cartel stability. Cartel stability is more likely to be enhanced when negative-demand-shocks are expected to be frequent in the future, and the probability of conviction after investigation is already high. Our conclusion is that in such cases, fine reductions not only are of little help, but also have undesirable side-effects. On the contrary, when the probability of conviction is low, leniency policies always result in a welfare improvement. The effect of LP on cartels is first examined in Motta and Polo (2003) which stresses the importance of post-investigation leniency. Spagnolo (2004) concludes that costless cartel deterrence can be achieved when the first informant is rewarded sufficiently. Chen and Rey (2013) shows that it is optimal to provide leniency post-investigation when conviction is not very likely without self-reporting. Studying empirically the effectiveness of the early European corporate LP, Brenner (2009) concludes it has not significantly affected cartel stability, eventually because of the weakness of the provided incentives. The paper is organized as follows: The model is described and benchmark is set in Sect. 2. Section 3 contains the solution of the model when post-investigation leniency is introduced. In Sect. 4 the analysis is concluded.",

Consider a firm owning a cost-reducing innovation. It can increase its own profits by licensing the innovation both to competitors and to non-competitors. In the former case, the patentee is said to be an insider innovator, while in the latter case it is an outsider innovator (Sen and Tauman 2007). We consider the case of an insider innovator. The patentee has several options for licensing the innovation to its competitors. Theoretical investigation on patent licensing has typically considered licensing contracts based on the quantity produced by the licensee. Furthermore, literature commonly assumes constant returns to scale. Therefore, under that assumption, the kind of contract scrutinized by theorists typically consists in per-unit royalties, alone or combined with fixed fees (two-part tariffs), where “per-unit royalties” means that the licensee pays to the patentee a certain royalty per any unit it sells. The typical result is that per-unit royalty is preferred to fixed fee by the patentee (Wang 1998; Wang and Yang 1999; Poddar and Sinha 2004; Filippini 2005). As expected, two-part tariffs perform even better, but they may decrease welfare (Faulí-Oller and Sandonìs 2002; Colombo 2012). In this paper we extend the literature by considering ad valorem royalty contracts and revenue-royalty contracts, where the price, rather than the quantity, is the basis of the licensing contract. In particular, “ad valorem royalty” means that the patentee extracts a quota of the licensee’s profits in change of the license, whereas “revenue-royalty” means that the patentee extracts a quota of the licensee’s revenues.Footnote 1

Footnote 2
 We assume that the cost function may have various degrees of convexity, and we show that several licensing contracts—two-part per-unit royalty contract, ad valorem royalty contract and revenue-royalty contract—may represent the preferred contract for the patentee, depending on the convexity of the cost function. Therefore, the degree of the convexity of the cost function may contribute to explain the real-world existence of different types of licensing contracts. Indeed, both ad valorem royalties and revenue-royalties are widely diffused in practice.Footnote 3 For example, Bousquet et al. (1998), by studying a dataset of French firms, find that 78 % of contracts include royalties and amongst these, only 4 % are per-unit royalties while 96 % are other types of royalties (ad valorem royalties or revenue-royalties). Another study by Lim and Veugelers (2002) on technology licensing contracts in US shows that at least 20 % of licensing agreements include some forms of ad valorem and revenue-royalty in the payment scheme. Sakakibara (2010) finds that a revenue-royalty scheme is better than a fixed fee payment in representing the patent price in the Japan industry. Macho-Stadler et al. (1996), by using a dataset of 241 licensing contracts in Spain, find that revenue-royalties are more common than per-unit royalties. Niu (2013) reports that the medical firm CSIRO in 2005 licensed an innovative medical device to Polynovo employing ad valorem royalties. Another example of ad valorem royalties is provided by Microsoft, when in 2006 it gave Skinkers the intellectual property rights for the peer-to-peer technology (Niu 2013). Very recently, Johnson and Johnson licensed an experimental ebola vaccine to a Danish vaccine maker, Nord Bavarian, in change of ad valorem royalties.Footnote 4
\(^{,}\)
Footnote 5 On the other hand, revenue-royalties contracts are adopted for exclusive patent licensing agreements between the US state-owned National Renewable Energy Laboratory and its licensees.Footnote 6 Similarly, revenue-royalties are used for those inventions whose intellectual property belongs to the University of California at Davis.Footnote 7 Confindustria (Confederation of the Italian firms) explicitly suggests its members to license their innovations by using either a per-unit royalty contract or a revenue-royalty contract.Footnote 8
 Our main results are the following. In the case of non-drastic innovation,Footnote 9 we find that the patentee prefers adopting ad valorem royalties when the returns to scale are scarcely or highly decreasing, while revenue-royalties are the preferred option when the degree of convexity of the cost function is intermediate-low. When the returns to scale are intermediate-highly decreasing, the preferred option is the two-part per-unit royalty contract. The intuition is the following. For low or high levels of convexity of the cost function, the ad valorem royalty licensing contract allows the patentee to have a great commitment power, that is, the patentee is able to commit to be less aggressive. Therefore, the patentee prefers this licensing method in order to keep the overall quantity low and to extract a quota of the profits from the licensee. When the degree of convexity of the cost function is intermediate-low, revenue-royalties turn out to be the preferred option for the patentee. Indeed, when the production costs go up, the patentee renounces to the commitment power guaranteed by the ad valorem method and prefers passing to revenue-royalties in order not to sustain (part of) the costs of production of the licensee. Finally, when the degree of convexity of the cost function is intermediate-high, the patentee prefers to balance the overall production between itself and the licensee by using a fixed fee together with the per-unit royalty. In this way, it is able to limit an excessive increase of the costs of production. In the case of drastic innovation, the ad valorem royalty contract is the preferred licensing mechanism for the patentee. Indeed, under the ad valorem royalty contract the patentee is able to replicate the multiplant monopolist, thus obtaining the highest profits. Few papers introduce convex costs functions in the context of licensing contracts for a cost-reducing innovation. Mukherjee (2014) considers an insider innovator that has to decide how many licenses to sell for a new product, and he finds that, in the presence of a convex cost function, it is better to sell the license to all the potential licensees. The analysis is performed under the hypothesis of per-unit royalties. Sen and Stamatopoulos (2009, 2013) compare fixed fees and per-unit royalties under the hypothesis of decreasing returns to scale, and find that the incidence of positive royalties is inversely related to the economies of scale. However, these papers do not consider alternative kinds of licensing contracts. The remaining of this article proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2 we introduce the model. In Sect. 3 we compare the two-part per unit royalty contract, the ad valorem royalty contract, and the revenue-royalty contract. In Sect. 4 we discuss a pure per-unit royalty contract. In Sect. 5 we consider more complex licensing contracts. Section 5.4 concludes. In “Appendix 1” we provide a numerical simulation of the main results, whereas in “Appendix 2” we discuss a variation of the main model.",17

This simultaneous competition and cooperation is called “co-opetition” (Brandenburger and Nalebuff 1996). For example, mobile phone companies, tourist sites, and food courts share common property resources such as base-station antennas, historic ruins in natural environments, and common dining areas, respectively. The quality of common property resources affects the market size and/or consumers’ willingness to pay for the products or services. Furthermore, the high quality of such resources generates non-excludable benefits for all firms in the industry. Therefore, each firm’s investment in common property resources (e.g., erecting additional base-station antennas, preserving historic ruins and the natural environment, and maintaining a hygienic eating environment) creates public-good benefits that all the firms can enjoy.Footnote 1 Another example is generic advertising for various commodities such as beverages, fruit, and meat and dairy products. Improving product image generates non-excludable benefits for all producers providing the same products. Firms’ investment in product safety is also considered as co-opetive behavior when they share an industry’s collective reputation for product safety.Footnote 2 In the aforementioned examples, firms share the product image as a common property resource and sometimes voluntarily contribute to improving it.Footnote 3
 Is free entry into such co-opetitive industries desirable from a social welfare perspective? To answer this question, we have to identify the following two effects of free entry on social welfare. One is the well-known business stealing effect of entry, which creates production inefficiency in the presence of scale economies (Mankiw and Whinston 1986; Suzumura and Kiyono 1987) and generally leads to socially excessive entry. The other is the effect of entry on the amount of common property resources, which we call the common property effect of entry. On the one hand, an increase in the number of firms may increase the total investment in common property resources. In this case, free entry may result in socially insufficient entry because firms do not consider the positive external effect of their investment in common property resources on other firms. On the other hand, an increase in the number of firms may also exacerbate the under-provision of common property resources, which may lead to a tragedy-of-the-commons situation. For instance, an increase in the number of tourism firms can deteriorate the quality of tourist attractions (such as wild life and historic ruins), which can eventually destroy tourism itself. As Puppim de Oliveira (2003) indicates, locations such as Acapulco in Mexico, the French Riviera and Mallorca and Torremolinos in Spain have faced tourism-related environmental issues. In these cases, the common property effect contributes to socially excessive entry. This leads us to the question of whether the government should regulate or encourage firm entry into the co-opetitive industry. In this study, we formulate a simple model of co-opetition with endogenous entry to present a welfare analysis of free entry equilibrium. In particular, we consider whether the number of firms that can enter a co-opetitive market is excessive or insufficient from the viewpoint of social welfare. We distinguish between two types of investment in common property resources: pre-commitment and non-commitment investments. In the case of non-commitment investment, firms choose their output and investment in the same stage; we call this game a “simultaneous co-opetition game.” In the case of pre-commitment investment, firms determine their investment before they choose their output; we call this a “sequential co-opetition game.” In both games, firms’ entry decisions are made in the first stage. The difference between non-commitment and pre-commitment investments reflects the difference in reversibility and persistency in investment. When investment has long-term impacts and is difficult to reverse (e.g., renovating historic buildings in a tourist area and increasing base-station antennas for mobile phone networks), it has strategic commitment value, which can be described by a sequential co-opetition game. In contrast, when investment has short-term impacts and is easy to reverse (e.g., providing generic advertising in daily newspapers and cleaning shopping malls or food courts), it has no strategic commitment value, which can be described as a simultaneous co-opetition game. We show that whether free entry into a co-opetitive industry is socially excessive or insufficient depends on the relative strength of business stealing and common property effects of entry. The former effect, as indicated by previous studies such as those by Mankiw and Whinston (1986), is based on the fact that an entrant firm does not consider its negative impact on other firms’ profits.Footnote 4 Therefore, when firms face fixed entry (set-up) costs, the business stealing effect leads to the excess entry of firms into the market caused by the socially wasteful replication of entry costs. The latter effect is novel and depends on the effect of entry on the total amount (or quality) of common property resources. An increase in the number of entrants increases the incentive to “free ride” on other firms’ investments in common property resources (public goods). However, the total amount of common property resources may increase because of a rise in the number of entrants. If that is the case, then such entry will generate positive external effects for other firms. Because private firms do not consider the positive externality when deciding whether to enter a market, the common property effect leads to insufficient entry. If market entry results in a reduction in the total amount of common property resources, then such entry will create negative external effects for other firms. In this case, a negative common property effect leads to excess entry. We find that in the simultaneous co-opetition game, an increase in the number of firms increases the total investment in common property resources while reducing individual investment per firm. Thus, the business stealing and common property effects function in opposite directions. In other words, whether free entry is socially excessive or insufficient depends on the relative magnitude of the two effects. In particular, by providing two concrete examples that assume linear and constant elasticity demand, we show that free entry is more likely to result in socially insufficient entry when initial market size as well as investment and production cost are smaller and/or the demand is more elastic. However, the business stealing and common property effects work in the same directions in the sequential co-opetition game, in which investment has a commitment value. The important aspect in this case is that the total investment in common property resources is decreased by an increase in the number of entrants. This is in contrast to the result of the simultaneous co-opetition game, because when investment has a commitment value, an increase in firm’s investments induces rival firms to respond more aggressively by increasing their output in the subsequent stage. Therefore, this pre-commitment effect of investment reduces the incentive to invest in common property resources. Because an increase in the number of rival firms strengthens the pre-commitment effect, the sequential co-opetition game gives rise to a negative common property effect of entry. Therefore, excess entry holds in sequential co-opetition. Interestingly, we show that the excess entry results hold for the sequential co-opetition game even when there are no entry costs caused by the negative common property effect. Our results enrich the established excess entry theorem in theoretical industrial organization literature. The theorem shows that in a Cournot model with homogenous products, free entry is socially excessive when firms incur fixed entry costs.Footnote 5 Our results from the simultaneous co-opetition game suggest that free entry may lead to socially insufficient entry when firms share common property resources that raise industry-wide demand or consumers’ willingness to pay for products. Furthermore, we show that excess entry occurs in the sequential co-opetition game even when there are no entry costs. Existing literature extends the excess entry theorem in various directions. Konishi et al. (1990) extend the traditional Cournot model with free entry to a general equilibrium model and explore Pareto-improving tax-subsidy policies. Incorporating strategic cost-reducing R&D activities into the Cournot model, Okuno-Fujiwara and Suzumura (1993) show that the existence of R&D investment strengthens the tendency of excess entry in a free-entry equilibrium. The critical difference between R&D investment in their study and investment in common property resources in our study is that the former generates private benefits for the investing firm, while the latter generates public benefits for all firms. Recently, Haruna and Goel (2011) and Wang et al. (2015) have also considered the problem of excess entry in the presence of cost-reducing R&D with spillovers. Our sequential co-opetition game with linear demand is iso-morphic to the case of R&D with perfect spillovers in Haruna and Goel (2011) and Wang et al. (2015).Footnote 6 However, our study considers various model specifications, including simultaneous-move model, non-linear demand, and investment cooperation. In particular, we find that the commitment power of investment in common property resources is a key factor determining whether free entry leads to excess or insufficient entry.Footnote 7
 Previous studies have found that free entry can result in socially insufficient entry (Spence 1976; Dixit and Stiglitz 1977; Kühn and Vives 1999; Ghosh and Saha 2007). Ghosh and Morita (2007) consider a vertical relationship in a homogeneous Cournot model and show that free entry in the upstream sector can lead to socially insufficient entry. The driving force behind their insufficient entry result is that entry in the upstream sector has a positive external effect on the downstream sector’s profit. However, the driving force behind our insufficient entry result is that entry may have a positive external effect on other firms’ profits through changes in the quality of common property resources. Incorporating constant elasticity demand into a standard Salop (1979) spatial framework, Gu and Wenzel (2009) show that the excess entry theorem does not hold when the price elasticity of demand is high. Although their study differs from ours in several respects, the conclusions are similar; insufficient entry occurs when price elasticity of demand is high. Therefore, the degree of price elasticity of demand may serve as a guideline for entry regulation policy.Footnote 8
 Using a free-entry oligopoly model, Etro (2006) considers the optimal behavior of a leader firm that can make a strategic precommitment on a “profit enhancing factor” before choosing outputs or prices. In contrast to the case with barriers to entry, when entry is free, the leader can take into account of the effect of its own investment on entry. He shows that the leader firm always undertakes aggressive investment in a market with free entry, and surprisingly, this does not depend on the mode of competition or strategic interaction among firms.Footnote 9 Our definition of co-opetitive investment is similar to the profit-enhancing one in Etro (2006), but there are two important differences. First, the investment in Etro (2006) is undertaken before entry stage, whereas the co-opetitive investment is undertaken after the entry stage. Second, the former can be undertaken only by the leader firm, whereas the co-opetitive investment can be undertaken by all firms, which benefits all firms in the industry. Furthermore, the main objective of Etro (2006) is to consider the optimality of preliminary investment by the leader firm under endogenous entry threats, whereas ours is to consider the welfare evaluation of free entry in a situation where all incumbent firms can (or should) engage in co-opetitive investment. This study is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the basic structure of the model. Section 3 considers a simultaneous co-opetition game, investigates the properties of free-entry equilibrium, and compares it with the second-best. Section 4 investigates the same for a sequential co-opetition game. Section 5 discusses some policy implications and a possible extension of the analysis. Section 6 concludes the study.",9

Sempere-Monerris,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Licensing is an important channel for technology transfer. The returns from technology licensing allow the owner of an invention, that is protected by patent laws, to recover part of its incurred R&D expenses. How profitable can licensing be will depend on how broad or narrow is the target market. Tacit knowledge or know-how also plays an important role in the successful transfer of many innovations, often complementing the transfer of codified knowledge. Our paper is a contribution to the literature on optimal licensing contracts in the presence of moral hazard associated with costly provision of know-how by the licensor. In a setting where the target market consists of a fraction of heterogeneous consumers who have enough valuation for the new product, we want to address the question of whether a licensor will include know-how, and if so, under which conditions the transfer of know-how fails to be complete. The scarce existing evidence on licensing contracts reveals that licensing by means of a fixed fee is less frequently used than royalties or a combination of them.Footnote 1 However, as emphasized by the large existing literature on technology transfer (see, for instance, Teece 1977), contracting for technology involves transaction costs. These costs include the costs of writing contracts as well as the costs of transferring know-how. With regard to international technology transfers, Arora (1996) showed that bundling know-how with other complementary inputs increases the efficiency of contracts. He argues that a successful transfer of technology, especially to firms in developing countries, requires that tacit knowledge complement codified knowledge. Tacit knowledge is intangible or informal knowledge that cannot be put into words, which is transmitted by personal contact and learned by experience. Hence, arm’s-length transactions of know-how are potentially affected by moral hazard problems. Since transferring know-how is costly, the licensor has incentives to spare on the quality or extent of the know-how transferred. On the licensee’s side, it may fail to honor the contract after learning the know-how. The costly efforts to transfer know-how may be observable to the parties, but not verifiable to a third party, and therefore contracts contingent on these efforts are not enforceable in courts. This way, compensation structures become relevant in these inter-firm relationships. Along these lines, Aulakh et al. (1998) document, among other things, that licensor involvement in foreign markets is higher under a royalty-based agreement to ensure appropriate use of know-how, meet quality standards and so on. In this paper we wish to explore optimal know-how transfer in licensing contracts. 
Kamien (1992) provides an excellent survey of the literature on licensing, where optimal licensing policies are reviewed in a game theory framework. Sen and Tauman (2007) provide a general presentation and offer a good overview of the licensing literature. See also Mukherjee (2009) for a survey on technology licensing. Output based royalties are typically used as a response to asymmetric information; they may also be used to induce licensees to reduce output, or as a reaction to moral hazard.Footnote 2 Relevant theoretical justifications for using royalties that allude to informational asymmetries include Gallini and Wright (1990), Macho-Stadler and Pérez-Castrillo (1991) and Beggs (1992). In Marjit and Mukherjee (2001) the quality of the technology is private information. These authors consider alternative ways of international technology transfer to show that a pure technology licensing agreement is not always preferred. Incumbent innovators have a preference for royalty licensing in order to control for competition intensity, as in Wang (1998), Kamien and Tauman (2002), and Mukherjee and Pennings (2006), to mention a few. More related to our work is the literature on licensing with moral hazard. Macho-Stadler et al. (1996) and Choi (2001), in a setting with one-sided and double-sided moral hazard, respectively, show that the optimal contract between a licensor and a licensee will typically include royalties so as to provide the parties with the right incentives to undertake effort. Our model is thus a contribution to the licensing literature as we characterize the optimal licensing contract in the presence of costly provision of know-how by the licensor. Our analysis can also be related to the existing literature on the endogenous provision of technology quality with costly technology transfer. The recent paper by Mukherjee and Tsai (2015) features a licensing model with an incumbent innovator, who chooses to license its technology at a certain quality level; higher quality entails lower licensee’s marginal cost, but this is at the expense of higher transfer cost. They show that firms profit and social welfare are higher under a two-part tariff contract that includes an output royalty. The royalty included in the licensing contract induces a higher quality level transfer, although the best technology is not necessarily transferred. In contrast to Mukherjee and Tsai (2015), we consider a product innovation that is licensed by an external licensor where the provision of know-how is endogenous and reduces the marginal production costs. In line with the extant literature on know-how, we assume that its level is observable to the licensor and the licensee but not to third parties, so it is not included in the licensing contract.Footnote 3 Additionally, and regarding demand, only a certain consumer segment may purchase the licensed product. When the relevant market is too thin, the licensor’s incentives to transfer know-how are limited by the restriction of selling to all consumers. This conditions the optimal terms of payment and the level of know-how transferred, leading to non-monotonicity between the size of the target market and the level of know-how transferred. We show that, no matter how thin the target market, know-how transfer always takes place. The optimal licensing contract includes a royalty on sales, which is non-increasing with the size of the target market. However, know-how transfer can be full or partial, where full implies that marginal production cost becomes zero. Specifically, parameter configurations with low enough maximum willingness to pay and high enough convexity of know-how cost are sufficient conditions that entail partial instead of full know-how transfer. If those conditions are not satisfied then the thinness of the target market explains when partial instead of full know-how transfer is implemented. Full transfer is chosen more frequently as it becomes less costly. Finally, it is also shown that the effective (inclusive of the royalty) marginal cost exceeds the one when know-how transfers do not occur. These results are particularly relevant for developing countries, since understanding the efficiency of different channels of technology transfer—see Saggi (2002) and Maskus (2004) for surveys—has very important welfare implications. In particular, we add another explanation for the lack of transfer of the best technology available and point at a potential inefficiency in this process as it leads to a higher effective marginal cost once technology payments are included. Other examples that preclude the licensing of the best technology can be found in Rockett (1990), Kabiraj and Marjit (1993) and Feess et al. (2009). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 begins by describing the model and assumptions. Different subsections characterize the equilibrium choice of production, know-how transfer and contract terms, before presenting the main results and intuition. Some concluding remarks close the paper.",5

The vast and increasing literature on mixed oligopolies dates back to Merrill and Schneider (1966), and now comprehends a large array of questions.Footnote 1 In particular, this study investigates long-run competition and collusion in a mixed oligopoly. On one hand, long-run competition in mixed oligopolies has been studied in the context of partial privatization by Matsumura and Kanda (2005), Fujiwara (2007) and Cato and Matsumura (2012). Matsumura and Kanda (2005) and Fujiwara (2007) consider the case of free-entry of private firms, and they are mainly interested in the effects of the degree of privatization of the public firm on the total welfare when goods are homogeneous and differentiated, respectively, whereas Cato and Matsumura (2012) investigate the long-run effect of foreign penetration in home markets on the optimal privatization policy of the public firm. On the other hand, collusion between private firms in a super-game context has received constant attention by scholars. For example, Chang (1991, 1992) and Hackner (1995) investigate the impact of product differentiation on collusion sustainability, Motta and Polo (2003) and Ishibashi and Shimizu (2010) explore the impact of leniency programs on the collusive behaviour of private firms, Friedman and Thisse (1993), Posada and Straume (2004) and Colombo (2011) consider partial collusion, whereas Lambertini and Schultz (2003) and Albaek and Lambertini (2004) investigate the choice of the strategic variable in a context of colluding private firms. In the present article, we consider a situation where a number of private firms are trying to constitute a cartel when also a non-colluding public or semi-public firm is competing in the same market. Indeed, the private firms have the incentive to collude in order to obtain greater profits even when they operate in industries where public firms act as well. For example, a recent antitrust case handled by the Italian Antitrust Authority (ref. I743-AGCM) involved four independent private firms carrying passengers to and from Sardinia, and competing against a public-owned company that did not participate to the collusive agreement. In the Netherlands, Dijkgraaf and Gradus (2007) document the existence of collusion between private firms in the waste collection market. Notably, in this market, private firms compete not only with each other, but also with public companies. Therefore, collusion between private firms is not a priori prevented by the presence of public firms in the same market. Starting from these observations, we investigate the impact of a public firm on the conditions for the sustainability of collusion between the private firms. While the literature on the conditions for collusion sustainability is rich, the role played by a public firm in such a context has not been investigated yet.Footnote 2
 Therefore, we posit the following question: does the existence of a public or semi-public firm favor the collusion between private firms? To answer this question, we develop a parsimonious model of collusion in a dynamic game. There are two private firms that try to set up a cartel. However, there is also another firm which does not participate to the cartel. As in Matsumura (1998), the government owns a positive proportion of the shares of the non-colluding firm. Therefore, the non-colluding firm takes into consideration both its own profits and the social welfare: by varying the weight attached to each of these two components in the firm’s objective function, we cover all the intermediate cases between the two extreme situations where the non-colluding firm is a purely private firm or a purely public firm. We analyse how variations of the public quota in the non-colluding firm affect the sustainability of collusion between the private firms. We find that increasing the public ownership of the non-colluding firm may increase or decrease collusion sustainability between the private firms. In particular, when the products are strongly substitutable, the existence of a public or semi-public firm that does not participate to the cartel makes the punishment in the case of a deviation from the agreement harsher and it makes the deviation less profitable. This helps sustaining collusion, as it makes the conditions for collusion sustainability milder. The opposite holds when the products are weak substitutes. The rest of this article proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2 we introduce a simple model with two colluding private firms and one non-colluding public or semi-public firm.

118.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,16 March 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-016-0477-5,"Nonprofit organizations, free media and donor’s trust",July 2016,Maja Adena,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In 2007, UNICEF Deutschland, one of the biggest and most well-known nonprofit organizations (NPOs) in Germany, was accused of nepotism, of having made dubious and expensive arrangements with private fund-raising agencies without written contracts, of paying suspiciously high consultant fees, which went partly to the former employees, and of the costly rebuilding of its headquarters in Cologne. The story was uncovered by a German newspaper, the Frankfurter Rundschau. Between December 2007 and April 2008, UNICEF Deutschland lost the trust of 38,000 of its individual members, worth roughly €22 million in yearly donations. Many corporate donors also revoked their donation agreements.Footnote 1
 This and other recent scandals show that there is a serious problem in the nonprofit sector. Because the donors are not the beneficiaries, they cannot estimate how much of their donation reaches the needy and how much trickles away as fund-raising and administrative costs or even as agency fees and private expenses. Although many of the nonprofit organizations seem to be devoted to achieving their chosen charitable goal to the best of their abilities, some of them, however, seek to maximize the amount of money in their own pocket. Cutlip (1990) describes the situation in the following way: Cruel exploitation of man’s urge to help his less fortunate fellow man is an ancient evil. \(\ldots \) In the early centuries of philanthropy the charity frauds were perpetrated mostly by the itinerant beggars, making false claims in their tearful appeal for alms, or of local fund appeals of questionable merit. \(\ldots \)[W]ith the advent of America’s twentieth-century surefire methods of fund raising and multibillion-dollar philanthropy, dishonest and wasteful fund raising has become a serious social problem (Cutlip 1990, p. 441). The solutions to the problem of asymmetric information proposed and implemented for typical consumer goods might not work for the nonprofit sector.Footnote 2 The reason is that the notion of quality is a very subjective one and there are few legal rules for how the money collected should be spent. This is intentional, as governments aim to increase private involvement, believing that such nonprofit organizations better understand how to help the needy. Governments do not want to restrict nonprofit activities with too much regulation. This allows “bad” nonprofit organizations to abuse the trust they are granted by the donors. Therefore, in the absence of any other mechanism revealing true quality, donors’ decisions about the amount of charitable giving must be based on the expected quality. If the level of trust is low, such that a good organization cannot cover its costs, then a complete market collapse is probable. Nevertheless, the size of the third sector is, at least in some countries, large. For example, in the US it amounted to $241 billion in 2002 (Andreoni 2006), in the Netherlands it makes up 4.95 % of GDP, whereas in Mexico it is only 0.12 % (Salamon and Sokolowski 2004). Among different possible reasons for those cross-country differences, the available information about NPOs is likely to be very important. The relevant information is provided by certifying and watchdog agencies, and by the media. Media organizations can spread information about (subjective) misconduct very quickly, and therefore severely punish an organization that relies on private contributions. In the words of Brunetti and Weder (2003) “[A]ny independent journalist has a strong incentive to investigate and uncover stories on wrongdoing.” Investigative journalism increases the probability of revealing a “bad” NPO and reduces its incentives for entering the market. What are the incentives for the media per se? The main product that they sell is news. Qualitatively good, interesting, scandalous and timely news attracts new readers and encourages loyalty among current readers. This in turn increases circulation and revenue from advertising. Furthermore, a journalist’s career concerns and private motives of the watchdog ethos may play an important role as well. Big organizations might get more attention from national and international media. Small, regional nonprofit organizations may be of interest to the regional media. This paper shows how media contributes to more transparency in the nonprofit sector. It shows that media, and especially more competition among media organizations, reduces the incentives of “bad” organizations to enter the market, thus increasing donors’ trust and the level of public good. However, the media is never able to completely deter the “bad” type from entering the market. The explanation for this is the following: if the probability of the “bad” type entering the market is zero, it does not pay off to investigate the market. Without the probability of being detected, “bad” types of organizations, expect profits and certainly enter the market. This paper contributes to the less examined research field that investigates the incentives and behavior of nonprofit organizations. Moreover, it contributes to the discussion of the performance-enhancing role of the media in the economy by highlighting the importance of media competition and freedom. Section 2 contains a literature review. Section 3 presents some empirical underpinning based on real world data on giving and press freedom. The fourth section of the paper is devoted to the development of a formal model. The last section concludes.",4

119.0,1.0,Journal of Economics,13 April 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-016-0483-7,Two ways to auction off an uncertain good,September 2016,Alison Watts,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"There are many goods whose availability is uncertain to both buyers and sellers in advance such as agricultural products and even bandwidth in radio spectrum sharing. Such goods can be sold either before availability is known to the seller or after availability is known to the seller. In fact, agricultural products and radio spectrum are each sold both ways.Footnote 1 However, it is unclear as to which method is preferable to buyers and/or sellers. To investigate this issue, we examine the expected payoffs to both buyers and sellers as well as the expected social welfare to determine how the timing of such sales affects payoffs. Agricultural products are known for their uncertain production as they can be greatly affected by the weather and other forces of nature. In particular, consider the market for local produce. Such produce is commonly purchased through either a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) share or at a farmer’s market; see Brown and Miller (2008). A CSA share is usually purchased at the beginning of the growing season and entitles the buyer to a share of the farm’s produce on a weekly basis for the duration of the growing season. The inherent risk involved in farming is then shared between the farmer and buyer. If the farm is subject to early or late freezes, unusually hot weather, or other factors that may affect production the buyer receives less produce than expected, but is not reimbursed for the loss; thus, the produce is sold before its availability is known to either the buyer or the seller; see Wilkinson (2001). The buyer may decide instead to simply purchase local produce at a farmer’s market where the availability of the produce is known at the time of the sale, and the farmer may decide to sell his produce this way if he thinks profits will be higher. Bandwidth in radio spectrum sharing is another good with uncertain availability; see Kasbekar and Sarkar (2011). Here primary users of the spectrum have licenses to use a given frequency. However, such primary users do not use the spectrum all of the time; see Engelman et al. (2002) and McHenry et al. (2006). Secondary (or non-licensed) users would like to access the spectrum when it is not in use.Footnote 2 In such a situation, the primary user could sell spectrum access to a secondary user. However, there is a chance that the primary user will need to use the spectrum himself and will not have any spectrum available to rent out. Thus, he could sell the spectrum to a secondary user either before he knows of its availability or he could sell the spectrum in real time so that availability is known at the time of purchase.Footnote 3
\(^,\)
Footnote 4 Such a secondary spectrum market is crucial for future spectrum access as PCAST (2012) estimates the number of devices connected to mobile networks could increase to 50 billion by 2020 from 5 billion in 2011. Thus, it is important to have a mechanism that mutually motivates both primary and secondary users to share the spectrum as there is a need for more efficient spectrum access; see Engelman et al. (2002), Wang et al. (2010), and Maharjan et al. (2011). Here we consider an auction framework where sellers auction off an uncertain good. Each seller has one unit of a good available with some positive probability and each buyer would like to purchase one unit. Two ways in which the sellers can auction off such an uncertain good are considered. The first is an ex-post auction which takes place after each seller learns whether or not he has a unit available to sell. The second is an ex-ante auction which takes place before the seller learns whether or not a unit is available. Both auctions used are simultaneous ascending bid auctions and it is well known that these auctions generate the lowest competitive market clearing price; see Bulow and Klemperer (1996). One can interpret an ascending bid auction as approximating prices in markets where a formal auction does not take place such as the market for local produce. Lemma 1 gives conditions under which no buyer purchases multiple expected units in the ex-ante auction. In the ex-ante case, the item auctioned off is an expected unit of the good not an actual unit. It is possible that a bidder will want to buy multiple expected units to guarantee that he ends up with an actual unit. In fact, such a buyer could end up with multiple actual units, but that buyer will only use one actual unit.Footnote 5 Such over purchasing creates a loss to society since not all of the product is indeed used. (In the case of cell phone service, if not all of the channels are used, then those which are used could be more crowded resulting in longer wait times to transmit or receive data.) Thus, it is important to know when such over purchasing can be ruled out. Proposition 3 shows that both social welfare and each seller’s expected payoff are higher in the ex-post auction than in the ex-ante auction, assuming that the conditions which rule out over purchasing in the ex-ante auction are met. Sellers expect to be better off with the ex-post auction even though not all sellers will end up with an item available to sell; since, when fewer units are actually available, these units are sold at a high price. While in the ex-ante auction all sellers sell an expected unit; thus, the number of expected units for sale is large which results in a low price. Social welfare is higher in the ex-post auction, because it is more likely that the buyer who values the good the most ends up with an actual unit. In the ex-ante auction, such a buyer always ends up with an expected unit, but may not always end up with an actual unit. A buyer is better off with the ex-post auction, if the buyer has a relatively high valuation of the unit and if the distribution of values makes it less likely that other buyers have high valuations. Such a buyer can expect to win a unit in the ex-post auction at a low price. A buyer is better off with the ex-ante auction, if his valuation is relatively low or if there are many high value buyers. Such a buyer is less likely to win a unit in the ex-post auction, but may still win an expected unit in the ex-ante auction. The current paper is related to the literature on English auctions. We use a standard ascending bid auction as discussed in the classic auction papers of Vickrey (1961), Milgrom and Weber (1982), and Riley and Samuelson (1981). However, the most closely related auction papers are Ausubel (2004) and Kranton and Minethart (2001). We borrow Kranton and Minethart (2001)’s ascending bid auction framework of multiple sellers simultaneously auctioning off units to multiple bidders. We borrow Ausubel (2004)’s ascending bid auction with clinching framework for the ex-ante auction when bidders may bid on multiple expected units. The current paper is also related to the auction literature dealing with stochastic supply; see Jeitschko (1999), Neugebauer and Pezanis-Christou (2007), and Babaioff et al. (2010). In Jeitschko (1999), there is a sequential auction of multiple items with unknown supply and each bidder wants to buy 1 unit. Conditions are given under which the expected price decreases as the price of the bids in the first auction take into account the discounted expected payoff in the second auction. This auction is somewhat similar to our ex-post auction, but differs since our auction takes place simultaneously not sequentially. For additional discussion of imperfect quantity commitment in sequential auctions see Rodriguez (2012) and Zeithammer (2009). Neugebauer and Pezanis-Christou (2007) examines supply uncertainty in a first price bid framework. While Babaioff et al. (2010) examines truthful mechanisms (or auctions) in an uncertain supply framework for online bidding. For an experimental analysis on the efficiency of using auctions to allocate uncertain goods, see Banks et al. (1989). Additionally, there is a large literature in electrical engineering which builds algorithms and/or mechanisms to implement secondary spectrum auctions occurring in real time with various properties such as incentive compatibility, reduction in communication overhead, or choice of transmitting power to name a few. See Chun and La (2013), Gandhi et al. (2007), and Zhang et al. (2013) for a literature review. However, most of this literature ignores the uncertainty regarding the availability of bandwidth. Uncertainty is examined by Kasbekar (2011) and Kasbekar and Sarkar (2011) whose analysis focuses on Bertrand style price competition among primary license holders. Thus, we add to this literature by examining the effect of uncertainty and the timing of secondary spectrum auctions on efficiency. There is also a large literature on the auctioning off of primary spectrum licenses. This work began with Coase (1959) and is eloquently reviewed by McMillan (1994). In Milgrom (2000), simultaneous ascending auctions are developed for the sale of primary radio spectrum licenses where bidding behavior will depend on whether or not the bidder thinks the licenses are substitutes for each other or complements. However, there is a lack of economics literature on the sale of secondary spectrum rights. An exception includes Milgrom (2011) who advocates for keeping some spectrum bands unlicensed as a catalyst for innovation. The paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2 the model is presented along with a description of the two auctions. The main results and payoff comparisons are presented in Sect. 3. A brief conclusion and discussion of possible extensions is presented in Sect. 4.",3

119.0,1.0,Journal of Economics,04 May 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-016-0485-5,Interlocking cross-ownership in a unionised duopoly: when social welfare benefits from “more collusion”,September 2016,Luciano Fanti,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Two important stylised facts regarding especially oligopolistic industries are the widespread presence of unionised labour marketsFootnote 1 and interlocking cross-shareholdings. These facts have been extensively—but so far only separately—investigated. By contrast, in this paper the relationship between cross-ownership and unionisation in a Cournot duopoly is investigated, in particular focusing on the effects of this relationship on social welfare. Most studies consider a very simple ownership structure with only one shareholder having participation in both firms.Footnote 2 In reality there are more complex kinds of cross-shareholdings: for instance, one may find “cross-participations” with each firm possessing a small amount of shares of the other (i.e. two-sided cross-ownership), or “multiple participation” with more complex direct as well as indirect links (e.g. Gilo and Spiegel 2003; Dietzenbacher and Temurshoev 2008). The case of bilateral participations in rival firms occurs fairly frequently. Thus in this paper a unionised Cournot duopoly with mutual (two-sided) cross-participation at ownership level comes under study. Since it is well established that, from a social welfare perspective, greater competition is always preferred and cross-ownership among competing firms reduces competition in the market (e.g. Farrell and Shapiro 1990; Reitman 1994), then common wisdom argues that the higher the share of cross-ownership, the lower the resulting social welfare. Since the relationship between welfare, two-sided cross-ownership and unionisation has not so far, to the best of our knowledge, been fully explored, this paper questions whether the common wisdom that the anticompetitive effect of an interlocking cross-ownership reduces social welfare still holds under the presence of firm-specific monopolistic unions, that is when wages are the outcome of a strategic game in line with the rising literature on unionised oligopolies (e.g. Dowrick 1989; Horn and Wolinsky 1988; Naylor 1999; Correa-Lopez and Naylor 2004; Fanti and Meccheri 2011). Cases of decentralised firm-specific unions are likely to arise in (1) countries with very decentralised bargaining structures such as the US, Japan and the UK, and (2) in markets separated by geographic and cultural spaces which act as obstacles to cooperation between unions.Footnote 3 In particular, as evidenced by Iversen (1998) analysing 15 OECD countries from 1973 to 1995, plant- and firm-level unions predominated (with some elements of industry-level unions) in the United States (1973–1993), Canada (1973–1995), Italy (1973–1975, 1979–1992), France (1973–1980, 1985–1995), Britain (1979–1995) and also in Japan (1973–1995), where, although national associations negotiate central agreements with some capacity for enforceability, industry-level organisations retain the right to bargain separate agreements without adherence to a peace clause. In the above countries not only firm-level unions but also interlocking cross-ownership between major companies commonly occur. Two typical examples of bilateral cross-ownership can be found, for instance as regards France and Japan, in the automobile industry and in the steel industry, respectively,Footnote 4 but there are many other examples regarding countries with significant firm-level unions.Footnote 5
 The paper develops a two-stage game. In stage 1, since both firms are unionised, unions’ choices take place simultaneously across firms: each firm-specific union sets the wage taking the wage of the other firm as given and taking into account how its decision will affect the competitiveness of its firm in the subsequent product market game.Footnote 6 In stage 2, by playing a non-cooperative Cournot oligopolistic game, firms’ owners choose their levels of output and employment, taking wages as determined in the prior stage. We proceed, as usual, by backward induction. As regards the output game, the essential feature of the existence of two-sided cross-ownership is that both firms behave “more collusively” (that is each firm internalises the fact that both firms compete in the product market) and when the mutual cross-ownership share approaches 50 %, they equally share monopolistic profits.Footnote 7
 The collusive behaviour of firms in the product market affects the firm-specific union’s behaviour, in the sense that each union is forced to dampen—with an extent depending on its members’ risk-aversion—its own wage claims. In particular, it is shown that interlocking cross-ownership is a “device” through which firms’ owners may dampen wage claims until to the elimination of the union’s rent. The main result is that, despite the degree of competition is reduced by cross-ownership, both consumer surplus and social welfare may increase with the share of mutual cross-participation, and this occurs even if the unions’ members are fairly “risk-averse” and thus their wage claims would tend to be low by itself.Footnote 8
 This unconventional welfare result occurs because mutual cross-ownerships reduce unions’ wage claims and thus, through reduced wage costs, may indirectly expand output to a greater extent than the output reduction directly induced by “more collusion”.Footnote 9 Moreover, it is shown that this result qualitatively holds also for the cases of product differentiation, Bertrand competition between firms and triopoly. Therefore, this finding, showing that social welfare benefits from the anticompetitive practice of mutual interlocking cross-ownership, offers an interesting anti-trust policy implication.Footnote 10
 The rest of the article is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the basic Cournot duopoly model, along with the equilibrium analysis. In Sect. 3, the union’s wage setting is presented and the basic model is extended with firm-specific unions. In Sect. 4 the welfare analysis is presented and the main result—that consumer surplus and social welfare increase with an increasing two-sided cross-ownership—is shown and discussed; furthermore, also the cases of (i) heterogeneous products, (ii) Bertrand competition and (iii) triopoly are briefly discussed. Section 5 concludes.",10

Their relative efficacy has been investigated previously. Pennings (2000) showed how a government can speed up irreversible investment at zero expected cost. This can be done by subsidising the initial investment cost and by charging a positive tax on future profits generated by the project. Pennings (2005) investigated the investment decision of a foreign monopolist, which may either export or set up productive capacity in a host country in order to serve the local market. Under investment irreversibility and demand uncertainty, he showed that domestic benefits are maximised by strongly subsidising the initial investment and by absorbing, through taxation, the benefits exceeding the gains from exporting. Yu et al. (2007) considered the impact on the timing of foreign direct investment associated with an entry cost subsidy and a reduced tax rate in a study where the two measures were considered separately and then compared. It was found that in order to speed up investment, the government should opt for an entry cost subsidy, since this is less costly and more effective than a tax reduction. Summing up, when it comes to speeding up private investment initiative, a subsidy seems to be preferable to a tax reduction. Sarkar (2012) represents the only exception in this regard: by simply allowing the government’s discount (or borrowing) rate to be different from the private firm’s discount rate, he shows that if the difference between the two rates is sufficiently large, a tax reduction may be preferable to an investment subsidy. In this paper we study the efficacy of these two policy measures in a novel frame where we allow for the presence of government present-biased time preferences. Short-sightedness can, as well known, be easily justified in contexts where, for instance, the government preferences are characterized by imperfect intergenerational altruism (see e.g. Phelps and Pollak 1968) or biased by the consideration of political turnover (see e.g. Amador 2003; Aguiar and Amador 2011). By incorporating this assumption into a basic real-option model, we are able to show that the result favouring the adoption of an investment subsidy may be reversed in favour of a tax reduction. In the analysis, government was viewed as an infinite sequence of hyperbolic discounting agents, utility of which depends on future agents’ utility, and this assumption was incorporated into a standard real-option model à la Pennings (2000) where, differently from Sarkar (2012), the government discounts future pay-offs at a time-declining rate. Within this frame, the net benefit accruing to the government was examined and the conditions under which the result favouring the adoption of an investment subsidy may be reversed in favour of a tax reduction were determined. The reasoning behind this approach is straightforward. The government, when selecting the instrument to be used for speeding up investment, trades off the immediate and certain cost of a subsidy against the random tax revenues accruing from the investment. Hence, from the short-sighted perspective of current government, setting a lower profit tax rate may appear optimal as long as: (i) the consideration given to the earnings of future governments is small and/or (ii) the current government’s duration is short. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the basic model, while Sect. 3 compares tax reduction and investment subsidy and determines the conditions under which one of these instruments may be preferable to the other. Section 4 provides some general conclusions.",6

Panteghini,Sergio Vergalli,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The last decade has been characterized by the well-known Great Recession which caused a substantial increase in financial instability.Footnote 1 In 2008, the G20 committed to a broad range of policy reforms that addressed the major fault lines that caused the crisis. At the same time, many Governments introduced fiscal stimulus packs aimed mainly at stimulating investment during the recession. Almost contemporaneously, a part of the relevant literature has been studying the effects of taxation on firms’ choices, thereby analyzing the interactions between financial and start-up decisions in a dynamic context (with or without complete information).Footnote 2 Other articles have focused on the neutrality properties of taxation in a real-option setting,Footnote 3. as well as the non-linear tax effects on investment (e.g., Gries et al. (2012)). Despite the growing interest in these topics, only Mauer and Ott (1995) have analyzed the effect of tax depreciation allowances on investment decisions. However, they only focused on an equity-financed investment, thereby disregarding default risk.Footnote 4
 In this article we aim to study the effects of tax depreciations allowances on both real and financial decisions. In particular, we will focus on a representative firm that can decide when to invest and how much to borrow, under default risk. This joint analysis allows to understand the effects of accelerated depreciation allowances in a risky environment. Given the capital structure of a firm, it is straightforward to show that accelerated depreciation stimulates investment. This means that, due to the tax benefit, a firm decides to invest with a lower initial EBIT. Coeteris paribus however, a lower EBIT implies a higher probability of default. If this is true, accelerated depreciation may cause an increase in bankruptcies and thus lead to higher systemic risk. Our model shows that, using realistic parameter values, accelerated depreciation delays the event of default. This result has an interesting policy implication: generous tax depreciation allowances are expected to stimulate investment without increasing systemic risk. The structure of this article is as follows. In Sect. 2, we develop a continuous-time model describing a representative firm that can decide both investment timing and the capital structure. Since the relationship between investment and financial choices is non-linear, we cannot find a closed-form solution. For this reason, Sect. 3 provides a numerical analysis aimed at studying how tax depreciation allowances affect both investment and financial decisions. Section 4 summarizes our findings and discusses their policy implications.",11

In particular, the functional representation of the several facets of separability (for instance, Houthakker 1960; Pollak 1972; Gorman 1976; Blackorby et al. 1978) resulted in a fundamental line of progress for microeconomic theory in general, and duality theory in particular. The significance of separability has been sharply pointed out by Gorman (1976): separability has to do with the “natural structure” of a choice problem. As long pointed out, in a number of relevant cases, choice problems can be assumed to consist of a series—perhaps a hierarchy—of subproblems that can be dealt with “in at least partial isolation from each other” (ivi, p. 224), possibly, budgeting problems concerning consumption aggregates. Such separations have been thoroughly addressed in terms of the functional structure of objective functions (direct and indirect utility functions, cost and distance functions: Blackorby et al. 1978). Noticeably, recent geometrical advances in the analysis of preferences (Tyson 2013; Mantovi 2013) point at the symmetries of preferences as a promising direction for deepening the “natural structure” of a choice problem. It is the aim of the present contribution to set forth a number of advances in such respects, meant to exploit the powerful analytical language of vector fields.Footnote 2
 On the one hand, Mantovi (2013) introduces, among other things, the expansion
vector field on consumption space, whose integral curves define a scaling parametrization of income expansion paths, thereby sheding new light on the benchmark relevance of homothetic models, in connection with the commutativity of finite expansion and substitution effects. On the other hand, Tyson (2013) introduces symmetries of preferences as transformations of choice space which do preserve the preference relation, and then symmetry vector fields, whose flows embody 1-parameter semigroups of continuous symmetries of such a space. The Author characterizes such symmetries in terms of partial differential equation (PDE) systems for the utility representation of preferences, which he applies to univariate, multivariate and joint separability. Building on such premises, it is the aim of the present contributionFootnote 3 to provide further insights on the characterization of symmetry vector fields set forth by Tyson (2013), and establish that symmetry vector fields for multivariate and joint separability have vanishing Lie bracket (a strong analytical condition which shall be given due economic interpretation). Then, we shall find that the marginal utility of money defines a “normalization” of the expansion vector field which results in the fundamental symmetry vector field, whose flow superposes to expansion paths and therefore preserves marginal rates of substitution. Finally, a characterization of symmetry vector fields shall be given with respect to the distance function, thereby complementing Tyson’s results with a perspective on the radial structure of preferences, together with an insightful approach to multivariate separabilty. In addition, we shall gain further insights on the benchmark relevance of the scale symmetry which characterizes homothetic models (think for instance of the conditions for the existence of a cost of living index: Samuelson and Swamy 1974; Gorman 1976), which share the same expansion vector field, namely, the generator of scale transformations (formula 1 below). True, the relevance of preference symmetries does extend beyond the problem of separability. In first instance, on conceptual grounds, recall that the significance of preferences and utility functions is not confined to the microeconomic representation of static consumption problems. For instance, one can consider the macroeconomic models encompassing utility functions over intertemporal consumption aggregates (for instance Barro 2001), or the utility functions representing the tradeoff between consumption and leisure (for instance, King et al. 1988). Such examples enlighten the relevance of preference symmetries in the representation of significant policy problems. A (public) policy is typically an investment of (public) resources meant to pursue definite goals, as gauged by some welfare index. It is often the case that the properties of the preferences of a representative agent, or of heterogeneous agents, are employed in the very representation of the policy problem. In such respects, the relevance is well known of employing analytically tractable functional forms (the Cobb-Douglas case stands out in such respects); true, the symmetries of the problem at hand may represent the bottom line of the modelling process: one can consider for instance the symmetry requirements discussed by Kimball and Shapiro (2008) for the consumption-leisure tradeoff. In addition, the reversibility aspects of a policy framework may be strongly connected with the assumptions on the preferences of agents, as discussed by Mantovi (2013) for the commutativity of finite expansion and substitution effects.Footnote 4 All in all, the symmetries of utility functions seem to represent a relevant line of inquiry for both micro- and macro- economic analysis. The plan of the rest of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we introduce symmetry vector fields and establish a few original results. In Sect. 3 we introduce our expansion vector field, and in Sect. 4 we discuss the fundamental expansion-symmetry vector field. In Sect. 5 we characterize symmetry vector fields via the distance function, and discuss a pair of insightful examples. A final section sketches potential lines of progress of our approach. Appendix 1 provides a short introduction to vector fields and Lie brackets. Appendix 2 addresses a technical result, upon which a fundamental lemma in the main text builds.",1

The literature on mixed oligopolies focused on quantity-setting games (e.g. Harris and Wiens 1980; Beato and Mas-Colell 1984; Cremer et al. 1989; De Fraja and Delbono 1989; Matsumura and Okumura 2013) or on heterogeneous goods price-setting games (e.g. Bárcena-Ruiz 2007). A homogeneous good price-setting mixed duopoly was investigated by Balogh and Tasnádi (2012). Concerning the simultaneous-move game, the current paper extends their findings obtained for duopolies to oligopolies. The importance of considering a homogeneous good market in the price-setting mixed oligopoly framework can be underlined by the fact that the oligopolistic extension and the homogeneous good assumption might be useful in modeling energy markets, especially electricity markets since the storage of electricity is difficult and expensive, capacity constraints play a natural role,Footnote 1 and in many countries state-owned firms are present on these markets. The main reason why the Bertrand–Edgeworth model has not been applied to these markets is the lack of explicit results (see for example Bompard et al. 2010). Furthermore, homogeneous good markets play a crucial role in the quantity-setting framework, and therefore it seems natural to establish analogous results for the homogeneous good price-setting case before investigating heterogeneous good price-setting oligopolies for which there are results already available.Footnote 2
 Probably the mixed homogeneous good price-setting oligopoly has not been analyzed so far because of the difficulties in characterizing and determining the equilibrium of its standard counterpart with purely private firms. Although the equilibrium of the relatively simple symmetric oligopoly game with identical firms was solved by Vives (1986), the equilibrium of the general triopolistic case was obtained only recently, independently by Hirata (2009) and De Francesco and Salvadori (2008). In case of \(n\ge 4\), the full characterization of the equilibrium is still incomplete but some of its important properties were derived by De Francesco and Salvadori (2008), which enable us to compare the purely private oligopoly with the mixed oligopoly in terms of social surplus. While in the homogeneous good price-setting game with purely private firms a pure-strategy equilibrium fails to exist for a wide range of capacities (see, for instance, Dasgupta and Maskin 1986; Vives 1986) we show that its mixed version has a pure-strategy equilibrium for a much wider range of capacities. In addition, if the price-setting oligopoly game with purely private firms has an equilibrium in non-degenerated mixed strategies, we prove that the presence of a public firm is strictly social surplus increasing whenever in the latter case a pure-strategy equilibrium exists, which holds if the public firm is sufficiently large. The social surplus increasing effect of a social surplus maximizing firm is far from obvious, since in their seminal paper De Fraja and Delbono (1989) established in the framework of a mixed quantity-setting oligopoly that social surplus may be higher when a public firm maximizes its profit rather than social surplus (for similar results in the heterogeneous goods framework, see Footnote 2). Besides extending the results obtained by Balogh and Tasnádi (2012) from duopolies to oligopolies another interesting feature of having more than two firms in the market is that one Pareto inferior type of Nash equilibrium vanishes when we move from two to more firms. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the framework, in Sect. 3 we recall the results of De Francesco and Salvadori (2008), which will serve as a benchmark in our analysis. Section 4 contains the characterization of the pure-strategy equilibria, and also a sufficient condition for its existence. Section 5 summarizes the results and mentions some possible directions for further research.",3

Thanks to its versatility and flexibility, indeed, this model is now widely employed to analyze a number of different issues related to long-run economic growth and ranging, for example, from international technology diffusion and trade to cross-country productivity differences, financial development and fluctuations, see Gancia and Zilibotti (2005). The distinctive feature of this paradigm is to regard innovation as an increase in the set of available products (either consumption goods/final output, or intermediate inputs), which raises consumers’ utility or manufacturing productivity. In the path-breaking paper by Romer (1990), innovation consists in the creation of a new idea for a new variety of intermediate inputs being employed to produce a single, homogeneous final output. The larger the number of varieties of intermediate inputs, the larger the productivity of all the other inputs that enter the aggregate production function and that are used in conjunction with intermediates, and the higher the growth rate of GDP per capita. In Romer (1990), as well as in most of the successive versions/extensions of his contribution,Footnote 1 however, the aggregate production function for final output is postulated to be homogeneous, with constant returns to scale, and of the CES (Constant Elasticity of Substitution)-type. The fact that the elasticity of substitution between any two generic varieties of intermediate inputs, and therefore the price-elasticity of demand for each type of intermediate, is constant implies that the optimal markup charged by local intermediate monopolistic competitors over their marginal costs of production stays constant, too.Footnote 2 How overly restrictive the consideration of constant markups is appears immediately once one reflects on the circumstance that empirically markups vary not only across countries (Alessandria and Kaboski 2011; Fieler 2011), but also over the business cycle (Nekarda and Ramey 2013). The main objective of the present paper is, thus, to analyze, within a dynamic long-run growth model with horizontal research and development (R&D) activity, the main implications of replacing the assumption of CES production function in the sector that produces consumption goods with that of a non-specified, non-CES technology. As far as we know, the present paper represents the first attempt in this direction within a dynamic, general-equilibrium, horizontal innovation-driven, growth framework. The presence of a non-CES production function in the sector that produces consumption goods yields two important consequences in our analysis. The first is that the standard equilibrium requirement for a competitive sector, i.e. total revenues equal to total costs, which usually follows automatically from the Euler theorem, might not be satisfied. In this regard, we find explicit conditions for a perfect-competition equilibrium in the final output sector to exist. These existence conditions prove to be a generalization of the commonly-used ones under the CES-case. We also show that, if they exist, equilibria based on perfect competition in the final output sector may be described by a curve (the Perfect Competition Curve in the paper) whose form and main properties are explored in detail. Finally, we analyze under which circumstances the equilibrium with perfect competition in the final output sector is unique. The second consequence of using a non-CES technology in the final output sector has to do, as already mentioned, with the possibility of generating quite naturally variable markups in the monopolistically competitive intermediate sector. In this regard, we show that the parameter measuring total factor productivity in the sector that produces consumption goods can affect both the amount of production and the size of the monopolistic markup of a generic intermediate, uncompetitive firm as well as the amount of labor employed at equilibrium by the representative competitive firm operating in the final output sector (i.e., the size of this firm). In more detail, we identify conditions under which an increase in the measure of aggregate productivity in the industry producing final output is conducive to a fall in the size of the final output sector’s firm and to a rise in the gross markup and in the amount of output produced by intermediate firms.Footnote 3 This analysis is important because it ultimately gives us the chance of studying the long-run relationship between variable markups and economic growth in two different cases, price-increasing and price-decreasing competition, respectively.Footnote 4 These two cases cannot be examined under the more traditional assumption of CES aggregate production function. Given that one of the building-blocks of our model is the presence of a monopolistically competitive sector (i.e., the sector producing intermediate inputs), our paper is obviously related to the recent contribution by Zhelobodko et al. (2012). With respect to it, however, our article deviates in two fundamental respects. First of all, we consider the case in which it is the availability of new varieties of intermediates, as opposed to consumer goods, to affect the aggregate production function (instead of the utility of agents), which in turn introduces into our analysis the additional general-equilibrium issue of the sectorial distribution of a common factor-input (labor/human capital in our model). More importantly, we embed our theory within a dynamic framework (the celebrated variety-expansion endogenous growth model), instead of a static setting.Footnote 5 We believe that these two features make our contribution fully original with respect to the whole existing literature, both micro– and macro–based, on the issue. We structure our paper as follows. In Sect. 2 we extend the simplest version of the Romer (1990) modelFootnote 6 by introducing an additive, non-homothetic, non-specified, non-CES, variable elasticity of substitution aggregate production function in the perfectly-competitive sector producing final output. In this section we also analyze the implications of having perfect competition in the final output sector – an assumption shared by most of variety-expansion endogenous growth model – under a non-CES aggregate production function, we introduce what we label Perfect Competition Curve, and study the main properties of such curve. In Sect. 3 we have a closer look at the intermediate-inputs sector and derive the optimal variable markup rate. In Section 4, we describe the model’s short-run equilibria, that is those equilibria obtained under a fixed number of intermediate-inputs varieties. In Sect. 5 the behavior of R&D firms is analyzed, while Sect. 6 characterizes the long-run dynamic equilibria of the model, that is those equilibria obtained under a non-fixed number of intermediate-inputs varieties. In Sect. 6 we also study, within a dynamic context, the consequences of price-increasing and price-decreasing competition for intermediate-input firms’ prices and markups. While in the previous sections of the article we consider the simplest case of the expanding-variety growth paradigm in which labor/human capital is employed solely for producing final output, in Sect. 7 we extend further our analysis to the case where labor/human capital is distributed between the final output and the R&D sectors, respectively. In this section, we also analyze the correlation between variable markups and long-run economic growth under price-increasing and price-decreasing competition. In particular, we show that, depending on the nature of competition in the intermediate sector, the relationship between markups and long-run economic growth is either positive or negative. As usual, the last section (Sect. 8) concludes.",4
120.0,1.0,Journal of Economics,13 May 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-016-0488-2,Endogenous cycles and human capital,January 2017,Dimitrios Varvarigos,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Are there any human capital-based implications on the analysis of economic cycles? Existing studies offer an affirmative reply. Particularly, a considerable body of literature has presented empirical evidence showing that activities that broadly constitute investment in human capital appear to be countercyclical (e.g., Betts and McFarland 1995; Sakellaris and Spilimbergo 2000; Dellas and Sakellaris 2003; Bedard and Herman 2008; Johnson 2013). The argument that is put forward to elucidate the distinctively countercyclical nature of human capital investment is at the same time indicative of the causal effect at work: According to conventional wisdom, periods of weak economic activity are exactly those periods where the opportunity cost of devoting time or effort towards the improvement of human capital, rather than earning labour income, is low. Thus, according to this argument, the movements of output above or below its trend represent the generating cause of variations in activities that promote human capital, such as formal education, skill acquisition etc. This paper takes the view that the dynamic implications from this argument are far more pervasive to what has hitherto been assumed. By inducing the reduction of human capital investment, a current increase of output may also cause a reduction in future labour productivity—in essence, it places the foundations for a future decrease in output. The distinction between cause and effect becomes blurred as activities that promote human capital do not just respond passively to the phase of the economic cycle. Instead, their response may act as a propagation mechanism that intensifies the non-monotonicity of economic dynamics, hence perpetuating the incidence of economic cycles. The purpose of the current paper is to provide a framework that identifies conditions under which countercyclical human capital investment can be crucial in generating economic cycles endogenously. I build an overlapping generations model in which agents use efficient labour—that is, raw labour time augmented by the stock of human capital—in order to produce output. Investment in human capital requires time/effort by the young, and an intergenerational externality whereby the current human capital stock complements private resources in supporting its accumulation. As long as some parameter conditions are jointly met, then the optimal amount of time devoted to human capital investment is decreasing in the current stock of human capital. Given that output is positively related to the human capital stock, the previous mechanism reveals that human capital investment is countercyclical. The parameter conditions under which this result may emerge are (1) an elasticity of intertemporal substitution that is above unityFootnote 1, and (2) diminishing returns in the accumulation of human capital in the sense that, holding the time devoted to human capital promoting activities constant, the accumulation of human capital is increasing but concave to the intergenerational externality that is manifested through the direct effect of the current human capital stock.Footnote 2 When these conditions are jointly satisfied, the dynamics of human capital can become non-monotonic, meaning that, rather than converging to a stationary equilibrium, the economy may admit a periodic equilibrium, converging to stable limit cycles during which human capital and output fluctuate permanently around their fixed points. What is particularly interesting is that, when this happens, the countercyclical nature of human capital-promoting activities is more than a mere response to economic cycles; it is at the same time the foundation of the complex economic dynamics that help generate and perpetuate cycles in the first place. The preceding discussion reveals that the current framework belongs to the class of models in which economic cycles are deterministic and emerge as a result of conditions linked to the deep structure of the economy, rather than the presence of exogenous shocks. While there is a significant number of papers that show the emergence of limit cycles under a variety of settings, the results of this analysis are novel enough to offer new insights that complement the existing literature by enriching our current understanding of the conditions under which cyclical dynamics may emerge. Firstly, this model explains a recognised stylised fact (i.e., the countercyclical nature of human capital investment) in terms of a well-defined combination of parameter values that involves both intertemporal substitution and the relative strength of the intergenerational externality in the evolution of human capital. Secondly, for reasons that were outlined in the previous paragraph, the same combination is ultimately responsible for the existence of cyclical trajectories. To the best of my knowledge, the model is the first to identify this parametric combination as the ultimate source of complex dynamics in a model with human capital. In fact, what is striking is that complex dynamics can emerge in a very simple and tractable model in which there are no elements that some previous analyses have employed in order to generate deterministic cycles in dynamic macroeconomic models. Such elements include, among others, consumption externalities (e.g., Lahiri and Puhakka 1998); productive externalities (e.g., Benhabib and Farmer 1994; Azariadis and Reichlin 1996); public policy (e.g., Farmer 1986); money (e.g., Grandmont 1985); environmental quality (e.g., Seegmuller and Verchère 2004; Palivos and Varvarigos 2016); financial intermediation (e.g., Banerji et al. 2004); endogenous entry under imperfect competition (Varvarigos and Gil Molto 2016); expanding product varieties (Furukawa 2007); and endogenous fertility (Fanti and Gori 2013). Furthermore, it should be noted that although existing analyses have focused on intertemporal substitution as an important element in the determination of complex dynamics in production economies (e.g., Reichlin 1986), they have done so in models where the reproducible factor of production is physical capital. Although both physical and human capital can act as the means of transferring real resources intertemporally, they differ by their very nature and by the mechanisms that govern their dynamics. In terms of this model, the focus on particular characteristics that govern the evolution of human capital—such as time spent on learning activities and intergenerational externalities—are of paramount importance for the results; hence, the distinction between physical and human capital is not a trivial one.Footnote 3
 Given the current framework’s focus on human capital, it shares similarities with the analysis of Kaas and Zink (2007). In their model, innovation and human capital are the driving forces behind productivity improvements. However, advanced technologies are skill-biased in the sense that they require technology-specific skills that are costlier to obtain. Therefore, productivity growth increases the cost of education, thus reducing the fraction of agents who invest in human capital improvements. This structure generates feedbacks that ultimately lead to endogenous growth cycles. Of course, the underlying reason why human capital investment is countercyclical differs in comparison to the model developed in this paper. As noted previously, the current framework attributes countercyclical investment in human capital to the deep structural characteristics of preferences and technologies. The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, I outline the economic environment. Section 3 analyses the equilibrium dynamics and shows the existence of limit cycles. In Sect. 4, I conclude.",2

120.0,1.0,Journal of Economics,12 September 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-016-0513-5,"Multistage public education, voting, and income distribution",January 2017,Katsuyuki Naito,Keigo Nishida,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Human capital accumulation can be an engine of economic growth, and the government plays significant roles in providing formal education. In many existing studies, human capital is produced in a single education sector, where an amount of government expenditure is a direct input. In reality, however, an education system is divided into multiple stages, such as primary, secondary, and tertiary education, and the government supports each of them. Primary and secondary (K-12) education has a particularly big difference from tertiary education in the sense that it is mandatory but serves everyone for free although college education is optional and requires private spending. It is relatively recently, however, that several studies have begun to analyze how policy changes for different education sectors affect economic growth and income distribution (Abington and Blankenau 2013; Arcalean and Schiopu 2010; Blankenau 2005; Blankenau et al. 2007a; Restuccia and Urrutia 2004; Su 2004). In particular, with heterogeneity in income or innate ability, changes in the size of public education funds or budget allocations across different education sectors may increase the welfare of some individuals at the expense of others as shown by Su (2004), Blankenau et al. (2007a), Abington and Blankenau (2013), and Hidalgo-Hidalgo and Iturbe-Ormaetxe (2012). This provides fertile ground for politico-economic analyses.Footnote 1 For example, enhancing college education may most benefit the rich but may not benefit the poor who do not attend college. This paper proposes an overlapping generations model in which both a tax rate to finance overall government education expenditures and a budget allocation for multiple education sectors are determined via majority voting, and analyzes the effects on human capital dynamics. Since individuals vote for both a tax rate and an allocation rule, the policy is multidimensional. In general, it is extremely, and often impossibly, difficult to find political equilibrium when a policy is multidimensional (Persson and Tabellini 2000). In this paper, we provide a model of a special case to avoid this difficulty and prove that the individual with median income (median human capital) is the decisive voter. Although our model is simple, it enables us to analyze the interaction between the political determination of education policies and the dynamics of human capital. The outline of the model is as follows. Individuals live for two periods, namely childhood and adulthood, and they have children when they are adults. Individuals in adulthood make all the economic and political decisions, but they care about the human capital of their children. The government operates two education sectors, which we call primary and higher education sectors. Primary education is compulsory but serves all childhood individuals free of charge. On the other hand, higher education is optional and requires private expenditures. In each education sector, the private return on education depends on resource allocations from the government and parental human capital. Parents with low human capital are unwilling to have their children receive higher education because the private return is low. They prefer a low income tax rate and to allocate all public funds to primary education. Parents whose human capital is above some threshold are willing to have their children obtain higher education. They prefer a higher tax rate and to allocate some resources to higher education. The policy implemented in the political equilibrium depends on the median level of human capital. Our model generates various dynamics of human capital accumulation and steady state income inequalities. As long as the human capital of the median voter is below some threshold, the income tax rate, which determines budget size of education, is low and all resources are provided for primary education. In some cases, the median voter accumulates sufficient human capital through primary education, and, as the economy develops, a higher tax rate (i.e., a larger budget for education) and a positive allocation for higher education are realized. In other cases, however, only the initial income distribution matters for the policy implementation. Although the emergence of higher education unambiguously promotes human capital accumulation and increases the aggregate income level, it may lead to income inequality because the poor are excluded from higher education. This paper is related to the literature on the political economy of education and its macroeconomic implications.Footnote 2 In our model, the tax rate is low and higher education is not realized if the median human capital (income) is below some threshold. There are several reasons why the median income may be low, but one of the main possibilities is large income inequality. If this is the case, our paper is also related to studies on income inequality and growth. Saint-Paul and Verdier (1993) develop a model in which income redistribution is in the form of public education. It is well known that, in majority voting models, large income inequality causes a large income redistribution. On the basis of the redistributive character of public education, Saint-Paul and Verdier (1993) show that in majority voting, large income inequality creates strong support for public education, thereby promoting human capital accumulation and economic growth. However, the model prediction is not supported by empirical studies (e.g., Easterly 2001, Easterly 2007).Footnote 3 We regard public education differently from Saint-Paul and Verdier (1993). The private return from public education is not equal among individuals but dependent on their inherited human capital. Moreover, higher education requires private spending. Thus, public education does not necessarily have a redistributive effect. In our model, if large income inequality makes the majority of individuals poor, it may have adverse effects on growth. 
Fernandez and Rogerson (1995) and Naito and Nishida (2012) also recognize that public support for education involves redistribution from the poor to the rich. In a static setting, Fernandez and Rogerson (1995) investigate majority voting on education subsidies. In their model, there is a single education opportunity, and individuals can obtain education if they pay a fixed cost. The government uses a proportional income tax scheme to provide subsidies that partially cover the fixed cost to individuals who take education. However, even with the subsidies, poor individuals may not be able to afford education because the credit markets are imperfect. Fernandez and Rogerson (1995) prove that there exists a majority voting equilibrium in which only rich and middle income individuals receive subsidies and obtain education although the poor also pay proportional income taxes. Naito and Nishida (2012) show that taxation to improve the quality of public education is not implemented under majority voting if the majority of individuals are so poor that they cannot afford education and/or the returns from education are low. Although Naito and Nishida (2012) use a model with a similar structure to this paper’s, human capital is accumulated only through a single public education sector and individuals vote for a proportional tax rate that determines the quality of education. Some studies use political mechanisms other than majority voting. Galor et al. (2009) and Su (2006) consider environments in which rich individuals have strong political power. Galor et al. (2009) construct a model in which landowners, who are better endowed with a production factor, prevent public education that promotes human capital formation and growth. The study most closely related to ours is Su (2006). She studies how a public budget allocation between primary and higher education is determined when the top class has dominant political power as in many less-developed countries. In economies where the middle class is poor, the top class implements a policy that allocates more resources to higher education at the expense of primary education. The results in Su (2006) accord with observed cross-country differences of education policies. Because the purpose of this paper is to provide a theory, we follow most of the literature and use majority voting as the political mechanism. However, our model can be immediately extended to study an environment in which only the rich have political power. In a typical case of less-developed economies, where the majority of the population is very poor and only a small portion at the top has high human capital, our model predicts that public funds are allocated to higher education despite the fact that most individuals are excluded from higher education. This result matches the characteristics of the less-developed economies documented by Su (2004, (2006). Thus, our paper is not without empirical value. Nonetheless, our main interest and goal are theoretical. Here, we aim to provide one step to analyze how politically determined public budget size and its allocation rule interact with the dynamic behavior of human capital accumulation.

120.0,1.0,Journal of Economics,09 June 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-016-0496-2,A new interpretation of the condition for precautionary saving in the presence of an interest-rate risk,January 2017,Marco Magnani,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Precautionary saving theory studies the effects of uncertainty on saving decisions. As noted by Sandmo (1970), in a setting where utility depends on income only, two types of uncertainty may arise. The first type of uncertainty concerns the level of future, non-capital, income, which I refer to as labor-income risk. The second type of uncertainty concerns the yield on capital investment, i.e. the return on saving, which I refer to as interest-rate risk. In both cases, uncertainty affects future wealth and may increase saving through a process which is known as the precautionary motive for saving. Labor-income risk has been widely studied since the seminal papers by Leland (1986), Sandmo (1970) and Drèze and Modigliani (1972). This literature shows that the precautionary saving motive operates and generates an extra-saving if and only if the third derivative of the utility function is positive, i.e., according to the interpretation of Kimball (1990), if the agent is prudent. The condition for precautionary saving changes when an interest-rate risk is present, and, in a model where utility is separable with respect to present and future consumption, involves the values of both the second and third derivatives of the utility function. The precautionary saving motive, in fact, operates if and only if the relative prudence index is higher than a threshold equal to 2.Footnote 1 This result was obtained for the first time by Rothschild and Stiglitz (1971), and also appears in Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger (2008), who provide a generalization studying the effects on precautionary saving of nth-order risk changes. The same threshold 2, referred to the partial relative prudence index, also characterizes the necessary and sufficient condition for precautionary saving, defined by Li (2012) in a setting where labor-income risk and interest-rate risk are both present, and are positive quadrant dependent.Footnote 2
 When an interest-rate risk is present, the condition for precautionary saving involves both the level of prudence and the level of risk-aversion which characterize agent preferences. The net impact on precautionary saving of an uncertain level of the interest rate, in fact, depends on two opposing effects which, following Sandmo (1970), Rothschild and Stiglitz (1971) and Li (2012), I refer to as the income effect and the substitution effect of saving. The income effect pushes a prudent agent to increase her level of saving in order to increase her income in the period where she faces uncertainty; the strength of the income effect depends on the level of prudence. The substitution effect, however, pushes a risk-averse agent to reduce her level of saving because saving itself is a source of uncertainty, and increases the agent exposure to the interest-rate risk; the strength of the substitution effect depends on the level of risk-aversion. In this context, the relative prudence index measures the relative strength of the income effect with respect to the substitution effect of saving. Although the presence of the relative prudence index in the necessary and sufficient condition for precautionary saving can be easily interpreted, the value of the threshold remains an open issue. No interpretation is provided in the literature for the fact that the relative prudence index must exceed the specific value 2, when only an interest-risk is present. Most of the authors who have addressed this issue, both in the precautionary saving literature (Rothschild and Stiglitz 1971; Li 2012; Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger 2008; Baiardi et al. 2014) and in the literature studying agent attitudes toward multiplicative risks (Hadar and Seo 1990; Choi et al. 2001; Chiu and Madden 2007; White 2008), explain this condition as the effect of prudence being “large enough” to counterbalance the effect of risk-aversion. The aim of the present paper is to re-examine the necessary and sufficient condition for precautionary saving in the presence of an interest-rate risk, and to explain the meaning of the threshold 2 for the relative prudence index. In particular, I will show that the precautionary saving motive operates if and only if the elasticity of the agent risk-aversion with respect to saving, i.e. the relative prudence index, is larger than the elasticity of the variance of second-period income with respect to saving, which is exactly 2. A similar interpretation of the threshold 2 is also appropriate in the case of multiplicative lotteries, and is presented in the Appendix. The note proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a new interpretation of the necessary and sufficient condition to have precautionary saving in the presence of an interest-rate risk. Section 3 provides an alternative proof of this condition. Section 4 concludes.",9

Chowdhury,Stephen Martin,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"We model a platform market that is supplied by an upstream firm with a complementary good that some consumers on one side of the market regard as essential. The model is a stylized version of a newspaper market, potentially a duopoly. Downstream firms are differentiated platforms, newspapers, that supply the two sides, advertisers and readers, of the platform market. The upstream firm, a syndicate, is the monopoly supplier of publishable material—newspaper columns and comic strips. We show that the impact of an exclusive license granted by the upstream firm to one of the downstream firms depends on the extent of differentiation between the products of the downstream firms and on the relative size of the market segment that regards the complementary good as essential. If consumers regard downstream varieties as close substitutes, duopoly with only one firm licensed to publish the complementary material can be an equilibrium outcome. For intermediate degrees of product differentiation and a sufficiently large fraction of the population that regards the complementary good as essential, an exclusive license can deprive the unlicensed firm of enough advertising revenue to make it unprofitable. For high levels of product differentiation, an exclusive license would make an unlicensed newspaper unprofitable, but the payoff-maximizing choice for the upstream firm is to license both firms. In a platform market, two groups of users interact through a platform firm. The benefit to users on one side of the market increases with the number of users on the other side of the market, and a platform is able to charge individual prices to the two groups (Rochet and Tirole 2006). The newspaper industry is a prototypical example of a platform market. It involves three sets of players: newspapers, readers, and advertisers. In this perspective, readers and advertisers are the two user groups that interact on newspaper platforms. A newspaper commonly publishes features (articles, comics, puzzles, etc.), along with local, national, and international news and advertisements. Newspaper employees prepare some published material; the remainder is purchased from press syndicates. Press syndicates are upstream firms that sell specialized material to newspapers. Some such syndicates specialize in the distribution of comic strips, acting as agents for cartoonists, often under exclusive contracts. An episode from the Dallas, Texas newspaper market exemplifies the phenomenon we model.Footnote 1 On August 2, 1989, the Dallas Morning News (‘Morning News’) signed an exclusive contract for 26 columns and comic strips provided by the Universal Press Syndicate. Until the signing of the exclusive contract, the material had been available through the Dallas Times Herald (‘Times Herald’). The two newspapers had competed in the Dallas area for more than a century. The Universal Syndicate acknowledged that the move was ‘predatory’, but said that denial of the material was required by its contract with the Morning News. The Times Herald suffered a circulation loss of 9000 to 10,000 weekday and 15,000 Sunday deliveries. It filed an antitrust lawsuit asking for $33 million in actual damages and up to three times that amount in punitive damages against the Morning News and its parent company. A state judge in Texas refused to grant the Times Herald a preliminary injunction to prevent the movement of the syndicated features, on the ground that the Times Herald could publish substitute features supplied by competing syndicates. The Times Herald subsequently lost a District Court jury trial and an appeal of the District Court outcome. The Morning News nonetheless paid $1.5 million to the Times Herald as part of an outside settlement. The Times Herald was unable to recapture its lost reader base and advertising revenue. The Morning News’ parent corporation purchased the Times Herald on December 8, 1991 and stopped its publication the next day.Footnote 2
 Although we focus specifically on the newspaper market in the current study, other platform markets can also portray similar situations of exclusivity. An example of such from the U.S. television industry involves Project Runway, a reality show based on fashion design that was shown by the Bravo Network from 2004 to 2008. On July 2006 the show’s producers made an exclusive deal to move the show to Lifetime Television starting from 2009. Litigation followed, and was privately settled after Bravo Network prevailed in early stages. In 2009, Bravo Network launched a competing program (“The Fashion Show”), which enjoyed about one-quarter Project Runway’s number of viewers, and correspondingly less advertising revenue. The Fashion Show broadcast its last episode on 25 January 2011.Footnote 3
 The results of the current study contribute to two literatures. First, it broadens our understanding of the nature of strategic interactions in imperfectly competitive platform markets. Second, it contributes to the literature on exclusion by considering the effect of an exclusive license for a complementary good in a platform market. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we review the parts of the literature on exclusionary contracts involving complementary goods that are most closely related to the present study. Section 3 contains the setup of the model. In Sect. 4, we present results for the monopoly case. Section 5 contains the basic duopoly model. Section 6 discusses equilibrium licensing behavior for moderately differentiated newspapers. Section contrasts the outcome for an intermediate degree of product differentiation with outcomes if product differentiation is either low or high. Section 8 concludes.Footnote 4

120.0,2.0,Journal of Economics,26 July 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-016-0503-7,Pricing and price competition in consumer markets,March 2017,Ante Farm,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Perfect competition is still the baseline model in introductory textbooks in economics. But not all firms can take the market price as given in a market where prices are set by firms. This paper argues, however, that there is a simple modification of the traditional model which makes sense in markets where buyers take prices as given and prices are set by sellers, as in most consumer markets. For, even if not all firms can be price takers, all firms but one can take the price as given. And by replacing an imaginary auctioneer with a real price leader maximizing its individual profits, we obtain a consistent and tractable model with plausible assumptions and realistic predictions, including markets which do not always clear. In this model the market price goes down if—and only if—a price cut appears profitable to a firm even if its competitors follow suit. Thus, the market price is determined by the lowest market price preferred by a firm, an idea which goes back at least to Boulding (1941, pp. 607–613). The basic idea is that if firms prefer the same market price, then the choice of price leader is immaterial, while if firms prefer different market prices – due to differences in costs or capacities or market shares – then a firm preferring the lowest market price will determine the market price simply by announcing it, while firms preferring a higher market price are forced to follow suit, at least if the price leader has excess capacity. And a firm preferring the lowest market price may be called a competitive price leader, to use the term introduced by Lanzillotti (1957). To my knowledge, competitive price leadership has not been further developed or discussed in modern literature on pricing. Price leadership is not even mentioned in recent monographs or handbooks with only a few exceptions, including Scherer (1980). And most recent articles on price leadership, including Rotemberg and Saloner (1990), Hviid (1990), Deneckere and Kovenock (1992), Pastine and Pastine (2004) and Ishibashi (2008), only deal with collusive price leadership or Stackelberg price leadership. The paper by Seaton and Waterson (2013), however, is an empirical study of price leadership in the classical sense, based on price data from two leading British supermarket chains. They conclude that, even with a narrow definition, price leadership appears to be a very common phenomenon. In classical writings a price leader is often a dominant firm. Markham (1951, pp. 895–896) notes that “nearly every major industry in the American economy has, in its initial stages of development, been dominated by a single firm”, and that “the monopoly power of the initial dominant firm in most industries [\(\ldots \)] was gradually reduced by industrial growth and the entrance of new firms”. Hence it is easy to understand why ‘dominant firm’ price leadership dominates the classical literature and why it often is called ‘partial monopoly’. Price leadership has often been divided into three categories, namely dominant firm, collusive and barometric (Scherer 1980 p. 176), but without precise definitions. I find it clarifying, to begin with, to distinguish between collusive price leadership, where the price leader is assumed to maximize its industry’s profits, and competitive price leadership, where the price leader is assumed to maximize its individual profits. And this paper only deals with competitive price leadership. If there are many firms preferring the lowest market price, the choice of price leader among these is immaterial and may be expected to vary randomly or depend on which firm is assumed to have the best information on market conditions. A competitive price leader may in this case also be called a barometric price leader, following (Stigler 1947). And if there is only one firm preferring the lowest market price, it may be called a dominant price leader. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 argues that while Cournot models and Bertrand models are applicable to commodity markets and markets with sealed bidding, respectively, Bolding models are applicable to consumer markets. In Sect. 3 we shall see how the outcome of competitive price leadership crucially depends on the way the market is shared between firms at different market prices. And the distribution of sales between firms depends in general not only on firms’ capacities, as it does at market clearing, but also on consumers’ preferences. The effects of capacities and preferences on pricing are analysed more in detail in Sect. 4, which also is a reappraisal of the classical model of price leadership by a dominant firm. And Sect. 5 concludes.",5

For example, loyalty programs and consumers’ online activity are very important sources of customer data in the retailing industry.Footnote 1
\(^,\)
Footnote 2 Collected data allows firms to conclude on both consumer characteristics relevant in spatial competition, consumers’ addresses and transport cost parameters (flexibility).Footnote 3 Customer location data is one of the first information items provided by consumers while signing up for a loyalty program and can be deducted from the IP address of a computer during the online purchase. This data is easily accessible and can be considered as (almost) perfect. In contrast, firms can estimate consumer flexibility only with less than perfect accuracy. Similarly, following a boom of location-based marketing enabled by the emergence of smarphones with built-in GPS devices, firms can make personalized offers to consumers depending on their precise physical locations delivered by smartphone signals.Footnote 4 However, physical location is not the only piece of customer data used by mobile advertisers and is usually combined with other types of data such as on previous sales, demographics, social networks and app usage.Footnote 5 Additional customer data can be used to estimate consumer flexibility. Gained customer insights are used by firms in two ways. First, customer data allows targeted advertising and pricing where firms can practice third-degree price discrimination based on both consumer locations and their flexibility.Footnote 6
\(^,\)
Footnote 7
\(^,\)
Footnote 8 Second, customer data is widely used to decide on the optimal store location.Footnote 9
 In this article we consider a Hotelling model, where consumers differ both in their locations and transport cost parameters. There are two firms which compete in prices and have access to perfect data on consumers locations. Additionally, firms hold data on consumer flexibility of an exogenously given quality, which allows them to distinguish between different flexibility segments and attribute every consumer to one of them. We consider two versions of our model depending on how strongly consumers differ in flexibility, with relatively homogeneous and differentiated consumers. We analyze firms’ location choices in the two versions of our model depending on the quality of customer flexibility data. Our article contributes to the literature on spatial competition in Hotelling-type models where firms first choose locations and then compete in prices given the ability to practice perfect third-degree price discrimination based on consumer addresses. The famous result in Lederer and Hurter (1986) states that in the latter case in equilibrium every firm chooses its location so as to minimize social costs equal to the minimal costs of serving a consumer at each address. In a standard Hotelling model (with a uniform distribution of consumers along a line segment) this result implies socially optimal equilibrium locations. Hamilton and Thisse (1992) introduce a vertical dimension of consumer heterogeneity along which firms can practice first-degree price discrimination. They get the same optimality result as in Lederer and Hurter and conclude that “... we see that the Hurter-Lederer efficient location result relies on perfectly inelastic consumer demands. For firms to locate efficiently when demands are price-sensitive, they need more flexibility in pricing ...” (Hamilton and Thisse 1992, p. 184) On the one hand, our results support this conclusion, as we show that when the quality of customer flexibility data improves (and firms can identify more flexibility segments) equilibrium locations become closer to the socially optimal ones. However, this happens only when consumers are relatively differentiated in flexibility. With relatively homogeneous consumers in equilibrium firms choose socially optimal locations regardless of their ability to discriminate based on consumer flexibility. Our results imply that in a model with price-sensitive demands at each address socially optimal locations can be an equilibrium under weaker requirements on the quality of customer data available to the firms than perfect data. 
Valletti (2002) is another article, which introduces heterogeneity along the vertical dimension of consumer preferences and assumes that consumers can be of two types depending on their valuation for quality. While firms can practice perfect third-degree price discrimination based on consumer addresses, they do not observe their types and, hence, have to rely on second-degree price discrimination at each address. Valletti shows that firms’ location choices influence their discriminating ability. Different from Valletti, in our model firms’ ability to discriminate is given exogenously and depends on the quality of customer flexibility data, such that a firm’s location choice influences only its market share (along the horizontal dimension of consumer preferences) and the profit on a given location. Our results show that for the same data quality firms make different location choices depending on how strongly consumers differ in flexibility. Overall, our article contributes to Hamilton and Thisse (1992) and Valletti (2002) by introducing third-degree price discrimination along the vertical dimension of consumer preferences enabled by customer data, while the former assume first-degree and the latter considers second-degree price discrimination. Our article is also related to Anderson and de Palma (1988) who assume that products are heterogeneous not only in the spatial dimension, but also in the characteristic space, which also leads to price-sensitive demands at each location. Similar to Anderson and de Palma we show that socially optimal prices and locations are not always an equilibrium, in contrast to models where only spatial dimension of heterogeneity is considered. However, different from Anderson and de Palma, we show that socially optimal prices and locations can also be an equilibrium in a model with price-sensitive demands. This happens in two cases. First, if consumers are relatively homogeneous in transport cost parameters. Second, if firms have perfect data on consumer flexibility and, hence, can perfectly discriminate along that dimension. The intuition for our results is as follows. When consumers are relatively homogeneous, in equilibrium every firm serves all consumers on its turf, even when firms do not hold data on consumer flexibility. This happens because if a firm targets at some address its most loyal customer (with the highest transport cost parameter), it suffices to decrease the price slightly to gain even the least loyal customer (with the lowest transport cost parameter). As a result, similar to Lederer and Hurter (1986), every firm chooses its location so as to minimize social (transport) costs, which implies socially optimal locations. However, when consumers are relatively differentiated, in equilibrium on any address on its turf a firm serves only the more loyal consumers and loses the less loyal ones to the rival. To mitigate competition firms deviate from the socially optimal locations, and the interfirm distance is larger in equilibrium compared to both the first-best and the second-best. With the improvement in the quality of customer flexibility data distortions in firms’ equilibrium locations become smaller, because every firm can better target consumers on its turf, which weakens the rival’s ability to attract its loyal consumers. When flexibility data becomes perfect, firms make socially optimal location choices with relatively differentiated consumers too. 
Tabuchi (1994) and Irmen and Thisse (1998) assume that products are differentiated along different dimensions and analyze firms’ locations in each dimension. The result of Tabuchi that firms choose maximal differentiation in one dimension and minimal differentiation in the other is generalized by Irmen and Thisse in a model of spatial competition in a multi-characteristic space who show that the Nash equilibrium implies maximal differentiation only in the dominant product characteristic. While in our model products differ only in one (horizontal) dimension, we introduce consumer heterogeneity in the strength of their preferences along that dimension. In contrast, in Tabuchi and Irmen and Thisse it is assumed that the transport cost parameters related to each product characteristic are same among all consumers. We show that firms’ location choices depend on how strongly consumers differ in transport cost parameters and firms’ ability to discriminate along that dimension of consumer preferences. Finally, our article is related to Jentzsch et al. (2013) and Sapi and Suleymanova (2013). Both articles assume that consumers differ in the strength of their brand preferences. In the former article the authors analyze firms’ incentives to share different types of customer data depending on how strongly consumers differ in flexibility and consider only data of perfect quality. In the latter paper the authors analyze firms’ incentives to acquire customer flexibility data depending on its quality and consumer heterogeneity along that dimension. The focus of our article is the analysis of firms’ location choices depending on the quality of customer flexibility data and on how strongly consumers differ in flexibility. In addition, in one of our extensions we endogenize firms’ decisions to acquire customer flexibility data and get results, which differ from those of Sapi and Suleymanova. We show that this difference is due to the location effect, which reduces firms’ incentives to acquire flexibility data, and is absent in Sapi and Suleymanova, where firms do not choose their locations. Precisely, we show that firms do not necessarily end up in the prisoner’s dilemma when flexibility data becomes precise and consumers are relatively differentiated. In the other extension where we assume that firms hold flexibility data of asymmetric quality, we show that with the improvement in data quality efficiency in location choices can be restored only when consumers are relatively homogeneous. Our article is organized as follows. In the next section we present the model. In Sect. 3 we provide the equilibrium analysis, state our results and compare them with Lederer and Hurter (1986) and Anderson and de Palma (1988). In Sect. 4 we consider two extensions. In the first one we analyze firms’ location choices under the assumption that they hold flexibility data of asymmetric quality and in the second one we analyze firms’ incentives to acquire flexibility data. Finally, in Sect. 5 we conclude.",3

This paper analyzes platform competition when these firms engage in vertical differentiation and set prices. The model herein departs from much of the current literature in that platforms compete directly on both sides. Doing so qualitatively alters equilibria the understanding of which is important in practice. The insights of this paper are robust to changes in the extensive form and of some modeling details, and so may be applied to multiple markets like newsprint, operating systems or video game consoles, and even healthcare and education (see Bardey and Rochet 2010a and Bardey et al. 2010b). The results also extend where prices are zero on one side, such as broadcasting, search engine competition or social media. The game considered has three stages: quality setting on one side (B) then price setting on the same side, and price setting on the other side (A). Because of a cross-market externality, the dominant platform on side B is the more attractive one for A-side agents, so vertical differentiation arises endogenously on side A. A unique pure-strategy equilibrium exists only when the A-side is not too lucrative. In this case the optimal quality level of the top firm is lower than the benchmark of maximal differentiation established by Shaked and Sutton (1982, now S&S) and Gabszewicz and Thisse (1979). Usually differentiation is a means of extracting consumer surplus at the cost of surrendering market share to the competition (Hotelling 1929; S&S). But here every B agent allows the platform to extract surplus from side A as well, and so is more valuable. This enhances competition for them. Thus B agents receive a discount commensurate with the profits that can be extracted from side A; then a lesser quality is necessary to attract the marginal B consumer. The more lucrative is side A, the harder platforms compete for B agents, so the lower are B prices. Beyond a well-defined threshold, the quality-adjusted price of the high-quality firm is so low that it preempts market B, and consequently side A as well. But then the excluded firm possesses a non-local deviation and can monopolize the market too. One must play in mixed strategies. The market may be preempted ex post (in the continuation play), which is a distinct feature of two-sided markets in practice; there is a single eBay, a single Microsoft and a single newspaper in any U.S. city (except for New York City). This pre-emption result is also the only equilibrium when B-side prices are fixed, or bounded, at 0. This applies well to search engine competition or social media: quality is costly and in equilibrium there is a single dominant player (Google, Facebook). Pre-emption and ex post monopolization owe not to a contraction of market B but rather to an expansion of the A market, which induces more aggressive competition for B-side consumers. In a discussion I argue that the results are quite widely applicable. I explain that the introduction of a second externality from A to B does not qualitatively alter any of the results. I also discuss bottlenecks (introduced by Armstrong (2006)) and show that the results are robust to a change in the extensive form.Footnote 1
 Capturing the phenomena of quality distortion and pre-emption requires there to be direct (price) competition on both side. That is, no platform should be a bottleneck. If a platform is a bottleneck, it is insulated from (price) competition in market A and so it behaves like a monopolist in that market. Then (i) a pure-strategy equilibrium always exists; and (ii) there can be no pre-emption (see details in the Sect. 4). Typically a bottleneck is modeled as allowing a buyer to purchase up to two units, with at most one from each supplier; it can only generate monopoly pricing. The bottleneck assumption severely understates the full extent of the competition between firms, and rules out playing in mixed strategies. In this paper direct competition is re-introduced in the form of a ‘single-homing’ assumption: both sides have unit demand. Single-homing exacerbates competition.Footnote 2 With this, price competition for A-side consumers generates a premium to being the dominant platform on side B. This premium effect is subsided when platforms are bottleneck: they are both local monopolists. When side B is lucrative enough, the premium effect induces payoffs that are not quasiconcave; it is precisely this lack of quasiconcavity that leads to a breakdown of the pure-strategy equilibrium. I also note that single-homing finds empirical support in Kaiser and Wright (2006) in the context of German magazines, in Argentesi and Filistrucchi (2007) in Italian newspapers and in Jin and Rysman (2010), who study sportscard conventions. The works closest to this paper are Gabszewicz et al. (2001, hereafter GLS) and Dukes and Gal-Or (2003, now DGO), which both study a media duopoly. GLS allow advertisers to place at most one ad on each platform; this is what creates the bottleneck. For a small externality the location equilibrium displays maximal differentiation; if the externality is large enough firms co-locate. In DGO the payoff function is additive over advertisers; this linear separability induces the bottleneck. The equilibrium exhibits minimal differentiation. In the present model there cannot be a pure-strategy equilibrium with minimal differentiation; instead one must play in mixed strategies. Hence we see that the nature of equilibrium varies greatly depending on whether platforms are bottlenecks. Armstrong and Wright (2007) study a model of bottlenecks that shares the essential features of GLS and generates results similar in spirit. In Ferrando et al. (2008) locations as fixed and prices are set simultaneously on both sides. The equilibria are coordination equilibria in which the market may be preempted by one platform. Gabszewicz et al. (2004) derive three mutually exclusive rational-expectation equilibria: a symmetric, Bertrand equilibrium; a preemption equilibrium and an interior (asymmetric) equilibrium. Here the extensive form calls for subgame perfection, which leads to a unique equilibrium. In the context of health care, Bardey and Rochet (2010a) allow insurance companies to compete for patients (through premia) and service providers (through rebates). Patients are heterogenous in their health risk and thus may value health services differently. This affects health plans’ payments to physicians and hospitals, but there is no direct competition. The authors assert that little changes with direct competition on both sides. This suggestion should be weighed with some caution in light of our results. Reisinger (2012) allows for direct competition for homogenous advertisers, while differentiated consumers do not pay for the platforms. Advertisers do not care for the relative quality of a platform, but only for the number of consumers, hence there is no premium effect. This tames competition. Armstrong and Weeds (2007) use a model of horizontal differentiation augmented with a quality investment to study the welfare effects of competition between broadcasters. Quality, although not the source of differentiation, may be under-provided in equilibrium. Gonzales-Maestre and Martinez-Sanchez (2015) use a similar model to evaluate the provision of quality and the quantity of advertising shown when a private broadcaster competes for viewers with a welfare-maximizing (public) broadcaster. The presence of the public broadcaster increases the quality of the private provider. The next Section introduces the model. Section 3 covers the characterization and some implications.

120.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,08 August 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-016-0508-2,"Seasonality, price discrimination, and welfare",April 2017,Francisco Galera,Pedro Mendi,Juan Carlos Molero,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Ever since Robinson (1933), economists have inquired into the issue of the welfare implications of third-degree price discrimination. A central point in this discussion is how price discrimination affects output and, ultimately, welfare. In this literature, Schmalensee (1981), assuming constant marginal costs, Varian (1985) with interdependent markets and increasing marginal costs, and Schwartz (1990) assuming decreasing marginal costs, showed that an increase in total output is a necessary condition for welfare improvement when we move from a uniform price regime to price discrimination. We contribute to the existing literature by discussing whether this result holds in the presence of demand fluctuations. In particular, we analyze a model in which a monopolist services two markets with seasonal demands and a capacity constraint in one of the markets. We compare the cases in which the monopolist may price discriminate across markets and periods with that in which the monopolist is forced to post the same price across different markets, but may still practice intertemporal price discrimination [see Crew et al. (1995) for a survey on peak-load pricing]. We show that with a binding capacity constraint in one of the markets, it is possible for average welfare to increase even if average total output decreases. What drives this result is that by price discriminating the monopolist may reduce its output if demand—and hence valuation—is low, doing the opposite if demand is high. Depending on the difference in valuation between the high- and low-demands, the gain when demand is high may more than offset the loss when demand is low, even if total output decreases. Our contribution to the literature is to present an existence result that has important policy implications. In particular, the assertion that an output increase is a necessary condition for welfare to increase with price discrimination may not hold in markets subject to demand or cost fluctuations. In practice, the vast majority of markets are subject to fluctuations of some kind. For instance, retail sales tend to peak during the Christmas season and then decline, and there is seasonality in other industries such as hospitality or transportation. On the cost side, the costs of producing many food products are subject to seasonality, and in many other industries firms’ costs are altered by frequently-changing oil prices. The model also stresses the idea that capacity constraints may play an important role in the welfare result. Capacity constraints are present in a wide variety of industries, such as utilities, transportation, hospitality, telecommunications and health services. Our analysis suggests that the welfare effects of price discrimination with capacity constraints and demand fluctuations may not be as straightforward as the widely accepted result indicates. Since geographic discrimination has typically been more closely watched by competition authorities than intertemporal price discrimination, our analysis focuses on the welfare effect of geographic discrimination conditional on the existence of intertemporal price discrimination. For instance, the European competition authority is more concerned about the existence of an integrated European market, with reduced price differentials across markets than about seasonal price fluctuations within each national market. For this reason, even though it could be argued that, since the monopolist is able to price discriminate both intertemporally and geographically, the no-discrimination outcome should be that in which the prices are the same for both markets and both periods, we believe our modeling assumption has more practical relevance. The robustness of the proposition that links the effects of price discrimination on total output and welfare has given rise to a large literature, see Aguirre et al. (2010) for a recent contribution. If total output remains constant, price discrimination redistributes output across markets in such a way that output is transferred from the market where it is valued relatively more to the market where it is valued relatively less, giving rise to a misallocation effect. This makes welfare to decrease with price discrimination. However, this result has been challenged in a number of ways. Focusing on costs, Galera and Zaratiegui (2006) show that in a Cournot duopoly where firms have different costs the cost effect may more than offset the output and misallocation effects, so that welfare increases with discrimination, even though total output decreases. Galera et al. (2013) prove that for a monopoly with increasing marginal costs and in the presence of demand uncertainty the cost effect may make total welfare to increase, even though output decreases with price discrimination. Also Bertoletti (2009) argues that in the presence of even arbitrarily small marginal costs differences, the output criterion may no longer hold: a profit-maximizing price-discriminating monopolist could increase the price of the good whose marginal cost is highest, thus increasing welfare by decreasing average costs. The relationship between output and welfare has also been challenged via quality. Ikeda and Toshimitsu (2010) show that if a monopolist facing linear demands and simultaneously choosing product quality and price, price discrimination brings about a quality effect that always dominates the misallocation effect. Quality is represented as a proportional increase in willingness to pay. Similarly, in Alexandrov and Deb (2012), the increase in the investment in quality when price discrimination is allowed relative to a uniform price may dominate the misallocation effect. Finally, Galera et al. (2016) analyze a model in which a firm that competes in two markets against one local firm in each market, with the latter producing a higher-quality product than the former. In the model, total output may decrease, and yet welfare increase with price discrimination because of a substitution towards the high-quality product by some inframarginal consumers. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model, which is used in the welfare calculations of Sect. 3. Section 4 discusses extensions of the model. Conclusions are presented in Sect. 5.",2

In particular, we can observe price-cap regulations in the telecommunications industries of many countries and regions. In most of these industries, it is invalid to assume that the market is approximately perfectly competitive, because the number of firms is not very large. Furthermore, few of the industries are monopolies.Footnote 1 Therefore, we examine an oligopoly model with a price-cap regulation. To be more precise, in our model, firms engage in Cournot or Stackelberg competition and the market price of the good must be less than a certain price-cap level. Our main finding is that tightening the price cap may decrease social welfare even if the price-cap level is higher than the competitive price. A large number of theoretical works discuss the price-cap regulation in the contexts of monopoly and oligopoly.Footnote 2 Earle et al. (2007) consider Cournot oligopoly models in which demand is deterministic or stochastic and the price-cap level is more than or equal to the competitive price.Footnote 3 They focus only on a symmetric equilibrium and show that social welfare is nonincreasing in the price-cap level as long as the level is more than the competitive price in the deterministic case. However, as shown later in this paper, there are asymmetric Cournot equilibria under a price cap. Furthermore, when we consider asymmetric equilibria, a decrease in the price-cap level may be socially harmful even if the price-cap level is more than the competitive price. When we focus on a Stackelberg game with a price cap, the result of the welfare analysis is clearer.Footnote 4 We show that the Stackelberg equilibrium is unique for any price-cap levels and a decrease in the price-cap level may also be socially harmful. 
Earle et al. (2007) show that if demand is uncertain, a reduction of the price-cap level may decrease social welfare. See also Roques and Savva (2009), Grimm and Zöttl (2010) and Corchón and Marcos (2012) for related models and results. Reynolds and Rietzke (2016) discuss an oligopoly model with endogenous entry and show that a decrease of the price-cap level may decrease social welfare. By contrast, we consider a model without any uncertainty and entry. We discuss simple Cournot and Stackelberg duopoly models with symmetric firms and a strictly convex cost function. First, we characterize the Cournot equilibria with a price cap. If the price-cap level is between the competitive price and the Cournot equilibrium price without any restriction, then the price cap is binding and there is a unique symmetric equilibrium as well as asymmetric equilibria, in which the output of a firm is larger than that of the other firm. We characterize each equilibrium as a convex combination of the symmetric equilibrium and the most asymmetric equilibrium where a coefficient of the convex combination represents the degree of symmetry of the equilibrium. By using the characterization, we provide comparative statics analyses by fixing the degree of symmetry. Unlike the comparative statics results of a monopoly model, we show that tightening a price cap may decrease the equilibrium output of a firm and may increase the profit of a firm. Second, we show that the Stackelberg equilibrium is always unique. Intriguingly, if the price-cap level is binding, then the unique Stackelberg equilibrium is equivalent to the most asymmetric Cournot equilibrium under the same price-cap level. We give several comparative statics results of the Stackelberg equilibrium. Some are also in sharp contrast to those of a monopoly model. Third, we consider the welfare effect of the price cap. First, if the price-cap level is binding in Stackelberg competition, then social welfare under Stackelberg competition is less than or equal to that under any Cournot equilibrium. Second, we show that if the price-cap level is equal to the competitive price, then the first best outcome is achieved in both market structures. Third, when we focus on a sufficiently symmetric Cournot equilibrium, social welfare is increased by a decrease in the price-cap level. Fourth, if the price-cap level is sufficiently close to the competitive price, then social welfare is also increased by a decrease in a price-cap level. However, if the price-cap level is sufficiently far from the competitive price, then social welfare may be decreased by a reduction in the price-cap level. This result is satisfied when we focus on the Stackelberg equilibrium or a sufficiently asymmetric Cournot equilibrium. Finally, we briefly explain why tightening the price-cap regulation may decrease social welfare. In our model, there may be multiple Cournot equilibria but the equilibrium total output does not differ among equilibria for any given price-cap level. We show that if the degree of symmetry is sufficiently small and the price-cap level is sufficiently close to the competitive price, then tightening the price cap increases the difference between the equilibrium outputs of the firms. Since the cost function of each firm is strictly convex, the industry cost is drastically increased by the decrease of the price-cap level. Therefore, a reduction in the price-cap level may decrease Cournot equilibrium social welfare. Since the Stackelberg equilibrium is equal to the most asymmetric Cournot equilibrium when the price cap is binding, tightening the price cap may also decrease Stackelberg equilibrium social welfare. A similar welfare effect is discussed by Matsumura (1998) but he restricts his attention to the effect of privatization policy.",1

In particular, when an upstream monopolist supplies an input to few downstream firms, downstream firms compete either in quantities or in prices. Alternatively, market conduct is fixed somewhere in between these polar cases, irrespective of the price the monopolist charges for the input. The purpose of this paper is to discuss when downstream market conduct is a function of the monopolist’s pricing behavior, and to spell out some consequences of this. Specifically, the implications of the finding that the monopolist’s pricing co-determines downstream market conduct are illustrated by discussing the pass-through of cost changes. Our analysis applies to markets with the characteristics that, first, firms in a vertical chain have market power, and second, downstream firms operate under a capacity restriction that implies that there is one marginal production cost within capacity and a higher cost when the firm produces beyond capacity. With respect to the first issue of market structure, one example is the automobile industry where the number of brands is limited, and the number of independent car manufacturing firms is even fewer, and virtually every important electrical component comes from Bosch, a leading global supplier of automotive and industrial technology. In parallel, there are few laptop manufacturers, and Intel seems to have gained monopoly power in the market for the semiconductor chips used in laptop production. As one more example, the Cambridge, UK-based company, Arm, holds sway (at least for now) over smartphone manufacturers. Our second assumption that downstream firms produce under a soft capacity restriction implies that production costs exhibit a discontinuity in the upward direction should a firm produce beyond capacity. This description of the firm’s possibilities fits well to modern manufacturing with substantial flexibility that allows the individual firm to accommodate demand changes (Milgrom and Roberts 1990).Footnote 1 The other side of the coin is that the real cost of using some given capacity is a function of processing, production scale and so forth, and, as noted by Milgrom and Roberts (1990, p. 515), the cost function in modern manufacturing involves non-convexities. In this paper, we apply the assumption used by Maggi (1996) that there is one fixed marginal cost for units produced within the capacity, and a higher fixed marginal cost for units that exceed capacity. Some examples of this are when the firm, in order to produce beyond capacity, pays existing labor a higher wage for extra hours, or when the firm subcontracts production (or part of it) in order to fulfill demand that exceeds capacity. To discuss the relationship between the monopolist’s pricing and downstream market conduct, we use a simple supply-chain model where the monopolist supplies an input to downstream firms. The market for the final product is a symmetrically differentiated products market described by a linear demand system, and downstream firms engage in this market in capacity-then-price competition. Each downstream firm converts one unit of input to a unit of the final product and, as noted, there is one marginal cost when output is within capacity, and a higher marginal cost, should the firm produce beyond capacity. We demonstrate, using the findings in Maggi (1996), that downstream market conduct is endogenously determined somewhere in between the polar cases of Bertrand and Cournot competition. We abstract from practices like price discrimination so that downstream firms pay the same price for the input. Likewise, we ignore the use of two-part tariffs and similar pricing arrangements. Also, it is assumed that the monopolist decides the input price, and we thus exclude bargaining, which would be relevant in the case of bilateral monopolies. The finding that market conduct in the downstream sector in a vertical relationship is endogenous has, to our knowledge, not been studied before. In particular, downstream market conduct is determined by the relationship between the marginal cost increase when producing beyond capacity on the one hand, and parameters including the marginal production cost for output within capacity and the input price on the other hand. It turns out that the welfare effects of cost changes are opaque when downstream market conduct is endogenously determined. For example, because an increase of the cost of capacity in downstream firms is conducive to Bertrand competition, a change from Cournot to Bertrand behavior following higher capacity cost benefits consumers (as a result of higher output at a lower price). Standard results suggest that higher capacity costs in downstream firms harm all involved parties: the upstream firm, downstream firms, and consumers. The double marginalization problem (Spengler 1950)—demonstrating that integration of successive monopolists increases overall profit and benefits final consumers—shows how the vertical organization of markets affects welfare. Subsequent analyses address merger incentives, vertical ties such as discriminatory prices, retail price maintenance, exclusive dealership agreements, and other sorts of arrangements that affect price and welfare. Horn and Wolinsky (1988) discuss merger in bilateral monopoly assuming Cournot competition in the downstream market. Similarly, assuming that downstream firms commit to strategies in prices or in quantities, Rey and Vergé (2004) consider vertical restrictions when a manufacturer sells through two retailers. Assuming competition in prices, Innes and Hamilton (2009) analyze vertical control in a multi-product retailer environment when two manufacturers deal with two retailers. Inderst and Shaffer (2010) discuss market-share contracts and vertical restriction, and Karp and Perloff (2013) discuss vertical contracts and exclusive dealership. Our focus is how decisions of the upstream monopolist shape competition in the downstream sector. Likewise, Mendi (2009) analyzes a market with upstream competitive firms and a downstream duopoly and discuss how vertical integration between one of the duopoly firms and an upstream supplier affects collusive behavior among final-goods producers. It is shown that vertical integration has effects similar to side payments, including that the integrated firm ceases production and acts solely as an input supplier. Kitamura et al. (2016) analyze a relationship-specific investment when a downstream monopoly firm uses inputs from an upstream incumbent firm or an upstream potential entrant. With respect to costs, the relationship-specific investment has effects that are somewhat similar to the effects of a soft capacity restriction—it prevents a smooth replacement of supplier. Thus, if the downstream monopoly accepts the specific investment there is a (discontinuity due to) switching cost when using the entrant firm. Our analysis differs because we explicitly model downstream market conduct endogenously. With respect to pass-through of cost changes in vertically related markets, interest has been directed mainly to empirical examinations.Footnote 2 However, Weyl and Fabinger (2013), showing that some basic results on (tax) incidence under perfect competition generalize to imperfectly competitive markets, discuss pass-through in a supply chain. The paper proceeds as follows. In Sects. 2 and 3 the model used is discussed and the downstream equilibrium (following Maggi 1996) is described. Some implications for pass-through and incidence is analyzed in Sect. 4. Section 5 concludes.",6

Fikru,Luis Gautier,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The rise in greenhouse gases (GHG) and concern for global warming has pushed many countries to adopt market-based policies to reduce pollution. For example, Ireland enacted a carbon tax in 2010 on most fossil fuels. Chile has recently enacted a pollution tax targeting large factories and the electricity sector; and European countries like Sweden and Finland had pioneered in the carbon/energy tax since the early 1990s. US states and local governments are also taking noteworthy actions to mitigate GHG emissions (Damassa et al. 2012). For instance, nine northeastern states adopted a cap-and-trade program in 2009 to reduce GHG emissions in the electricity sector. Boulder, Colorado has approved the carbon tax since 2006, the first ever in the entire country.Footnote 1
 With the conclusion of the 2015 Climate Change Conference in Paris, nations are expected to raise targets of anthropogenic GHG emission reduction. Energy-intensive manufacturing (e.g. cement), the electric power and transportation industries are expected to be the most affected by such policies. Due to their scale economies these industries are constantly seeking to consolidate. For instance, the US utility sector has seen the highest levels of merger and acquisition deals in 2011 (FW Magazine 2012; Wooders 2012). Thus, nations ought to take into consideration the effect of industry changes due to restructuring on their modification of existing environmental policies. Another example is pollution-intensive manufacturing such as the production of chemicals, plastic materials, paint and varnish, pesticides and agricultural chemicals which has record number of firms seeking to sell their assets in acquisition deals (Factset USA 2016; Hettige et al. 1995). In 2015 in the US there were 66 merger and acquisition deals in the chemical production industry, 24 deals for plastic producers, and 22 deals for pesticide and agricultural chemical producers. In industries where mergers and acquisitions are taking place, what is the optimal environmental policy response? The purpose of the study is to examine the role of output distortion associated with mergers and pollution intensity in the optimal adjustment of emission tax in oligopoly markets. We set up a model to characterize the optimal emission tax in a Cournot market where firms are producing differentiated products. We then model a merger among two firms and examine how the optimally chosen policy changes (if at all) in the post-merger market. Our result indicates that the adjustment in the emission tax crucially depends on the post-merger output distortion and pollution intensities. Specifically, given our model framework we find that the optimal emission tax increases post-merger as long as output distortion relative to pollution damages is smaller post-merger and pollution intensity of firms post-merger is sufficiently higher compared to pre-merger values. Furthermore our result suggests that there is no need to revise environmental policy (specifically emission tax) post-merger in markets where pollution intensity of firms does not change post-merger and (i) products are completely differentiated, or (ii) there are many firms for any degree of product differentiation. The reason for (i) is that complete product differentiation means limited power for merged firms to worsen the output distortion post-merger. In addition, since there is no change in pollution intensity post-merger, there will be no need to adjust the emission tax after the merger takes place. This underlines the importance of changes in pollution intensities and changes in output distortions in prompting an optimal change in the emission tax. The result in (ii) holds because the lack of sufficient output distortion post-merger when there are many firms in the market, removes the need to adjust the optimal taxation. The contribution of this study is at the intersection of three important branches of the existing literature. First, despite the growing number of studies on mergers and acquisitions, there are not many studies that include pollution parameters and resulting regulation in their models. The merger literature from Salant et al. (1983) to current (e.g. Blonigen and Pierce 2015) has largely focused on examining the motivations for and the effects of mergers (among pollution neutral firms) on market power and efficiency. There are merger studies that examine optimal change in other types of policies after mergers take place, but none of them examine optimal environmental policies in differentiated markets. For instance, Collie (2003) shows that the optimal response to mergers in oligopoly markets would be to increase production subsidy post-merger. If production subsidies are raised post-merger this action will offset the anti-competitive effect of a merger. Similarly, Huck and Konard (2004) show that the optimal response of an otherwise laissez-faire country is to introduce subsidies after firms merge. Likewise Fikru and Lahiri (2013) consider a flexible policy regime in which governments adjust optimal policy after a cross-border merger takes place. Their study shows that post-merger the optimal adjustment is to increase production subsidy as long as local firms acquire a more efficient foreign firm. Hence, the general consensus in the merger literature is that laxer taxation (e.g., subsidies) is optimal in response to a merger due to the output distortion created (exacerbated) by the merger. None of these studies examine the role of product differentiation and pollution intensities in the characterization of optimal taxation in the presence of mergers. Our contribution to this literature is that we derive conditions under which stricter taxation is optimal, specifically in the presence of pollution intensities and product differentiation, even when market power increases following a merger. Second, the literature on environmental policy in oligopoly markets shows that the type of market structure and number of firms affect optimal environmental policies. For example, Lahiri and Ono (2007) show that in Cournot oligopolies the effect of emission tax on welfare, production, and pollution depends on the specific market structure. On one hand studies like Ebert (1992), Katsoulacos and Xepapadeas (1996), Requate (2006) and Fujiwara (2009), just to name a few, suggest that an increase in market power limits production and pollution; hence, removing the need for stricter environmental regulations. In contrast, our result suggests that, even if market power increases following a merger, the optimal tax may be higher post-merger due to asymmetries in pollution intensities. We also find cases where there is no need to change the optimal emission tax post-merger. Hence, relaxing environmental regulation when market power increases should not always be viewed as a prescriptive solution in oligopoly markets with pollution externalities. On the other hand, studies like Simpson (1995) show that stricter taxation is optimal in Cournot markets where asymmetries in pollution intensity are present. The idea here is that a higher emission tax yields efficiency gains by discouraging inefficient firms in the market. Even though our analysis does not delve into efficiency aspects, it introduces cases where (in the presence of mergers) higher taxation is optimal even if asymmetries in efficiency are absent. A third branch of the literature examines the role of product differentiation on optimal policy (e.g., Fujiwara 2009; Poyago-Theotoky and Teerasuwannajak 2002; McGinty and Vries 2009) and reducing industry emissions (e.g., Lahiri and Symeonidis 2007; Gautier 2013, 2014, 2016). None of these works look at the role of product differentiation in the presence of mergers. We contribute to this literature by showing that the degree of product differentiation, in the presence of mergers, plays a crucial role in optimal taxation: markets characterized by very differentiated markets are associated with small differences in taxation pre- and post-merger, whereas in the case of homogeneous goods taxation post-merger could be stricter vis-à-vis pre-merger taxation. Mergers have a profound effect that goes beyond changing the number of firms in a market (Huck et al. 2004). On the one hand, mergers may facilitate innovation some of which are in cleaner technologies, synergies in reducing pollution intensities and the creation of high quality greener products (Swart and Marrewijk 2011; Bena and Li 2014). On the other hand, merging firms may prioritize growth, efficiency improvements and value creation at the expense of environmental protection. In both cases it is important to study if, how and why optimal environmental policies change as a response to mergers. Section 2 presents the model framework solving for equilibrium values before and after a two-firm merger takes place. Section 2.3 presents the welfare maximization problem and implications for the optimal choice of policy pre- and post-merger. Section 3 compares the pre-and post-merger optimal policies. In Sect. 4.1 we focus on the role of pollution intensity by keeping fixed the level of product differentiation. In Sect. 4.2 we focus on the role of product differentiation and number of firms by keeping fixed the pollution intensity. In Sect. 5 we conclude by forwarding some questions for future research.",11

One reason has been declining marginal tax rates for top incomes. Another is the effective high marginal tax faced by low income earners due to withdrawal of benefits as earnings rise, leading to the poverty trap. The existing tax structures in most developed countries are U-shaped, with increasing marginal tax (IMT) on high income earnings (but not on capital gains). The justification of IMT on top incomes is to raise revenue from those most able to pay, and provide a social safety net for the poor. This view is theoretically justified by Diamond (1998) and Saez (2001) based on their assumption that top income follows Pareto distributions (see also Salanié 2003). However, the shape of the optimal tax curve seems to be sensitive to income distributions. With a bounded distribution, Sadka (1976) and Seade (1977) find zero optimal marginal tax rate for the top earners. In general optimal tax curves are often inversely U-shaped or even declining (see Tuomala 1984; Kanbur and Tuomala 1994; Boadway et al. 2000; Tarkiainen and Tuomala 2007; Hashimzade and Myles 2007; Boadway and Jacquet 2008; Kaplow 2008), implying decreasing marginal taxes (DMT) on top incomes. But as Warren Buffet famously complained, the lower effective average tax rates paid by the rich, due to low capital gain taxes and various loopholes, are widely perceived to be unfair. This political problem often imposes a binding constraint and suggests a constrained optimal solution to be a flat tax, which by continuity should be closer to the optimal DMT and dominate IMT. Moreover, a flat tax will reduce administrative costs and avoid incentive distortions (see Atkinson 1995 for a good overview). Thus Mankiw et al. (2009) argue that “A flat tax, with a universal lump-sum transfer, could be close to optimal”. On the other hand, Diamond and Saez (2011), Piketty and Saez (2012, 2013) (DSPS) argue that if policy makers ignore the welfare of the richest group (due to their low marginal utility of income) and focus on the poor majority, the tax rate for top income should be 70–80%, supposedly higher than the tax rate for lower incomes. This policy has been successfully applied in the Scandinavian countries where high top tax rates co-exist with high labour force participation and the highest level of life satisfaction (Kleven 2014). The validity of different policy recommendations, IMT or flat tax, seems crucially dependent on social objectives as well as income distribution. This paper shows that even when DMT are optimal but not feasible, a flat tax may not be the next best alternative. Given any flat tax, we can increase the total utility of a poor majority by raising the tax rate on top earners under a simple condition, which means the optimal tax on top earnings derived by Saez (2001) is higher than the optimal flat tax. This condition generally holds when the poor majority is sufficiently large. Following DSPS (though they consider more general cases), we ignore the interests of the rich group and focus on the poor. Later we allow different weights given to different poor households, leading to a similar effect as decreasing marginal utility of income assumed by DSPS. Surprisingly, when we put more weight on the very poor households, a higher tax for top earners is less likely to benefit the poor. We first assume a constant elasticity of labour supply for the whole population. Later we assume more realistically declining elasticity with income and show that a higher top tax is more likely to be justified. This is consistent with the optimal IMT obtained by Aaberge and Colombino (2013) and Andrienko et al. (2014), using data from Norway, US, UK and Australia, with declining elasticity of labour supply. Continuous tax curves have been criticized as “too far removed from the tax–benefit systems observed in practice to be a useful guide for policy” (Chone and Laroque 2005, p. 396). Apps et al. (2009) remark that “Given its significance in practice, the piecewise linear tax system seems to have received disproportionately little attention in the literature on optimal income taxation.” Following Diamond and Saez (2011) who argue for practical and useful research on tax policy, we first consider two-band taxes. This system is the natural first step beyond a flat tax and can model IMT and DMT as well as a flat tax. Furthermore the two-band tax literature finds DMT optimal. 
Sheshinski (1989) first argued for increasing two-band taxes. However, Slemrod et al. (1994) find errors in his proof and use numerical simulations to show that DMT maximize maximin and utilitarian objectives. Similarly Salanié (2003), Hindricks and Myles (2006) obtain optimal decreasing two-band taxes in a two-class economy. Hence it is interesting to see if both decreasing and increasing two-band taxes dominate any flat tax. We later allow more tax bands and generalize our result accordingly. We introduce our two-band tax model in the next section. Section 3 shows that any flat tax is Pareto dominated by some DMT. Section 4 gives a sufficient condition for a higher top tax rate to benefit a poor majority and shows it is valid if the majority is sufficiently large. Section 5 extends our model and generalizes the results allowing different welfare weights for the poor, declining elasticity of labor supply and multiple-tax bands. Section 6 concludes the paper.",1
122.0,2.0,Journal of Economics,11 April 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-017-0538-4,Commodity taxes and welfare under endogenous market conduct,October 2017,Henrik Vetter,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Comparison of incidence speaks in favor of ad valorem over unit taxes in monopoly markets (Suits and Musgrave 1953), and more broadly in a homogenous-product market where fixed market conduct ranges from situations of monopoly to perfect competition (Delipalla and Keen 1992). With respect to policy conclusions, the preference for ad valorem taxation is largely upheld in symmetric Bertrand–Nash equilibrium in a differentiated-products market as shown by Anderson et al. (2001) and recently, in terms of pass-through rates, by Häckner and Herzing (2016). Existing analyses of ad valorem and unit taxes under oligopoly are based on the assumption that it is possible to change taxes without changing market conduct. Speaking to this point, established results might be a poor guide to policy because, as pointed out by Milgrom and Roberts (1990, p. 515), modern manufacturing technology is characterized by non-convexities. Thus, in capacity-then-price competition—when firms produce under one marginal cost within capacity and marginal cost jumps discontinuously when they exceed the capacity restriction—Maggi (1996) shows that market conduct is endogenous. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the efficiency of ad valorem and unit taxes when the taxes affect market conduct. The Bertrand–Edgeworth model with soft capacity constraints, as noted, is introduced in Maggi (1996), and in-house production versus external production, procurement of extra intermediate input at higher costs, and paying workers for overtime motivate the significance of soft capacity restrictions. In this setting, equilibrium is somewhere in between the Bertrand and Cournot outcomes, moving gradually towards the Cournot equilibrium as the significance of the capacity constraint increases. The significance of the capacity restriction is a function of demand conditions and production costs. Formally, taxes affect demand as well as costs because an ad valorem tax rotates demand, and the unit tax implies a shift of marginal costs. In this way, the taxes co-determine how the capacity restriction affects competition and this results in a relationship between taxes and endogenous market conduct.Footnote 1
 Ad valorem taxes have a pro-competitive effect because they are a tax on mark-up, and they are therefore favored, in comparison with unit taxes, under fixed market conduct. However, when the mix of ad valorem and unit taxes co-determines market conduct, ad valorem taxes promote the Cournot outcome more than unit taxes do. This has to do with the way that taxes affect firms’ gain from the soft capacity restriction. Under the soft capacity restriction, firms charge a price that is higher than the one dictated by their marginal cost even when they compete in prices. However, they will not charge more than the Cournot price and this upper limit on the price defines a critical value of the capacity restriction. Thus, firms charge the Cournot price when the actual value of the capacity restriction exceeds the critical value. The critical value depends on the tax rates and, depending upon parameters, more ad valorem taxation at the expense of unit taxation reduces it, and it is more likely that the actual value of the restriction exceeds the critical value that in turn promotes Cournot competition. On this basis, we show that it is sometimes better to use a pure unit tax rather than a pure ad valorem tax. In particular, moving from pure ad valorem taxation to pure unit taxation may change market conduct and presents a benefit on two accounts: it reduces the consumer price and increases the tax revenue. As a corollary, we establish results for more complex tax schemes where both tax rates are strictly positive. Recently, in differentiated oligopoly, Häckner and Herzing (2016) suggest that we analyze taxes and welfare in terms of pass through. Building on work by Weyl and Fabinger (2013), they discuss how tax incidence gives policymakers information in situations where the marginal cost of public funds is difficult or impossible to access. In particular, Häckner and Herzing (2016) demonstrate that the tax’s pass-through rate and the cost of public funds are inversely related. Based on this, pass-through rates for ad valorem and unit taxes suggest that it is always best to raise more revenue by adjusting the ad valorem tax rate (leaving the unit tax rate unchanged). Our results demonstrate that this conclusion holds only if market conduct is unaffected by the mix of the taxes. In fact, we show when it is best to reduce the ad valorem tax rate and increase the unit tax rate to provide more tax revenue. In public finance, the comparison of taxes is a recurring theme, and for oligopoly most analyses confirm the initial finding of Delipalla and Keen (1992), that ad valorem taxes are welfare superior to unit taxes. Some exceptions are Hamilton (2009), Wang and Zhao (2009), and Lapan and Hennessy (2011). In two-good multiproduct oligopoly, Lapan and Hennessy (2011) show that the welfare ranking of the two taxes is uncertain if goods are complements. Similarly, Hamilton (2009) shows the importance of consumer preferences by using the Dixit–Stiglitz (1977) approach for taste for variety in a model where multiproduct oligopolistic retailers are positioned (equally spaced) around a circle. Even with symmetric preferences, we cannot exclude that a revenue-neutral shift from ad valorem to unit taxes increases welfare. With respect to costs, Wang and Zhao (2009) and Lapan and Hennessy (2011) show that cost asymmetries can reverse the welfare ranking, which is not that surprising given the findings by Salant and Shaffer (1999) on cost minimization in duopoly. Using an approach that is very different from the aforementioned analyses because we model competition endogenously through firms’ capacity choice, we show when unit taxes are the best choice even under symmetry.Footnote 2
 The issue of taxes and market conduct is discussed in Vetter (2014) in a model of homogenous-good duopoly. In that analysis, the taxes have different competitive effects because the equilibrium is a consistent-conjectures equilibrium, and taxes affect equilibrium conjectures. Thus, the explanation for the taxes’ different effects is based on unobservable variables. Moreover, at least some literature views consistent conjectures as a poor explanation for behavior (see for example Lindh (1992)). In contrast, in this paper, the different effects of the two taxes are attributable to a cost parameter that is, in principle, observable. Furthermore, modeling capacity choice, we explicitly account for the mechanism whereby the tax structure affects firms’ longer-term decisions beyond the customary price or quantity decisions that have been analyzed previously in the literature on consumption taxes and welfare. Finally, a differentiated-products setting is arguably more realistic than the homogenous-products case discussed in Vetter (2014). The paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2 we discuss the model. The way taxes relate to market conduct is discussed in Sect. 3, and we compare unit versus ad valorem taxes in Sects. 4 and 5. Section 6 concludes. We stress that parts of the analysis is a straightforward application of Maggi (1996).",7
122.0,2.0,Journal of Economics,14 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-017-0556-2,On the implications of declining population growth for regional migration,October 2017,Thomas Christiaans,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The theories of economic growth and migration are mostly concerned with non-negative population growth rates. Following a long history of increasing populations, however, many industrialized countries nowadays experience a decline of their populations or at least have growth rates of population near zero. Especially in Europe only four countries have experienced above-replacement fertility during any 5-year period since 1990–1995; European population is prospected to decline from 738 millions in 2015 to 707 millions in 2050 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division 2015, pp. 1 and 10). While there are a few theoretical papers on economic growth that consider the implications of negative population growth (Samuelson 1975; Ritschl 1985; Ferrara 2011; Christiaans 2011; Sasaki and Hoshida 2016, e.g.), to the best of my knowledge there is just one theoretical analysis of migration in the context of economic growth with declining populations (Christiaans 2012). Nevertheless, some economists have very pessimistic expectations about the future consequences of shrinking populations, especially with respect to the development of rural regions. The following quotation provides a clear example: With the strong contraction of population the younger people will start to move to the congested urban areas, both from the country and from the smaller urban areas. The elderly will stay as long as possible, but will finally have to follow. The material infrastructure in the abandoned areas will decay. The institutions: enterprises, public administration, police, schools, universities, hospitals will disappear from these areas. They will not gently separate, so that the last to go switches off the light, but they will break down as suddenly as in an earthquake and leave chaos as after an earthquake. The material values invested in the province will be lost. E.g., houses become worthless, even if they are not already ruined, because nobody wants to buy them anymore. An atmosphere of gloom and doom will spread as on a sinking ship, and it will expand to the metropolises. Law and order cannot be upheld and the civil society will break down. Contractual claims and therefore also claims on insurances can only be established by private force, the economy will continue to shrink more than it would correspond to the contraction of the population. The elderly and the sick will be the first to suffer from the evolving barbarity. Social security will break down before the collapse of the entire society. (Brinkmann 2009, pp. 11–12, translation by author) While this quotation in some respects is akin to a prophecy, it nevertheless comprises serious arguments suitable to raise fears about the future development of shrinking societies shared by many researchers.Footnote 1 According to Reher (2007, p. 189), e.g., the decline in population will be the “key social issue of the twenty-first century”. An interesting question that has not been answered as yet, however, is whether standard neoclassical theory would also strengthen or lighten such fears. The present paper analyzes this question. Relating to the issue of migration from rural to urban areas, a study of the German Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung establishes a renaissance of cities since 2000. All but one of the ten fastest growing German cities over the period 2000–2009 have more than 500,000 inhabitants (Göddecke-Stellmann 2011, p. 5). The smaller towns and villages in the rural regions suffered a decline of their populations since 2004 (Göddecke-Stellmann 2011, p. 9). During 2007–2013, the mean annual growth rates of population in urban districts has been 0.48% in western and 0.89% in eastern Germany, while in several varieties of rural districts the rates have all been negative and ranged from \(-0.08\) to \(-1.28\%\) (Milbert 2015, p. 6). Remarkably the actual development therefore matches Brinkmann’s prophecy originally stated in January 2001 as part of his valedictory lecture. While it is understood that a monocausal explanation does not do justice to the phenomenon of migration to the cities, it is an important issue whether standard neoclassical arguments do support or moderate the thesis of a rural exodus. Countries like Germany considered in the preceding paragraph are not the classical examples used to explain notions like “rural exodus” or “urbanization”. It is therefore remarkable that even in Germany as in other European countries such a renaissance of cities can be observed in present days. Worldwide the process of urbanization is even more pronounced, as the following figures illustrate (cf. United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division 2014, p. 7): In 1950, about 70% of world population lived in rural areas. In 2014, about 54% of the world’s population live in urban regions. For the first time in history, the global urban population exceeded the global rural population in 2007. The United Nation’s projection for 2050 is that about 66% of population will live in urban areas. Modern neoclassical growth theory can roughly be classified into the theory of endogenous and the theory of semi-endogenous growth (cf. Christiaans 2004, e.g.). Most of the models of endogenous growth involve scale effects in that a larger population leads to a higher growth rate of per-capita income. Therefore, a steady state does not exist whenever the population growth rate does not vanish. Thus, introducing migration in such a model means that overall population must either be constant as e.g. in Glomm (1992), Premer and Walz (1994) or Lucas (2004), or population growth can only be introduced as a one-time change in the size of population as e.g. in the North–South model of Lundborg and Segerstrom (2002). Moreover, endogenous growth is always a knife-edge case. Models of endogenous growth are therefore not suitable to analyze migration in case of a negative population growth rate. Nevertheless, the following analysis is related to Glomm (1992) in that the influence of quasi-linear preferences will finally be analyzed. While Glomm (1992) concludes that there will be a permanent migration from the rural to the urban region (a complete rural exodus), the main conclusion of the present paper is that such an entire exodus will take place only if the overall population growth rate falls short of minus the rate of depreciation of physical capital. Nevertheless, a decline in the population growth rate will always induce some additional migration into the urban region. The scale effects of population size are absent in models of semi-endogenous growth. It is shown in Christiaans (2011) for the case of a semi-endogenous growth model that there is indeed a case for pessimistic expectations about the growth performance of a country experiencing a decline of its population. For a wide range of reasonable parameter values, a negative population growth rate induces a decline in per-capita income.Footnote 2 The present paper investigates whether a prediction about a rural exodus can also be substantiated by a neoclassical model of interregional migration in a growth context. It sticks to the theory of semi-endogenous growth by considering variations of a standard two-sector growth and migration model. To keep matters as simple as possible, it concentrates on a model without long-run per-capita growth. This simplicity allows for an analytical solution of a model with non-homothetic preferences that is able to at least partly explain migration from rural to urban areas as a result of a decline in population growth. A related model by Reichlin and Rustichini (1998) concentrates on diverging growth patterns in a two-country setting of semi-endogenous growth, each producing the same good, in an overlapping generations model with positive population growth. Migration is due to increasing returns to scale at the aggregate level. In contrast, the present paper is concerned with two regions producing industrial and agricultural goods, respectively, and simplifies the analysis by neglecting overlapping generations. The classical saving function that is used prevents inefficient oversaving that may arise in case of overlapping generations. The main focus of the analysis is to identify forces that determine the impact of declining and possibly negative population growth on the directions of migration in such a setting, even without increasing returns to scale but with different capital intensities in the two regions. The analysis starts in Sect. 2.1 with the standard neoclassical two-sector growth and migration model of Mas-Colell and Razin (1973) and investigates the implications of declining population growth rates that eventually become negative. The result is that these changes do not induce migration in either direction. Section 2.2 starts with a brief review of the model of semi-endogenous growth and migration analyzed in Christiaans (2012), where again the decline in population does not induce any migration. The main reason for this behavior turns out to be the assumption of homothetic preferences in both of the cases. Therefore, a similar model is presented that simplifies matters by assuming technical progress away but introduces quasi-linear preferences. A decline in population growth now leads to migration from the rural to the industrial region, thereby reinforcing pessimistic expectations about a rural exodus. The final section concludes and argues that there is indeed a case for pessimism, because the neutrality of population growth with respect to migration in the other models is based on an unrealistic assumption about consumer preferences.",7

Human capital accumulation is considered a driving force in economic growth theory, and its spillover effects have been broadly recognized in the literature: a noteworthy model on the topic is the Uzawa–Lucas model (Uzawa 1965; Lucas 1988). On the other hand, researchers have also empirically evidenced negative growth effects on education. For instance, Pritchett (2001) highlights the dwindling output of education by posing the question “Where has all the education gone?” Measuring human capital by the number of scientists and engineers and of patents in the United States, Jones (1995) shows decreasing returns from human capital investment in R&D. According to the Uzawa–Lucas model, which does not account for an explicit patent system, decreasing returns from human capital can be attributed to the lower per capita efficiency of scientists and engineers. In other words, human capital productivity is less efficient when driven by economic growth, and larger human capital investments are needed to accumulate human capital measured by productivity. Thus, the present study aims to analyze the dynamic properties associated with the negative effects of economic growth on human capital accumulation. The Uzawa–Lucas model analyzes the education–growth relationship. Many studies have attempted to expand the model, because of its conciseness, by introducing human capital externalities to analyze various dynamic properties such as the emergence of indeterminacy or poverty traps. Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin (1993), Benhabib and Perli (1994), and Xie (1994) are some of the early works in this vein, while Gomez (2003), Goenka and Poulsen (2005), Bethmann (2007), Wirl (2011), and Gorostiaga et al. (2013) are relatively recent studies. These works mainly analyze the emergence of indeterminacy, assuming that externalities are basically in the production sector. However, this study posits spillover effects in human capital accumulation, that is, the education sector.Footnote 1 To capture the negative effects of economic development on human capital accumulation, we assume a positive spillover from human capital and, at the same time, a negative spillover from economic growth. In the usual Uzawa–Lucas model, the exogenously given efficiency parameter of human capital accumulation (i.e., educational efficiency) and linearity of human capital investment are critical determinants of the long-run growth rate. Accordingly, we obtain a long-run growth rate of \((1/\theta )(b-\rho )\), denoting educational efficiency by b, subjective discount by \(\rho \), and intertemporal substitution elasticity by \(1/\theta \). This long-run growth is realized if \(b>\rho \); however, there is no human capital accumulation if \(b<\rho \), and the economy is stuck in a no-growth trap. Thus, the realization of long-run growth is contingent on exogenously given parameter restrictions in the usual Uzawa–Lucas model.Footnote 2 By contrast, our model assumes that b, the critical determinant factor in the normal Uzawa–Lucas model for the long-run growth rate, is endogenously determined. Therefore, our analysis can be regarded as one step ahead in estimating the long-run growth rate. Economists have often accounted for multiplicity when determining an economic growth path. Some empirical works (e.g., Easterly 1994; Quah 1996, 1997) have reported polarization of the global economy. Lucas (1988) highlights the “mystery of economic growth” in Korea and the Philippines, two similar economies with differing growth paths. In the past two decades, some underdeveloped countries have experienced not only rapid economic growth but also economic shocks such as the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis. Even modern advanced economies and countries experiencing positive long-term growth have been repeatedly experiencing economic shocks in recent times, such as the 2001 dot-com bubble burst, 2008 financial crisis, and 2010 European debt crisis, which have led to persistent stagnation in the global economy. Summers (2014) terms this as “secular stagnation.” Krugman (1991) and Matsuyama (1991), in their article “History versus Expectations,” discuss the multiplicity of economic paths, and increasing returns play an important role in their study. As for this multiplicity of steady states, the Uzawa–Lucas model also provides a good framework, mainly by uniting labor and leisure choice. We can cite Benhabib and Perli (1994) and Ladrón-de-Guevara et al. (1999) as early works on this topic. The model in the present study also yields multiplicity of steady states without using labor–leisure choice. It is derived by only an additive mechanism, externality effects in educational efficiency. Furthermore, early studies of endogenous growth theory, such as Benhabib and Farmer (1994) and Boldrin and Rustichini (1994), also show that indeterminacy can be attributed to sufficiently large externalities. However, these results have been criticized, and some extended to establish the conditions under which indeterminacy emerges without assuming strong degrees of increasing returns to scale. For example, Benhabib and Perli (1994) and Benhabib and Farmer (1996) introduce an endogenous labor–leisure choice in their model. Benhabib et al. (1999) and Mino (2001) assume a two-sector endogenous growth model with social constant returns. The present study shows that indeterminacy phenomena emerge as long as externality exists even if it is negligible. Thus, the current study also obtains indeterminacy and multiplicity of steady states, but differs from the previous works in two respects. The first concerns the setup of the model. The educational sector is characterized by externality, which reflects the negative effects of economic growth on human capital reported by Pritchett (2001) and Jones (1995), as described above. Furthermore, previous studies usually yield multiple steady states by assuming a labor–leisure choice, but our model does not incorporate labor–leisure choice as a necessary condition for multiple steady states. The second is the ease with which indeterminacy emerges. Our type of externality can provide indeterminacy under negligible, but not zero, externalities. In addition, we show that the steady state with indeterminacy has a higher growth rate, which is consistent with the following evidence: before a shock hits, the economy often grows at a higher rate, a phenomenon which economists have attempted to explain. For example, viewing these shocks as monetary phenomena, Woodford (1990) explains crowding-in of investment in a bubble economy, and Kunieda and Shibata (2012) show that the bubble burst was preceded by high total factor productivity (TFP) growth, using a model with TFP growth in boom and bubble economies. By contrast, our model is a non-monetary one and explains these phenomena using equilibrium growth dynamics with a high growth rate and indeterminacy properties obtained in the study. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 derives the steady states. Section 4 discusses the dynamics and stability of the system. Section 5 provides concluding remarks.",3

This is evidenced by the fact that the merchandise exports of developing countries represented 44.8% of world exports in 2015, up from 24.2% in 1990. Similarly, these countries’ share of outward FDI also increased dramatically, from 5.4% in 1990 to 25.6% in 2015.Footnote 1 For the most part, the increasing contribution by developing countries to both exports and outward FDI reflects the improved access of these countries to foreign markets. Integration into the world economy has long been regarded as an important instrument for developing countries to promote economic growth. Although there are many channels through which exports and outward FDI foster economic development, one strand of research has focused on whether and how they drive the process of technological upgrading. For example, some empirical studies have investigated how trade liberalization affects technological upgrading in exporting countries. Lileeva and Trefler (2010) found that US tariff cuts induced Canadian plants to commence or increase exporting, and that these plants increased their productivity by engaging in greater product innovation and having higher adoption rates for advanced technologies. Bustos (2011) showed that the reduction in Brazilian tariffs associated with the formation of Mercado Común del Sur (MERCOSUR) induced Argentinean firms to adopt more advanced technology. Aw et al. (2011) showed that a reduction in trade costs increased the probability of exports and R&D investments by a Taiwanese electronics plant. Other empirical studies have investigated the impact of outward FDI on firm productivity. For example, Kimura and Kiyota (2006) concluded that Japanese outward FDI had a positive impact on firm productivity, while Hijzen et al. (2007) found no significant effect on productivity by controlling for the endogeneity between outward FDI and productivity. Likewise, Bitzer and Görg (2009) investigated the productivity effect of outward FDI using data for 17 OECD countries and found a negative, although heterogeneous, relationship across countries. Chen and Yang (2013) found that the relationship between a firm’s outward FDI and domestic R&D is indeterminate. Lancheros (2016) found that, although exporting has encouraged domestic firms to upgrade their technology, outward FDI has acted as a substitute for such technological activities. Based on these empirical evidences, it would be safe to conclude that the productivity effect of outward FDI can be either positive or negative. These empirical studies suggest that the productivity effect of better access to foreign markets depends on the firm’s choice of mode between exporting and FDI. There have been few analyses, however, of how improved market access affects firm decisions to upgrade technology, especially given that these mode choices are endogenously determined. Among the existing work, Saggi (1999) developed a two-period duopoly model where a firm chooses between licensing and FDI and investigated the relative impact of these modes on the incentives for R&D in the two firms. Petit and Sanna-Randaccio (1998, 2000) examined how the choice between exporting and FDI affects the incentive to innovate, while Xie (2011) analyzed, both theoretically and empirically, how optimal R&D investments of firms are associated with their choices between exporting, licensing, and FDI. The purpose of this paper is to provide new insight on this area, using a simple oligopoly model in which both firm location and level of technology are endogenously determined. We then examine the effects of improved market access on technology adoption through both trade and FDI liberalization. Specifically, we develop a duopoly model where two foreign firms compete in the domestic market and each firm decides whether to serve the domestic market via exporting from the foreign country or undertake horizontal FDI.Footnote 2 A notable feature of this analysis is that a firm’s technology choice is analyzed in a dynamic model of technology adoption (TA). Explicitly, two foreign firms, which have not yet adopted advanced technology, determine the timing of TA to maximize its intertemporal profit given that the cost of TA declines over time. The model also assumes away technological spillover among firms. This assumption enables us to extract the effect of improved market access rather than that of improved access to superior technology. This setup provides some advantages over a static model of trade and FDI with endogenous R&D. First, it enables us to examine not only how firms’ ex ante location choices affect their incentives to upgrade their technologies but also how the implemented technologies affect ex post  the firms’ location choices. This two-way relationship between R&D investment and location choice has been overlooked in the literature. For instance, Saggi (1999), Petit and Sanna-Randaccio (2000), and Xie (2011) considered only the ex ante effect because, in their models, firms choose their supply mode before they engage in R&D. The ex post effect of technology on location, however, is also important, as Helpman et al. (2004) suggest. Petit and Sanna-Randaccio (1998) considered the two-way relationship and showed that a monopolist engaged in R&D is more likely to choose FDI, leading in turn to a higher level of R&D activities. However, their paper did not consider strategic interactions between firms in both location choices and R&D activities. This paper is distinct in that it takes into account the two-way relationship in a duopoly model, where a firm’s location choice and the adoption of new technology depend on the other firm’s location choice and TA. Because of the strategic interactions between firms, promoting FDI does not necessarily lead to TA, but may hurt the domestic consumers. Second, the model can help us explore not only whether improved market access enhances TA but also whether it speeds up TA. If the cost of TA sufficiently declines in the long run, as assumed in the basic setup, firms end up adopting new technology at some point in time, irrespective of their location choices or government policies affecting market access. Even so, the speed of new TA by firms would vary if the gains from TA differ. From the viewpoint of economic development, faster adoption of new technology should speed up the development process and generate higher intertemporal welfare in that country. The seminal work here is that of Miyagiwa and Ohno (1995), who investigated the effects of permanent and temporary protection on the timing of TA for the domestic firm. As in our model, Miyagiwa and Ohno (1995) also considered horizontal FDI, but their focus was on how FDI, possible for the foreign firm, affects the timing of TA for the domestic firm. In contrast, our focus is on how the FDI of the foreign firm affects TA by the foreign firm itself. Other theoretical studies have analyzed the timing of TA in the context of international trade. For instance, Crowley (2006) compared the impacts of safeguard tariffs and antidumping duties on the outcomes of a technology adoption game between firms located in different countries. Ederington and McCalman (2008, 2009) explored how firm heterogeneity and a decline in the number of firms in an industry evolve as a result of TA influenced by international trade. Vashchilko (2013) showed that a decrease in the tariff on the imports of final products and an increase in the tariff on the imports of inputs speed up TA by the domestic firm. Using a three-country model, Mukunoki (2015) investigated how preferential trade agreements change the speed of both new technology adoption and realization of multilateral free trade. However, none of these studies considered the endogenous location choices of firms. The results of the analysis are summarized as follows. If a single foreign firm serves the domestic market, liberalization of FDI, represented by a reduction in the fixed cost of FDI, promotes TA. TA is quickest if the foreign firm undertakes FDI both before and after its TA. Trade liberalization, on the other hand, may delay TA because it increases only the pre-adoption profit and decreases the gains from TA when the foreign firm’s supply mode changes from exporting to FDI as a result of TA. Nonetheless, TA is attained most rapidly under free trade. These results suggest that in the absence of competition between foreign firms, elimination of trade barriers contributes to the technological development of foreign countries. Since improved access to the domestic market promotes TA and FDI at the same time, free trade or free FDI to the domestic market maximizes the domestic consumer surplus. However, these results contradict the aforementioned empirical results that improved access to international markets may not encourage, but can indeed discourage, technological advancements in developing countries. In contrast, if two foreign firms compete in the domestic market, multilateral liberalization of FDI does not necessarily accelerate (but may even delay) TA of all firms. On the one hand, multilateral reduction in the fixed cost of FDI makes a firm more likely to undertake FDI, and the FDI increases the investing firm’s gains from TA. On the other hand, it promotes the FDI and TA of the rival firm, which intensifies product market competition and diminishes the gains from TA. Because of the latter effect, multilateral liberalization may reduce the gains from the firm’s own TA. Conversely, if multilateral liberalization induces the rival firm to choose FDI even before the firm itself adopts the new technology, the rival’s FDI in the pre-adoption period increases the gains from TA if the adoption blocks the rival’s FDI (FDI-blocking effect), or if it promotes its own FDI while crowding out the rival’s FDI (FDI-conversion effect). In the latter case, TA may be quicker and consumer surplus larger compared to a situation where the fixed cost of FDI is removed and both firms always enjoy free access to the domestic market. These intertemporal changes in FDI patterns is consistent with the fact that the firms’ foreign affiliates frequently enter and exit the market in the real world.Footnote 3 The same argument applies to multilateral trade liberalization, so that free trade does not necessarily maximize the speed of new technology adoption by foreign firms. These results indicate that strategic interactions among firms in both TA and FDI are key to explaining why the relationship between improving market access and technology upgrading is not monotonic in the existing empirical analyses. The paper also investigates whether preferential liberalization of FDI targeted at one of the two firms may help expedite TA. For instance, many countries have concluded bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with other countries and preferentially liberalize FDI measures. As of March 2017, the number of BITs in force was as much as 2332.Footnote 4 We found that preferential liberalization has a technology creation effect on the targeted firm (by promoting TA) and a technology diversion effect on the other firm (by discouraging TA). However, the FDI-conversion effect of TA does not emerge with preferential liberalization. Therefore, consumers in the domestic country prefer preferential liberalization only if the targeted firm realizes TA much earlier than it would under multilateral liberalization. One policy implication drawn from these findings is that opening the home market to overseas producers and their products does not necessarily enhance technological development of those producers. For more rapid diffusion of advanced technologies, the degree of market access should be kept neither very low nor very high in order to simultaneously increase firms’ post-adoption profits and decrease their pre-adoption profits. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops a benchmark model where a single foreign firm chooses its supply mode and time of TA. Section 3 details a duopoly model where two foreign firms compete in the domestic market and where both firms choose their supply mode and decide the time of TA. We also compare multilateral liberalization and preferential liberalization of FDI. Section 4 conducts a welfare analysis and investigates whether liberalization benefits consumers in the domestic country. Section 5 summarizes the paper and offers some concluding remarks. The “Appendix” provides proofs for the lemmas and propositions.",
122.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,18 April 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-017-0541-9,Local content and emission taxes when the number of foreign firms is endogenous,November 2017,Luis Gautier,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There is a wide range of developing countries which have employed local content requirements to promote employment and stimulate the development of industries (for specific cases see e.g., UNIDO 1986, 2011a, b; Sturgeon 1998; Lahiri and Ono 2003; Ado 2013; UNCTAD 2014). At the same time, developing countries face environmental issues and, as a result, some have implemented market-based policies such as emission/carbon taxes (e.g., Blackman and Harrington 2000; Shan and Larsen 1992; Tyler et al. 2013) as well as local content requirements to meet green energy objectives (UNCTAD 2014, pp. 19–26). The analysis of the interplay between development and environmental policy is thus relevant (Bowen 2012). With these in mind, this paper examines the effects of emission taxes and local content requirements on emissions and foreign direct investment (FDI) where firms behave à la Cournot. The analysis explores the policy reform of emission taxes and local content requirements and, in addition, the conditions under which stricter/laxer local content and emission taxes aid in the reduction of emissions and increase in income via FDI. The literature on FDI and environmental policy is vast, but the contribution of the present work lies at the intersection of two important strands (see Requate 2006; Lambertini 2013 for a survey of the literature of environmental policy under imperfect competition). One strand examines whether FDI reduces pollution and increase output by foreign, less polluting firms. The idea here is that foreign firms bring in advanced, less polluting technology to the host country thereby lowering pollution (Zarsky 1999, p. 56). This hypothesis is referred to in the literature as the pollution halo hypothesis. Dardati and Saygili (2012) find evidence in the case of Chile that foreign firms are cleaner than domestic firms, Eskeland and Harrison (1997) find that foreign firms are more fuel efficient (i.e., use less dirty fuels) in the case of Morocco, Venezuela, Mexico and Cote dIvoire, and Blackman and Wu (1998) find similar evidence in the case of China. However, Neumayer (2001, p. 17) argues that the evidence of the pollution halo hypothesis is ambiguous. Zarsky (1999) analyzes case studies around the world where foreign firms bring in better environmental practices, but larger environmental impacts might still be present. Grether and Melo (2004) list some of the mixed evidence on the pollution halo hypothesis. With this empirical literature in mind, a theoretical literature, assuming Cournot competition, has emerged, which shows that stricter environmental regulation (absent of local content requirements) may not deter FDI (i.e., may not deter foreign firms from relocating to the host country) and the conditions under which this result holds (e.g., Dijkstra et al. 2011; Sanna-Randaccio and Sestini 2012; Elliott and Zhou 2012; Gautier 2017). The present paper adds to this line of research by considering an emission tax and local content requirement to examine the effects on both FDI and emissions. I derive conditions under which higher taxation may attract FDI, particularly in the presence of local content requirements. The analysis also suggests, inter alia, that the government may respond to increasingly relatively pollution-intensive home firms by setting laxer taxation and local content requirements.Footnote 1 This is because relatively more pollution intensive home firms facilitate the entry of foreign, less pollution intensive firms, particularly under laxer policy. But in the case where the government uses entry incentives arising from the abatement induced by the emission tax to attract FDI, stricter taxation and stricter local content requirements are consistent with the promotion of FDI and addressing damages from pollution. This result shows the viability of stricter policy in the presence of free-entry and, additionally, the crucial role of free-entry in the characterization of policy. This paper contributes, moreover, to a branch of the literature which examines the implications of policy on free-entry markets e.g., Matsumura and Okumura (2014), Kayalica and Lahiri (2005), Bayındır-Upmann (2003), Lahiri and Ono (1995, 2015), Requate (1997), Lee (1999), Conrad and Wang (1993) and Katsoulacos and Xepapadeas (1995) to name a few. Matsumura and Okumura (2014), for example, show that under free entry quotas reduce welfare vis-à-vis taxes because quotas lead to excessive entry. In contrast, the present analysis indicates that an emission tax may not only control for excessive entry, but also serve as an incentive for entry via the pollution abatement induced by the tax, particularly in the presence of entry-restrictive policies such as local content requirements. It is shown that some of the results are reversed in the case where the number of firms is fixed. A second important strand touches on the role of the local content (absent of emission taxes) and firm location decisions i.e., foreign firms are determined endogenously e.g., Lahiri and Ono (1998, 2003, 2004) and Qiu and Tao (2001). In a sense the present work is closest to Lahiri and Ono (1998). There are two fundamental contributions to their work. First, the present work incorporates issues of local pollution and an emission tax, while Lahiri and Ono’s work only looks at the local content and profit taxation. Second, I consider exogenous changes in the pollution intensity coefficient to analyze the effect on emissions and FDI arising from policy adjustments. The present work adds to this literature by exploring the conditions (e.g., efficiency and incentives to enter the market) under which policy adjustments of emission taxes and local content requirements address emissions and promote FDI. The analysis contributes also to a small line of research, which studies aspects of policy reform of environmental policy under imperfect competition (e.g., Hoel 1991; Hatzipanayotou et al. 2005; Lahiri and Symeonidis 2007; Bhattacharya and Pal 2010; Gautier 2013, 2014). Specifically, there are no works which look at the role of the local content requirement on policy reform alongside environmental policy and so the present work fills this void. This paper develops a two-stage game where the host government first sets the emission tax and local content simultaneously; on the second stage firms take policy as given and maximize profits by choosing the level of output and emissions in a Cournot–Nash fashion. Firms compete for the production of a homogeneous good, which is exported to a third market exclusively. Relative to foreign firms, domestic firms may be more, less or equally pollution intensive, and at the same time foreign firms are relatively more efficient. The relative efficiency of foreign firms and asymmetry of pollution intensities, coupled with the free entry and exit assumption of foreign firms, allows to focus the analysis on issues of FDI and emissions. The paper is structured as follows. The next section presents the model, followed by the comparative statics exercise. In Sect. 4 I examine the extent to which exogenous changes in the pollution intensity coefficient of domestic firms affect optimal policy, welfare, emissions and FDI. Section 5 explores the case where the number of foreign firms is exogenous. The last section concludes with suggestions for future research.",3
122.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,16 May 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-017-0548-2,International asymmetric R&D rivalry and industrial strategy,November 2017,Yasunori Ishii,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"It is well known that numerous global firms conduct cost-reducing or “process” R&D, and/or quality-improving or “product” R&D for reinforcing their competitive power in international markets. They learn through experience that they cannot survive in competitive global markets without resorting to process and/or product R&D. Athey and Schmutzler (1995), Cohen and Klepper (1996), Boone (2000), Thompson and Waldo (2000), Fritsch and Meschede (2001), Lin (2004), and Inkmann (2010) have revealed the co-existence of process and product R&D in many industries. In particular, Lunn (1986), Lee and Stone (1994), Bertschek (1995), and Becker and Eggar (2013) have explored the same issues in international industries. Furthermore, as is widely known, not all firms in an industry are involved in the same type of R&D (process or product R&D). There usually are no mutual agreements in international markets that force firms to adopt the same type of R&D, and firms usually decide on the type of R&D they wish to pursue. Therefore, some firms execute process R&D, while others adopt product R&D, which demonstrates that firms act in international industries under asymmetrical R&D rivalry. In this study, when all firms in an industry undertake either process or product R&D, R&D competition is defined as symmetrical R&D rivalry, whereas when firms in an industry undertake different types of R&D, that is, some firms execute process R&D and others conduct product R&D, such R&D competition is defined as asymmetrical R&D rivalry. Certain firms might adopt both types of R&D investments simultaneously, but such firms can theoretically be divided into two groups that undertake asymmetrical R&D. Nevertheless, existing theoretical studies focusing on the R&D decisions of firms mostly analyze symmetrical R&D rivalry, in which all firms in the industry undertake the same type of R&D, and do not consider asymmetrical R&D rivalry. For example, Spencer and Brander (1983) and Bagwell and Staiger (1994) assume that all firms conduct process R&D investments, while Park (2001), Zhou et al. (2002), Jinji and Toshimitsu (2006), Ishii (2014), and Taba and Ishii (2016) assume that all firms execute product R&D investments. Clearly, these assumptions of symmetrical R&D rivalry are in contrast with the asymmetrical R&D rivalry empirically observed in the real world. Then, it is not prudent to suggest optimal behaviors of firms and optimal R&D policies of governments in the real world by considering the findings of the studies assuming symmetrical R&D rivalry. Therefore, the present study considers asymmetrical R&D rivalry as original and meaningful from both theoretical and empirical viewpoints. These arguments constitute our motivation for the present study. The model in this study is established by replacing one firm in a symmetrical product (process) R&D investment model with a firm that conducts process (product) R&D investment and adopting some necessary adjustments. That is, we construct our model by converting one firm in the symmetrical product R&D investment model explored by Taba and Ishii (2016) into a firm that undertakes process R&D investment and introducing some necessary conditions under which such a firm acts to decrease its production costs. Although it seems easy to build our model, it is quite different from those in the existing studies assuming symmetrical process or product rivalry. In our model, firms avoid direct quality-improving or cost-reducing competition by adopting their advantageous R&D investments as their strategic variables. We find that, while an increase in the R&D investment subsidy of a country raises the R&D investment of its own firm, it decreases that of its rival firm, and vice versa. We also show that, while an increase in the R&D investment of a firm raises its output, it reduces that of its rival firm, and vice versa. Therefore, an increase in the R&D investment subsidy in a country enlarges the market share of its own firm, but curtails that of its rival firm, and vice versa. Further, we demonstrate that the effects of changes in R&D investments of these firms on their prices are asymmetrical, that is, while an increase in the process R&D investment of the cost-reducing firm lowers the prices of both firms, an increase in the product R&D investment of the quality-improving firm raises its own price, but reduces the price of its rival firm, and vice versa. Finally, we clarify that the optimal R&D investment policies of both countries are to give subsidies, even when their firms determine outputs and R&D investments under asymmetrical R&D investment rivalry. The remainder of this study is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we model an international duopoly under asymmetrical R&D rivalry. We use a three-stage game model, where the governments set R&D policies in the first stage, and the firms choose asymmetrical R&D investments and outputs in the second and third stages, respectively. Section 3 analyzes the output decisions of the firms in the third stage. Section 4 examines the asymmetrical R&D investment choices of the firms in the second stage. Section 5 explores the optimal R&D policies implemented by governments in the first stage. Section 6 provides our concluding remarks.",1
122.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,20 April 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-017-0537-5,Aspirations and the transfer paradox in an overlapping generations model,November 2017,Kojun Hamada,Tsuyoshi Shinozaki,Mitsuyoshi Yanagihara,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"In this study, we examine whether and how donor or recipient aspirations impact the welfare effect of an international transfer in a dynamic setting. In spite of the fact that intergenerational aspirations can affect capital accumulation in a dynamic setting and that capital accumulation can cause the transfer paradox, few studies have examined the transfer problem when there are aspirations in an OLG model. Therefore, this study examines the transfer problem involving two countries when either the donor or the recipient has aspirations, based on parents’ standards of living, in a one-sector overlapping generations (OLG) model. Ever since Keynes (1929) pointed out that a transfer is likely to diminish the transferrer’s welfare, and Samuelson (1952, 1954) demonstrated that no transfer paradox can occur in a Walrasian stable market equilibrium in two countries, the transfer problem has attracted the attention of many economists engaged in the theory of international trade. In static frameworks, the existing literature has demonstrated that in order for the transfer paradox to occur in a two-country model, distortions are required that restrict free trade. These might include exogenous distortions caused by trade barriers (tariffs or subsidies) or endogenous distortions (rent seeking or administrative costs of transfers).Footnote 1 In contrast, in a dynamic framework, and especially in an OLG model, the existing literature has shown that the transfer paradox can take place in a two-country model, without any distortions, even in a dynamically efficient region, because capital accumulated over time affects the welfare of both countries. Ever since the seminal work of Galor and Polemarchakis (1987), who used an OLG model to show that a permanent lump-sum transfer can cause the transfer paradox in a steady-state equilibrium, numerous studies have noted the possibility of the transfer paradox occurring in a dynamic framework, unlike the case of a static framework. Haaparanta (1989) proved that a transfer paradox can occur when a temporary transfer is financed by public debt in the donor country and/or is used for debt relief in the recipient country. Cremers and Sen (2008) extended the analysis to the transition to a steady state, and demonstrated that the results of Galor and Polemarchakis (1987) can also be applied to such a transition.Footnote 2
 However, in spite of its importance, few studies have addressed the problem of how intergenerational influences in a country, such as aspirations based on parents’ living standards, impact the effectiveness of the international transfer. In reality, many macroeconomists have been investigating how such aspirations affect economic growth. Aspirations are an important notion in describing intergenerational behavior. Although modern economics has evolved under the conventional assumption that economic agents are perfectly rational, recent studies have revealed that agents are influenced by various cognitive biases and inherited preferences, which contradicts the assumption of perfect rationality. In particular, since Duesenberry (1949) demonstrated that “keeping up with the neighboring Joneses” drives consumption aspirations, a considerable number of studies have noted the existence of habit formation and aspirations. For example, using direct individual data, Stutzer (2004) shows empirically that higher income aspirations reduce people’s utility, and in an experimental study, McBride (2010) finds clear evidence that aspirations affect happiness. Of the few studies to examine aspiration formation in an OLG model, De la Croix and Michel (1999) were the first to incorporate aspiration formation in an OLG model to clarify the conditions required for optimal growth. Then, De la Croix (1996, 2001), De la Croix and Michel (2001), and Artige et al. (2004) investigated the stability condition in an OLG model that included aspirations. Barnett and Bhattacharya (2008) examine how the existence of rejuvenated individuals, being older agents who derive utility from keeping their consumption levels comparable to those of current younger persons, affects economic growth in a standard OLG model. Alonso-Carrera et al. (2007) explore a model incorporating both aspirations and habit formation and demonstrated that aspirations and habit formation have opposite effects on the bequest motive. However, few studies have used an OLG model to investigate how the existence of aspirations affects an international economy in terms of, for example, trade patterns and the transfer problem. In contrast, several studies have dealt with habit formation in a two-country continuous-time Ramsey model. Since Ryder and Heal (1973) presented a model dealing with consumption habits to clarify the characteristics of optimal paths, several studies have examined the bilateral relationship in a continuous-time Ramsey model with habit formation. Focusing on the effect of habit formation on trade, Mansoorian (1993) uses the model of Ryder and Heal (1973) to show that the Harberger–Laursen–Metzler effect holds, where a deterioration in terms-of-trade causes a decrease in savings due to a decrease in real income. Carroll et al. (2000) show that a growth model in which an individual cares about the habit stock determined by past consumption can explain why savings and growth are positively correlated across countries. Ikeda and Gombi (2009) extend the model with habit persistence to a two-country world economy, and show that an increase in fiscal spending in one country can benefit the country and harm others, owing to reversed intertemporal terms-of-trade effects. In particular, as the most important contribution in a Ramsey model, Gombi and Ikeda (2003) demonstrate that the transfer paradox can occur in a free-trade, dynamically stable economy, using a two-country model with habit-forming consumers. Although there is an essential difference between the setting of a Ramsey model and that of an OLG model, their study addresses the same problem we do here. Both elucidate how the intertemporal dependence of preferences, such as habit formation or aspirations, impacts the welfare effect of a transfer. Aspirations in an OLG model differ from habit formation in a continuous-time Ramsey model. Aspirations based on parents’ standards of living are an exogenous preference, and generations cannot change the consumption levels inherited from the preceding generation. In contrast, habit formation is based on an individual’s previous consumption. In this case, individuals can determine their consumption level, taking into account whether the initial consumption levels they chose subsequently affect their utility. Thus, habit formation in a Ramsey model is referred to as “rational” because a representative individual foresees what will happen in the future perfectly after choosing the initial consumption. Moreover, we cannot examine the intergenerational influence in a continuous-time Ramsey model because the model does not include different generations; representative individuals live forever. Therefore, we adopt the OLG model to consider the intergenerational influence explicitly. Then, we investigate how aspirations inherited from parents impact the effectiveness of an international transfer from a donor to a recipient on the welfare of each country through the change in capital accumulation. Considering the situation in which each generation in a country inherits aspirations from parents, we aim to fill the existing gap between the Ramsey model and the OLG model. In particular, we examine whether the degree of aspirations alters the likelihood of the transfer paradox occurring, where the donor is enriched and/or the recipient is immiserized as a result of the transfer. This study also sheds new light on the conditions necessary for the transfer paradox to occur when there is an intergenerational externality on preferences. Here, we incorporate aspirations into an individual’s preference. In the theoretical framework dealing with the transfer problem, several studies have investigated the conditions necessary for the paradox to occur. Hamada and Yanagihara (2014) explore a model in which the donor has an altruistic utility to the recipient, and demonstrate that, contrary to the first impression, as the donor becomes highly altruistic, donor enrichment is not likely to occur. Hamada and Yanagihara (2016) consider a situation in which an individual has intergenerational altruism, and show that the condition for the transfer paradox to occur is independent of the degree of this altruism. Although aspirations differ from altruism, our study has a common interest with the afore-mentioned literature on how the externality of consumption or utility fosters or hinders the effect of a transfer on the donor’s or the recipient’s welfare. Our results are as follows. First, in the case where a donor with an aspiration preference has a higher marginal propensity to save than does the recipient, donor enrichment is more likely to occur in the steady state as the donor’s degree of aspirations increases. However, there is no effect on the recipient’s welfare. When the recipient has an aspiration preference, whether recipient immiserization occurs depends on whether the transfer raises the consumption of the recipient. Second, when the effect of the donor’s (recipient’s) aspirations on his/her marginal utility increases, whether the transfer paradox is more likely to occur depends on the savings propensities in the two countries. We also investigate the dynamic stability condition in the model incorporating aspirations, and show that no additional condition is required when the dynamic stability condition is satisfied in the standard OLG model without aspirations. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the one-sector OLG model, in which each generation of the donor country or recipient country has aspirations based on the consumption level of the preceding generation. Here, we confirm whether the dynamic stability conditions are satisfied in the model with aspirations. Sections 3 and 4 present the main results on the relationship between aspirations and the transfer paradox.

Lobbying activities by organized interest groups serve a double role. On the one hand, such activities attempt to influence decision making in favour of the interest group. On the other hand, they provide useful information to a policy maker regarding the likely consequences of specific public policies. This paper combines both aspects of lobbying to gain some understanding about the extent of regulation in the form of industry protection when regulatory outcomes are uncertain to the policy-maker. There are many instances in which the state of market demand is not perfectly known to the policy-maker. Typically, in the sector of highly-qualified professional services (lawyers, doctors, architects), information about market demand is private to the firms (professionals). Small firms in competitive markets often join together to form associations (like the Chamber of Commerce) to lobby the legislator in order to obtain market protection (usually, through licensure or entry restrictions). Such demands are likely to exert influence on those politicians who are partly concerned with rent extraction (for instance through taxation on extraordinary profits). We consider a policy-maker à la Stigler,Footnote 1 who faces incentives to regulate the market at the expense of consumer welfare. The level of protection that maximizes the policy-maker’s utility depends on market conditions, but these conditions are frequently information private to the industry. The informational setting assumed describes an adverse selection problem, that we analyze in a principal-agent framework.Footnote 2 By organizing as a lobby, the industry gains bargaining power to the extent that it can take the initiative in negotiations over protection (the industry then plays the role of the principal). However, if the industry is unorganized, it is the policy-maker who makes a regulatory proposal. We propose a regulatory framework in which a domestic production quotaFootnote 3 (X) is imposed in exchange for a transfer to the policy-maker \(\left( Z\right) \). This transfer can be thought of as money seized from taxation on the extraordinary profits created by the quota. The strategic interaction between the industry and the politician is described as a two-stage game. In the “organization stage” the industry decides whether to organize or not as a lobby. If the industry group is organized, it bears a fixed cost and lobbies in order to influence the politician’s regulation (the industry pays a cost to play the role of a principal). If the industry group remains unorganized, it does not pay the fixed organization cost, but then it is not allowed to lead the negotiations about the degree of market intervention either. The “regulation stage” comes after the politician knows whether she is dealing with an organized lobby or with an unorganized interest group. At this stage, a regulatory policy pair \( \left( X,Z\right) \) is set up. The whole game is solved by backwards induction. First, we use the tools of contract theory to characterize the equilibrium regulatory policy that takes place at the regulatory stage. Then, assuming that the industry discounts the equilibrium outcome of the regulation stage, we analyze the industry’s decision of organizing or not as a lobby (organization stage). The asymmetric information approach undertaken in this paper allows for a number of insights that relate lobby formation to the degree of market intervention. First, it provides an alternative rationale to the “loser’s paradox” (Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud 2007). The paradox consists in the fact that low demand industries receive relatively higher protection when compared to high demand industries, which are the ones that invest more resources in lobbying activities.Footnote 4 When organization costs are moderate, there exists a separating equilibrium at the organization stage in which an industry organizes as a lobby if market demand is strong, and it remains unorganized when demand is weak. In this separating equilibrium, the lobbying decision of the interest group reveals private information: If the industry lobbies, the policy-maker infers high market demand; if the industry does not lobby, the policy-maker infers low market demand. This equilibrium outcome involves higher degree of protection on industries facing low demand, although the most resources spent on lobbying activities correspond to high demand industries. Second, the model provides a theoretical explanation of the relationship between lobbying costs and lobby formation. If organization costs are low enough or high enough, there exist pooling equilibria at the organization stage in which either both types of industry become organized (costs are low) or neither of them do (costs are high). Comparing the degree of protection at equilibrium for different values of organization costs C yields the result that, if organization costs fall from moderate to low level, then virtually every type of industry organizes as a lobby, and the overall degree of market protection increases. The evidence recorded in Bradford (2000), using the same database as Trefler (1993), bornes out this prediction. Bradford (2000) finds that industries with lower transaction costs receive more protection. In our model, if all types of industries are organized, low demand industries signal their types by including in their policy proposals excessive (distorted) degrees of market protection. Our paper borrows certain elements from the literature on: (1) policy influence, (2) informative lobbying, and (3) lobby formation. Next we briefly review some relevant contributions to the literature in each of these categories and identify the main differences with respect to our approach. Since the pioneering work on pressure groups by Becker (1983), a host of models have attempted to provide a rationale to Becker’s influence function which associates pressure by interest groups to government’s policy choices. A major strand in this category is the approach whereby campaign contributions buy votes. In this vein, the menu-auction model developed in Grossman and Helpman (1994) (GH henceforth) provides a benchmark in which the “contributions for policy favors” scheme explains policy choices when lobbies compete for trade protection. Bennedsen and Feldman (2006), Dahm and Porteiro (2008) and Cotton (2009) among others, analyze the interaction of campaign contribution and information provision as means of influence. In our model, the level of market intervention (X) is attached to a monetary transfer from the industry to the policy-maker (Z). Unlike most of the literature, we do not analyze how Z influences X. Instead, we consider a regulatory policy pair \(\left( X,Z\right) \) as a binding contract. Although not explicitly enforceable, the commitment on fulfilling the terms of the contract may come from a repeated relationship, trust or simply reputation.Footnote 5
 Informative lobbying is based on the existence of uncertainty between policy and its consequences, and relies on the assumption that the lobby is better informed than the policy-maker. When the provision of information affects policy choices in favour of the lobby group there is room for strategic information transmission.Footnote 6 Potters and Van Winden (1992) analyze informational lobbying as a game in which the interest group has some private information and the policy-maker is aware of the strategic incentives of the interest group for truthful revelation. The information transmission problem can also be analyzed from a signaling perspective. In this line, Lohmann (1993, 1995) highlights the informative role of monetary contributions in a signaling model in which competing reports and their accompanying contributions determine policy decisions. Our paper considers the informative power of contracts both in a signaling framework (when the lobby proposes regulatory policy) as in a screening framework (when it is the policy-maker the one who proposes regulation). Most of the literature on lobby formation analyzes the incentives to form a lobby by comparing the benefits of common action with organization costs.Footnote 7 The latter are usually treated as a sunk investment, and the former depend on the specific features assumed in each model. Our approach complements the usual explanation of lobby formation as related to the extent of free riding by firms within the industry.Footnote 8 We adopt a similar view of lobby formation as Mitra (1999), and compare the (exogenous) costs with the benefits of organizing as a lobby. What is distinctive about our approach is that these benefits depend on the different regulations that emerge in equilibrium from the relationship of the industry with the policymaker. For high demand industries, the advantages of enjoying a Stackelberg leader position outweigh the information rents the industry may have obtained if they had accepted the government’s regulatory proposal. The contrary occurs for low demand industries. With fixed costs of lobby formation, our model predicts higher degrees of lobby organization in high demand industries. The present paper is very related in spirit to Magee (2002). This author proposes a model that combines endogenous lobby formation with endogenous trade protection. Magee’s analysis extends the GH framework by allowing for bargaining between lobbies and policymakers. In Magee’s paper, the amount of campaign contributions in exchange for protection is determined as the outcome of a Nash bargaining process. In order to emphasize the role played by asymmetric information, we consider a simple setting in which all bargaining power corresponds to the principal (i.e., the industry if organized, or the policy-maker otherwise). It is worth mentioning, though, that the distribution of bargaining power in our model turns out to be irrelevant in the determination of the level of market protection (it only affects the monetary transfer from the industry to the government). The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the model. Section 3 characterizes the optimal regulatory policy undertaken by the policy-maker when acting as a principal. Section 4 analyzes the optimal regulatory policy proposed by the industry, when organized as a lobby. In both sections the analysis comprises the cases of symmetric and asymmetric information. Section 5 considers the equilibrium outcomes in the previous sections to discuss the industry’s incentives to lobby actively. Finally, Sect. 6 draws the main conclusions of the paper. The proofs of the main results are in the “Appendix”.",2

Nevertheless, many public and semipublic enterprises (i.e., firms owned by both public and private sectors) are still active in planned and market economies in developed, developing, and transitional countries. One classical rationale for public enterprises is to prevent private monopolies in natural monopoly markets when significant economies of scale prevail. Thus, many public enterprises existed or still exist in such national monopoly markets.Footnote 1 However, because of technological improvement, public enterprises are not always monopolists and the markets in which public enterprises exist are not always characterized by significant economies of scale. Indeed, a considerable number of public (including semipublic) enterprises compete with private enterprises in a wide range of industries (mixed oligopolies).Footnote 2 The optimal privatization policies in these mixed oligopolies have attracted extensive attention from economics researchers in such fields as industrial organization, public economics, financial economics, and development economics.Footnote 3
 Owing to recent deregulation and liberalization, entry restrictions in mixed oligopolies have significantly weakened. As a result, private enterprises have newly entered many mixed oligopolies such as the banking, insurance, telecommunications, and transportation industries. The literature on mixed oligopolies has intensively investigated optimal privatization policy in free entry markets. By using a monopolistic competition framework, for example, Anderson et al. (1997) showed that privatization may improve welfare when private competitors are domestic, and Matsumura et al. (2009) showed that privatization is more likely to improve welfare when private enterprises are foreign. Matsumura and Kanda (2005) adopted the partial privatization approach formulated by Matsumura (1998) and showed that the optimal degree of privatization is zero when private competitors are domestic, while Cato and Matsumura (2012) showed that it is strictly positive when they are foreign and that this is increasing in the foreign ownership share in private firms. Fujiwara (2007) showed a non-monotonic relationship between the degree of product differentiation and optimal degree of privatization. Cato and Matsumura (2015) discussed the relationship between optimal trade and privatization policies and showed that a higher tariff rate reduces the optimal degree of privatization as well as that the optimal tariff rate can be negative. Cato and Matsumura (2013a) showed the privatization neutrality theorem originally discussed by White (1996) in a duopoly in a non-free entry market. Fujiwara (2015) showed that in a general equilibrium model, privatization has no effect on welfare and labor income. All these papers assumed that the government chooses its privatization policies before the entries of private enterprises.Footnote 4 This assumption, however, is not always realistic. For example, in the Japanese banking and life insurance industries, entry restrictions have been gradually deregulated since the 1970s. On the contrary, the privatization of public financial institutions has only recently become prominent. For instance, Japan Post, which owns part of Postal Bank, the largest bank in Japan, and Kampo, a large life insurance company, were first privatized in 2015, and the government still holds more than 80% of their shares. Although the government announced its intention to privatize the Development Bank of Japan, its privatization has been repeatedly postponed and the government still holds 100% of its shares. Further, while the government opened up the Japanese telecommunications market in 1985, it continued to sell shares in NTT, a state-owned public monopolist until 1985, from 1986 to 2016. Moreover, the government still holds a more than 30% share in NTT. These examples suggest that the timeline in existing works (i.e., privatization then entry) might not always be plausible.Footnote 5
 Moreover, even when privatization occurs before the entry of private enterprises, the above timeline may still be problematic. As noted above, the Japanese government reduced its ownership of NTT gradually over more than 10 years. Thus, even if the government partially privatizes a firm before opening up the market, it may additionally sell shares in partially privatized enterprises after observing the entries of private enterprises.Footnote 6 In other words, the government may be unable to commit to a privatization policy before such entries, especially when it has an incentive to increase the degree of privatization (to reduce its public ownership share) after private enterprises have incurred their sunk entry costs.Footnote 7
 In this study, we consider a different timeline in free entry mixed oligopolies. We assume that private enterprises first choose whether to enter the market and then the government chooses the degree of privatization in the public enterprise. We show that under fairly general demand and cost conditions, the equilibrium degree of privatization is too high (low) from the viewpoint of welfare when private enterprises are domestic (foreign). We also show that under linear demand and quadratic costs, there exists a threshold of the foreign ownership share in private firms \(\bar{\theta }\) such that the equilibrium degree of privatization is too high from the viewpoint of welfare if and only if when \(\theta <\bar{\theta }\). These results have an important policy implication. When competitors are domestic (foreign), committing to not increasing (decreasing) the degree of privatization is welfare improving. If it is more difficult for the government to increase its ownership share in the partially privatized enterprise than to decrease it, the government can more easily implement an efficient privatization policy when private enterprises are foreign. In the literature on mixed oligopolies, it is known that the nationality of private firms is often crucial in shaping mixed oligopolies (see the literature starting with Corneo and Jeanne 1994; Fjell and Pal 1996).Footnote 8 Because the public firm is concerned with domestic welfare, the public firm does not care about the profit of private firms when they are foreign. This makes the nationality of the private firms matter in mixed oligopolies. In our framework, the nationality of the private firms affects the result. Given the number of firms, the optimal degree of privatization is lower as the foreign ownership share in the private firms is larger because a smaller degree of privatization reduces the outflow of the surplus to foreign investors (Lin and Matsumura 2012). In the free entry market, however, this reduces the number of entering firms, which is harmful for domestic welfare. Therefore, committing not to set a too low degree of privatization is important when the private firms are foreign. On the contrary, when the private firms are domestic, the government has an incentive to make the public firm less aggressive to induce production substitution from the public to the private firms. This increases the number of entering firms, which is harmful for domestic welfare because the number of entering firms is excessive for welfare. Therefore, committing not to set a too high degree of privatization is important when the private firms are domestic.",38

Sorge,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Right-skewed and thick-tailed wealth distributions have been documented as one of the most pervasive empirical regularities in economics (e.g. Wolff 1987; Piketty 2003; Klass et al. 2007).Footnote 1 In the wake of the recent financial crisis, the topic of rising wealth (and income) inequality and its intergenerational transmission has considerably gained relevance among academic researchers and practitioners. This in turn has spurred a renewed interest in exploring, both in the data and from a theoretical perspective, the various economic and social forces that contribute to producing large and slowly declining top wealth shares (e.g. Piketty 2014). As surveyed in Benhabib and Bisin (2016), a large variety of models have been proposed in the literature that provide theoretical support to the emergence and persistence of thick-tailed wealth distributions. Early frameworks relied on the skewness for the labor earnings process which is then passed on the wealth distribution (e.g. Frechet 1939) or rather on the aggregation of individual wealth processes in the presence of random volatility in reaction to changes in rates of return and/or labor income (e.g. Champernowne 1953). Since these studies are very mechanical in nature and lack explicit micro-foundations, recent contributions have rather attempted to rationalize the aggregate behavior of wealth as the endogenous outcome of market interactions among rationally optimizing agents. In this context, the interplay of preferences (e.g. bequest motive), financial markets operation and demographic dynamics has been shown to produce accumulation patterns consistent with thick upper tails in wealth (e.g. Castaneda et al. 2003). As a prominent example, Benhabib et al. (2011) study wealth dynamics in an overlapping generation model with finitely lived agents and intergenerational transmission of wealth, in which both the rate of return on wealth and labor income arise endogenously from households’ savings and bequest optimal decisions. These authors establish that, in the presence of stochastic returns, the upper tail of the stationary wealth distribution is well approximated by a Pareto distribution.Footnote 2
 This paper explores the role of stochastic dominance changes in risk for the tail properties of stationary wealth distributions in random growth models. Proportional random growth is one of the most widely used mechanisms for generating power-law behavior in numerous contexts of economic interest, see e.g. Gabaix (2009). Our contribution to the theory of wealth random growth is twofold. First, we draw a precise distinction between pure changes in risk (generated by e.g. negative shocks to the volatility of financial returns) vis-à-vis shocks to the first moment of the returns probability distribution (generated by e.g. the imposition of a proportional capital income tax), and identify sufficient conditions for signing the impact on the tail index—hence, on the (within-tail) Gini measure of wealth inequality—of either type of risk transformation. In particular, we show that the order of changing risk (first vs. second) is crucial for assessing the qualitative dependence of the right tail of the wealth distribution on policy actions and/or financial shocks which differ in their impact on the basic average return-risk trade-off. Under the mentioned conditions, an order-contingent monotone comparative statics property is shown to hold, according to which first-order stochastic dominance changes in the returns distribution discourage concentration in the top tail of the stationary distribution by lowering capital income risk irrespective of invested wealth, whereas (mean-preserving) second-order ones induce higher inequality as they inflate the dispersion around average returns.Footnote 3 Second, our findings are generic in nature since they hold true across a large set of frameworks, provided wealth dynamics are described by the so-called Kesten process (e.g. Kesten 1973; Goldie 1991). As reviewed in Gabaix (2009) and Benhabib and Bisin (2016), Kesten processes have been frequently used in scholarly work aimed at providing theoretical underpinnings to the empirics of wealth concentration. Bewley economies with capital income risk and borrowing constraints, such as those studied in Benhabib et al. (2015), are a case in point. While clearly inspired by Benhabib et al. (2011), our analysis allows us to shed further light on the dependence of the stationary distribution of wealth on alternative capital income tax treatments, and especially on the economic sensibility of comparative statics predictions about the response of top wealth inequality to various fiscal policies. Ever since Becker and Tomes (1979), many scholars have been interested in the role of taxation for the intergenerational transmission of inequality (e.g. Castaneda et al. 2003; Bossmann et al. 2007; Cagetti and De Nardi 2009). Developed within a partial equilibrium setting, our analysis points to the potentially ambiguous effects on top wealth inequality of introducing or modifying capital income tax treatments in the presence of stochastic returns. Intuitively, alternative tax systems (e.g. proportional vis-à-vis progressive) are associated with different changes in the probability distribution of after-tax returns on wealth, which in turn might trigger dissimilar (model-specific) behavioral reactions of taxpayers as rational decision makers. We illustrate this crucial point in the context of a simple OLG model with capital income risk and bequests, by showing that the introduction of a progressive tax on capital income may induce risk-averse households to offset the adverse effects of taxation on the returns on wealth by increasing intergenerational wealth transfers. By the same token, we also establish that modifying a proportional tax schedule may well fail to affect the average return on wealth, and hence produce second-order effects only. In either case, the distribution of after-tax returns on wealth is not associated with lower (top) wealth inequality. From a methodological point of view, our analysis is closely related to the extensive literature on the economics of income inequality and poverty. Since the seminal contribution by Atkinson (1970), the (ascending) stochastic dominance approach—alongside with alternative measures of (in)equality among the poor—has been prominently used for pairwise comparisons of income distributions.Footnote 4 Roughly speaking, stochastic dominance analyses of income distributions attempt to assess the welfare implications (according to some well-defined evaluation criterion) of the introduction or revision of tax-benefit systems, redistributive policies or other social programs which differ with respect to their efficiency and equity properties, possibly at different percentiles of the underlying distribution (e.g. Atkinson and Bourguignon 1989). Most importantly, studies on income inequality employing stochastic dominance techniques typically draw attention to measures of relative welfare from the bottom of the distribution. As stressed in Alvaredo et al. (2016), empirically grounded explanations for rising income inequality rather require augmenting the evidence on wages and earned income with data on income from capital, particularly at the top of the distribution. Our study is in fact concerned with the effect on the endogenous stationary distribution of wealth of ordered changes in the exogenous distribution for the rate of return on it. This allows us to study the tail properties (e.g. wealth concentration at the top-end) of such distributions as a function of varying capital income risk, as opposed to labor income, and hence assess how the occurrence of capital income taxation—which is levied on realized (financial) returns irrespective of the heterogeneity in taxpayers’ wealth levels (i.e. of the relative position of taxpayers in the initial wealth distribution) – affects the process of wealth accumulation. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out the basic framework of analysis and describes the issue we are interested in. In Sect. 3, we present and discuss our findings about the link between stochastic dominance changes in the probability distribution for wealth’s returns and the tail properties of the stationary wealth distribution. To facilitate interpretation, we illustrate our results in the context of two analytically tractable random growth frameworks with stochastic returns on wealth (Sect. 4). Section 5 offers concluding remarks.",2

Many R&D-based growth models have been constructed to explain economic growth, for example, the seminal works by Romer (1990), Grossman and Helpman (1991), and Aghion and Howitt (1992). As noted by Wong et al. (2005), however, although these studies recognize certain aspects of entrepreneurship by describing the innovation process, most fail to explicitly account for the role of entrepreneurs who set up businesses and are key contributors to innovation. In most cases, entrepreneurs do not assume other jobs because of the increased effort and possible divided attention affecting their entrepreneurial activities. Thus, entrepreneurs can be considered to emerge from an occupational choice between becoming an entrepreneur or a worker. By explicitly focusing on entrepreneurship, this study argues that even a policy intended to encourage innovation does not always promote economic growth and, thus, can negatively affect growth. To account for the role of entrepreneurs, I construct an overlapping-generations model in which each individual chooses their own occupation (i.e., entrepreneur or worker) and the engine of economic growth is entrepreneurial innovation. In this model, a government issues R&D subsidies to entrepreneurs expected to encourage innovation and promote economic growth. In reality, R&D subsidies encourage related activities and increase labor demand for investment in R&D activities. This, however, raises workers’ wages, making the role of worker more attractive and reducing the number of entrepreneurs. Thus, for entrepreneurial innovation and occupational choice, R&D subsidies can have a negative as well as a positive effect on economic growth. These opposing effects result in an inverted U-shaped relationship between subsidies and growth and a growth-maximizing R&D subsidy rate. A significantly high R&D subsidy rate can be detrimental to economic growth. I also perform a welfare analysis and show that the growth-maximizing R&D subsidy rate is higher than the rate maximizing welfare. Additionally, when individuals are heterogeneous in their abilities, R&D subsidies decrease intra-generational inequalities. Lastly, I conduct a numerical exercise and numerically show the growth-maximizing and welfare-maximizing R&D subsidy rates. The growth-maximizing subsidy rate is nearly 3.5 times higher than the US R&D subsidy rate in 1995 reported by Impullitti (2010), whereas the welfare-maximizing subsidy rate is close to that of the US when the social discount factor is moderate. Moreover, the welfare-maximizing R&D subsidy rate shows the close value to the optimal R&D subsidy rate calibrated by Şener (2008). Several studies in the literature have constructed models that include an occupational choice in dynamic settings.Footnote 1 This study is particularly related to Keuschnigg (2004), García-Peñalosa and Wen (2008), and Jaimovich and Rebelo (2012), which construct models including innovations by entrepreneurs (or innovators) as well as occupational choice. Keuschnigg (2004) investigates how venture capitalists, who finance and advise entrepreneurs, boost economic growth. García-Peñalosa and Wen (2008) shows that redistributive taxation increases the economic growth rate because it provides insurance to entrepreneurs and encourages more agents to engage in risky entrepreneurial activities. In these two studies, innovation takes the form of the “quality ladder,” as in Aghion and Howitt (1992). On the other hand, assuming innovation to be a form of “variety expansion,” which is in line with Romer (1990), Jaimovich and Rebelo (2012) investigates the effects of disincentives on investments such as tax and shows that the effects of disincentives on growth are highly non-linear; that is, small disincentives allow the exclusion of less productive entrepreneurs, whereas large disincentives force more productive ones to exit. In these studies, innovation is one dimension (vertical or horizontal), and input for R&D activities are entrepreneurs (or innovators) and their effort. That is, entrepreneurs (or innovators) do not use resources other than themselves in R&D activities; thus, the higher the number of entrepreneurs (or innovators), the faster the economic growth. By contrast, this study assumes “in-house R&D” in line with Peretto (1996, 1999, 2007) and Young (1998), that is, innovation is two dimensions. One entrepreneur produces one variety of good, and the number of goods (horizontal dimension) is determined by the number of entrepreneurs as in the previous studies. In addition, entrepreneurs invest labor in R&D activities to improve their own productivity (vertical dimensions). Therefore, entrepreneurs invest in themselves and resources other than themselves, such as labor, for R&D activities. Then, economic growth is determined by the number of entrepreneurs and investments in each entrepreneur’s R&D activities. For in-house R&D with occupational choice, this study is related to Grossmann (2007, 2009). The former constructs an in-house R&D model that incorporates occupational choice among unskilled workers, skilled workers for production, and skilled workers for R&D activities. In Grossmann (2007), while public educational expenditures for R&D skilled workers unambiguously promote economic growth and are neutral on intra-generational income inequalities, R&D subsidies have ambiguous effects on growth and raise inequalities. Therefore, public educational expenditures are desirable, and a social optimal R&D subsidy rate can be zero under plausible parameter configurations. A major difference between the mechanism of Grossmann (2007) and the mechanism of this study is a main cause of the negative effects of R&D subsidies on economic growth, which is a congestion effect on public education in Grossmann (2007). The present study is more in line with Grossmann (2009) because it presents an endogenous growth model with occupational choice and entrepreneurial in-house R&D. By constructing such a model, Grossmann (2009) provides an endogenous growth model without scale effects, that is, economic growth rate and welfare can depend on policy but do not depend on population size. In Grossmann (2009), all individuals live for two periods. In the first period, all individuals become workers and, in the second, they quit their jobs and become entrepreneurs or retire. Thus, individuals do not face an occupational choice between a role as an entrepreneur and a worker. By contrast, I assume that individuals choose between becoming an entrepreneur and a worker and that the two occupations are incompatible. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the basic model in which all individuals in a generation are homogeneous in their abilities. Section 3 solves for the equilibrium and investigates the effects of R&D subsidies on economic growth and the welfare of each generation. Section 4 extends the model to include the heterogeneity of individuals’ abilities and shows that such an extension does not alter the main results.

In the battle for survival, incumbent firms focus on reducing production costs through investment in incremental innovations that refine their production technologies. In contrast, firms entering the market invest in breakthrough innovations that allow them to displace vintage product lines with new products of higher quality, leading to a process of creative destruction from which product cycles may emerge. In this paper, we investigate how competition between investment in breakthrough and incremental innovations determines the existence and length of product cycles. Product cycles are characteristic of many manufacturing industries.Footnote 1 For instance, Grimm (1998) studies the quality-adjusted price patterns of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips for four densities, 4, 16, 64, and 256 kb, over the period from 1974 to 1994, and finds that price trends exhibit a cyclical pattern similar to the stylized pattern reproduced in Fig. 1 following Flamm (1993). The three curves describe quality-adjusted price trends, measured in price per bit, for three memory chip densities, introduced at times I, II, and III. After the introduction of a higher density (quality) chip, price initially falls quickly before flattening out. One potential explanation for these product cycles revolves around a comparison of the incentives for investment in breakthrough and incremental innovation. In this explanation, times I, II, and III reflect the introduction of new product designs that are the result of breakthrough product developments, and the intermittent declining price trends describe the outcome of incremental process innovations that reduce production costs. When combined, these two types of innovation generate product cycles at the industry level, and become key drivers of economic growth. Stylized DRAM price patterns In this paper, investment in breakthrough and incremental innovations potentially generates product cycles with price trends similar to those of Fig. 1. Our framework combines two strands of the endogenous growth literature. First, following Grossman and Helpman (1991), firms within a given industry compete according to Bertrand competition, resulting in a single industry leader supplying a state-of-the-art product with the highest product quality and the lowest cost production technology. Specifically, the industry leader enters the market with a breakthrough innovation that raises the quality of the state-of-the-art product, while adopting the lowest cost production technology, and sets a limit price that is just low enough to force all rival firms out of the market. Second, following Smulders and Klundert (1995) and Peretto (1996), incumbent industry leaders invest in incremental process innovation with the aim of lowering production costs. Although these process innovations increase firm value by raising future profits, technology spillovers to rival firms induce industry leaders to lower limit prices to prevent rival firms from entering the market. Using this framework, we find that long-run patterns of product evolution may be characterized by corner solutions with either quality or productivity growth alone, or by an interior solution with product cycles that feature both quality and productivity growth. In an interior equilibrium, product cycles are characterized by the stochastic interaction between breakthrough quality and incremental process innovation, generating heterogeneous processes of product evolution across industries: some industries experience short product cycles while others exhibit long product cycles. As a result, while average product cycle length is constant and average product price falls at a constant rate in an interior equilibrium, limit price adjustments induced by technology spillovers diminish along the product cycle, creating within industry pricing patterns similar to those illustrated in Fig. 1. Studying investment dynamics around the interior equilibrium, we find that product cycle stability depends on how changes in product cycle length affect the relative returns to breakthrough and incremental innovation. Product cycle length determines the technology gap between industry leaders and rival firms. Thus, a decrease in product cycle length lowers the return to breakthrough innovation, as current profits fall, but raises the return to incremental innovation, as the potential for improving future profits rises. After a fall in product cycle length, adjustments in innovation levels are required to restore equality between the rates of return. In the first case, labor productivity is higher for breakthrough than incremental innovation, and industry leaders raise firm value by reducing investment in process innovation, as the positive effect of reduced labor costs on current profits is greater than the potential benefit of higher future profits. Breakthrough innovation increases and incremental innovation decreases, leading to a further fall in average product cycle length and an unstable interior equilibrium. In the second case, labor productivity is higher for incremental innovation, and the positive effect of higher future profits outweighs the negative effect of lower current profits, inducing industry leaders to increase process innovation and extending product cycle length. Product cycles are therefore stable. Focusing on a stable interior equilibrium, we investigate the effects of R&D subsidies on average product cycle length, economic growth, and welfare. Simple numerical examples show that a subsidy to incremental innovation increases the rate of productivity growth relative to the rate of quality growth, resulting in greater average product cycle length and a higher rate of growth. Longer product cycles imply a larger technology gap between industry leaders and rival firms that allows for a greater price-cost markup and hurts welfare. Overall the growth effect dominates generating a positive welfare effect for subsidies to incremental innovation. Alternatively, a subsidy to breakthrough innovation raises the rate of quality growth relative to productivity growth, causing shorter product cycles, accelerating the growth rate, and improving welfare. Our numerical examples suggest that R&D subsidies are welfare improving. Our paper is closely related to Acemoglu and Cao (2015) who study how the distribution of firm size arises from the incremental innovation of incumbent firms and the radical (or breakthrough) innovation of new market entrants that displace incumbents through creative destruction. The innovation activities of both entrants and incumbents produce drastic quality improvements that lead to constant monopoly prices. Thus, our framework breaks from Acemoglu and Cao (2015) by considering limit prices that decline gradually over the product cycle, as illustrated in Fig. 1. 
Klepper (1996) and Cohen and Klepper (1996) develop dynamic models of product life cycles in which the number of firms in an industry expands, peaks, and then declines before stabilizing.Footnote 2 Incumbent firms invest in quality innovations that increase the unit price consumers are willing to pay and in process innovations that reduce production costs. The share of investment in process innovation increases over the life of the industry, as the returns to process innovation rise and the returns to quality innovation fall, and production scales and market shares expand for the remaining incumbent firms. A key feature of these frameworks is that firms benefit from innovation during the investment period. In contrast, rather than studying the dynamics of market structure over a single product cycle, we focus on how the risk of future market entry affects investment in incremental innovation, within an environment of creative destruction, potentially generating consecutive product cycles. As any R&D-based explanation of product cycles requires at least two types of innovation, our paper also contributes to an expanding endogenous growth literature that considers two types of R&D within a unified framework (Young 1998; Thompson 2001; Peretto and Smulders 2002; Lambertini 2003; Klette and Kortum 2004; Gil 2013; Steinmetz 2015). In particular, Segerstrom (1991), Davidson and Segerstrom (1998) Cheng and Tao (1999), and Palokangas (2008) investigate how the interaction between incentives for investment in quality innovation and quality imitation causes industries to cycle between a monopoly and a duopoly, both of which set constant prices. These frameworks do not generate product cycles with gradually declining prices. Cheng and Dinopoulos (1996) examine the relationship between product cycle length and long-run growth in a model of R&D races with breakthrough quality innovation and intermittent quality improvements that diminish over the product cycle. Their framework cycles through breakthrough and incremental innovations rather than settling at a steady state. Our paper contributes to the literature with a framework in which breakthrough quality and incremental process innovations potentially generate steady-state product cycles with gradually decreasing prices. The paper proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2 we introduce our model of endogenous growth, and then in Sect. 3 we characterize three equilibrium patterns of product evolution. Section 4 considers the effects of R&D subsidies on product cycle length, economic growth and welfare. The paper concludes in Sect. 5.",10
123.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,17 August 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-017-0562-4,On financial deepening and long-run growth,April 2018,Sergio Salas,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Does the development of financial markets influence long-run growth? This question has been examined at both the theoretical and empirical level; see, among many other contributions, King and Levine (1993), Levine and Zervos (1998), Demirguc-Kunt and Levine (2008), Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990), Rioja and Valev (2004a, b), Kiyotaki and Moore (2005a). In general, the literature has identified theoretical considerations and evidence that financial depth has mixed effects on growth. I contribute to the theoretical discussion by providing a stylized model of heterogenous agents, in which credit, in the form of equity financing, flows among agents who differ in their ability to undertake investment projects. These financial flows face an exogenous impediment, which is interpreted as the degree of financial depth. Financial frictions of this sort have been proposed by Kiyotaki and Moore (2005b, 2012). I depart from their analysis in many respects, but more fundamentally, I allow for spillovers in the production function of the economy, and in the spirit of seminal papers such as Frankel (1962), Romer (1986), I introduce “learning by doing” in a simple fashion by postulating that when firms rent capital and use it in production, they immediately enhance productivity in the economy, an aggregate spillover. The economy may grow forever, and the model provides a closed-form solution for the economy’s long-run growth. I then examine what this simple model suggests with respect to the relationship between the depth of financial markets and long-run growth. To analyze the extent to which financial deepening may influence growth, it is desirable to have heterogeneity that gives rise to credit in equilibrium. In much of the related literature, heterogeneity is introduced by assuming that the probability of finding an investment opportunity is exogenously given; see Kiyotaki and Moore (2012), Nezafat and Slavick (2015), Shi (2015), Jinnai and Guerron-Quintana (2015). I depart from this assumption by endogenizing the decision of whether to undertake investment projects. The feature I introduce is to assume that individuals draw, in each period, an efficiency level or a cost of transforming the consumption good into capital. In certain periods, some agents may be very efficient at transforming the consumption good into capital, while in other periods, they can only do so at a high cost. This idiosyncratic productivity is governed by a given probability distribution. With this feature, the model provides a cutoff value for how efficient an individual needs to be to undertake investment projects. When an individual draws a cost below the cutoff value, he will undertake the project, becoming an investor. Investors may issue equity on the capital they create in the market, but they are exogenously constrained to hold at least some of the new capital as own equity, and this measures the degree of financial depth. Relatively inefficient agents, those whose cost draws are above the threshold, will partially finance investment by purchasing equity issued by investors. The cutoff value mentioned above turns out to be the price of equity. Intuitively, if the cost of a unit of new capital is below the price of equity that can be issued on that unit, then it pays to undertake investment. I demonstrate that the equity price falls when the financial market becomes deeper. In simple terms, financial deepening makes equity less scarce, and thus, its market valuation decreases. With this result in place, it is possible to decompose the effect of deeper financial markets on growth into three components. Two of them have an unambiguously negative effect on growth. The first effect is labeled the wealth effect. Growth is supported by investors, who are relatively efficient in transforming the consumption good into capital. They use available resources to do so. One of their resources is the capital accumulated from previous periods, the value of which declines with the drop in the asset price. This wealth effect produces a decrease in the desired amount of investment, which translates into less growth. The second effect concerns the extensive margin. The lower the asset price is, the larger the fraction of agents who are relatively inefficient in creating capital relative to the cutoff value, and fewer individuals engage in investment. Having fewer investors entails less new capital production, which translates into lower growth. The third effect is related to the intensive margin. Investors in the model face an idiosyncratic downpayment, or effective cost of investment. When creating capital, investors do not bear the entirety of this cost but sell equity on new units of capital created up to the financial constraint of the economy. When this constraint is relaxed, meaning a deeper financial market, the downpayment required tends to decrease, but since the asset price under which equity is issued in the market also decreases, the net effect on the effective cost is ambiguous. If the equilibrium asset price is inelastic with respect to financial market depth, then the downpayment decreases, which boosts investment. Thus the third effect may dominate the other two negative effects and increase growth. Determining how sensitive the equilibrium price of the asset is to greater financial depth and its impact through the three effects mentioned above is key to assessing the net effect on growth. To make progress on this issue, I consider a specific distribution of the cost of investment, the Weibull distribution. It turns out that the shape of the distribution influences the sensitivity of the equilibrium price of equity to financial deepening. I find that the model delivers a non-monotonic relationship between financial deepening and growth. In particular, under certain parameterizations of the Weibull distribution, is possible to find that when departing from low levels of financial depth, financial deepening increases growth at diminishing rates, and eventually, a threshold is reached after which financial deepening decreases growth. The empirical literature on the relationship between financial deepening and growth is vast, while the purely theoretical literature is somewhat limited. Greenwood and Jovanovic (1990) present a model in which financial intermediation and growth are endogenously determined and positively correlated. Morales (2003), using a setup that emphasizes moral hazard, shows that there exists a negative relationship between the financing of innovation and the process of capital accumulation. Another related contribution is Giordani (2015), who develops a matching model in general equilibrium in which financiers and entrepreneurs match to create an innovation, which yields higher growth. Efficiency in the matching process is governed by an aggregate “matching function” that accommodates a thick market externality. In his model, actual financial assets are absent, and real resources flow among agents who match according to the matching function. The author explores what type of policy may induce optimality in that setup. Kiyotaki and Moore (2005a) follow an approach that is similar to the model developed in the present paper. However, there are important differences. First, they do not develop a model of endogenous growth but simply examine the impact of financial deepening on capital accumulation. Furthermore, they do not consider an endogenous determination of investors and lenders, and they find that financial deepening unambiguously increases capital and output. In the empirical literature, the initial studies tend to find a positive relationship between financial deepening and growth, while later studies cast some doubt on this finding. King and Levine (1993) is a seminal empirical contribution. They present cross-country evidence in support of Schumpeter’s view that the financial system can promote economic growth. Rajan and Zingales (1998) show that a more developed financial market positively impacts industrial sectors in need of external finance and hence fosters growth. Rioja and Valev (2004b) show that financial development has a differential effect on the sources of growth in developed and developing economies, and Rioja and Valev (2004a) show that there is a non-monotonic relationship between financial development and growth. Levine (2005) concludes that while there is evidence that financial development matters for growth, this is “subject to ample qualifications and countervailing views”. Ang and McKibbin (2007) even find evidence of “reverse causality” in the case of Malaysia as the country underwent a financial liberalization process. They find that output growth leads to greater financial depth. This view of the causal relationship has also a long tradition initiated by Robinson (1952). In the case of China, Liang and Teng (2006) show that the causality is unidirectional, running from economic growth to financial development. Brezigar Masten et al. (2008) analyze the case of Europe and find significant non-linear effects, with less-developed European countries gaining more from financial development. One important study is Bekaert et al. (2005), who focus on instances of equity market liberalization and find a positive and significant causal effect of financial liberalization on growth. Demirguc-Kunt and Levine (2008) argue that while theoretical models are ambiguous with respect to the relationship between financial development and growth, the empirical literature is more conclusive and asserts that the relationship is positive. Ben Gamra (2009) studies six major emerging East Asian countries and find that the effect of financial liberalization on growth depends on the nature and intensity of such liberalization. Full liberalization of the financial sector is associated with slower growth outcomes, while more moderate partial liberalization is associated with more positive outcomes. Rousseau and Wachtel (2009) show that the sample under consideration is important when assessing the relationship between finance and growth. Examining recent data (post 1990), they find a relatively dampened effect of financial deepening on growth. Beck et al. (2012) show that for a set of developed and developing countries, enterprise credit is associated with economic growth whereas household credit is not. Law and Singh (2014) study 87 developed and developing countries. They find a threshold in the finance-growth relationship; the level of financial development benefits growth only up to a certain threshold, beyond which further financial development tends to adversely affect growth. In the same vein, Arcand et al. (2015) demonstrate that there can be “too much finance”, a given threshold above which finance begins to have a negative effect on output growth. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model, Sect. 3 solves for the model’s economic equilibrium, Sect. 4 analytically examines the effect of financial deepening on growth, Sect. 5 examines the implications of a specific distribution of investment costs, and Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",3

Javier Casado-Izaga,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Empirical evidence shows that residential density varies hugely from one advanced country, city and time to another. In this regard, Kasanko et al. (2006) show that the structure of European cities has become less compact since the 1950s. They also find (p. 122) that in the European cities studied in their paper “the population density differs to a considerable extent”. In their study they find three groups of cities: southern cities, which are very compact in structure and densely populated, northern and eastern cities, which have low densities and discontinuous residential structures, and finally northern and western cities, which are at an intermediate level. The population density is much higher in the cities in Southern Europe than in the north.Footnote 1 In the case of the U.S., sprawl is an important issue and as Brueckner (2001, p. 66) points out: “in response to concerns about sprawl, state and local governments have adopted policies designed to restrict the spatial expansion of cities”.Footnote 2 Lopez and Hynes (2003) examine data from the 2000 census for the U.S. and conclude that sprawl has increased over the past decade in many metropolitan areas.Footnote 3
 There are many factors that affect urban expansion and thus the density of the residential areas of cities. Brueckner (2001) and Johnson (2001) describe several of them: price of housing, housing consumption, improved access to open space, traffic congestion, household incomes, cost of commuting, the amenity value of the space around cities, jobs, taxes and subsidies, effects of federal policies, provision of public goods, impacts of urban sprawl such as increased traffic congestion and air pollution, and reduced regional open space among others. In this paper we consider an additional factor that affects the size of residential areas and that, as far as we know, has not yet been considered by the relevant literature: strategic behavior by firms located in a municipality due to spatial competition between them.Footnote 4
 The location of the competing firms within a municipality depends on the location of consumers, so in this paper we analyze the decision taken by a local authority on the optimal size of the residential area within a municipality. To analyze this issue we consider a spatial location model. A standard assumption in location models since the seminal paper by Hotelling (1929) is that consumers are uniformly distributed along a linear city of a given size. In his model two private firms simultaneously locate within a linear city and then simultaneously decide their uniform prices. Consumers transport their purchase home at a linear transportation cost. This is a problem because there is no price equilibrium when firms are close enough, as pointed out by d’Aspremont et al. (1979). They also show that under quadratic transportation costs there is price equilibrium and firms locate at the city boundaries. Later Lambertini (1994, 1997) and Tabuchi and Thisse (1995) show that under quadratic transportation costs, when firms are free to locate outside the linear city they locate outside the residential area, which is exogenously given. In this paper we focus on a prior decision that a regulator may consider: the possibility of designing a more compact and thus denser residential area within a municipality, which means that firms may locate outside the residential area.Footnote 5 Unlike Lambertini (1994, 1997) and Tabuchi and Thisse (1995), we consider that the size of the residential area (and thus the residential density) is endogenously decided by the local authority. Moreover, they consider that the municipality has no boundaries while we consider that it has a specific size. A denser residential area means that residents are located closer, which causes a negative effect from a social welfare viewpoint (congestion). But a more compact residential area forces competing firms to locate closer to their rivals, so consumers’ transportation costs are reduced, which is positive from a social welfare viewpoint. Thus, to explain a reduction in the size of the residential area we must consider these two effects. In our study the local authority decides the optimal size of the residential area before firms locate in the municipality. For the sake of simplicity, the residential area extends symmetrically from the middle of the municipality. Consumers are distributed uniformly along the residential area and the rest of the municipality is not residential but firms may locate there if they wish to.Footnote 6 The smaller the residential area is, the denser it is. In order to determine the optimal size of the residential area we analyze different market structures. With just one duopoly we consider that both firms may be private, or one private and the other public (i.e. a mixed duopoly). With two duopolies that produce goods which are independent in demand, we analyze the cases where both duopolies are private, both are mixed, and one is private and the other mixed. We find that the optimal size of the residential area depends on the ownership of the firms that compete in the market. Most of the literature that analyzes how to enhance social welfare when it crucially depends on the location of firms has focused on measures that restrict the location of firms to specific areas of the municipality. The literature on zoning has analyzed the optimal policy for restricting firms’ locations in several scenarios such as uniform prices, spatial price discrimination and Cournot competition.Footnote 7 In this paper we do not limit firms’ locations, so they are under no zoning constraints: Only the location of consumers is constrained to a central area of the city, the extent of which is decided by the local authority.Footnote 8
 Henceforth we discuss our results in terms of the ratio between the parameter that measures the size of transportation costs and the parameter that captures the intensity of the negative externality. Under a private duopoly we find that when the ratio between these parameters is low enough the optimal residential area extends over the whole municipality (i.e. it is a flat city) to minimize the impact of the negative externality. When the ratio is high enough the optimal size of the residential area is less than 36.88% of the municipality. Firms’ locations are continuous with respect to the size of the residential area and independent with respect to the ratio between transportation costs and the negative externality. However, the optimal size of the residential area is discontinuous with respect to this ratio.Footnote 9 This is because when the residential area is greater than 2/3 of the size of the municipality the location of the two competing firms is always the same: they both locate at the boundaries of the municipality. Thus, a reduction in the size of the residential area—when it is great enough—only increases consumers’ transportation costs and congestion, both of which are bad from a social welfare viewpoint. This excludes residential areas with a size between 2/3 and the full size of the municipality as optimal. Further reductions in the size of the residential area may improve welfare as firms locate closer to consumers, which is a positive effect that may counteract the negative effect that arises from more congestion. Thus, when the ratio between transportation costs and the negative externality is high enough a more compact residential area may be of interest from a welfare viewpoint. In that case, the higher the ratio is the more compact and dense the residential area is. By comparing the two local maxima we find that only compact residential areas with sizes lower than 36.88% of the municipality can become optimal.Footnote 10
 An analysis of a mixed duopoly reveals that when the ratio is low the optimal residential area extends over the whole municipality. In this setting firms always adopt social welfare-maximizing locations so a reduction in the size of the residential area increases residential density and reduces transportation costs. The transition from a flat city to compact cities is continuous as the ratio increases. A comparison of private and mixed duopolies shows that total transportation costs are lower in the latter because firms adopt social maximizing locations, which is not the case in the former. Thus, a less compact residential area might be expected under a mixed duopoly, but this is only the case when the ratio between transportation costs and the negative externality is very high. For intermediate values of the ratio, a flat city is optimal under a private duopoly and a compact one under a mixed duopoly.Footnote 11
 We also analyze the case of two duopolies that sell two goods that are independent in demand. In this setting each consumer buys one unit of each good and the two goods are transported separately. There are therefore four firms and three different market structures can be compared: two private duopolies, two mixed duopolies, and one private and one mixed duopoly. Because goods are independent in demand and their transportation costs are assumed to be identical for the sake of simplicity, the optimal locations of the firms are independent of how many duopolies there may be. In this setting a new surprising result arises for intermediate values of the ratio between transportation costs and the negative externality: with one private duopoly and one mixed duopoly the optimal size of the residential area may be the whole municipality, but it is more compact with two private duopolies or with two mixed duopolies. Thus, the optimal size of the residential area crucially depends on whether firms are privately or publicly-owned and on the number of duopolies. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Sections 3 and 4 seek to determine the optimal size of the residential area with a private duopoly and a mixed duopoly, respectively. Section 5 compares the results. Section 6 extends the model to analyze two duopolies that may both be private, both mixed or one private and one mixed, and Sect. 7 draws conclusions.",6

As a rule, when new products of higher quality enter the market, they do not immediately replace all older ones. Therefore, at any point in time, product variants of different quality and vintage coexist and only the products with the worst price-performance ratio exit the market. However, higher quality is not the only difference between new and old products. A second distinctive feature of new products is their novelty. Most consumers would still differentiate between new and old products, even if they were of the same quality. For example, products that have been introduced long ago, may be considered as no longer up-to-date or simply “boring”. Consumers may fear that buying these products will make them seem dull individuals to others, whereas consumers buying a newly introduced product may expect to be regarded as modern and interesting. Other consumers, however, may dislike to appear as “trendy shoppers”. They continue to buy the time-tested products as long as they are available. Alternatively, all consumers may appreciate novelty, but may differ with respect to their switching costs (e.g., exit fees, search costs, learning costs, emotional costs). For consumers with high switching costs, the extra benefits of the novel products may not be sufficient to overcompensate the associated switching costs. Therefore, they would tend to buy the familiar, old products. Consumers with low switching costs may prefer to buy a novel product even if the familiar product is still available. Similarly, novelty may appeal to all consumers, but they may doubt the quality and ease of use of these products. Consumers with sufficiently large doubts or high risk aversion may prefer the established products, whereas consumers with little doubts or low risk aversion may purchase the new products. In summary, whereas a higher quality of a new product always benefits consumers, the product’s newness benefits some consumers, but not others, and for some, it is even a drawback. Therefore, the analysis of markets characterized by continuous technical improvements should account for both quality and novelty. In the industrial organization literature, competition between products of different quality is generally modeled as vertical product differentiation, whereas differentiated consumer tastes are commonly captured by horizontal product differentiation in the tradition of Hotelling’s (1929) spatial model. This suggests that markets characterized by technical progress should be studied by means of models that combine horizontal differentiation (capturing different preferences for novelty) with vertical differentiation (capturing product quality differences). In the present paper, we specify a simple Vertically Extended Hotelling (VEH) model. It combines horizontal and vertical product differentiation and can easily be embedded into a dynamic context. Our VEH model is a duopoly model in which the consumers can choose either an incumbent product or an entrant product. The incumbent product is an established commodity of basic quality and zero novelty that competes against the entirely novel entrant product. By definition, the basic quality of the incumbent product is given. However, the seller of the entrant product can choose a quality that differs from the basic quality of the incumbent product. The cost of the entrant product increases with its quality level. In our VEH model, the duopolists compete on price and quality. Quality can be interpreted in a broad sense. It captures all product features that influence the consumers’ willingness to purchase the product (e.g, usefulness, design, emotional benefit, etc.). All consumers appreciate the difference in quality (the vertical characteristic) in the same way. However, the consumers differ in their preferences for novelty (the horizontal characteristic). Hotelling’s original spatial model is a price competition model. Therefore, almost all studies utilize the Nash equilibrium concept, and our VEH model is no exception. However, price competition between an incumbent and an entrant product is not necessarily symmetric. For instance, the seller of the incumbent product might be restricted in his price setting by past contracts. We capture this asymmetry by a Stackelberg price game in which the incumbent is the involuntary Stackelberg leader and competes against the seller of the entrant product (the Stackelberg follower). For completeness, we also consider the reverse situation. Different equilibrium concepts (Nash or Stackelberg) may lead to different pricing strategies. Generally, two opposing pricing strategies appear sensible. When consumers appreciate the novelty of new products, firms should introduce new products into the market at prices above those of the older products of comparable quality, and during the later stages of the product’s life cycle, price it below newer products of comparable quality. In the marketing literature, this strategy is often referred to as skimming (e.g., Noble and Gruca 1999). However, if consumers hesitate to switch to new products, the sellers of these products can counter such initial scepticism by an aggressive pricing policy during the early stages of the product life cycle. Once a sufficiently large customer base has been established, in the later stages of the product life cycle, the price is set above those of newly entering rival products of comparable quality. In line with the marketing literature, we denote this strategy as penetration. We investigate whether in the VEH model the firms decide for skimming or penetration, and whether this decision depends on the underlying equilibrium concept (Nash or Stackelberg). However, markets characterized by frequent product turnover and technical progress, are dynamic in nature, whereas our VEH model is static. Therefore, we extend the VEH model to a dynamic context. For this purpose, we assume that the duopoly game is played repeatedly with today’s entrant product being the incumbent product of the next period, while today’s incumbent product leaves the market and is replaced by a new entrant product. This generates an infinite-horizon model with overlapping products (firms), in the same manner as common overlapping generation models. We refer to this as the  Hotelling model of OverLapping Innovators (HOLI model). It is complex enough to account for the key aspects of markets with product turnover and technical progress. At the same time, it is sufficiently simple to generate, for each of the three scenarios that we consider (the Nash scenario and the two Stackelberg scenarios), a unique equilibrium path. The HOLI model is a dynamic, but analytically tractable model that captures the nexus between quality and novelty in markets characterized by technical progress and product turnover. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first model to merge horizontal and vertical product differentiation into a dynamic framework. Since the HOLI model is a sequence of static VEH models, the literature most closely related to our approach is that which explores static models combining horizontal and vertical product differentiation. However, in this body of literature, the nexus between novelty and quality is never considered and few can be classified as VEH models. To capture the nexus between novelty and quality it is tempting to re-interpret quality as a second horizontal characteristic and to utilize a two-dimensional extension of Hotelling’s spatial model. In fact, this two-dimensional spatial model was proposed by Launhardt (1885) almost 50 years before Hotelling’s (1929) famous article. A multiple-dimension extension can be found in Irmen and Thisse (1998). However, the re-interpretation of quality as a second horizontal characteristic is inappropriate. Suppose that consumers have to choose between two equally novel products offered at the same price. If quality were a horizontal characteristic, some consumers would prefer the low-quality product. However, this would contradict the very meaning of quality. Therefore, quality has to be captured by vertical product differentiation. Building upon Launhardt’s (1885) work, Dos Santos Ferreira and Thisse (1996) extend the Hotelling spatial model not by quality differences, but by differences in product versatility. Therefore, it would be misleading to classify their model as a VEH one. The first attempt to combine horizontal and vertical product differentiation can be found in Ireland (1987), although he does not use Hotelling’s spatial model. The first VEH model is proposed by Neven and Thisse (1990). In their duopoly model, consumers are differentiated with respect to both the horizontal characteristic and quality valuation. The two competing firms decide on the horizontal characteristic, the vertical characteristic, and the price of their respective products. However, the firms are restricted in their quality choice to some specific interval, and the level of quality does not affect the firm’s cost. The analysis is confined to the Nash equilibrium concept and no interior equilibria can be found in this VEH model. Bergemann and Välimäki (1997) introduce a VEH model similar to our basic framework. However, in their study the quality of the novel product is exogenously given and uncertain to the buyers, the incumbent and the entrant. The uncertainty can be resolved only through purchases of the novel product. In view of the sparse body of literature, Lambertini (2006) concludes that horizontal and vertical product differentiation are usually studied in isolation. However, since 2006, several studies have been published that combine horizontal and vertical product differentiation. Deltas and Zacharias (2006) consider the sub-game perfect Nash equilibrium of a two-period game in which every consumer buys one unit of a durable product, but must choose between period 1 in which only the low quality product is available, and period 2 in which there is a choice between the old low-quality product and a new better-quality one. The subgame of the second period resembles our VEH model, although the customer base is truncated to those consumers who abstained from purchasing during the first period. Furthermore, the quality differential is exogenous. Some important studies are concerned with the link between imperfect competition and incomplete information about product quality; e.g., Daughety and Reinganum (2007, 2008), Gabszewicz and Resende (2012). However, the underlying models cannot be classified as VEH models. A notable exception is Levin et al. (2009), who propose a VEH model that is similar to ours. However, in their model, quality is an exogenous random variable and the firms can decide whether they want to disclose the quality of their respective product. Our HOLI model can be interpreted as a repeated duopoly game. None of the models listed in this literature review can be viewed as a repeated game. Furthermore, they are not concerned with the product characteristic of novelty and they exclusively utilize the Nash equilibrium concept. This is the standard equilibrium concept applied in the context of Hotelling’s spatial model. One notable exception to this rule is Anderson (1987), who applies the Stackelberg equilibrium concept to Hotelling’s original spatial model and shows that Stackelberg equilibria may exist where Nash equilibria do not. We content ourselves with the analysis of price competition, even though studies exist that combine Hotelling’s spatial model with quantity competition (e.g., Hamilton et al. 1994). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the VEH model. In Sect. 3, we derive the subgame-perfect equilibrium for the Nash scenario and the two Stackelberg scenarios. Section 4 introduces the HOLI model and Sect. 5 concludes.",

Generally, to obtain better outcomes in bargaining, agents should have better outside options (threat points) and stronger bargaining power. In vertical relations, for example, the common belief is that upstream firms act as the sole input suppliers toward the downstream firms and they exploit their monopoly power to raise input price, which unambiguously reduces downstream firms’ profits. However, we show that there are situations under which the widely accepted view that downstream firms’ profits are decreasing with the bargaining power of upstream firms does not hold.Footnote 2
 Following recent studies (Aghadadashli et al. 2016; Gaudin 2016, 2017), we apply the Nash bargaining approach to bargaining between downstream firms and upstream agents. Our model can be applied to the relationships between downstream firms and input suppliers, labor unions, or governments. In fact, Nash bargaining is employed in labor economics (e.g., Dowrick 1989; Koskela and Schob 1999; Haucap and Wey 2004; Lopez and Naylor 2004). Empirically, there has been a significant interest on the bargaining power of the agents (e.g., suppliers or labor unions) and its effects on downstream firms’ profitability (Hirsch 2004; Farmakis-Gamboni and Prentice 2011) over time.Footnote 3 Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to re-examine these questions when firms are inherently asymmetric. We first consider a vertically related industry consisting of one upstream and two downstream firms, with the latter having different technology in terms of marginal costs. Each upstream-downstream pair bargains over a linear wholesale price, and, subsequently, the downstream firms engage in Cournot competition.Footnote 4 We apply the generalized Nash bargaining approach. In this setting, we find that the inefficient downstream firm may benefit from an increase in the bargaining power of the upstream firm, while the efficient one unambiguously loses. We also consider the cases where the upstream market consists of two exclusive suppliers or where downstream firms compete in price, and obtain similar results. In our model, an increase in the bargaining power of upstream firms has two effects. The first one is the input price effect: an increase in the bargaining power of upstream firms raises both wholesale prices. This clearly harms both downstream firms. However, an increase in the bargaining power can have another effect, the anti-selection effect. When the upstream firms have no bargaining power, the efficient downstream firm can fully utilize its cost advantage in downstream competition. When the downstream firms have different efficiencies, the upstream firms with positive bargaining power charge different wholesale prices—the efficient downstream firm’s wholesale price becomes higher than that of the inefficient one. Moreover, an increase in the bargaining power of the upstream firms raises the wholesale prices for the efficient downstream firm more than for the inefficient one. Thus, an increase in the bargaining power reduces the difference of ex post efficiency between the downstream firms. This can benefit the inefficient downstream firm, whereas it always harms the efficient one. It is essential for our results that the firms bargain over a linear wholesale price. One may think that if possible, upstream firms prefer employing two-part tariff contract to linear contrast. However, Milliou and Petrakis (2007) consider an endogenous choice of these contract types and show that an upstream monopolist chooses to trade through linear wholesale price contracts with both downstream firms when the bargaining power of upstream firm is not too large. This is consistent with the condition for Proposition 1. Although the argument cannot be applied when the upstream market consists of two exclusive suppliers, it is easy to justify when we regard upstream agents as labor unions. Additionally, linear contracts as well as two-part contracts are often observed in numerous markets. Therefore, both theoretically and empirically, many researchers employ linear contracts (e.g, Iozzi and Valletti 2014), and estimate models with bargaining over linear contracts (e.g., Draganska et al. 2010; Crawford and Yurukoglu 2012; Ho and Lee 2015) because these provide a good approximation of reality. For example, Grennan (2013) observes that price contracts for medical devices between manufacturers and hospitals are typically of the linear form.Footnote 5
 It is important for our results that upstream agents can use a discriminatory price. This assumption is natural when upstream market consists of exclusive suppliers. When upstream market consists of a single agent, whether an upstream agent can use a discriminatory price or not depends on institutional reasons, preventing an upstream agent from charging discriminatory input prices. The assumption of discriminatory pricing is employed in Horn and Wolinsky (1988b), Symeonidis (2010), while Mukherjee and Wang (2013) employ uniform pricing. The three implications of the results are presented below, which might be empirically testable. First, our results relate to the vast literature on unions’ effect on firm performance. In the context of labor economics, there has been extensive research on this effect, but the net effect of unionization on firm performance remains unclear. On the one hand, unions can raise productivity of unionized firms or sectors (Freeman and Medoff 1984). On the other hand, some papers argue that unionization can hurt firms by increasing payments and/or imposing restrictive work rules that depress productivity (e.g., Grout 1984; Van der Ploeg 1987. Many empirical studies examine the predictions of economic theory, namely profits are decreasing with union relative bargaining strength (e.g., Machin 1991). Our results show that conventional wisdom does not always hold true when firms are asymmetric in terms of efficiency. Thus, this result might provide important implications for empirical research. The second implication is as follows. An important property of the Nash bargaining solution is that it can be implemented as the outcome of a dynamic non-cooperative alternating-offers bargaining game (Rubinstein 1982; Binmore et al. 1986). It is known that Rubinstein’s (1982) model has a broader interpretation of a measure of bargaining power. For example, it has been shown that the discount factors of player i, \(\delta _i\), in Rubinstein’s model are theoretically equivalent to the bargaining power in the generalized Nash bargaining solution. It has also been shown that bargaining power can be interpreted as risk aversion. More precisely, as Binmore et al. (1986) note, in the Rubinstein’s bargaining model with a risk of exogenous breakdown of negotiations, we can interpret a belief concerning the likelihood of a breakdown as a bargaining power. Therefore, the higher the downstream firms estimate of the probability of breakdown, the higher the upstream firms’ bargaining power becomes. This implies that a change of market environment that affects the downstream firms’ estimation of the probability of breakdown might have different impacts on their profits. Third, our results imply that there might be some market environments where the existence of strong upstream agents causes some inefficient firms to survive (i.e., they earns positive profits) due to the anti-selection effect. Since the anti-selection effect generated by the upstream agents’ power might protect some inefficient firms, this might delay firm turnovers of the industry. This result relates to Mukherjee and Wang (2013), which show that the presence of a labor union increases efficient firm’s incentive for entry compared to the situation with no labor union. However, theirs and this paper give different implications, which can present an empirical question. Several papers analyze theoretically the relationship between the bargaining power of downstream firms and their profits. In economics, Chen (2003) considers a dominant firm-competitive fringe model with one upstream supplier, and they bargaining over a two-part contract. He finds that the profit of the dominant retailer may decrease with its bargaining power, because an increase in the countervailing power of the dominant retailer significantly reduces the wholesale price of the fringe retailers, which, in turn, decreases the residual demand of the dominant retailer.Footnote 6
 
Mukherjee and Wang (2013) consider a unionized duopoly model where one firm requires one worker to produce one unit of the good while the other requires less workers. They find that the presence of a labor union may increase the efficient firm’s profitability compared to the situation with no labor union. Han and Mukherjee (2017) also consider a similar unionized oligopoly with complementary workers, and show that although cooperation among the unions reduces wages, it may make one of the downstream firms with a small labor coefficient worse off.Footnote 7 In contrast, the effect of wage is different because downstream firms have different technological coefficients in terms of labor. Basak et al. (2016) find that a higher union bargaining power may increase firm profit in a Cournot oligopoly model with decreasing returns to scale technology. Both assume that the labor union charges a uniform wage to each firm (e.g., they consider a situation of collective bargaining), whereas we employ a decentralized bargaining model.Footnote 8
 The novelty of our work lies in the assumption of firm asymmetry in terms of efficiency. The implications of firm asymmetry are discussed extensively in the industrial organization literature, yet the bargaining literature did not pay much attention to this aspect. Since our assumption of cost asymmetry plays a pivotal role, our result also relates to Zanchettin (2006), which shows that when product substitution increases, an efficient firm can increase its profit while an inefficient one unambiguously loses. This is because, on one hand, a reduction of product differentiation reduces the firm’s profits since total demand decreases directly. However, the selection effect allows the efficient firm to exert a strong impact on the inefficient rival’s market share, which is a benefit for the efficient one. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 contain our core results: when the upstream market consists of exclusive suppliers or a monopolistic supplier, an inefficient downstream firm may benefit from an increase in the bargaining power of upstream firms. Section 4 considers price competition in the downstream market. Section 5 discusses our assumptions. Finally, Sect. 6 presents the concluding remarks. All proofs are shown in the “Appendix”.",7
124.0,2.0,Journal of Economics,19 September 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-017-0573-1,Partial privatization in an exhaustible resource industry,June 2018,Alla Fridman,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In many industries, private firms compete with the firms fully or partially owned by the state. This form of strategic interaction known as mixed oligopoly was introduced by Merrill and Schneider (1966) and was studied extensively during the last decades, inspired by the seemingly counterintuitive result of De Fraja and Delbono (1989), who suggest that social welfare might increase if a public firm that is engaged in Cournot-type competition with private firms is privatized. This result is explained by the inefficient allocation of output between the private and public firms that arises endogenously: under increasing marginal costs, a welfare maximizing public firm produces more than a private firm, which results in higher marginal costs. Thus, the loss from cost inefficiency of the public firm may dominate the benefit from the increased output if the number of private firms is large enough so that the output gap is small. The mixed oligopoly theory was further developed by Matsumura (1998) who admitted the phenomenon of joint ownership and demonstrated that neither full nationalization of one of the firms nor full privatization is socially desirable in simultaneous quantity-setting game with fixed number of firms which might explain the existence of partially privatized firms. Later on the mixed oligopoly theory was developed in multiple directions.Footnote 1 It was demonstrated that the optimal degree of privatization is affected by product differentiation (Fujiwara 2007), presence of foreign competitors (Wang and Chen 2011) and participation of foreign investors in privatization (Lin and Matsumura 2012), environmental damage (Kato 2013), market competitiveness (Matsumura and Okamura 2015) and possibility of free entry (Matsumura and Kanda 2005), quality investment (Ishibashi and Kaneko 2008; Lutz and Pezzino 2014) and endogenous efficiency improvement of the privatized public firm (Chen 2017). In case of homogenous product industry with fixed number of firms, the partial privatization result, as it was demonstrated by Matsumura (1998), is due to the trade-off between the efficiency loss from marginal cost gap that arises under reduced degree of privatization and the efficiency gain from the output expansion by the public firm. The basic mechanism involved deals with the incentive of the public firm to produce more if the degree of privatization is reduced as it increases the weight put on consumers’ surplus in the objective function of this firm. This mechanism cannot take place in the case of finite resource stock that is observed in exhaustible resource industries as the total extraction for each firm is restricted by the available resource deposits. Extractive industries in many countries are not fully privatized and the state share in those industries is rather high in both developed and developing economies (World Bank 2011). We can find examples of partially privatized firms in different sectors of extractive industries, like oil (Statoil in Norwey, Petrobras in Brazil, Rosneft in Russia), gas (Gazprom in Russia), minerals (Debswane in Botswane, ZCCM-IH in Zambia). If the standard explanation for partial privatization is not directly applicable to the extractive industries as the total output of any firm, including the state-owned one, is limited by the existing resource stock and thus the public firm cannot expand its total output in response to a reduction in privatization degree, how then can we explain the phenomenon of partial privatization? In this paper we argue that the mechanism in case of exhaustible resources is based on the interplay of intertemporal and intratemporal resource allocation. Although total extraction is fixed by the firms’ reserves, the firm with some state share proposes better allocation of this fixed stock over time. Strategic competition in exhaustible resource industry was studied intensively starting with the dominant firm model proposed by Salant (1976) and a dynamic version of Stackelberg model considered by Gilbert (1978). Later Lewis and Schmalensee (1980) and Loury (1986) analyzed the intertemporal version of Cournot-type model and demonstrated that if the price elasticity is diminishing in output, then extraction path is socially inefficient for the cases of symmetric and asymmetric costs. The model of strategic competition was successfully tested for the oil industry for different time periods (Polasky 1992; Pickering 2008). Further developments deal with strategic resource exploration (Hartwick and Sadorsky 1990; Boyce and Vojtassak 2008), and analysis of alternative equilibrium concepts (Eswaran and Lewis 1985; Benchekroun and Gaudet 2003). In all these papers, all firms are assumed to be private and thus the mixed oligopoly in extractive industries has not been studied; at the same time the results on privatization cannot be automatically extended to extraction industries due to the presence of stock constraints that make the total output substitution between public and private firm impossible. Nevertheless, in this paper we will show that partial privatization is still optimal for the exhaustible resource industry under identical cost functions and equal stocks. This happens because under competition private firms may allocate their stocks inefficiently between the periods and the semi-public firm will try to reallocate its own stock in order to correct this distortion. But full nationalization isn’t optimal either as with increasing marginal costs and highly asymmetric extraction by public and private firms the total costs of extraction will increase and the social loss from the cost increase isn’t balanced by the gain from better intertemporal allocation of extraction. It will be also shown that, contrary to the static mixed oligopoly model, full nationalization could be optimal if the public firm is less efficient than the private one, which contrasts to Proposition 1 of Matsumura (1998); this might happen even under constant marginal costs. In case of two resource deposits with different constant marginal costs, efficiency requires that the least cost resource is extracted first (in this case the present value of total extraction costs is minimized) but the private duopoly may violate this rule (Lewis and Schmalensee 1980). Under nationalization, the public firm will correct this inefficiency by reallocating its extraction in favour of future period and thus increase the social welfare. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we outline the model and investigate the impact of degree of privatization on the equilibrium extraction paths. In Sect. 3 we analyze the first stage of the game and formulate key results on privatization for the case of symmetric costs and identical resource stocks and Sect. 4 deals with privatization under cost asymmetry. Section 5 concludes the paper.",10

We assume that technology is a linear combination of AK and Cobb–Douglas models, whose parameters (which measure total factor productivity, TFP) are allowed to be stochastic. In fact, all of the risk in the economy is captured by a set of stochastic variables that affect other relevant economic factors, such as TFP, the depreciation rate and volatility of capital, the size and frequency of the jumps in capital, and the representative agent’s subjective discount rate. Here, we are dealing with models that allow for a positive long-run growth of output, and we show this feature by computing the capital accumulation implied by the optimal consumption strategy (that we are able to find in closed form). Since some parameters of the production function (measuring the productivity) are allowed to be stochastic, then the optimal capital accumulation in the long-run could be either enhanced or reduced. The agent’s behaviour may be described by one of two families of preferences: Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) or Hyperbolic Absolute Risk Aversion (HARA). Whereas the subsistence level of consumption is implicitly set at zero under CRRA preferences, it is allowed to take on different values under HARA preferences. Thus, HARA preferences allow for a much wider variety of behavioural descriptions. Additionally, in the case of CRRA, optimal consumption is a linear transformation of capital, while in the case of HARA it is an affine transformation. Consequently, HARA preferences are able to account for so-called autonomous (or exogenous) consumption, which empirical research has found to be significantly different than zero [either positive, as in Weinbaum (2005), Strulik (2010) and Achury et al. (2012), or negative, as in Holt and Laury (2002), Eisenhauer and Ventura (2003) and Levaggi and Menoncin (2013)].Footnote 1
 In both cases, we are able to find quasi-explicit solutions for optimal consumption; in the CRRA case, it can be found in a fully stochastic framework, while in the HARA case it can only be achieved if a given combination of some of the production function’s parameters is deterministic. Furthermore, both the production function and the stochastic differential equation for capital accumulation must behave in consistently unique manners in both settings. Moreover, when autonomous consumption is allowed to be non-zero (under HARA preferences), capital must also have a non-zero, autonomous level. This study is inspired by Wälde (2011), who presents stochastic models that yield closed-form solutions for optimal consumption. Here, we expand his model in three new directions: (i) under CRRA preferences and AK production function, we find a closed form solution for optimal consumption allowing for the presence of any number of stochastic state variables (this allows us to take a wide variety of economic frameworks into account), (ii) under CRRA preferences we can generalize the production function to a Cobb–Douglas type by obtaining a closed form solution at the cost of a restriction on parameters: the relative risk aversion parameter must coincide with the output elasticity of capital [the same assumption made in Feicht and Stummer (2010)], (iii) under HARA preferences, we find a closed form solution for optimal consumption which is an affine transformation of capital; this time we have to impose a restriction both on the subsistence consumption level and on the shape of the production function. In order to obtain the solutions to the stochastic differential equations for both forms of preferences, we rely on the “representation theorem”, which was first proposed by Feynman and Kač and thereafter commonly used in financial economic literature (Cont and Tankov 2004; Øksendal and Sulem 2007). In fact, our optimal consumption solution is written as an expected value that can easily be computed with numerical (Monte Carlo) simulations. The rest of this study is organised as follows: In Sect. 2, we present the CRRA preferences case. The subsections show how we model the stochastic economic environment and the agent’s preferences, as well as how we solve the dynamic optimal consumption problem. Furthermore, we conduct a numerical simulation to compute the optimal level of consumption under a simplified AK framework, where factor productivity (A) follows a mean reverting stochastic process. In Sect. 3, we solve the optimal consumption problem subject to HARA preferences and, in contrast to the previous case, we employ a different production function and stochastic differential equation to describe the dynamic behaviour of capital. We further create two different specifications of this model in order to conduct an empirical estimation with US consumption and GDP data. Our results indicate that consumption may be effectively modelled as an affine function of capital. The last section of this study presents our conclusions.",5

That position has been modified through the following decades both in response to the changes in communist policies and diplomacy, and development within the church itself. The church had adopted different strategies in different countries; these strategies reflected differences in the severity of communist anti-religious policies and the church’s own strength (Chenaux 2009). We focus on the situation in Czechoslovakia where the regime was among the most severe in the oppression of religious groups (Balík and Hanuš 2013), and contrast it with the situation in Poland where the Catholic Church had a much better position than in any other communist country (Davies 2001). The situation of the Catholic Church in Czechoslovakia was particularly uneasy after the Second World War. In Bohemia, secularization had advanced considerably due to the history of religious conflicts (Hussite Wars, Wars of Religion) as well as the political and social development in pre-war Czechoslovakia. Slovakia was dominantly Catholic, and Catholicism was an important part of national identity; however, the Catholic Church had been somewhat discredited because of the involvement of several church officials in the politics of the fascist Slovak state during the war. Thus, conditions were quite favorable for a radical offensive against the church after the communist coup of 1948. The coup of 1948 marked the beginning of a massive anti-religious campaign in Czechoslovakia. The first and most brutal period lasted through the 1950s; it was followed by a relative increase in religious freedom in the 1960s, especially during the period known as the Prague Spring. After the Soviet intervention of 1968, the anti-religious activities had intensified, although they did not reach the extent and brutality of the Stalinist 1950s. The situation was quite different in Poland. Unlike in Bohemia, Polish society had been deeply religious and Catholic; also, unlike in Slovakia, there was little record of collaboration with Nazi occupiers that could be used to discredit the church. On the contrary, the Catholic Church was seen as an important vehicle of national opposition to any occupation, German or Soviet, and any government installed by foreign intervention. Thus, communists had limited opportunities to apply their anti-religious policies. The time scale in Poland roughly corresponds to that of Czechoslovakia. There are four main periods:Footnote 3 The first period of Gomułka’s leadership from 1945 to 1948 was followed by the Stalinist period lasting up to 1956. The Polish thaw (following the Khrushchev thaw in the Soviet Union) restored Gomułka as leader and emancipated Poland from the direct control of Soviet leadership.Footnote 4 The definition of the fourth period preceding the end of communist regime in Poland is more difficult. The end of Gomułka’s second rule is one option (Diskin 2001); perhaps a more important milestone is the rise of the Solidarity movement (1980–81) and the period of General Jaruzelski’s military dictatorship (1981–83, Davies 2001). The election of Karol Wojtyła as Pope John Paul II in 1978 is another breakpoint event and a precursor to Solidarity (Weigel 2003). State regulation and anti-church measures have touched different areas of religious life. To compare the situation in Poland and Czechoslovakia, it is useful to select measures from several categories. First, we compare measures aimed at the church hierarchy, i.e., bishops and priests; second, measures concerning property as the source of church independence; and third, regulations targeted at religious education. In all categories, there are similarities and differences between the Czechoslovak communist regime and the Polish one. In both countries, the regime attacked the Catholic hierarchy. Restrictions ranged from the removal of economic independence to physical imprisonment, torture, and even capital punishment in several cases. The government also interfered with the appointment of church officials. In Poland, some 2000 Catholic activists were imprisoned by 1956, including eight bishops and 900 priests (Weigel 2003). However, after 1956, they were all released and the government stepped back on restricting appointments. Thus, the Polish church could maintain a well-developed hierarchical structure. Between 1945 and 1980, the number of clergy doubled (Nowak 1982). In Czechoslovakia, the anti-church campaign was much harsher. By 1951, all but one of the bishops were deprived of liberty; 18 bishops were imprisoned and another 10 placed under house arrest.Footnote 5 Some of them died of torture in prison. Several hundred priests were imprisoned, some of them sentenced to death or killed in prisons and labor camps. Some 2400 members of religious orders, both men and women, were interned in selected monasteries (operated as labor camps), and their activities were outlawed. The repression lasted into the 1960s. The communist regime persistently refused to approve the nominations of new bishops; thus, the episcopate shrunk significantly during communist rule. Providing religious services without state approval was a criminal act. Unlike in Poland, the number of priests in Czechoslovakia halved between 1948 and 1987 (Balík and Hanuš 2013). Communists in both countries tried to elicit support from the clergy and the Catholic laity. In Poland, collaborating Catholics established the movement Pax and the Patriotic Priests group; both groups aimed to support government anti-church policies and to make communist ideology more acceptable to Polish Catholics. However, neither group was able to command popular support, and their influence in society and among the clergy remained marginal (Diskin 2001). In Czechoslovakia, this role was given first to the Peace Movement of the Catholic Clergy and later, after the Prague Spring, the Association of Catholic Clergy Pacem in Terris. Membership in those organizations was often involuntary; thus, it is difficult to evaluate the extent of actual collaboration with the communist regime. However, the numbers are quite significant; in the 1970s, about a third of Czech and a quarter of Slovak priests were members of Pacem in Terris (Balík and Hanuš 2013). Property represents a source of economic independence. Although the nationalization of property was an integral part of communism, it also served as part of the anti-church campaign. In Poland, landed property was never collectivized to the extent known in other communist countries, and state-run collective farms were only established in western territories acquired from Germany after the Second World War. Landed property of the church was confiscated except for small farm holdings of parish priests not exceeding 50 hectares (Cieplak 1969), which provided a certain degree of economic independence. In Czechoslovakia, all church property was expropriated. The law established a state-paid salary for clergy with state approval; the communists used the threat of its removal as a pressure tool. The control of education was an important element in communist plans to control society. The most important fights between the communists and the church concerned elementary schools, Catholic instruction of children, and the education of clergy. In both countries, church schools were closed or taken over by the government. Polish children could receive religious instruction outside school, and Nowak (1982) reports the existence of “more than 21,000 catechism classes, which are held in churches, parish buildings, and private homes.” In Czechoslovakia, the law allowed religious instruction in public schools only; parents had to apply for classes and risk retaliation from the communists. The proportion of children attending religious instruction in school fell from almost 100 percent in 1950 to less than 10 percent in the early 1980s (Balík and Hanuš 2013). The Polish church was also successful in getting concessions in higher education. The Catholic University of Lublin was the only Catholic university in the Eastern bloc. In 1980, nearly 6,300 seminarians were studying in 46 seminaries in Poland (Nowak 1982). In Czechoslovakia, the government allowed two seminaries under strict control, and the number of seminarians in the 1980s did not exceed 300 (Balík and Hanuš 2013; Vaško 2007). The measures discussed here are just a selection of the wide range of different restrictions used by the communists in their anti-church campaign. Further measures were targeted against religious associations, charities, media and publishing houses, and lay people in different positions. The selected restrictions should suffice to illustrate how different the Polish and the Czechoslovak regimes were in their approach to the regulation of religious markets. The response of the Czechoslovak and the Polish church differed as much as the regulatory policies. In Poland, the Catholic Church emerged as the major vehicle of anti-communist opposition. With few exceptions, the church was unified and it was able to maintain its official operation with modest concessions to the communist regime. The church in Czechoslovakia virtually split into two organizations, although they were not completely separated. The official church sought compromise with the communists, while the underground church strictly followed Catholic doctrine and opposed the regime. The situation of the Polish church allowed a firm position against the communists. Casanova (1994) attributes its strength to the interconnection between Catholicism and Polish nationality. The church had superb organization with a centralized hierarchy and a prominent position of the clergy in society. Another important element was popular devotion, best represented in pubic rituals such as pilgrimages and processions. The Catholic Church represented religious as well as national and civic resistance against the communist regime. As such, it never had to yield too much to the restrictions that the communist government tried to impose. The church in Czechoslovakia was in a different position. It was not as strong as in Poland, and the repression it experienced was much harsher. The official structure never ceased to exist, although it was much weakened through the restrictions described above. Over time, the church sought a modus vivendi that would allow it at least a basic official operation. The concessions to the regime were backed by the Vatican’s Ostpolitik of the late 1960s (Chenaux 2009). However, the official church stagnated during the communist era. In the early 1950s the Catholic Church started to build its underground organization in Czechoslovakia. It included secretly ordained bishops and priests as well as the lay movement. Besides religious services, the underground church provided religious instruction for children, education for its clergy, published or smuggled books, and organized various activities. The underground church was not always personally separated from the official church, although there is a clear difference in its structure and activities (Balík and Hanuš 2013). The underground church was a natural choice for Catholics seeking a deeper involvement in their religion, the strict observation of doctrine, or more information and access to religious literature. The underground church had been growing over time and it showed considerable power in the final years of communist rule. After the 1989 revolution, both organizations merged into one as the underground church members joined the official church again.",5

Taylor (2003) reports how this price discrimination based on past purchases, called behaviour-based price discrimination (BBPD), is very common in subscription markets. In these industries, the non-anonymity of subscriptions gives to firms information on the identity of current subscribers, so that there is scope for proposing low introductory prices to whom did not buy its product in the past. Discounts take different forms such as low introductory prices, trial memberships and free installations. As mentioned in Caillaud and De Nijs (2014), a new subscriber for three months to the French newspaper “Le Monde”, pays 50 euros whereas a previous customer is charged 131.30 euros. Similar offers are the free trial memberships to software applications as well as online contents platforms such as Spotify and Amazon.Footnote 1 Moreover, first subscriptions to credit cardsFootnote 2 and TVs/internet services are often offered for free. All these services have the common feature that subscribers are not the only customers, as business is also made on merchants (credit cards), advertisers (media) and content providers (online platforms). In economic jargon, these markets are run by two-sided platforms allowing the interaction between different groups of customers linked to each other by cross-group externalities. Think for example to credit cards. A cardholder’s utility is increasing in the number of shops where she can use it and merchants are in turn more willing to pay to hold a card reader as the number of consumers increases. Because of the presence of the externalities, one of the distinctive features of these markets is the pricing rule, which is different from the one applying in a one-sided framework (i.e., market without externalities). Going back to the example of credit cards, the subscription fee charged to the cardholders affects not only the demand in this group, but also the willingness to pay of merchants to hold an electronic point of sale. This is the basic reason for the observation of a cross-group price discrimination, as the price charged to each group depends on the cross externalities, so that a group whose participation entails a large participation of the other group will be charged less. This is the so-called Divide and Conquer strategy, according to which the group having weaker externalities becomes a loss leader, as attracting it is necessary to make higher profits on the group with stronger externalities. According to this discussion, in many subscription markets two kinds of strategies are used by competing platforms: the mentioned cross-group price discrimination typical of a two-sided market and the within-group BBPD on subscribers’ side.Footnote 3
 This paper provides a two-sided market analysis investigating the effects of within-group BBPD on prices, surplus distribution and welfare. The aim of the analysis is to tackle the following questions: (i) “ What is the impact of within-group BBPD in two-sided markets?” and (ii) “ What is the role of the relative discounting of subscribers in relation to the one of platforms?”. The paper demonstrates that within-group BBPD has a negative effect on platforms’ profits, does not affect the firms’ side, and benefits consumer only if they do not discount the future too much. On the one hand, platforms compete strongly to attract switchers and this always makes them worse-off when they can discriminate prices. On the other hand, when consumers are strongly interested in meeting firms, they become the profit-making group and BBPD results to be a further future alternative to attract consumers. As a consequence, early competition in consumers’ side is mitigated and, if consumers discount factor is sufficiently low, this may result in a lower consumer surplus in relation to uniform pricing. In terms of welfare, the loss of the platforms is compensated by the gain of consumers only when the latter give much weight on future utility, so that they really care about future possibilities of switching. These findings result from a two-period model in which two platforms compete for subscribers and firms, located in a Hotelling line of length one. After a first round of subscription decisions, platforms are able to recognize first-period subscribers and are allowed to discriminate between old and new subscribers. This behaviour-based discrimination is allowed in the consumers’ side only. In the examples motivating the paper this type of discrimination is never used in the firms’ side. As a matter of fact, other types of price discrimination might be used by platforms on the firms’ side: in the media market, advertisers usually compete for a limited number of spaces through auctions, whereas per-click royalties are paid to content providers (majors/record labels/publishers) by online platforms. For the sake of simplicity, the model proposed here neglects these discriminating policies, by focusing on a uniform price on the firms’ side. In terms of second-period prices, competition for consumers is strengthened compared to the case in which a uniform price is charged in both sides of the market, whereas firms are indifferent between the BBPD and the uniform-pricing regime. Indeed, both platforms invade rival turf putting pressure on subscription prices. As a result, they steal each other the same number of consumers, so that their total number is the same that would have been attracted under uniform pricing, with the consequence of an identical willingness to pay of firms. Consumers are assumed to discount their future utility, with the usual parameter \(\delta \) representing the relative weight that a subscriber gives to second-period in relation to first-period utility. Differently, platforms are assumed not to discount the future. This allows to reinterpret the parameter \(\delta \) as the relative discounting between platforms in relation to consumers. The assumption of different discounting is common in several papers studying dynamic pricing, e.g. Villas-Boas (1999), Villas-Boas (2006), Chen and Zhang (2009), Zhang (2011), Carroni (2016), Rhee and Thomadsen (2017) and it is grounded on two arguments. On the one hand, as pointed out by Rhee and Thomadsen (2017), “research has shown that consumers generally discount future consumption utility at greater rates than are earned on capital (e.g., Andreoni and Sprenger 2012; Malkoc and Zauberman 2006)”, which is consistent with consumers discounting the future more than platforms. On the other hand, many papers in one-sided BBPDFootnote 4 show how consumers discounting has an impact on the first-period competition, as the anticipation of future discounted prices induces the indifferent first-period consumer to respond more weakly to first-period prices, so to mitigate early price competition. Therefore, considering different discounting allows to isolate this first period “elasticity effect” that BBPD brings about. In the present work, the inter-temporal effect introduced by consumers’ perception of future switching opportunities is enriched by the interaction between the Divide and Conquer in the early and the BBPD in the late price competition. In particular, if subscribers exhibit stronger externalities than firms, the optimal Divide and Conquer will entail a cross-subsidization from the consumers’ to the firms’ side, with consumers becoming the profit-making group. As BBPD offers the platforms a new opportunity to enlarge their market lately, this reduces early competition in the subscribers’ side so to fully exploit the positive impact of late poaching on early competition. This unambiguously reduces consumer surplus in the first period and may reduce it overall if consumers discount sufficiently future utility. Differently, if platforms “divide” on the subscribers’ side to “conquer” the firms’ side, offering a very low price to the former and making profits on the latter, BBPD may increase first-period competition. In particular, unless consumers discount the future very little, so that the demand is not too “inelastic”, within-group BBPD makes platforms more aggressive in the early competition, so that future switching becomes a threat of loosing consumers (the key group to make profits on the other side) rather than a future opportunity of attracting new ones. In this case, BBPD benefits consumers, as they enjoy lower prices in both periods when they put no weight on future utility or, if they do it, the surplus improvement in the switching phase associated to BBPD prevails over the detriment given by higher first-period prices. 
Related literature This paper is naturally linked to the two-sided market literature, initially formalized by Rochet and Tirole (2003), Armstrong (2006) and Caillaud and Jullien (2003). The main result around which this literature is built on is the cross-group price discrimination, which follows the concept of Divide and Conquer firstly proposed by Caillaud and Jullien (2003). In order to develop a business, a platform offers a low (often below-cost) price to one side of the market and thus restores its losses by charging a relatively high price to the other side. As in Rochet and Tirole (2003) and Armstrong (2006), the present paper proposes a Hotelling model, to capture the idea that customers exhibit heterogeneous preferences over rival platforms, which are then expressed by locations on the Hotelling line. An alternative way to model two-sided markets is the one proposed by Gabszewicz and Wauthy (2014) and Roger (2017), among others, which interpret two-sided market as vertically differentiated with consumers heterogeneous in terms of the strength of the externalities rather in terms of locations. Moreover, the present model focuses on the simplest case in which platforms charge only a fee independent of the number of interactions with the other sideFootnote 5 and customers can join at most one platform.Footnote 6
 On the other side, the paper is strongly related with BBPD literature. In particular, the model builts on Fudenberg and Tirole (2000), who provide a Hotelling model played twice, allowing firms to know whether a customer in the second period is new or old. In different setups, the literature of BBPD mainly agrees on the fact that customer’s recognition harms firms compared to a situation in which the targeted pricing is not possible. Even if a firm alone prefers to obtain the information and so use it to benefit from a surplus extraction, if both get it, then a market stealing effect tends to prevail.Footnote 7
 In recent years, first investigations of within-group price discrimination have been presented, both from an empirical and a theoretical viewpoint. Gil and Riera-Crichton (2011) and Angelucci et al. (2013) provide empirical analysis respectively on Spanish TV and French newspaper industries. The first paper is mainly focused on the relationship between competition and price discrimination, while the second one studies how advertisement revenues affect price discrimination on the readers’ side. Both competition and advertisement revenues are found to have a negative impact on the likelihood of medias to use price discrimination. From a theoretical point of view, two papers are close to the present one. Carroni (2017) provides an industry-specific model of BBPD that suits the case of media markets taking into account the negative externality that advertisers create on consumers (nuisance). In that case, within-group BBPD intensifies competition in the firms’ side, as some firms single-home: this may reduce consumers’ surplus and total welfare. Liu and Serfes (2013) allow platforms to engage in perfect within-group price discrimination. Their main finding is that discrimination might be a tool to neutralize cross-group externalities with a positive effect on prices and platforms’ profits. The main difference with the present paper is that they analyze the case of perfect price discrimination rather than discrimination based on past purchase behaviour, in which also an inter-temporal trade-off plays an important role in platforms’ decisions. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Next section introduces the model, which is analyzed in Sect. 3. Section 4 provides a welfare analysis and, finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",11

Henry Wang,Bill Z. Yang,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Capacity choice and capacity constraints have been important topics of research by economists for decades. In the industrial organization literature, much focus has been on the choice of capacity by individual firms and the effects of such choices on interactions of firms in the market place.Footnote 1 An exception has been recent research by Nie and Chen (2012) and Nie (2014). These authors study the effect on oligopolistic competition when there exists a joint industrywide constraint on available inputs. More specifically, Nie and Chen (2012) study the effects of a joint capacity constraint on a private duopoly, while Nie (2014) studies that of a mixed duopoly. The models studied in the present paper deal with both standard oligopolies and mixed oligopolies.Footnote 2\(^{,}\)Footnote 3 Specifically, this paper is a follow-up study that is based on Nie and Chen (2012) and Nie (2014). Their studies were carried out under the crucial assumption that the game has an equilibrium which is unique and interior. Our study tackles a more basic issue in that we seek to answer the question of when does their assumption apply. Our investigation is undertaken by using the traditional best-response curve analysis. Both standard duopoly and mixed duopoly are considered, and both simultaneous moves and sequential moves are investigated. It is worthwhile to point out that the Nash equilibrium solution we find using best response curves for the duopoly with a joint capacity constraint is consistent with the concept of generalized Nash equilibrium for generalized Nash equilibrium problems studied especially in the Operations Research literature (e.g., Facchinei and Kanzow 2010). The generalized Nash equilibrium problem refers to a non-cooperative game in which each player’s feasible strategy set may depend on other players’ choices. According to Facchinei and Kanzow (2010), a generalized Nash equilibrium is obtained when no player can do better unilaterally given other players’ choices and his/her feasible strategy set. For all four models considered in our study, we find that there exists a critical level of constraint such that the standard equilibrium prevails if the constraint is weaker than the corresponding critical level but the equilibrium is affected if otherwise. Moreover, multiple equilibria exist in the simultaneous move models, while corner solutions arise in the sequential move models. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the basic model setup. Section 3 is focused on private duopoly models under a joint capacity constraint. Section 4 studies mixed duopoly models with a joint capacity constraint. Section 5 concludes the paper.",9

(1988), but the systematic comparison of ad valorem and specific taxes under oligopoly began with the article by Delipalla and Keen (1992). In a conjectural variation oligopoly model they demonstrate that an ad valorem tax is superior to a specific tax by considering a tax reform that reduces the specific tax and increases the ad valorem tax in such a way that the first-round effect on tax revenue, at the initial equilibrium price, is zero (denoted as a P-shift). Skeath and Trandel (1994a) demonstrate that a specific tax can be replaced by a Pareto superior ad valorem tax under monopoly that yields higher consumer surplus, profits and tax revenue, and under oligopoly if the tax rate is sufficiently high.Footnote 2
 Assuming identical and constant marginal cost, Anderson et al. (2001) demonstrate that an ad valorem tax will yield higher tax revenue than a specific tax that results in the same consumer price. They also consider Cournot and Bertrand oligopoly with a fixed number of firms and asymmetric costs, and free entry with symmetric costs. Wang and Zhao (2009) show that specific taxation can be superior to ad valorem taxation with differentiated products and asymmetric costs under Cournot and Bertrand oligopoly. Recently, in a model with endogenous market structure Vetter (2017) shows that a specific tax may be superior to an ad valorem tax. In a strategic market game model of oligopoly, Grazzini (2006) shows that specific taxation can be superior to ad valorem taxation, but this result is driven by the social welfare function. Schröder (2004) shows that ad valorem taxation is superior to specific taxation under monopolistic competition with Dixit-Stiglitz preferences, but Vetter (2013) argues that the result is due to the functional form rather than the mode of competition. Recently, Colombo and Labrecciosa (2013) compared the sustainability of collusion with ad valorem and specific taxation under Cournot and Bertrand oligopoly using the P-shift employed by Delipalla and Keen (1992). They consider infinitely-repeated supergames where collusion is sustained by either Nash-reversion or optimal punishment strategies, and show that a shift from specific to ad valorem taxation makes it easier for firms to sustain collusion. Consequently, in contrast to conventional wisdom, they demonstrate that the specific tax may yield higher tax revenue than an ad valorem tax when collusion is sustainable with the ad valorem tax but is not sustainable with the specific tax. In this comparison of tax revenue, they assume that there is full collusion with the ad valorem tax but no collusion with the specific tax. In this paper, the sustainability of collusion with ad valorem and specific taxes will be reconsidered using a different approach. Rather than using the P-shift, the assumption of constant marginal cost will be used as in Anderson et al. (2001) so that it is possible to find a specific tax that results in the same consumer price as an ad valorem tax in each phase of the supergame with general demand functions under Cournot oligopoly. In contrast to Colombo and Labrecciosa (2013), it will be shown that the critical discount factor required to sustain collusion using Nash-reversion strategies or optimal-punishment strategies is the same with an ad valorem tax as with a specific tax that results in the same price. Using particular functional forms, linear demand and quadratic costs, it will be shown that it is easier to sustain collusion with an ad valorem tax than with a specific tax that results in the same price when marginal cost is increasing. However, in contrast to Colombo and Labrecciosa (2013), it is shown that an ad valorem tax always yields higher revenue than a specific tax when the possibility of partial collusion is considered.",10

China opened her doors to foreign countries in 1979, and then initiated massive privatization in her state-owned enterprises (SOEs), with a guideline to “retain the large, release the small.” During the process of privatization of SOEs (public firms), the widening wage gap between the rich and the poor, and the rising unemployment created social conflict and undermined economic growth and regional stability.Footnote 2 The China government has provided huge fiscal support to chosen provinces and output subsidies to firms, and SOEs are bearing policy burdens as well. From the above description, we argue that subsidies are financed by distortionary taxes, the public firm’s profit, and the tariff revenue can be earmarked. The excess taxation burden accompanying the privatization policy is the issue that we should pay attention to and analyze the intertwined factors in a proper theoretical context. It motivates us to examine how the excess taxation burden will affect the privatization policy in the presence of strategic tax/subsidy policies. 
Lin and Li (2008) explored the pervasive syndromes of soft budget constraint (SBC) in socialist and transition economies, and argued that the policy burdens on enterprises result in SBC problems. In their paper, the policy burdens induce low effort input of firm manager and thus low efficiency of production; with the policy burdens, increasing market competition will make the SBC syndromes more likely to arise. Accordingly, privatization will not necessarily harden the budget constraint of the enterprise. On the contrary, when a public firm still bears the policy burdens, privatization will only aggravate the SBC problems and besides, a private enterprise will demand more ex post subsidies from the government than would a public firm under the same conditions. However, in their paper, the impact of policy burden on privatization was not dealt with in the context of a mixed oligopoly market with excess burden of taxation. In mixed oligopolistic industries, Matsumura (1998) considered the possibility of partial privatization, and showed that neither full privatization nor full nationalization is optimal. Mixed oligopoly modeling with foreign competitors is also presented in Fjell and Pal (1996), Pal and White (1998) and Matsumura (2003). In a closed-market homogeneous oligopoly, Matsumura and Kanda (2005) demonstrated that partial privatization is the optimal policy in the short-run; full nationalization is always optimal in the long run with free entry among private firms. Recently, there have been several important extensions of the above well-known results by considering FDI and privatization policy, a state holding corporation with two plants and privatization, and efficiency improvement in relation to the level of privatization, in particular. Dijkstra et al. (2015) showed that the possibility of FDI reduces the degree of privatization, and furthermore, demonstrated that FDI policies reducing the fixed cost of undertaking FDI may need to complement the privatization policies to attract FDI and to improve domestic welfare. Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón (2017) considered a state holding corporation with two plants that may produce complement or substitute goods. They mainly found that if the marginal cost of the state corporation is low, it is not privatized either if goods are substitutes or if they are complements. However, if the marginal cost of the state corporation is high, the two plants of the state holding corporation are sold to a single private investor if goods are complements, and to different investors if goods are substitutes. If goods are close substitutes and the marginal cost of the state corporation takes an intermediate value, only one plant is privatized. Chen (2017) endogenizes efficiency improvement in relation to the level of privatization in a mixed duopoly and showed that in the short run, specifically, if the effect of efficiency improvement is sufficiently small, the magnitude of the improvement of social welfare is reduced; in the long run, the optimal policy for a state-owned firm is partial privatization.Footnote 3
 Some studies have simultaneously considered the relations between privatization policy and dual trade instruments, output subsidy or/and import tariff, in a mixed market. For example, Pal and White (1998) examined the interaction between privatization and strategic trade policies and found that the welfare is always increased with privatization if output subsidy is used only. However, privatization increases welfare over much of the parameter space if import tariff is used only. Chang (2007), Yu and Lee (2011), Han (2012) and Lee et al. (2013) also examined the optimal privatization and trade policies in an international mixed market. Excess taxation burden was not a concern in these papers. A peculiarity common to all these studies is the assumption that the social cost of public funds is unity: an extra dollar earned in profits has the same social valuation as an extra dollar in subsidy payments forgone by the government. However, public funding yields deadweight loss; that is, there is an excess burden of taxation for public funding. Ever since Pigou (1947), many scholars and policymakers are convinced that the marginal cost of public funds must be larger than one, since the government relies on distortionary taxes to finance its outlays. If the marginal cost of public funds is indeed larger than one, this has important normative consequences for the determination of optimal public policy in many fields.Footnote 4
 In the literature on mixed oligopolies with social cost of the public fund, Capuano and De Feo (2010), Wang and Chen (2010) and Matsumura and Tomaru (2013, 2015) have examined the welfare effect of a change in a public firm’s objective function when the government takes into account the social cost of public funds (or, henceforth, excess taxation burden). Xu et al. (2016) introduced the excess taxation burden into a bilateral trade, two-country and two-mixed market model in which a state-owned enterprise in each country competes with both domestic and foreign private enterprises. They showed that the welfare effect of privatization and free trade agreements (FTAs) depends on the shadow cost of the excess burden of taxation. The above papers except Xu et al. (2016) examined the excess taxation burden in a closed economy, but none of them considered how the optimal policies (i.e., privatization, subsidization and trade policies) are affected by the excess taxation burden in a mixed oligopoly with foreign competition. Besides, whether the privatization is desirable for welfare improvement is making the comparisons of the equilibrium outcome under mixed oligopoly and pure oligopoly. This paper uses a mixed oligopoly model with foreign competitors for an open economy like China, and examines how the excess taxation burden and foreign competition will affect the privatization policy in the presence of strategic tax/subsidy policies. We show that in the presence of the excess taxation burden with foreign competitors, the optimal privatization policy is partial privatization, which is different from the existing results. If the excess taxation burden is small, output subsidy coupled with import tariff and partial privatization is adopted to improve the social welfare. However, if the excess taxation burden is relatively large, the government may switch to use production tax coupled with tariff policy and partial privatization to improve the social welfare. This paper is organized as follows. Basic modeling is provided in Sect. 2. Section 3 explores how the excess taxation burden and foreign competition will affect the privatization policy in the presence of strategic tax/subsidy policies. Section 4 provides conclusions.",16

Demand-side determinants of trade provided by preference specifics, which was put forward by Linder (1961), were not ordinarily accounted for. Indeed, the number of existing contributions, encompassing many trade papers, typically postulate identical and homothetic preferences across consumers. This assumption, which is central to the canonical models of trade (Krugman 1980; Helpman and Krugman 2000), implies that the market demand function is symmetric across varieties and countries, i.e. the same for the same varieties across different countries as well as for different varieties within the country. Although at odds with reality, this assumption allows one to greatly simplify the analysis and obtain explicit analytical results. In the meantime though, there is an increasing list of publications where an attempt is made to take the heterogeneity and non-homotheticity of consumer preferences into account when explaining market outcomes and international trade patterns (Choi et al. 2009; Simonovska 2010; Auer 2010; Fieler 2011; Markusen 2013; Hepenstrick and Tarasov 2015; Kichko et al. 2014; Di Comite et al. 2014; Nigai 2016; Wang and Gibson 2015). Despite the fact that the heterogeneity of consumer preferences doesn’t raise any doubts (Allenby and Rossi 1999; Calvet and Comon 2003; Auer 2010; Di Comite et al. 2014; Christensen 2014; Nigai 2016), the authors dealing with the models of monopolistic competition, customary avoid its consideration. There are at list two reasons explaining this fact. First is that the heterogeneity of consumer preferences entails a significant complication of the formal structure of the models, and second is that the effects of unobserved heterogeneity in tastes are very difficult to identify empirically. The present paper builds a two-sector two-country trade model of monopolistic competition in which consumers/workers, employed in agricultural and manufacturing sectors, differ not only in their incomes, but also in their tastes and expenditure shares on manufacturing and traditional goods. Workers employed in industrial sector are assumed to be relatively richer than workers in agricultural sector, and as a consequence, tend to spend a larger share of their income on manufacturing goods compared to agricultural goods.Footnote 1 The relationship between expenditure shares of the two types of consumers/workers and relative wages of industrial workers is provided by a system of equations constituting the general equilibrium of the model. The kind of consumer heterogeneity considered in our framework is neither reflected in the canonical model of monopolistic competition (Dixit and Stiglitz 1977), nor in the canonical models of trade (Krugman 1980; Helpman and Krugman 2000), since all of these models is based on the assumption of identical consumers. One approach which is close to ours in terms of modelling strategy is that of Di Comite et al. (2014). Here the authors also invoke the heterogeneity of consumers to explain the strong variation observed in the quantities of identical varieties sold in various countries. Nevertheless, there is a difference between the two models. While the model of Di Comite et al. (2014) is based on the restructured quadratic utility used previously by Ottaviano et al. (2002), Melitz and Ottaviano (2008), and others, we prefer the modification of the nested Cobb–Douglas and CES utility function to model consumers’ perception of the manufacturing goods. Similar strategy was applied in our earlier paper (Osharin et al. 2014), where an attempt was made to develop a monopolistic competition model accounting for heterogeneity in consumer preferences and incomes for a closed economy case. In contrast to trade models based on identical consumers, an assumption of preference heterogeneity makes it possible to obtain different demands for the same variety across destination countries when consumers within these countries have nonidentical joint distributions of tastes and expenditure shares. Since there is no reason to assume a priory that the taste and income (expenditure share) distributions of consumers in different countries are the same (Calvet and Comon 2003; Fernandez-Blanco et al. 2009; Atkin 2013; Di Comite et al. 2014; Christensen 2014), we may expect that the consumer-specific preferences used in the present model will provide a richer set of predictions compared to that of Krugman (1980) and Helpman and Krugman (2000). The main objective of the paper is the assessing of the role of within country taste and income heterogeneity in resolving “home bias in trade puzzle”.Footnote 2 The “home bias in trade” is defined as the excessive consumption or absorption of domestically produced goods compared with what the traditional models of trade predict. The first illustration of this phenomenon is McCallum’s finding that trade between two Canadian provinces is twenty times greater than trade between individual Canadian provinces and individual U.S. states (McCallum 1995). Nitsch (2000) has come to a similar conclusion on home bias by estimating that on average EU countries internal trade is seven to ten times larger than trade with partner countries. Using gravity specification and inspecting trade within U.S. states, Wolf (2000) showed that home bias is present even on the subnational level, although its magnitude is substantially lower than the home bias found for Canada versus the United States and for intra- versus international trade of OECD countries. Taken together, the most of the literature comes to a conclusion that countries do exhibit a sufficiently high degree of home bias in consumption, but its magnitude is not as large as McCallum’s original estimation. Traditional explanation of home bias is the presence of formal and informal trade barriers. Moreover, Obstfeld and Rogoff (2001, henceforth OR) argue that trade costs in goods markets can be the unified explanation of the most of the existing trade puzzles, including the home bias in trade. To prove their proposition they used a highly simplified two-country trade model which was calibrated to an observed ratio of home to foreign consumption spending and showed that trade costs and appropriately chosen common elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods can explain a large observed home bias in trade. Recently Eaton et al. (2016, henceforth EKN) took a multi-country dynamic model of trade to data from nineteen countries and obtained results in favor of OR conclusions. While there is quite a consensus about the role of trade costs in explaining the home bias in consumption, less is known about the influence of consumer taste heterogeneity on home bias (Markusen 2013; Balta and Delgado 2009; Bahles 2014; Morey 2016). Our paper contributes to the related literature and shows that preference and income heterogeneity in combination with trade costs can be an essential ingredient in resolving home bias in trade puzzle. By taking a few simple illustrative examples, we show that the growing taste differential between skilled and unskilled workers within the countries may provide divergence in the price elasticities of the market demand for home and foreign goods, making market demand for importables less elastic. This leads to an increase in the price of imported goods compared to local goods. As a consequence, the local goods’ becoming relatively cheaper strengthens the home bias in trade. This observation is in line with OR early prediction that the “…home bias in demand for goods can work similarly to trade costs, at list for the trade and portfolio-bias puzzles” (OR, p. 348). What is interesting is that our model demonstrates an ambiguous prediction towards the direction of trade bias depending on the sign of the correlation coefficient between tastes and expenditure shares of the two groups of consumers/workers. While positive correlation between tastes and expenditure shares provides a substantial increase in home bias in response to the rising taste differential between agricultural and industrial workers, the negative correlation acts in the opposite direction, providing a noticeable reduction in home bias in trade. Alongside with the difference in tastes of consumers, our paper reveals also an additional channel through which the structure of an economy may exert influence on home bias in trade. This is the inhomogeneity of within country income distribution arising due to difference in wages across production sectors. The larger the wage difference between the two groups of consumers/workers in our model of trade the more the consumption spending is skewed in favor of domestic goods. This finding seems to be in line with the data, provided by EKN for nineteen economies over the period of 2000–2014, and contributes to the existing literature on trade and income inequality linkages (Mitra and Trindade 2005; Waugh 2010; Kurokawa 2014; Eppinger and Felbermayr 2015; Martinez-Zarzoso and Vollmer 2016). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model and obtains short-run and long-run equilibrium outcomes. In Sect. 3 we carry out the comparative static analysis of the model (both analytically and numerically) and present our main results. Section 4 discusses the perspectives of the model. Section 5 concludes.",3

They have made it possible to study the interaction between growth and uncertainty, and also led to the development of the real business cycle theory. Modern macroeconomic models are primarily based on these models, and they can be used to quantitatively examine how macroeconomic aggregates respond to exogenous shocks such as technology shocks. One shortcoming of stochastic growth models, however, is their intractability. To a large extent, because of uncertainty, the model is analytically harder to solve than their deterministic counterparts, and they are often solved numerically around the steady state. Moreover, a case of closed-form solutions is by and large limited. For example, in order to obtain the closed-form solution, some authors use logarithmic utility function, instead of the more general constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) preferences for the household side. Or, for the firm side, production technology has been limited to linear or the so-called AK type, instead of Cobb–Douglas technology.Footnote 1
 This being said, the breakthrough of Bucci et al. (2011) is substantial: they first find the closed-form solution to the continuous-time version of the two-sector optimal growth model of Uzawa (1965) and Lucas (1988) in which technological progress follows an exogenous Brownian motion process. Although Bucci et al. (2011) assume the CRRA preference and generalized Cobb–Douglas production technology à la Mankiw et al. (1992), without ignoring depreciation of physical and human capital, they successfully discover the explicit solution with two parameter restrictions, one of which has been standard since Xie (1991, 1994). Economically, they uncover that the larger technology shock reduces the optimal level of consumption and time devoted to the production of final goods. The former is obtained by virtue of Jensen’s inequality, while the latter is confirmed by numerical simulation. Subsequently, Hiraguchi (2013) revisits Bucci et al. (2011) and finds that, the closed-form solution is, in fact, available with one parameter restriction of Xie (1991, 1994) only. Moreover, Hiraguchi (2013) proves that the value function of Bucci et al. (2011) does not satisfy the optimality conditions, and unveils the new correct value function. It shows that technology shocks, de facto, have nothing to do with the optimal level of consumption and increase time devoted to the final goods production, both of which are in sharp contrast to Bucci et al. (2011). Following the lead of them, Marsiglio and Torre (2012a, b) also get the closed-form solution to the Uzawa–Lucas model with stochastic population dynamics driven by, again, a Brownian motion process.Footnote 2
 Four papers on the stochastic Uzawa–Lucas model above are innovative in that they analytically, not numerically, throw new light on the mechanism through which technology/demographic shocks affect the macroeconomy in a transparent way. At the same time, they leave some common possibilities to be studied. First, they only consider a Brownian motion process. While this process is widely used (Turnovsky 1997, 2000), it is not the only stochastic process used in macroeconomics. For instance, another stochastic process of the Poisson jump process is also used extensively by some authors such as Aghion and Howitt (1992), Steger (2005), Sennewald and Wälde (2006), Sennewald (2007) and more recently, Brunnermeier and Sannikov (2014). Moreover, Wälde (2011a) finds the closed-form solution to the stochastic AK model with a combination of a Brownian motion process and many Poisson jump processes, while Hiraguchi (2014) does so in the stochastic Ramsey model with leisure. To string studies cited above together, it is worth exploring whether we can find the closed-form solution to the stochastic Uzawa–Lucas model with a mixed Brownian and many Poisson jump processes. This is the first agenda of this paper. Second, these four papers all assume that human capital, the heart of the Uzawa–Lucas model, accumulates in a deterministic way. However, it is hard to believe that the return on the accumulation of human capital is not uncertain. Since human capital uncertainty is known to have sizable impacts on, for example, estimates of rates of return (Levhari and Weiss 1974), or on the decision of students on when to leave school and to enter the labor market (Bilkic et al. 2012), its stochastic nature has to be examined for the design of policy. Notwithstanding its importance, the lack of human capital uncertainty has been frequently indicated, for instance, by Levhari and Weiss (1974) and Krebs (2003) in theory, and Hartog et al. (2007) in practice. Specifically, Hartog et al. (2007) construct a simulation model to replicate the situation in which agents ex ante face risks associated with education. They empirically demonstrate that investment in a college education is as risky as investment in the stock market with a portfolio of some 30 randomly chosen stocks, and hence the stochastic returns from human capital accumulation. On the other hand, in order to understand the interactions between human capital uncertainty and major macroeconomic aggregates, Krebs (2003) develops a discrete-time, one-sector stochastic growth model with human capital in which heterogeneous households face undiversifiable idiosyncratic risks in an incomplete market. He shows that the larger human capital risk increases physical capital stock, while leads to human capital contraction, weakens the growth rate, and deteriorates welfare. These findings are robust even in the presence of risky physical capital. Since four papers on stochastic Uzawa–Lucas model above do not conduct an inspection of the relationship between welfare and (human capital) uncertainty, the finding of Krebs (2003) must be appreciated. Following Krebs (2003), I not only find the closed-form solution, but also use that solution in studying nexus between uncertainty and welfare in the context of the stochastic Uzawa–Lucas model. Moreover, I analyze the effect of technological progress on welfare. Although Krebs (2003) abstracts from technological progress, some empirical studies such as Hojo (2003), and more recently, Madsen (2014) and Cinnirella and Streb (2017), point out that the true value of human capital can be well understood only in conjunction with technological progress. Furthermore, all my findings are completely characterized based on the closed-form solution obtained, and I will show that the larger human capital uncertainty has nothing to do with physical capital stock, and that it reduces expected growth rate of human capital. Krebs (2003) acknowledges that his results are primarily driven by market incompleteness, whereas here, I assume a complete market. In addition, I examine the welfare implications of the higher arrival rate and the larger jump size of many Poisson jump processes on expected growth rate of human capital and welfare. This is possible because, unlike Krebs (2003), I will deal with the Poisson jump process, as well as a Brownian motion process. Summing up, the purpose of this paper is to find the closed-form solution to the stochastic Uzawa–Lucas model in which the accumulation of human capital follows a combination of a Brownian motion process and many Poisson jump processes, and in particular, to examine impacts of larger human capital uncertainty on expected growth rate of human capital and welfare. This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the baseline Uzawa–Lucas model with stochastic human capital accumulation driven by a Brownian motion process. Section 3 extends the baseline model by considering a mixture of a Brownian motion process and many Poisson jump processes. Section 4 provides the further extension which incorporates the risky physical capital (the reason for this extension will be clear in Sect. 2). Concluding remarks appear in Sect. 5.",7

The traditional understanding of this question is that strengthening patent protection heightens patent holders’ power, which can incentivize future innovations. Recent analyses by Jaffe and Lerner (2004), Shapiro (2001), however, suggest that, if patent holders have too much power, it will stifle future innovations rather than promote R&D. In this study, we focus on the effects brought about by strengthening patent protection between incumbents and entrants through the profit-division rule. In an environment with cumulative innovations, firms apply previously patented products, processes, or technologies to their new products. Therefore, to avoid patent infringement, they must share their profits with current patent holders, because existing technologies are protected by intellectual property rights. This profit-division rule implies that stronger patent protection increases patent holders’ power and enlarges their payments from those wishing to access their patented technology. Consequently, strengthening patent protection can stifle new invention and subsequent innovation, because it reduces incentives to engage in R&D. This negative aspect of patents is often called a “blocking patent,” because it adversely affects future innovations. Many previous studies, such as Boldrin and Levine (2008) and Chu (2009), analyzed the negative effects of a blocking patent on innovation. In this paper, we show that increasing the power of incumbents can have a positive effect on economic growth and provide a new perspective on a blocking patent. We incorporate the profit-division rule from the entrant to incumbent firms examined by Chu et al. (2012) into the endogenous growth model developed by Furukawa (2013a), which features survival activity in the R&D sector.Footnote 1 Furukawa (2013a) analyzes the effect of innovation and growth with two policy variables: patent breadth and subsidies for the R&D sector. In this model, the incumbents invest to survive longer and to maintain their position as patent holders to gain more profit from entrants. In the real world, firms try to maintain their state-of-the-art technology and retain their profits by investing in or doing various activities.Footnote 2 Therefore, it is reasonable to analyze the effects of a blocking patent with endogenous survival activities, reflecting the real firm behavior. The main contribution of this study is the exploration of endogenous survival activities as novel channels, through which blocking patents can have ambiguous effects on economic growth. We find that, in an environment where patented firms engage in survival activities, strengthening patent protection—which means that the profit sharing from entrant to incumbent firms increases and the rights of patent holders are strengthened—enhances the survival investment and has a positive effect on economic growth and social welfare under some conditions. Results show that endogenizing survival activity has indirect positive effects on economic growth. We thus characterize the new role of a blocking patent on economic growth. We also find that increasing R&D subsidy rate can negatively affect economic growth because of the survival investment. Although this result confirms Furukawa’s (2013a) model, it shows the novel insight of a blocking patent in determining the innovation effect of R&D subsidies. Furthermore, we show that the size of patent breadth, which is another patent instrument in this model, may affect the innovation effect of the profit-division rule and the subsidy rate for R&D. The literature analyzing macroeconomic effects of patent policy includes Chu (2009), Chu and Pan (2013), Chu et al. (2012), and Niwa (2016), who explain the effects of a blocking patent in an endogenous growth model. Chu (2009) quantitatively examines the effects of blocking patents in a quality-ladder model with overlapping intellectual property rights. The model analyzes both positive and negative effects of blocking patents from two aspects: patent breadth and the profit-sharing rule. He shows that reduction of the negative effect of blocking patents would increase current profits for an inventor and enhance R&D and welfare. In an endogenous growth model, Chu and Pan (2013) analyze the effect of patent breadth and the profit-division rule. In their model, the rate of profit division is determined endogenously by the step size of innovation. They show that the effect of a blocking patent under the endogenous step size of innovation for economic growth is non-monotonic. By introducing the profit-division rule into two types of R&D (i.e., horizontal and vertical R&D), Chu et al. (2012) find that blocking patents have a positive and negative effect on R&D. They show that strengthening a blocking patent on one R&D impedes innovation, whereas it enhances innovation for other R&D. Niwa (2016) extends the model of Chu et al. (2012) by incorporating the profit-division rule into both vertical and horizontal R&D, finding that strengthening each type of blocking patents has both a positive and negative effect on innovation. This study differs from these studies in analyzing endogenous survival activities of patent holders. By introducing survival activities, we find the novel channel of a blocking patent and show that it has a positive effect on economic growth and social welfare under some conditions, which is new to the literature of profit-division rule. This novel dimension of a blocking patent through survival activities complements previous studies that focused on the negative dimension of a blocking patent. Several studies about other patent instruments exist, such as Iwaisako and Futagami (2003), Futagami and Iwaisako (2007), and Chu (2010), about patent length; Horii and Iwaisako (2007) and Furukawa (2007) write on patent protection against imitation; Iwaisako and Futagami (2013) and Saito (2017) write on patent breadth; and Suzuki (2015) write on patent protection and trade secrets.Footnote 3 Our paper complements these studies by characterizing the novel role of a blocking patent on patent protection through endogenous survival activities of incumbent firms. This study proceeds as follows. Section 2 constructs an R&D-based growth model that features a blocking patent. Section 3 defines the equilibrium conditions. Sections 4.1 and 4.2 analyze the effects of strengthening patent protection and the subsidy rate for R&D on innovation and economic growth. Section 4.3 discusses the role of patent breadth in this model. Section 5 analyzes the welfare effects of a blocking patent and R&D subsidies. Section 6 provides a quantitative analysis of this model. Finally, Sect. 7 provides concluding remarks.",6
125.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,15 May 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-018-0611-7,Surplus measures and luenberger Hicks–Moorsteen productivity indicator,November 2018,Arnaud Abad,Rabaozafy Louisa Andriamasy,Walter Briec,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The quantification of productivity changes associated with efficiency analysis of firms is an important part of production theory. It is at the same time one of the most difficult aspects of empirical production economics, for such quantification is hampered by the possible lack of information on prices. Hence, the issue is important both from a theoretical and empirical viewpoint. A principal approach for making productivity comparisons is the calculus associated with compensated and equivalent variation which play a central role in surplus measures. To do that distance functions (Farrell 1957) play a crucial role. The directional distance function was introduced in Chambers et al. (1996) and is a transposition in production theory of the benefit function proposed in Luenberger (1992a) and Luenberger (1995) in consumer theory. Notice that Luenberger (1992b) introduced an equivalent concept in the general equilibrium context. He termed it the “shortage function”. The benefit function can be viewed as a surplus measure dual to the expenditure function. More recently, Chavas and Baggio (2010) established a relationship between the benefit function and the Marshallian and compensated price-dependent consumer demands. The directional distance function in the input (output) oriented case is primal to the cost (revenue) function that is dual to the input (output) directional distance function. Distance functions offer a powerful tool to measure productivity changes (Caves et al. 1982). The directional distance function can be used to construct the so-called Luenberger productivity indicator (Briec and Kerstens 2004; Chambers 2002; Chambers et al. 1996) that is an additive form of the Malmquist productivity index (Chambers et al. 1994; Estache et al. 2007; Färe et al. 1995; Fuentes et al. 2001; Glass and McKillop 2000; Ouellette and Vierstraete 2004). The Luenberger–Hicks–Moorsteen productivity indicator was introduced in (Briec and Kerstens 2004) to provide an additive version of the Bjurek index (Bjurek 1996; Bjurek et al. 1998; Färe et al. 1996). While the Bjurek index is constructed from Shephard distance function (Shephard 1953), the Luenberger–Hicks–Moorsteen is derived from the directional distance function. This paper extends to production theory some notions of compensated and equivalent variation analyzed in Luenberger (1996) in a consumer context. It is established that the Luenberger–Hicks–Moorsteen productivity indicator has a simple interpretation in term of surplus. From a formal viewpoint, the main problem is that production theory involves a multi-output context. Therefore some notions are developed in an output context. Along this line a special input–output version of the Slutsky matrix is proposed. When considering efficiency analysis of a technology as a wholeFootnote 1, it is natural to extend efficiency measures to an aggregate efficiency measure (Färe and Primont 2003) over all firms by summing their individual scores. The issue of aggregation has been widely studied in production theory. First, Farrell (1957), introduced the notion of structural efficiency of an aggregate group of firms. Thereafter, Färe and Zelenyuk (2003) established group structural efficiency measures. The latter is defined as the optimal aggregate output when the allocation of individual input endowments is targeted and fixed (for an output orientation). Following Luenberger (1995), Färe and Zelenyuk (2003) and Nesterenko and Zelenyuk (2007) extended aggregate efficiency measurement to a group potential technology, allowing inputs reallocations. From these aggregation plans, Nesterenko and Zelenyuk (2007) and Mayer and Zelenyuk (2014) proposed an aggregate Malmquist productivity indices. These indexes allow to consider intertemporal change in productivity for an industry, with or without input reallocations (output orientation). Briec et al. (2003) analysed the issue of aggregation focusing on directional distance function. These authors show that conditions of exact aggregation hold only on specific cases. Most of time, there exists aggregation bias which can be interpreted as a bound for industrial allocative inefficiency. Leleu and Briec (2009) proposed to assess lower bound for the sum of firms’ allocative efficiencies in the absence of information on prices. In this paper a resource function introduced by Luenberger (1994, 1995, 1996) is considered and an analogue formulation is constructed in a production context. To do that, a total directional distance function is introduced that is the sum of the individual directional distance functions. The directional distance resource function is then defined as the maximum of the total directional distance function over all the possible reallocations of resources. This aggregate efficiency indicator allows to indicate possible inefficiency and an optimal resource reallocation within the group. Two types of directional distance resource functions are considered. First, we focus on an input oriented measure. In such a case, the output levels are targeted and fixed. Input directional distance resource function is of interest when firms merge to an aggregate entity (eg. industry or economic union) with possible input reallocation. Symmetrically, an output oriented resource function is considered for which input levels are given. Output directional distance resource function is attracting when the combination of firms permits to establish output reallocations. One can then construct an aggregate version of the Luenberger–Hicks–Moorsteen productivity indicator proposed in Briec and Kerstens (2004) by combining input and output oriented resource functions. This allows to analyze dual properties. This aggregate difference based productivity indicator is of particular interest to managers (or leaders) of grouping firms as it is connected to the variations of the aggregate input and output over consecutive time periods. Notice that similar ideas are also proposed in Ten Raa (2005) that quantifies the aggregation inconsistency of productivity indices from firm’s allocative efficiency change and its excess marginal productivities weighted by input changes. Such an approach requires knowledge of the production function for each firm at each point in time, or, at the very least, the marginal products at both the observed inputs and at the optimally allocated inputs for each firm. The estimating of these production functions is, however, difficult (e.g., Diewert 1992, 2000). The paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 lays down the groundwork. Section 3 presents the connections between surplus and duality theories. The dual properties of the Luenberger–Hicks–Moorsteen productivity indicator are analyzed in Sect. 4. A special aggregate resource function is defined for a group of firms in Sect. 5. Along this line an aggregate Luenberger–Hicks–Moorsteen productivity indicator is proposed in Sect. 6.",

On the one hand, climate policy in some countries like Germany has been driven by the hope that leadership by a country or a group of countries will improve public good provision and global welfare. On the other hand, it has been shown in the framework of standard public good theory (see, e.g., Sandler 1992, pp. 57–58; Varian 1994) that due to the strategic reduction of the leader’s public good contribution the leader–follower (Stackelberg) game with sequential moves brings about a smaller public good supply than the game with simultaneous moves so that “the tendency toward underprovision is even more marked at the equilibrium of the sequential process than at the Nash-Cournot equilibrium” (Cornes and Sandler 1996, p. 331). But also in a cooperative scenario (see, e.g., Chen and Zeckhauser 2018), in which a bargaining solution is attained, leadership may be detrimental to public good supply (see Hoel 1991; Buchholz and Konrad 1994). There have been a lot of attempts to vindicate the position of leadership optimists (see Edenhofer et al. 2015; Schwerhoff 2016, for overviews), e.g. by taking into account that leadership may resolve uncertainties about the costs and benefits of public goods (see Hermalin 1998; Brandt 2004) or may cause positive technological externalities which automatically reduce contribution costs in other countries (see Stranlund 1996; or Buchholz et al. 2017). The interaction between technology spillovers and information transmission through signaling may even foster the positive effects of leadership (see Mideksa 2016). Moreover, leadership proves to be successful when it facilitates communication (see Barbieri 2012) or—by integrating features of behavioral economics—when the agents involved have other-regarding preferences or expectations of reciprocity (see Buchholz and Sandler 2017). In this paper we add a further argument to support the belief that leadership can have a positive effect both on the level of public good supply and on the utilities of the countries involved. The mechanism, which underlies these positive effects of leadership, completely works within the standard framework of public good theory (see Bergstrom et al. 1986; Cornes and Sandler 1996). In particular, it does without assuming specific preferences or asymmetric information but sticks—in a scenario without uncertainty and asymmetric information—to the conventional modest assumption of purely strategic leadership, i.e. that “governments are … the narrow payoff-maximizers postulated in models as those of Hoel (1991) and Varian (1994)” (Schwerhoff 2016, p. 200). At the same time, the analysis takes an empirically relevant element of leadership behavior in climate policy into account, i.e. climate friendly technological progress through which greenhouse gas mitigation is made less expensive. Against this background, the main point of our analysis is that, by acting as the leader in the Stackelberg game, a country has a higher incentive to utilize a cost-saving “green” technology as compared to the Nash game, where strategic considerations may prevent countries from applying an improved contribution technology (see Buchholz and Konrad 1994; Ihori 1996). The positive effect on public good supply that is caused by the improved technology then may be so strong that it overcompensates the negative crowding-out effect that occurs in the usual leader–follower scenario, which even leads to a Pareto improvement. The structure of the paper will be as follows: In Sect. 2 we describe an otherwise standard two-stage model of voluntary public good provision with two countries L and \( F \), in which at stage 1 one of the two countries, country \( L \), has the possibility to switch to a new contribution technology, which improves its productivity in public good provision. At stage 2 voluntary public good provision takes place either in a Nash game or a Stackelberg game. Section 3 then first of all provides a condition implying that country \( L \) does not want to take the opportunity for technological improvement in the Nash game but adheres to the original less productive contribution technology. If country \( L \) instead is the leader in a Stackelberg game of public good provision it always has an incentive to apply a productivity-enhancing technology. Section 3 concludes with a description of the subgame-perfect equilibria in the Nash and in the Stackelberg case. In Sect. 4 we then provide a general condition, which ensures that public good supply in the subgame-perfect equilibrium of the Stackelberg game with the new improved technology in country \( L \) exceeds public good supply in the subgame-perfect equilibrium of the Nash game with the old less productive technology. In that case leadership also makes both countries better off so that the sequential game structure is preferred by both countries over the simultaneous one. In Sect. 5 our general results are illustrated through a Cobb–Douglas example. Section 6 concludes by especially giving some brief hints at empirical applications of our theoretical results.",4

At the beginning, merchants created and used their own web pages both to increase their customer base and to facilitate sales to existing customers. Then, we observed the proliferation of e-commerce companies, web platforms, comparison shopping sites and online auctions through which customers and merchants were able to buy and sell a broad variety of products and services worldwide (e.g., eBay, Amazon, Expedia, PriceGrabber). The next step was to gather consumers. Group buying became a common practice thanks to the extraordinary expansion of Groupon, followed by several other similar websites. Each of these online selling methods has been analyzed in the economics and management literature, in order to understand the reasons of their success or failure, and their impact on market competition and welfare.Footnote 1 However, a key player in this market has been partially neglected, at least by the mainstream theoretical literature: online reviews aggregators and reservation services, (web) aggregators for short.Footnote 2 They started to operate in the second part of 2000s and enjoyed a rapid expansion ever since.Footnote 3 We can distinguish aggregators that are open, such as Booking.com and OpenTable, from those that are closed, such as Relais and Chateaux and Gourmet Society. The latter are exclusive clubs which select their members based on income, education, and social status.Footnote 4 Aggregators also differ in the quality/amount of information they provide to customers. The source of information may be mainly left to consumer reviews (TripAdvisor, OpenTable, Zomato), or it can be a combination of both the aggregator itself and peer reviews (Booking.com, TheFork, RatesToGo, HotelClub). In addition to information, many aggregators offer the possibility to book/purchase when the customer finds the desired product (Booking.com, RatesToGo, HotelClub, OpenTable, Gourmet Society, TheFork, Relais and Chateaux). This service is particularly convenient in the lodging and catering sectors, for it allows to reduce consumer search costs by restricting the database to firms that are available (have a free room or a table) on the required day. Often, consumers who book online enjoy a discount, which could be either imposed by the aggregator or decided by the producer. Discounts are more frequent in closed aggregators. All restaurants that appear on Gourmet Society’s website, for example, have agreed to offer a discount (25% off the total bill). On the contrary, restaurants listed on TheFork are free to decide their discounting policy (about 20–30% offer a lower price to their online clients). Several aggregators, however, prohibit price discrimination. Diners using OpenTable and Zomato, for example, pay the same price as those who do not reserve through the aggregator. The rise of online reviews aggregators is strictly related to the persistence of asymmetric information in markets characterized by experience goods. Starting from the seminal contribution developed by Akerlof (1970), such asymmetries have been widely studied especially for the case of vertically differentiated products. Insurances and warranties are commonly accepted solutions in the market for lemons. However, the same toolkit cannot be easily implemented in the case of horizontally differentiated products, as the perception of quality is subjective. Although firms often advertise characteristics of their products, consumers do not always rely on such a biased source of information. Partial solutions may be the brand reputation in a specific market niche and word-of-mouth. However, these remedies are not very effective in markets with unitary consumption, such as hotels, restaurants, or museums. Our paper delivers a theoretical model to investigate the impact of web aggregators in horizontally differentiated markets with experienced goods. For ease of exposition, through the paper we focus on aggregators that provide information and booking services in the catering sector, and we illustrate our model as a stylized version inspired by OpenTable and TheFork.Footnote 5 They both provide detailed information about different restaurants, including location, type of cuisine, menu, prices, and dining atmosphere. Together with consumer reviews, this information helps the customer to narrow down her search to a few options that best match her tastes. As pointed out earlier, TheFork allows restaurants to offer online discounts, while OpenTable imposes uniform pricing. This leads us to the following questions. When should an aggregator allow price discrimination? How does the choice of a pricing policy affect social welfare? We adopt Salop (1979) circular city model to analyze the equilibrium behavior of consumers, restaurants and a web aggregator. We assume that initially consumers do not know the locations of the restaurants in the product space nor their prices. The restaurants decide whether or not to be listed on the aggregator’s website and set their prices. When a restaurant goes online, its location and price become observable to the consumers that visit the website. Consumers who book a table through the aggregator are called e-users, while those who choose a restaurant in a more traditional way (yellow pages or randomly walking down the street) are called  walkers. The proportion of e-users in the population is exogenously fixed. The main difference between e-users and walkers is that the former have an edge over the latter since they can learn the horizontal characteristics of the restaurants by reading online comments and reviews before consumption takes place. Finally, we assume that the aggregator charges restaurants a fixed fee.Footnote 6 We consider two settings. In the first one the aggregator imposes uniform pricing, while in the second it allows restaurants to price discriminate between walkers and e-users. In both settings, we compute the equilibrium prices, profits, and the number of online restaurants. We show that in equilibrium not all restaurants will go online—some will remain offline. Online restaurants attract more customers than their offline counterparts due to reduced mismatch costs, but they face a tougher price competition. We find that in the first setting (uniform pricing), online restaurants charge a lower price than offline restaurants when the proportion of e-users is sufficiently high. In the second setting (price discrimination), online restaurants set the same price for walkers as offline restaurants, while offering a discount to e-users. Although simple, our model allows us to derive interesting conclusions both from the private and the social standpoints. In particular, the analysis that we carry out brings forth three interesting results. First, for a given number of online restaurants, we find that allowing discounts may hurt the restaurants. Specifically, when the proportion of e-users in the population is relatively low, online restaurants are trapped in the prisoner’s dilemma. Each restaurant has an incentive to offer a discount to capture more e-users; however, as they all offer a discount, the final price may be too low and the restaurants end up losing in comparison to uniform pricing. Second, we calculate how many restaurants will go online in each of the two settings and compare these numbers with what is best for society. (In our theoretical framework, the social optimum is achieved when all restaurants go online.) We show that uniform pricing induces more restaurants to go online when walkers predominate. When e-users predominate, price discrimination yields a higher number of online restaurants. The socially optimal number of online restaurants can always be reached under price discrimination, provided that the fixed online fee is sufficiently low. In the first setting, that of uniform pricing, the first best outcome can only be achieved if the proportion of e-users is relatively low. Third, we evaluate the aggregator’s optimal policy regarding the fee to be charged and whether to impose uniform pricing or to allow discounts for e-users. We find that when the proportion of e-users is relatively high, the aggregator optimally allows discounts and charges a rather high fee, inducing only a few restaurants to go online. A similar situation occurs when the proportion of e-users is intermediate, although the aggregator imposes uniform pricing. Also in this case, the profit-maximizing fee results in less than the socially optimal number of online restaurants. Only when the proportion of e-users is relatively low, the aggregator’s optimal policy—uniform pricing and a low fee—yields the socially optimal outcome. Our analysis therefore reveals that possible negative effects for society are not only caused by the aggregator’s choice of the pricing policy, but also (and mainly) by the amount of the fee it charges the restaurants. Hence, the possible intervention by the policy maker to restore efficiency should carefully consider the interplay between the fee and the pricing policy adopted by the aggregator. The paper is structured as follows. In the next section we review the literature. The model is presented in Sect. 3. The two settings mentioned above are analyzed in Sects. 4 and 5, respectively. In Sect. 6 we report the choice of the aggregator. Concluding remarks appear in Sect. 7.",2

In oligopolies of private firms, price competition is stronger, yielding lower profits and greater welfare than in the case of quantity competition.Footnote 1 Ghosh and Mitra (2010) revisited the comparison between price and quantity competition in a mixed duopoly in which a welfare-maximizing public firm competes against a profit-maximizing private firm.Footnote 2 They showed that price competition yields a larger profit for the private firm and greater welfare than quantity competition. In other words, welfare ranking is common with private duopolies but profit ranking is the opposite. The literature on Cournot–Bertrand comparison in mixed oligopolies has become rich and diverse recently. Haraguchi and Matsumura (2014) showed that Ghosh and Mitra’s (2010) result holds, regardless of the nationality of the private firm. Scrimitore (2014) adopted Matsumura’s (1998) partial privatization approach and considered the optimal degree of privatization. Her findings showed that under optimal privatization policies, Cournot competition could yield higher profits for private firms than under Bertrand competition while welfare ranking is not (Bertrand yields greater welfare). Haraguchi and Matsumura (2016) investigated an oligopoly model and showed that the profit-ranking can be reverted if the number of private firms is large, whereas the welfare-ranking is not. The aforementioned studies, however, assumed that firms play simultaneous-move games. Another strand of the literature related to this study is on Stackelberg mixed oligopolies. The literature on mixed oligopolies contains intense discussions of both public leadership and private leadership models.Footnote 3
Wang and Mukherjee (2012) and Wang and Lee (2013) considered public leadership in a homogeneous product market and showed that the public leadership benefits total social surplus but is less beneficial for consumer welfare than public monopoly.Footnote 4 Gelves and Heywood (2013) found that mergers of public and private firms can improve welfare under public leadership. Pal (1998) showed that welfare is greater in the private leadership game than in the public leadership and simultaneous-move games, and Ino and Matsumura (2010) showed it in a free-entry market. However, all of these studies assumed quantity competition and did not discuss the price–quantity comparison. In this study, we consider two sequential-move games, public leadership and private leadership games, and revisit the price–quantity comparison in mixed duopolies. In private duopolies with sequential moves, Boyer and Moreaux (1987) showed that quantity competition is more profitable and price competition provides higher total welfare, whatever the role (leader, follower). Thus, we can naturally suppose that in mixed duopolies, the two sequential-move games also provide the same welfare and profit ranking. This supposition is, however, not correct. The two sequential-move games provide the same profit ranking as the simultaneous-move game, but the private leadership game yields a different welfare ranking from that of the simultaneous-move and public leadership games.Footnote 5 First, we analyze a model in which the private (public) firm is the leader (follower). In the context of mixed oligopolies, the public firm’s acceptance of the follower role often improves welfare (Pal 1998; Matsumura 2003a; Ino and Matsumura 2010; Matsumura and Ogawa 2017). Many stated that the public firm should play a complementary role to private firms, and the role of follower is adequate from this viewpoint. In this study, we show that when the public firm is the follower, quantity competition is stronger than price competition, resulting in a smaller profit for the private firm. This result is in accordance with that in the simultaneous-move game. However, the welfare ranking can be reversed. When the private firm is domestic (foreign), quantity (price) competition yields greater welfare than price (quantity) competition. In other words, the welfare ranking is crucially dependent on the nationality of the private firm.Footnote 6 Next, we analyze a model in which the public (private) firm is the leader (follower). We find the same profit and welfare rankings as in the simultaneous-move game, that is, price competition yields a higher profit for the private firm and greater welfare, regardless of the nationality of the private firm. We then introduce the nonnegative profit constraint for the public firm. The literature on mixed oligopolies shows that the public firm’s welfare-maximizing behavior may yield negative profits for the public firm.Footnote 7 However, as Estrin and de Meza (1995), Ishida and Matsushima (2009), and Wang and Tomaru (2015) discussed, we often observe that the nonnegative profit constraint is imposed on public firms. We find that the welfare and profit ranking remains unchanged under public leadership. By contrast, under private leadership, the nonnegative profit constraint affects the welfare ranking. This constraint improves welfare with quantity competition, while welfare remains unchanged with price competition. As a result, quantity competition more likely yields greater welfare than price competition. Finally, we discuss the endogenous competition structure (endogenous price-quantity choice) as discussed by Singh and Vives (1984). They formulated a two-stage game. In the first stage, each firm simultaneously chooses a price or quantity contract. In the second stage, after observing the rival’s choice in the first stage, each firm simultaneously chooses price or quantity according to the first stage choice. They investigated a private duopoly and showed that both firms choose the quantity contract. Cournot competition therefore appears in equilibrium. Matsumura and Ogawa (2012) investigated this endogenous competition structure in a mixed duopoly and showed that both firms choose the price contract. Bertrand competition therefore appears in equilibrium.Footnote 8 We investigate this problem in public and private leadership games.Footnote 9 We consider two timelines: one where two firms simultaneously choose a price or quantity contract before facing Stackelberg competition, and the other in which the leader chooses between price or quantity first, before the follower chooses after observing the leader’s price or quantity. We find that in both timelines, under both public and private leadership, price competition appears in equilibrium, regardless of whether quantity or price competition yields greater welfare. This indicates that equilibrium competition structure can be inefficient under private leadership.",13

In a dynamic labor market, our attention is centered on the progressive expansion or contraction of the set of workers employed within the firm and the evolution of the wage they earn. The dynamic aspects of the interaction between the firm and the union are based on the existence of adjustment costs, that is, on how the firm’s profits and the union’s welfare are affected when new employees are hired or existing workers are fired. We use the term adjustment costs in concordance with the literature. However, these costs will be positive when firing occurs but will be typically negative when hiring occurs. Adjustment costs are crucial in determining the speed of convergence, as well as determining the steady-state equilibrium of both employment and wages. We introduce two considerations which drive the dynamics of the collective bargaining process and which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously addressed by the literature. First, on the firm’s side, the conventional adjustment costs, exclusively dependent on the number of hired or fired employees, are extended by assuming that these costs also depend on the prevailing wage. Thus, we define a two-part adjustment cost for the firm. Second, we also assume that the entrance of new employees and the layoff of current employees also affect the union’s welfare and its behavior. We model a full-coverage industrial relations system in which all workers are affected by the union’s decisions about wage.Footnote 1 Thus, workers benefit from the union’s achievements regardless of whether they are members or not. Or put differently, the union represents members and non-members identically. These are habitual industrial/labor relations in some countries in Continental Europe.Footnote 2 The model developed in this paper could be included within the insider-outsider literature from a broad perspective. Some previous works model collective bargaining within an insider-outsider theoretical setting from a static standpoint. An excellent example of this literature is Holden (1990). Our work, on the other hand, contributes to the dynamic insider-outsider literature which can be dated back to Solow (1985), and which has produced interesting theoretical models such as Drazen and Gottfries (1990), Huizinga and Schiantarelli (1992), Fukuda and Owen (2008) and, more recently, Galí (2016), for example. The four central assumptions on which an insider-outsider model rests, (Lindbeck and Snower 2001) are fulfilled: “(1) Firms face labor turnover costs that they cannot entirely pass on to their employees. (2) Insiders have some market power. (3) If entrants remain with a firm long enough, they become associated with the same labor turnover costs as the insiders, and have an opportunity to renegotiate their wage. (4) Employment decisions are made unilaterally by the firms”. The bargaining process presented in this work shares these four main characteristics of insider-outsider models and seeks to describe the functioning of several European labor markets with large rates of union coverage. In summary, in this paper we model the bargaining process between a trade union and a representative firm in a dynamic labor market. The dynamics stem from the adjustment costs for the firm and the trade union associated with hiring and firing decisions. The equilibrium concept considered in the paper is a partial steady-state equilibrium in which aggregate supply-side forces (i.e. labor supply and labor demand interactions) drive the allocations of wages and employment.Footnote 3 The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The second section discusses and introduces, in an informal way, the adjustment costs for the firm and the union that we claim play an important role in the bargaining process, and places them within the existing literature on collective bargaining. The formal model is built in the third section. The fourth section analyzes the baseline scenario with instantaneous adjustment, and two intermediate scenarios with adjustment costs only for the union or only for the firm. The general Stackelberg game with adjustment costs for both players is solved in the fifth section, which also presents a sensitivity analysis of the main parameters describing these costs. The sixth section presents a broader approach in which hiring and firing decisions are taken separately, which opens up the possibility that hiring and firing occur simultaneously. Conclusions are presented in the seventh and final section.",5

In a study for the Social Science Research Council, Arum et al. (2011) find that 36% of U.S. college students learn very little after 4 years. One economist (Caplan 2011) recently argued that little is learned in college, higher education is essentially a signal, and welfare would increase if students spent fewer years in school.Footnote 1 One problem for the signaling hypothesis is that potentially cheaper screening mechanisms should exist. Gary Becker suggested “Surely a year on the job or a systematic interview and applicant-testing program must be a much cheaper and effective way to screen.”Footnote 2 However, in the European Union, applicant test responses are personal data, and some countries (Greece and France in particular) make employment tests difficult (Perritt 2008). In the U.S., limits to the use of applicant testing are the U.S. Supreme Court decision Griggs v. Duke Power (1971) and subsequent court rulings and legislation. O’Keefe and Vedder (2008) argue that employers now focus on very narrow subjects directly related to jobs in applicant testing. After Griggs there has been less use of general aptitude and intelligence tests that might help employers determine an individual’s ability to learn and advance at a firm. O’Keefe and Vedder suggest that educational signaling has substituted for employment testing since nothing prevents individuals from obtaining educational credentials to try to demonstrate ability to firms.Footnote 3 Assuming that signaling occurs, I will address two issues. First, who (if anyone) over-invests in education when it is a signal? The typical signalingFootnote 4 model (Spence 1974a; Riley 2001, for example) implies that more able individuals over-invest in education in order to sort themselves from those who are less able. Although such an argument might explain more individuals receiving, for example, an MBA in order to sort themselves, the recent significant increase in undergraduate enrollment in the U.S. cannot have come from the more able unless relatively few of them previously enrolled in college. From 1995 to 2010, the 18–24 year old population in the U.S. increased from 24.28 to 27.16 million, a 12% increase.Footnote 5 Yet the number enrolled in college in that period rose from 14.26 to 21.02 million, a 47% increase.Footnote 6 As will be demonstrated, this large increase in undergraduate enrollment is consistent with the idea that relatively low ability individuals may over-invest in education in order to distinguish themselves from those with even lower ability.
 Second, and the main focus herein, is whether signaling may improve welfare by allowing individuals to be allocated to jobs where they are most productive. Kenneth Arrow was asked about education being wasteful in the signaling model. Arrow responded “It permits the sorting. That in itself may be socially gainful. And Spence’s model in its form doesn’t fully convey all its implications. It implies that an individual will be productive no matter what.”Footnote 7 In this paper, I add to the formal analysis of the sorting effect of educational signaling.Footnote 8 I develop a theoretical model that avoids the argument about how much education increases human capital/productivity by generally assuming there is no direct effect of education on productivity. I make such an assumption in order to consider if education can increase welfare by sorting individuals to jobs. Later (Sect. 5) I allow for the possibility that education increases human capital. Thus, the main contribution of this paper is to add to the literature on the welfare effects of educational signaling when the social gain from education is that it allows for an improved sorting of individuals between jobs. I assume there may be a social gain from education as a signal in that it allows individuals to be sorted to jobs where their productivity is the highest. Signaling models generally ignore the sorting gain from education and assume a continuous signal. Such models have either a few types of individuals in terms of ability (typically two) or a continuum of individual ability. In those models, an individual of one ability type may be perfectly identified via signaling. In contrast, I assume a continuum of ability, with individuals getting either zero education (beyond some level assumed to already be attained by all) or one additional level of education. Thus, different ability types attain the same education level—zero or the additional level. The truth lies somewhere between the usual assumption that one can be perfectly identified and my assumption of many ability types getting the same level of education. The question is which assumption fits the evidence. The number enrolling in college increasing much faster than the school age population is consistent with the hypothesis that those in the lower ability range of college matriculants try to distinguish themselves from those who are even less able, which occurs with a discrete level of education.Footnote 9 One result I find, which does not appear to have been previously considered, is that signaling may increase welfare—relative to a world with no signaling—but be socially excessive relative to the number who should signal to maximize welfare. The outline of the rest of this paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, I compare my approach to other signaling models. My model is developed in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, I consider numerical examples to see when welfare increases with signaling. The possibility that education increases human capital is considered in Sects. 5, and 6 contains a summary.",3

In this study, we focus on the endogeneity of time preference and consumption externalities as one such mechanism that yields multiple equilibria under globalization. Specifically, we develop a two-sector dynamic Heckscher–Ohlin–Samuelson (HOS) model of international trade à la Oniki and Uzawa (1965) with consumption externalities in a representative household’s instantaneous utility, and endogenous time preference in which the household’s discount rate is dependent on its consumption. Using this model, we show that a small open economy might reveal multiple steady states and indeterminacy of equilibrium paths. Since the pioneering work of Benhabib and Farmer (1994), dynamic general equilibrium models that display indeterminacy have been extensively examined. The driving force that causes indeterminacy in most of the studies, including applications to dynamic open-economy models (Weder 2001; Nishimura and Shimomura 2002a, b; Bian and Meng 2004; Meng and Velasco 2004), is intra- or inter-sectoral production externalities. By contrast, consumption externalities as a source of indeterminacy have received little attention in the literature, with a few exceptions. Meng (2006) developed a one-sector model with individual agents’ time preference depending on the economy-wide average consumption and average income, and showed that local indeterminacy could arise if the rate of time preference increases with average consumption and decreases with average income.Footnote 2 Chen and Hsu (2007) introduced consumption externality into households’ instantaneous utility function in a one-sector neoclassical growth model with endogenous time preference, and showed that if the instantaneous utility is increasing in consumption externality (i.e., if individuals feel admiration) and if the individual’s rate of time preference is decreasing in his/her own consumption, indeterminacy might arise. Alonso-Carrera et al. (2008) and Chen et al. (2012) showed that consumption externalities can be a source of equilibrium indeterminacy in a model with endogenous labor supply. Chen et al. (2015) showed that in a two-sector model, even without a labor–leisure trade-off, consumption spillovers lead to an inefficient allocation in a steady state and indeterminacy of equilibrium paths. These studies considered closed-economy models; to the best of our knowledge, there have been no attempts to derive indeterminacy with consumption externalities in open-economy settings. Therefore, our study is the first to analyze an open-economy model displaying indeterminacy of equilibrium caused by consumption externalities even in the absence of production externalities. Among a wide variety of dynamic open-economy models, we consider a standard two-factor two-good HOS model of international trade with capital accumulation. A prototype model was developed by Oniki and Uzawa (1965), in which a pure consumption good and a pure investment good are produced by employing labor and capital, and was analyzed by Stiglitz (1970), Baxter (1992), and Chen (1992). These studies have shown that the optimal-growth version of the Oniki–Uzawa model has the following extreme features: (i) in the steady state, a small open economy is likely to specialize completely in one good; (ii) long-run equilibria with diversified production are not unique; and (iii) there are no transition dynamics for long-run equilibria with diversified production.Footnote 3 The reason for these results is that in the steady state, the rate of return to capital must be equal to the rate of time preference, which can be attained by chance for a small open economy if the rate of time preference is an exogenous variable and if the economy produces both goods, wherein the factor prices are completely dependent on world commodity prices. 
Nishimura and Shimomura (2002b) and Karasawa (2007) showed that by introducing an endogenous time preference developed by Uzawa (1968) and further elaborated by Epstein (1987) and Obstfeld (1990), even a small open HOS economy can diversify production in the long run and there exist transition dynamics toward the long-run equilibrium.Footnote 4 In addition, Nishimura and Shimomura (2002b) assumed externalities on the production side and demonstrated the possibility that the dynamic equilibrium path exhibits indeterminacy. In this study, we do not assume such externalities on the production side; instead, we assume consumption externalities in which households’ utility not only depends on their individual consumption but also on the economy’s average consumption.Footnote 5 In addition, in order to obtain the long-run diversified production and the existence of transition dynamics, we assume endogenous discounting, as in Nishimura and Shimomura (2002b). Therefore, our study is an extension of the one-sector, closed-economy model with endogenous discounting and consumption externalities analyzed by Chen and Hsu (2007) to a two-sector, open-economy model. We show that a unique steady-state equilibrium exists under autarky, which is saddle-point stable; that is, indeterminacy of equilibrium does not occur under autarky.Footnote 6 Nevertheless, we can show that if the economy is open to international trade, there might be multiple steady states and indeterminacy of equilibrium paths might occur. Specifically, we obtain the following results on the properties of the dynamic equilibrium of a small open economy. If individuals’ time preference exhibits increasing marginal impatience, the steady state of a small open economy exhibits uniqueness and saddle-point stability, irrespective whether the economy is completely or incompletely specialized. However, in the case of decreasing marginal impatience, we might have multiple steady states: some with complete specialization and the rest with diversified production. Moreover, the long-run equilibrium with diversified production can be locally indeterminate if the individuals’ preferences exhibit admiration and there is a large degree of decreasing marginal impatience. These findings could serve as rationale for globalization of economic activities that could be a source of disparities in development patterns across countries. In addition, we examine the effects of a change in the economy’s terms of trade on the steady-state solutions of the economy, and discuss their relationship to the uniqueness and stability of the steady state. We observe that the comparative steady-state effects are dependent on whether the marginal impatience is increasing or decreasing. This result suggests that the economy’s trade pattern can be reversed depending on whether the dynamic equilibrium exhibits saddle-point stability or indeterminacy.Footnote 7 The result also suggests that, in the case of multiple steady states, whether the economy specializes in one good or diversifies production in the long run depends on the conditions related to indeterminacy. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 present the model and derive the optimality conditions, respectively. In Sect. 4, we characterize the dynamic general equilibrium of the economy under autarky. In Sect. 5, we characterize the dynamic general equilibrium of the small open economy. In Sect. 6, we discuss the economy’s long-run trade pattern and its relationship to indeterminacy. Section 7 concludes.",1

However, countless lab and field experiments in economics showed that self-interest approach may not be sufficient in explaining all of the observed behavior.Footnote 1 Moreover, these experiments highlighted the fact that many people have other-regarding preferences, and concern for another’s situation is a motivating factor in most people’s decision-making processes. Supporting the experiments, many theoretical papers showed that this behavior can be presented in a tractable way. We also follow this path and investigate how other-regarding preferences shape the optimal collusion-proof contract in the principal–supervisor–agent hierarchy. We show that the possibility of collusion between employees and wage payments in an optimal contract depend on the degree of social preferences. Moreover, the role of collusion can be ignored in an organization if the supervisor’s degree of inequity aversion is above a certain threshold. Collusive behavior is not a rare event in organizations. The fact that several layers of people interact with one another puts an emphasis on group gains as well as individual gains which open a way to forming coalitions among different parties. Hence, hierarchy design for an organization must consider the possibility of corruptive activities and aim to prevent them beforehand. To present a way to construct this kind of design, in his seminal work, Tirole (1986) puts sociological studies on corruption in hierarchies into a formal theoretical model by adding a supervisor layer between the standard principal–agent network. Although he acknowledges the fact that interaction between the supervisor and the agent affects the shape of their relationship, he still prefers to use self-interested parties in his theoretical framework. The literature in the standard principal–agent contract theory also uses the assumption of self-interest. However, several papers have used the theories of social preferences in the principal–agent theoretical framework.Footnote 2 On the other hand, these models have not been widely affiliated with the collusive behavior and optimal contracts in a three-level hierarchy, though Tirole (1986), for example, considers this type of hierarchies as a network of standard two-tier contracts. We provide a theoretical framework to complement empirical studies on how social preferences in an organization affect collusion and behavior of the parties and hence optimal contract design. Several empirical studies [e.g., Blinder and Choi (1990), Agell and Lundborg (1995), Campbell and Kamlani (1997), Bewley (2002) and Gartenberg and Wulf (2017)] report that employees in an organization not only care about their own well-being but also take the well-being of their co-workers into consideration, and managers design contracts that avoid too much internal inequality. Pepper and Gore (2015) argue that an employee of an organization may take the compensation (rewards) of her peers, immediate subordinates or immediate superiors as a reference for her own rewards and compensation. Hence, it appears essential to apply other-regarding preferences into hierarchical models. By incorporating other-regarding preferences, it is possible to gain further and more realistic insights about collusive behavior and optimal contracts. The first objective of this paper is to introduce other-regarding preferences for the supervisor and the agent and investigate its effect on the collusive behavior. The second one is to explore the changes in the optimal collusion-proof contract parameters: (i) effort levels exerted by the agent; and (ii) wages. We choose to use Fehr and Schmidt (1999) type of other-regarding utility function since it is simple, powerful and can easily be applied to the principal–supervisor–agent hierarchy. We investigate the case in which the supervisor is either inequity averse or status seeker, and the agent is only inequity averse since we assume that the agent’s wage is always lower than the wage of the supervisor. The main observation is that introducing other-regarding preferences changes the amount that a briber has to pay in order to persuade the other party and also the amount that she can pay at most if she wants to form a coalition. The components of contracts (especially effort exerted by the agent) also change with other-regarding preferences. Though the ranking of both agent’s and supervisor’s utilities at different states does not differ from Tirole’s (1986) model, wages and dispersion among wages at different states vary due to changes in collusion constraints shaped by social preferences. Furthermore, we find that inequity aversion results in wage contraction between layers of the hierarchy. Lastly, depending on the degree of social preferences, the principal can escape from the burden of preventing collusion between employees since the net benefit of collusion can be negative for employees with other-regarding preferences. The next section introduces our model, which is basically Tirole’s (1986) model with Fehr and Schmidt (1999) type of other-regarding preferences. Afterward, we analyze the principal’s problem and investigate the structure of collusion-proof contracts when both supervisor and agent have other-regarding preferences. Section 3 contains our main results. We conclude the paper with a discussion and open questions for future research. All proofs are relegated to the “Appendix”.",1

To answer this question seems extraneous because when ever production is costly, production will equal sales in equilibrium. Maybe for that reason the variable y in economic models typically is used for both, production and sales. The output y affects revenues—i.e. y refers to what a firm sells—and costs—i.e. y refers to what a firm produces. The firm’s optimization problem is to choose y such that profits are maximized. Key to understand, however, is that this treatment of sales and production in economic models effectively treats them as an identity.Footnote 1 But of course it is a fact that firms have always the option of not selling the entire stock of produced output, even then when the unsold output perishes and becomes useless and production costs cannot be recovered. Thus, in practice to sell and produce are two distinct choices. If x denotes sales and y production, then we have that \(x\le y\), when ignoring the case in which output is sold before it is produced.Footnote 2 Clearly, if the production of output is costly, then profit-seeking firms in equilibrium will not produce more than what they sell. Thus, in equilibrium we get \(x^*=y^*\), or in words: “sales equals production.” However, this is not an identity; this is an equilibrium outcome. The paper shows that this distinction matters when production is sequential because of off-equilibrium path behavior. There will be situations where firms will not sell all of their produced output. What matters is how much firms can credibly commit to sell. Thus, firms produce what they sell and not the other way around. We will show that this observation, in fact, affects the analysis of the standard oligopoly game in quantities with sequential production (Stackelberg competition). When the notion “sales equals production” is no longer treated as an identity, then the production and sales decision have to be modelled as two separate decisions. In this paper, we do this for the standard oligopoly game in quantities with sequential production (Stackelberg game). We add “sales” as a third stage to the standard textbook Stackelberg game, studying a setting where firm 1 produces first, firm 2 produces second, and then both firms simultaneously decide on sales given the produced output. We emphasize that this is the appropriate setup to study an oligopoly with sequential production because firms can always choose to sell only a fraction of total production. We want to emphasize at the outset that the assumption of “sequential production” does not necessarily need to be taken literally – that is in terms of elapsed calendar time. Instead “sequentiality” can be interpreted as an assumption about the leader’s ability to strategically use the follower’s best-response function or an assumption about the information structure of the game with the follower having perfect information about the leader’s production decision. These interpretations go well with the justification for the Stackelberg model proposed by Cabral (2017), which states that this model “is appropriate for situations when there is a natural asymmetry between firms, so that one acts as a natural ‘market leader.”’ In addition, models of endogenous sequencing provide additional support for the relevance of this setup. For example, Mailath (1993) and Normann (1997) show that the Stackelberg setup emerges endogenously in a situation of incomplete information even then when simultaneous-move Cournot–Nash equilibria can be achieved and may be preferred by the leader.Footnote 3 The paper shows that the regular Stackelberg outcome may no longer emerge as a Subgame-Perfect Equilibrium (SPE) in this three-stage setting. In the standard game, the first mover effect consists in the increased revenue the first mover can obtain because increasing its own output not only lowers the price but also indirectly increases it by lowering the follower’s output choice. However, we show that this first mover revenue effect cannot be higher than marginal cost. In other words, moving first does not per se produce a strategic advantage, it is only first moves that are sufficiently costly that produce this advantage. We find this result very intuitive. This implies that with costless production, there is no first mover advantage from producing first. In this case, we obtain the standard Cournot–Nash outcome in our setup. This is of course contrary to the standard textbook analysis where moving first always produces an advantage no matter how costly those moves are. Julien (2011) shows that the leader has an advantage in such a setting if the best-response function of the follower is decreasing in the choice of the opponent, which is the case in the standard model and in the one proposed here. That a first mover advantage can evaporate when first moves are costless has been shown in the context of investments as a mechanism of entry deterrence (e.g. Dixit 1980; Ware 1984). In the setting there, firms sequentially choose production capacity before they simultaneously produce (and sell) their output on the market. The analysis in these two papers shows that if the investment in capacity is costless (i.e. no sunk costs), the first mover has no strategic advantage. Here, we show that this insight holds more generally, namely then when production and sales are no longer treated as an identity in standard economic models with sequential choices, which includes the standard Stackelberg game. Another difference is that we refrain from using specific functional forms, which yields insights into what exactly drives the result. This paper relates also to the literature on capacity constrained price games—Bertrand competition with capacity constraints (e.g Kreps and Scheinkman 1983; Davidson and Deneckere 1986; Hviid 1990). There, firms simultaneously decide on the production of capacity before selling and producing on the market using Bertrand-price competition. Similar than in the model here, capacity/production will not be left idle in equilibrium and firms will choose Cournot capacity/output and prices in the unique pure strategy equilibrium Kreps and Scheinkman 1983.Footnote 4 We have a coincidence between capacity, production, and sales similar than in the model analyzed here. The difference is that here the production decision is sequential thereby shedding light onto what drives the first mover advantage in such games. Sequentiality and the asymmetry introduced in this way plays no role in Kreps and Scheinkman (1983) and the related literature. Also, here competition is in quantities whereas there, competition is in prices (constraint by capacity/quantity). Finally, this paper also relates to articles by Saloner (1987) and Pal (1991). Both analyze a setting where firms decide on production in two stages. However, in the setting there firms can only increase production in the second stage but not reduce it. In the setup here, selling only some of total production is equivalent to reducing production in the second stage in their setup. We want to emphasis that it is appropriate to study the setting proposed here as it is a fact that firms can always choose to sell only a fraction of the produced output; production and sales are two separate decisions.",1
126.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,28 May 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-018-0616-2,On competition and welfare enhancing policies in a mixed oligopoly,April 2019,Marc Escrihuela-Villar,Carlos Gutiérrez-Hita,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Public or at least to some extent state-owned firms are very common in many markets such as airlines, telecommunications, railways, electricity, banking, broadcasting, and education. Consequently, the literature on mixed oligopolies where a public or semi-public firm competes against one or more private profit-maximizing firms is also extensive. Many papers have also examined mixed oligopolies considering whether privatization or subsidization is optimal. Classical examples include De Fraja and Delbono (1989, 1990) and ensuing literature showing that, with symmetric convex cost functions, in some cases, a public firm should be privatized and should maximize profits rather than welfare. The intuition is that privatization might increase welfare since with a large number of private firms the public firm must produce a very high level of output, driving private profits to a very low level. More recently, Matsumura and Kanda (2005) have shown that while partial privatization might be the optimal policy in the short-run, full nationalization becomes optimal in the long-run only with free entry among private firms. With respect to the effects of subsidization, one line of research has shown that there are no consequences from privatization of a public firm whenever a subsidy ensures the first-best allocation. For instance, White (1996) shows that in a Cournot setting both in the private and in the mixed oligopoly, the optimal subsidy is identical. This has often been referred to as the privatization neutrality theorem. Another line of research, however, has derived a non-neutral result of privatization. For instance, Matsumura and Tomaru (2012, 2013) have respectively shown that privatization neutrality does not hold if there are foreign competitors or when an excess burden of taxation is introduced. However, previous studies on policy issues in mixed oligopolies have ignored the effects of the capacity of the regulator to assess the competitive (or collusive) reaction of private firms to the policy measures.Footnote 1 More precisely, little attention has been paid to investigate the question of how the timing of policy measures affects the degree of competition, the policy outcomes as well as welfare in a mixed oligopoly. Among the few exceptions are the recent papers by Matsumura and Okamura (2015) and Lee et al. (2018) with which the present work is most closely related. In the first work, the authors introduce an interdependent payoff structure into a mixed oligopoly assuming that firms consider their own and other firms’ profits. It is basically obtained that the optimal degree of privatization is higher when there is less market competition. On the other hand, Lee et al. (2018) uses a model of mixed oligopolies with free-entry where private firms enter the market, and then the government chooses the degree of privatization of the public firm to show that the timing of privatization affects the equilibrium degree of privatization according to whether private firms are domestic or foreign. This assumption differs from that employed in the papers cited above where privatization policies are set before the entries of private firms. As argued by Lee and coauthors, this consideration is important because even if the government partially privatizes a public firm before opening up the market, the government may be unable to commit to a privatization policy before private firms enter the market or determine their outputs.Footnote 2 There are, however, some important differences between the present paper and above-mentioned papers. To begin with, Matsumura and Okamura consider that privatization always takes place after the competitiveness of the market is determined. Consequently, they do not analyze which is the effect of the timing of decisions. On the other hand, Lee and coauthors restrict their attention to Cournot competition ignoring, therefore, the effects of (or on) the intensity of market competition. Moreover, these papers do not consider either the output subsidization. Summarizing, the main goal of the present article is precisely to study the optimal government intervention contrasting two different regulatory timings; a Social Planner (hereafter, SP) that does not consider that a policy measure applied might affect market competition (namely, decides after the degree of market competition is set), and a SP that is able to anticipate that the degree of market competition depends on the policy measure implemented and, therefore, the policy measures are implemented before competition among private firms takes place. To that extent, we firstly develop as a benchmark model a mixed oligopoly where private firms simultaneously compete in quantities with a relatively more inefficient and partially welfare-maximizing public firm. Additionally, and following (among many others) Matsumura and Okamura (2015), we introduce an interdependent payoff structure assuming that private firms maximize the sum of their own profits and a fraction of the other private firms’ profits.Footnote 3 As a consequence, this fraction may be considered as the degree of competition which implies that firms can agree on a distribution of the output quotas different to that arising from a perfect joint profit maximization agreement. The present model is mathematically equivalent to a model of standard strategic delegation in which in the first stage, profit-maximizing firms make a commitment not to maximize their own profits while in the second stage, these firms face Cournot competition. The literature on the delegation game is quite extensive (see, for instance, Fershtman 1985, or Vickers 1985 and subsequent contributions) and has reached consensus on the fact that players who care not only about their own payoffs but also about their payoffs relative to others earn strictly higher payoffs than do the standard payoff maximizers.Footnote 4 Accordingly, we obtain that private firms always prefer a larger output than the joint profit-maximizing level which can also be interpreted as collusion profitability being limited by the output expansion of the public firm intended to maximize welfare. Secondly, we also analyze whether the welfare may be enhanced by using an optimal privatization scheme or by subsidizing production contingent on the cost inefficiency of the public firm. Our most important result is that the success of the policy implemented and consequently also the level of welfare depends on the timing of the policy. We show that privatization incentives are generally larger if a SP privatizes before the private firms determine the degree of competition since, in this case, the SP is aware of the fact that by keeping a larger amount of shares in a partially privatized firm, private firms voluntarily reduce the degree of imperfect collusion.Footnote 5 On the other hand, if the regulator incorporates a production subsidy after the degree of competition is set, the private sector benefits from a high subsidy and achieves perfect collusion. In this case, the government incurs a higher expenditure. On the contrary, a SP subsidizing before market competition offers a lower subsidy reducing, therefore, firms’ incentives to reduce competition and yielding higher welfare. The results of the present paper thus prove useful to highlight that in a plausible scenario of imperfect competition among private firms, the welfare effects of a policy measure depend on the capacity of the regulator to assess not only the current but also the subsequent level of market competition.Footnote 6 Although we focus on a mixed oligopoly from a theoretical viewpoint, our paper is also motivated by some real cases. Mixed public–private firms are increasingly used in several European countries and regulators make use of mixed firms following cost considerations or financial constraints. Some empirical studies have also analyzed how weak competition makes it difficult for local governments to obtain benefits from contracting out. For instance, in the Netherlands, Dijkgraaf and Gradus (2007) investigate whether collusion exists and what the impact is on tariffs for waste collection. Their results indicate the existence of collusion between private firms and that the presence of competing public firms might be essential to ensure more and fair competition. The electricity market also provides several interesting examples; in the 90’s United States, Chile, and other countries within EU (Great Britain, Spain, Germany, among others) begin to implement reforms aimed to privatize and restructure the electric power industry. Several authors have found that wholesale prices increased well above marginal cost and that some degree of collusion could be observed in the market. For instance, Wolfram (1999) presents an empirical study of market power in the British electricity industry or Borenstein and Bushnell (1999) analyze how the wave of liberalization and restructuring in the US electricity market has modified the incentives to exert horizontal market power. The Spanish power electricity market is analyzed by Fabra and Toro (2005) where it is found that the post-privatization performance of this market is not consistent with the predictions of models of individual profit-maximizing behavior. Despite the trend toward economic liberalization and privatization of public firms, we can observe that some governments still hold a large share in public firms and that privatization has often occurred gradually over recent decades (see, for instance, Lee 2006). Consequently, studying how the timing of the policies affects the market outcomes may provide new insight into the optimality of privatization and output subsidization. For instance, an interesting World Bank policy research report (see World Bank 1995) argued that the historical evidence on the timing of reforms shows that the degree of political intervention depends on the opportunity cost of the public firms’ inefficiency which, in turn, also depends on the actual and potential market competition. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the imperfectly collusive market in the presence of a public firm. Section 3 presents two different policy measures in order to enhance the welfare and compares two different timings. Section 4 presents an extension of the model showing that, if we allow for multiple public firms, a sufficiently high number of public firms makes collusion among private firms unprofitable.

We find that this taxation always leads to welfare improvement in the long run and a condition is derived when it is welfare-improving for transitional generations, implying that a Pareto-improving reform is possible. This condition is similar to the dynamic inefficiency property, usual in the overlapping generations (OLG) models. We show that an increase in longevity positively affects the optimal tax rate to be levied on the investment-goods sector, and permits the government to institute welfare-improving taxation. Furthermore, the larger the output elasticities of capital, the smaller the optimal tax on labour income in the investment-goods sector. Changes in fertility rates do not affect optimal taxation in the long run. In many types of models, conditions, which give rise to optimal capital–labor ratios in equilibrium have a name of the “Golden Rule”. In an OLG framework, two types of deviations from the golden rules are possible: if capital–labour ratios are higher than optimal in the equilibrium, the equilibrium is said to be ‘dynamically inefficient’ because Pareto-improving policies can be implemented. If capital–labour ratios are lower than the optimal level, the corresponding equilibrium is said to be dynamically efficient, because such Pareto-improving policies are impossible. In fact, under a dynamically efficient equilibrium, a properly designed reform may lead to welfare improvement in the long run, but, one or a few transitional generations are worse off (Diamond 1965; Galor and Ryder 1991). The Golden Rule does not always hold in OLG models, because individuals, which make savings–consumption decisions, consider macroeconomic factors as given. They do not take into account that their savings may have an effect on the total capital amount in the economy. As a result, capital–labour ratios may deviate from the optimal level, determined by the Golden Rule. In a two-sector model, with consumption and investment goods sectors, agents’ savings/consumption decisions determine demand for consumption and investment goods, their relative price and, therefore, production factor allocation between the sectors. Previous works considered a number of public policies in the OLG framework, which improve welfare in the long run. Most of such policies affect intergenerational reallocation of resources. For example, Aaron (1966), Breyer (1989) and Verbon (1989) studied in detail optimal pension system designs. Cremers (2006) considered consumption taxes and investment subsidies. So, in her model, consumptions of both young and old agents are taxed, but only young agents receive a subsidy for investment. A two-sector OLG model gives a possibility for ‘intragenerational’ policies, when taxes levied on agents working in one sector are returned back to the economy as a subsidy to agents working in another sector. The other option is to tax and subsidize returns to capital in the sectors. Such policies redistribute resources within the same generation but, under the assumption of perfect factor mobility between the sectors, may also lead to welfare improvement. In this paper, we focus on such an asymmetric labour taxation. Capital taxes and value-added taxes (VAT) are considered in the appendix. The advantage of ‘intragenerational’ policies over ‘intergenerational’ is that intergenerational reallocation of resources usually leads to a very complicated bargaining process among generations, some of which may even not exist at the time of policy reforms. The presence of ethical commitments among generations also plays a role. At the same time, reallocation of resources within the same generation is a much simpler process from the political perspective (Anderson 2013). On the other hand, the advantage of intergenerational policies is that they can contribute to the risk-sharing between generations (see Gordon and Varian 1988; Gollier 2008; Andersen 2014 for example). An example of an asymmetric labour taxation can be various tax allowances and exemptions for personal income tax (PIT) in agriculture. According to the Euromod country reports 2009–2013, such allowances and exemptions exist in Bulgaria, Germany and Luxemburg. In Ireland, PIT exemptions exist for writers, composers, visual artists and sculptors. Sector specific VAT are even more common. For example, sector-specific VAT rates are applied in Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France and many other countries. For simplicity, we derive expressions for optimal taxes and subsidies in a two-period OLG framework under assumptions of a logarithmic utility function and Cobb–Douglas production functions. Despite of the lack of generality, we show that such ‘intragenerational’ welfare-improving policies are possible. We expect that similar policies can also exist in a more general framework, but they depend on the parameters of the generalised production and utility functions. This paper is organized as follows: In the next section literature is discussed. Section 3 develops the model and discusses its basic properties. In Sect. 4 a condition for optimal taxation is derived. Section 5 presents a numerical example. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",

Then, how much public debt can the government issue? When it rolls over public debt successively, the level of public debt may exceed total savings at a certain point in time; thereafter, sovereign default occurs. Public debt or the primary deficit is said to be sustainable as long as sovereign default does not occur in finite time under the current policy. The literature on the sustainability of public debt is extensive. As Tirole (1985) implies,Footnote 2\(^{,}\)Footnote 3 the overlapping generations (OLG) model developed by Diamond (1965), without any policy alternatives, allows for public debt sustainability if the long-run growth rate without public debt is higher than the interest rate. That is, dynamic inefficiency is a necessary condition for the public debt/production ratio to asymptotically converge to zero (hereafter, we call this condition Tirole’s debt-existing condition). Chalk (2000) showed that a positive primary deficit in the OLG model is sustainable when it is sufficiently low and dynamically inefficient. In terms of endogenous growth, Bräuninger (2005) showed, using an OLG model with AK production and constant government spending/GDP and primary deficit/GDP ratios, that public debt is sustainable with a low primary deficit/GDP ratio. Following Barro (1990), Arai (2011) considered the sustainability of public debt using an OLG model in which the government engages in productive public spending. The spending was a flow-variable and his model resulted in an AK model. In his model, it was shown that public debt is sustainable when the government spending/production ratio is moderate. Further, Yakita (2008) investigated the sustainability of public debt with public capital, as did Futagami et al. (1993) with the constant budget deficit/production ratio in the OLG model, and showed that the threshold of initial public debt for the policy to be sustainable increases with initial public capital. On the other hand, since Uzawa (1965) and Lucas (1988) published their papers, both physical and human capital accumulation have been considered crucial for the growth engine. To examine the sustainability of public debt, therefore, we must use a two-sector endogenous growth model in which both physical and human capital accumulation exist. What comes to mind from previous literature is the Uzawa–Lucas model. Using this model, I can analyze the effect of human capital on the sustainability of public debt. Further, we must consider the effect of public educational expenditure, in addition to that of private educational expenditure, on economic performance, as in previous studies such as Glomm and Ravikumar (1992), Blankenau and Simpson (2004), Blankenau et al. (2007), and Agénor (2011). In fact, according to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report (2016), the average public education/GDP ratio of OECD in 2013 was 4.8%, which is not a negligible value.Footnote 4 Given that the government must finance public education, it should affect the sustainability of public debt. My model allows the government to finance public education by issuing new debtFootnote 5 and to determine the level of public education as well as the tax rate at which public debt could be sustained. Therefore, I have extended the model developed by Boldrin and Montes (2005) by incorporating both public education and public debt. Based on this model, I obtain the following three results. First, I explicitly show the parameter region in which public debt is unsustainable for any initial endowment. The parameter condition implies that the economy has multiple steady states. Therefore, in line with the previous literature, an additional condition, besides Tirole’s debt-existing condition, is needed to obtain a positive steady-state value of public debt. Second, we explicitly obtain the threshold level of initial public debt over (under) which the economy diverges from (converges to) the steady state, which is one of the novel contributions of this paper. Further, counterintuitive as it may be, the threshold is neutral to the level of human capital; that is, whether the economy initially has high education or not has nothing to do with the sustainability of public debt. Third, I focus on the long-run growth rate and consider the effect of a marginal increase in the tax rate and public education/production ratio on the growth rate. The higher tax rate lowers the future income, and therefore, the investment in private education also decreases. This is a marginal cost of an increase in the tax rate. However, the primary deficit and public debt decrease, and physical capital increases, which is a marginal benefit. When the public education/production ratio increases, human capital directly increases, which is a marginal benefit. However, the primary deficit and public debt increase, and physical capital is crowded out, which is a marginal cost. Taking these into account, I can show that there exist a unique growth-maximizing tax rate and public education/production ratio. Further, a comparison of the long-run growth-maximizing and (each generation’s) welfare-maximizing policies show that the long run growth-maximizing tax rate is higher than the long-run welfare-maximizing rate. However, whether public education is under- or over-supplied depends on the parameter values. Some literature simultaneously treats public education and public debt in the growth model. Zhang (2003) considered public debt and subsidy for education with a constant public debt/production ratio in the OLG model with altruism, and obtained the policy function of public debt. Greiner (2008) considered the relationship between economic growth and public debt with public education in the Ramsey model, and showed the steady states and their stability through calibration. Gottardi et al. (2015) considered the Ramsey model in which uninsurable idiosyncratic shocks to human capital exist and the government can issue public debt, showing the existence of a positive long-run capital tax rate that achieves the first-best allocation. Further, Ono and Uchida (2016) simultaneously considered public education and public debt in the OLG model; they compared welfare between an only-tax regime and a tax plus public debt regime in terms of competitive and political (middle-aged welfare-maximizing policy) equilibrium. Nevertheless, these studies did not focus on the sustainability of public debt. To my best knowledge, this is the first study on public debt sustainability that uses a model incorporating both public debt and human capital accumulation. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, I describe the behavior of a household, firm, and government, and obtain simultaneous difference equations that describe the model’s equilibrium. I discuss the condition of public debt sustainability in Sect. 3.1 and compare my results with related literature in Sect. 3.2. In Sect. 3.3, I conduct comparative static analysis of the stable steady-state values with respect to each policy variable. Sect. 3.4 shows the existence of a unique long-run growth-maximizing tax rate and public education/production ratio. At the same time, I compare the long-run growth-maximizing and long-run welfare-maximizing policies. Finally, Sect. 4 summarizes the study.",2

127.0,1.0,Journal of Economics,18 September 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-018-0634-0,"Bank competition, real investments, and welfare",June 2019,Oz Shy,Rune Stenbacka,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Traditional banking consists of banks collecting deposits and making loans. Banks earn profit from the spread between the return they collect from bank-funded investments and interest paid to depositors. Excess returns generate value for bank ownership that is traded among different generations of consumers. The present contribution shows that resources used to acquire bank ownership crowd out investments that otherwise could support real returns and growth. We design an overlapping generations (OLG) growth model, where in each period the young consumers determine the allocation of resources between real investment (deposits), acquisition of bank ownership, and young-age consumption. At old age, consumers sell bank ownership and collect their bank deposits to support consumption. We show that intensified deposit market competition reduces bank ownership value that is traded among generations, thereby increasing the fraction of the young consumers’ savings allocated to deposits. This reduces investment crowding-out induced by financial investments to acquire bank ownership.Footnote 1 Finally, we show that the equilibrium need not be Pareto-efficient. At the outset the young generation tends to have insufficient incentives for real investments if the banks maintain positive margins between lending and deposit rates. Earlier investigations of the inefficiencies created by traditional banking go back to Simons (1936) who observed that bank lending activities amplify the business cycle. This is because banks expand lending during booms, but contract fast during recessions. Krainer (2017) also identifies misallocations of real productive investment associated with deposit-creation. Our study contributes to this discussion by presenting a formal dynamic analysis of the tradeoff between resources allocated to financial ownership and those allocated to real investments with a particular emphasis on how deposit market imperfections impact this tradeoff. Our analysis is related to a stream of studies with the goal of evaluating the effects of a financial sector capturing an increasingly high proportion of GDP. In this literature, larger financial sectors are often viewed as inefficient because they tend to employ human and physical capital and other resources that could be socially more productive when directed to real production and innovation. As noted in Kay (2015) and in Philippon (2010), since the 1960s, a larger fraction of college graduates in general, and engineering graduates in particular, accepts jobs outside their field to become investment bankers or management consultants. Likewise, Arcand et al. (2015) apply different empirical methods to demonstrate that increased financial depth diminishes output growth if the private sector debt is sufficiently high relative to GDP. On the theoretical side, Cahuc and Challe (2012) develop a two-sector OLG-model with the feature that rents in the financial sector induce occupational shifts that divert high-quality human capital out of productive activities into “speculative” activities in the financial sector. Apart from the crowding-out of human capital (misallocation of skilled labor), Cecchetti and Kharroubi (2012, 2015) show, theoretically as well as empirically, that financial sector growth disproportionally benefits sectors with low productivity and high collateral, thereby reducing total factor productivity growth in the economy. On the other hand, it has been argued that a large financial sector complements real investment and promotes economic growth through various channels: production of information, allocation of capital to productive use, monitoring investments, diversification and management of risk, see Levine (2005). In contrast, Lucas (1988), p. 6, argues that “... the importance of financial matters is very badly over-stressed in the popular and even much professional discussion... ” In the present study we do not address the questions associated with the effects of an increasing size of the financial sector within the framework of a genuine multi-sector model of the economy. Instead, we limit our analysis to explore the tradeoff between the investments to acquire ownership and real investments within the banking industry with a particular emphasis on the effects of imperfect competition in the deposit market. Our OLG model combines two-period horizons of consumers with infinite horizons of banks which is related to a research approach developed by Tirole (1985). Tirole (1985) considers the interaction between productive and nonproductive savings within the framework of an OLG model and with a particular focus on the existence, nature, and consequences of asset bubbles. An important category of studies have subsequently developed this research approach along different dimensions.Footnote 2 Our study focuses on the steady-state equilibrium where the price of bank ownership is determined by its fundamental value and therefore excludes considerations associated with asset bubbles. In our model there are no bubbles due to the capitalization of future profits and the feature that the value of banks grows at the same rate as consumers’ resource endowment. From the perspective of model design, our study is importantly linked to the influential study by Laitner (1982). Laitner (1982) demonstrates in an OLG model how imperfect competition affects aggregate output and capital accumulation. Jones and Manuelli (1992) and Chou and Shy (1991, 1993) apply a similar idea to optimal growth and optimal duration of patents. Muller and Woodford (1988) explore the implications of a finite lifetime for consumers by considering the effects of profits/rents in model where finitely and infinitely lived agents coexist. In particular, they demonstrate that there may be multiple perfect foresight equilibria, all converging to the same steady-state. Further, Femminis (2002) and Sen (2002) explore the implications for dynamic efficiency in OLG models of the combination of imperfect competition and finite lifetimes of agents. Following a related approach, our analysis highlights the fact that finite lifetime imposes a liquidity constraint on the young of a new generation, whereby the resources of young consumers are partly allocated to a less productive form of savings by buying the wealth disposed off by old consumers. These effects are generated by the sale of capital from old to young, or by sale of equity value of firms/banks with market power that the young generation buys from the old one. In all of these cases, part of a young consumer’s endowment is diverted from productive investments to the acquisition of capital or ownership from the old generation, thereby reducing or even halting the growth of output in the economy relative to its full potential. Our paper adds to this literature by explicitly integrating the banking industry and interest-bearing deposits into the young consumers’ savings decisions as a means for transferring wealth between periods. We then use such an OLG framework to show how the transfer of ownership of banks from old to young generations extracts resources from real investments.Footnote 3 Whereas the previous literature on crowding-out focused predominantly on market structures with perfect competition and monopoly, our paper also analyzes how the magnitude of the crowding-out effect depends, in a continuous way, on the intensity of competition in the deposit market. This study is organized as follows. Section 2 constructs an overlapping generations model of deposits, bank ownership, and bank-funded real investment. Section 3 solves for the dynamic equilibrium of deposits, consumption, and allocation of savings to the acquisition of bank ownership. Section 4 defines the measure whereby the acquisition of bank ownership crowds out real investments and analyzes the effects of deposit market competition on the magnitude of crowding-out. Section 5 conducts a welfare analysis of inefficiencies of traditional banking. Section 6 presents concluding comments. Appendix A contains derivations of the main results.",3

127.0,2.0,Journal of Economics,12 September 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-018-0633-1,Attorney fees in repeated relationships,July 2019,Brad Graham,Jack Robles,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Contingent fee agreements are widely used in personal injury and medical malpractice litigation. These cases tend to involve clients with little experience in litigation who hire attorneys on a one-time basis. Numerous authors have considered this situation and find the contingent fee superior to other fee arrangements.Footnote 1 The typical reasoning in favor of the contingent fee stems from the familiar moral hazard problem. That is, if attorney effort is not observable, then an hourly or fixed fee arrangement does not induce the attorney to exert the effort necessary to maximize the client’s expected award. The contingent fee, by giving the attorney a stake in the final award, induces the attorney to put forth greater effort (Danzon 1983). Contingent fees are found to be preferable to hourly or fixed fees in a number of other settings as well.Footnote 2 However, the relationship between corporate clients and law firms has received little attention. Hadfield (2000) and Kritzer et al. (1985) note that corporate clients and law firms typically engage in fixed or hourly fee, rather than contingent fee, contracts. One reason may be that corporate clients are better informed about the merits of their cases than the average plaintiff (Dana and Spier 1993).Footnote 3 Another possible explanation is that corporate plaintiffs are involved in more litigation than the average plaintiff and frequently use the same law firms for multiple cases (Coates et al. 2011). This repeated interaction allows the client to punish the law firm for poor performance by reducing the number of cases it sends to the law firm or by terminating the relationship. A law firm, therefore, must consider the impact of its level of effort for any single case on the continuing relationship with the client. We show that in repeated relationships between law firms and corporate clients the contingent fee is no longer the optimal compensation arrangement. Rather, a contract combining an hourly fee, a lump sum payment, and a retention function can improve the client’s payoff and lead to an efficient outcome.Footnote 4 The contract we find is not unique. However, it is the simplest such contract, and the one that best matches contracts used in practice.Footnote 5 The lump sum payment in our contract is independent of the outcome of the case and the law firm’s performance. In contrast, the retention function states the probability that the client will continue his relationship with the law firm as a function of the outcome of the current case. We treat both the lump sum payment and the retention function as explicit elements of the contract. However, there seems to be no loss in treating the retention function as an implicit contractual element. This is made more feasible by the fact that the retention function takes a very simple and intuitive form. In particular, it is piece-wise linear and (weakly) increasing in realized payoffs. Regarding the lump sum payment, we argue in Sect. 5 that it may easily arise from an acknowledged distortion in reported hours. Hence, to an outside observer, the contract we suggest is indistinguishable from the hourly contracts observed in practice by Hadfield (2000) and Kritzer et al. (1985). The combination of the three contractual elements creates the incentives for the law firm to provide the efficient effort level. The hourly fee is set at exactly the opportunity cost of the law firm’s time, and the lump sum payment is unaffected by the law firm’s actions. Thus, the incentive for the law firm to exert optimal effort is not based on compensation derived from the current case but solely on the likelihood of receiving lump sum payments in future cases. Because the likelihood of receiving future cases is determined by the realized payoff in the current case, the firm acts to satisfy the client in the current case. In contrast to one-time contingent fee contracts, the repeated nature of the relationship allows the client to design a contract such that the law firm cares about the full realized payoff in the current case rather than the fraction of the payoff it receives. The previous literature regarding attorney fees has largely found that contingent fee arrangements provide better incentives than hourly or fixed fee agreements. However, the contingent fee does not create perfect incentives for the attorney in these models.Footnote 6 Our contract provides the law firm with the incentives to choose the efficient effort level. Under mild assumptions, this leads to an outcome that the client prefers to the outcome from a one shot contract. However, our contract is not ‘second best.’ We do not set out to find such a contract, but rather to find a justification for the simple wage contracts which we observe in the market for corporate legal services. An important assumption of our model is that the client may terminate his relationship with the attorney at any time. This assumption allows us to simplify the analysis by limiting the client’s decision to a choice between continuing or terminating its relationship with the law firm. Evidence suggests that corporate clients are able to reduce the intensity of a relationship with one law firm at nearly zero cost from the common use of “preferred counsel” lists that are maintained by many Fortune 500 companies.Footnote 7 Preferred counsel lists are created by corporations to inform managers about which law firms are approved for use in a particular type of case. Law firms are informed of their placement on or removal from the list and most companies list multiple law firms for each type of legal dispute (Jones 2003). Thus, if a corporate client wishes to punish a law firm for providing insufficient effort it can simply give a larger share of its cases to one of the other approved firms. Additionally, the corporation can remove the law firm from the preferred counsel list altogether. In a recent survey of Fortune 500 corporations, Coates et al. (2011) find the most common reason for reducing the volume of cases general counsel allocated to a particular law firm was poor quality service. Furthermore, empirical evidence indicates corporate general counsel consider only very recent activity by the law firm when setting compensation and the likelihood of retention (Jones 2003). We are not aware of other studies that provide a formal analysis of repeated legal services contracts. A few authors have considered information asymmetries related to the performance of law firms. For example, Smith and Cox (1985) find empirical evidence that firms invest in their reputations to signal to clients that they are high quality. Garoupa and Gomez-Pomar (2008) also examine contracts between clients and law firms, but in a one-shot setting. In their model, an attorney must balance the interests of the client and the law firm for which he works. They argue that the hourly fee is preferred to the contingent fee because it offers a solution to this dual agency problem. (See also Gilson and Mnookin (1985) and McChesney (1982) on agency problems within law firms.) Mixed fee arrangements have also been considered by others. For example Claremont and Currivan (1978) propose a mixture of hourly and contingent fees to solve the moral hazard problem. Likewise, Rubinfeld and Scotchmer (1993) find that a combination of fixed and contingent fees is optimal when information is asymmetric. These authors focus on one time interactions whereas we consider repeated interactions between the attorney and client. There are two closely related strands of literature outside of law and economics: the literature on implicit contracts, and the literature on repeated contracting under moral hazard. Our paper is distinguished from both literatures by our focus on the corporate legal services market. In particular, we take institutional constraints on legal service compensation very seriously. Our analysis is not directed towards finding a standard ‘second best’ contract. We do not claim to have found such a contract. Instead, we find an efficient contract that a client would chose if: he is involved in a repeated relationship, and must choose a contract that appears outwardly to be a standard legal services contract. Other distinctions arise as we discuss these literatures in the next two paragraphs. The contract that we propose takes advantage of repetition within the relationship to improve incentives through the retention function. The literature on implicit contracts is similar (see MacLeod (2007) for a useful survey). In particular, Klein and Leffler (1981) show agents can be induced to supply high quality output when they receive a flow of rents and face the threat of losing those rents if they provide low quality output. Our model is also similar to the efficiency wage model of Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) and the more general relational contracting models of MacLeod and Malcomson (1989) and Levin (2003). These papers, along with others such as Baker et al. (1994), allow for a variety of contract forms including bonus payments. This bonus depends upon non-contractable signals concerning the non-stochastic portion of the firm’s performance. Our model contains no such bonus. Our paper is also related to the very large literature on repeated contracting with moral hazard. Many of the papers in this literature consider long term contracts with commitment. Papers within this literature using the threat of termination include: Banks and Sundaram (1998), Heinkel and Stoughton (1994), Spear and Wang (2005) and Ohlendorf and Schmitz (2012). These papers take advantage of the commitment between principal and agent to allow transfers in the current period to depend upon previous periods. Such dependence allows the agent to smooth consumption, and also allows the principal to provide stronger incentives even when the agent is risk neutral. However, such explicitly multi-period contracts don’t seem empirically valid in the market for legal services. By ruling out long term contracts, Olcay (2012) comes closer in spirit to our model. However, the model in Olcay (2012) is unsuitable for the current study, because it uses a contract in which rewards depend only upon outcomes. This feature is shared by all the models discussed in this paragraph. Unlike our paper, they rule out the hourly wage contracts which seem ubiquitous for corporate clients. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the model. In Sect. 3, we present a fairly standard model of short term legal service contracts. The contract from this Section serves as a baseline for our long term contract. In Sect. 4, we describe our proposed contract, and present our main results. Section 5 contains a discussion of the results and concludes the paper. Proofs are relegated to the “Appendix”.",

Weichenrieder,Fangying Xu,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The term “tax haven” is used in different ways by different authors, but usually the term refers to jurisdictions that impose no, or hardly any income taxes on foreign investors. In addition, typical tax haven jurisdictions are reluctant to reveal tax relevant information about the income that foreign investors earn in the respective tax haven. There are different lists of typical tax haven jurisdictions. Small jurisdictions, like Andorra, the Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the British Channel Islands, the Netherlands Antilles, or Panama, are usually prominent entries on these lists. However, somewhat larger countries such as Switzerland and Austria are also included in some lists.Footnote 1 According to a recent estimate, roughly 8% of total assets in the world are held by tax havens (Zucman and Piketty 2015). The fear of losing valuable tax revenues is the root of the revived interest in the activities of tax havens. This triggered the G20 leaders in the midth of the crisis in 2009 to propose “take action against non-cooperative jurisdictions, including tax havens. We stand ready to deploy sanctions to protect our public finances and financial systems”.Footnote 2 In April 2016, leaked documents from a Panamanian law firm on firms registered in offshore entities additionally highlighted the prominence of this issue. On December 5, 2017 the European Union blacklists 17 non-cooperative tax jurisdictions for the first time.Footnote 3 Tax haven jurisdictions have been under pressure from various angles. An important initiative was taken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The essential strategy, much intensified since 2008, was to greylist alleged tax haven jurisdictions and to delist jurisdictions that agree on a standard of information exchange and sign at least twelve bilateral tax information exchange agreements (TIEAs). Since 2009, this initiative has led to an exploding number of TIEAs that already exceeds 2000.Footnote 4 The signing of a TIEA implies that a country can contact the tax authorities of a partner country and ask for tax relevant information. Information must not be denied just because the relevant information is not tax relevant in the addressed country or because the tax payer’s behavior that is the request reason is not an offense in this country. On the other hand, a TIEA does not allow for “fishing expeditions” in which information on a large number of tax payers is requested without giving individual reasons for the request. If effective, tax information exchange eliminates one of the two important features of a tax haven: while the treaties do not eliminate the low or zero taxation of income, they may eliminate the shelter that secrecy offers for tax evaders and tax avoiders.Footnote 5 Despite the international pressure on tax havens, parts of the economic literature have claimed positive effects of tax havens on the welfare of other countries. The most prominent paper in positive welfare effect direction is by Hong and Smart (2010) [HS (2010) in the following]. It shows that for high-tax countries, which for legal or political reasons cannot differentiate tax rates between the elastic foreign investment and inelastically supplied domestic investment, the existence of tax havens may be beneficial. It is because that tax havens can indirectly provide a lower tax on international investors which allows high-tax countries to stick to high tax rates for immobile domestic investment. The present paper reconsiders the potential welfare effects of tax havens, but differs from HS (2010) in two important ways. First, while we follow the setup in HS (2010) and consider a high-tax country that hosts both domestic and foreign firms, the secrecy services provided by tax havens in our approach may allow domestic investors to camouflage as foreign ones. This feature of the model is motivated by the large estimates of round-tripping investment in emerging markets. For example, it is estimated that 25% of the alleged foreign direct investment into China is nothing but Chinese domestic investment in disguise (World Bank 2002, p.41). As we discuss below, substantial round-tripping investment is also suspected in the case of India. Therefore, our paper provides a stylized model on the crucial role tax havens play in round-tripping structures and contributes to the theoretical literature of taxation in developing countries.Footnote 6 Second, we challenge the assumption by HS (2010) that non-haven countries cannot differentiate their tax rates dependent on ownership. Again, China serves as a motivation. At least until 2008, the country indeed provided a lower statutory tax rate for foreign-owned companies.Footnote 7 With our set of assumptions, we conclude the opposite: tax-haven secrecy makes it harder to tell the true ownership of domestic and foreign-owned firms and therefore has a negative impact on non-haven countries’ welfare. Consequently, since information exchange agreements make it more difficult for domestic firms to disguise as foreign investors, those agreements will be beneficial for non-haven countries. There are many other reasons why secrecy plays a role in profit shifting and round shipping. Besides providing shelter for ownership, it may conceal illicit income from corruption and proceed money laundering, but may also offer protections for investments from countries with financial and political risks. For example, investors can go around capital controls and tax havens may prevent investments from expropriation.Footnote 8 In this paper, we focus on the channel mentioned above that tax-haven secrecy provides opportunities for concealing firms’ true ownership and the impact thereafter on the tax benefit of non-haven countries. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews recent findings on the possible impacts of OECD crackdown on tax haven secrecy, particularly TIEAs on tax haven activities and summarizes the views on the role of tax havens on other countries’ welfare. Section 3 highlights the stunning importance of tax havens as conduit countries for investments into China and India. It also comments on the possibility of round-tripping investment that may be included in these figures. Section 4 then offers a revised version of the model by HS (2010) which introduces round-tripping investment in a stylized way. Section 5 concludes.",4

In other words, we replicate Tirole’s pathbreaking study of asset price bubbles in the overlapping generations model [see Tirole (1985)] in the simpler framework of the Solow–Swan model. Such an analysis would hardly be of any interest if it led to similar results as those derived by Tirole (1985). But this is not the case. First of all, we find that the equivalence between the existence of asset price bubbles and the dynamic inefficiency of the standard (bubbleless) equilibrium, which is one of the central results in Tirole (1985), does not hold in our setting: bubbles can exist even if the bubbleless equilibrium is dynamically efficient. Second, we demonstrate that asset price bubbles can generate non-monotonic and even periodic capital accumulation paths, which is not the case in the overlapping generations economy studied by Tirole (1985). We use the standard framework of a neoclassical one-sector growth model: a single output good is produced from capital and labor and it can be used for consumption and investment. We augment this setting by introducing a second asset which is intrinsically useless (it cannot be used in production, it cannot be consumed, and it does not pay any dividend). In order to ensure that the two assets are equivalent stores of value, we impose a no-arbitrage condition. Analogously to the Solow–Swan model we suppose that the amount that is consumed or invested, respectively, is a fixed fraction of aggregate income. The crucial assumption of the present paper concerns the definition of aggregate income: we assume that it consists of all factor income (i.e., GDP) plus capital gains. It follows that, whenever the price of the useless asset increases or decreases, this triggers corresponding movements of consumption and investment. It is this feedback mechanism, which opens the door for a rich set of bubbly equilibria including ones that display damped oscillations or periodic cycles. We believe that this aspect of the model, namely that capital gains may directly increase investment, is not an awkward feature of the (non-microfounded) Solow–Swan model but a rather realistic one. Moreover, the possibility of non-monotonic bubbly equilibria is in accordance with highly volatile asset price bubbles such as those observed on the markets for bitcoin or other crypto-currencies. It has to be emphasized that the feedback loop mentioned in the previous paragraph does not exist in Tirole (1985), which is based on a two-period overlapping generations economy à la Diamond (1965). As a matter of fact, in that model the saving/investment decisions are made by the households in their first period of life, that is, at a time when their income consists only of wages. This implies that movements of the price of the useless asset do not directly affect aggregate savings (investment), but only indirectly as a general equilibrium effect. Let us now describe our findings in more detail. We start our analysis by assuming that aggregate consumption is a fixed fraction of aggregate income. For positive population growth we find that the useless asset can have a positive price if and only if the equilibrium of the original Solow–Swan model is dynamically inefficient. In this case we therefore get the same result as Tirole (1985). If the population growth rate is negative, however, then asset price bubbles can also exist when the standard Solow–Swan equilibrium is dynamically efficient. Moreover, in this case the bubbly equilibria can display damped oscillations or even truly periodic fluctuations. We also consider a version of the model in which aggregate investment rather than aggregate consumption is a fixed fraction of GDP plus capital gains. In this situation asset price bubbles and cyclical fluctuations can occur even if the population growth rate is positive and the standard Solow–Swan equilibrium is dynamically efficient. These results demonstrate that the relation between dynamic inefficiency of capital accumulation paths and the existence of bubbles is much more subtle in our modified Solow–Swan model than in the overlapping generations framework from Tirole (1985). They also show that those feedback effects, which are the source of the asset price bubbles, may also be responsible for excess volatility of asset prices. Asset price bubbles have occurred frequently in the past [see, e.g., Aliber and Kindleberger (2015) or Scherbina and Schlusche (2014, chapter 2)] and their analysis has become a hot topic of economic research. The bulk of the pertinent literature uses versions of the overlapping generations model of Samuelson (1958) and Diamond (1965) (see Tirole (1985), Weil (1987), Caballero et al. (2006), Martin and Ventura (2012, 2016), and Farhi and Tirole (2012), to name just a few). It is considerably more difficult to establish the existence of bubbly equilibria in microfounded models with infinitely-lived consumers; see Kocherlakota (1992, 2009) and Miao (2014) as well as references therein. In particular, in those models asset price bubbles can only occur in the presence of financial frictions such as collateral constraints. This is the case because without any financial frictions, bubbles would have to grow at the real interest rate and this is inconsistent with the necessary transversality condition for the consumers’ optimization problem. To the best of our knowledge, asset price bubbles have not been studied in the Solow–Swan model. This is probably the case because the Solow–Swan model is not micro-founded and bubbles are thought to be episodes in which assets are voluntarily traded by rational agents despite the fact that their market prices do not reflect their fundamental values. The key condition that allows for this kind of behavior is arbitrage-free pricing of all assets. If we use a model without micro-foundation and directly impose a no-arbitrage condition, as we do, then there is obviously no inconsistency with the usual interpretation of asset price bubbles. We therefore believe that it makes perfect sense to study this phenomenon also in the simpler Solow–Swan model, especially if this yields results (such as oscillations) which cannot be obtained in standard models that are based on micro-foundation. The Solow–Swan model has the additional advantage over the overlapping generations model that it can easily be formulated in continuous time, in which case diagrammatic analysis is especially simple and illuminating.Footnote 1 A final reason for the use of a continuous-time Solow–Swan model is that, due to its simplicity, it forms an especially challenging playing field for establishing the existence of oscillating or periodic equilibria. We address this challenge by using local stability analysis and the Hopf bifurcation theorem. The outline of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we briefly describe the framework of our analysis and summarize the known results on the dynamic (in)efficiency of the equilibria of the Solow–Swan model. Section 3 extends the standard Solow–Swan model by introducing an intrinsically useless asset and by assuming that consumption is proportional to GDP plus capital gains. Section 4 analyzes under which circumstances the second asset can coexist (with a positive price) with physical capital. We allow for positive and negative population growth rates and emphasize the differences between these two scenarios. Section 5 demonstrates that for negative population growth rates capital allocation paths in bubbly equilibria may display non-monotonic and perpetually oscillating behavior. In Sect. 6 we consider a version of the extended Solow–Swan model in which behavior is described by an investment rule rather than by a consumption rule. In this case, permanently oscillating bubbles can also occur if the population growth rate is positive and the standard Solow–Swan equilibrium is dynamically efficient. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes the paper and outlines questions for future research.",1
127.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,10 November 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-018-0639-8,Risk aversion heterogeneity and the investment–uncertainty relationship,August 2019,Gianluca Femminis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The available empirical evidence suggests that an increase in volatility has negative effects on capital accumulation. Instead, most of the theoretical literature on competitive firms’ investment decisions has pointed to a positive relationship between the size of productivity shocks and investment. The tension between the theoretical literature and the empirical contributions originates in the flexibility effect. As originally highlighted by Hartman (1972) and Abel (1983), a risk-neutral firm which incurs an installation cost when deciding upon its capital level, but which is able to freely adjust labour after the realization of the shock, can exploit this asymmetry. In fact, the firm can increase production by adjusting the flexible inputs when the marginal cost is low, while output is reduced when the cost is high. Therefore, the firm’s marginal revenue of capital is convex in the productivity shock, so that a mean-preserving spread in productivity increases the expected marginal revenue of capital, and therefore the firm’s investment. While the early contributions essentially propose partial equilibrium frameworks, Saltari and Ticchi (2007) develop a general equilibrium model populated by infinitely-lived individuals. In this economy, to disentangle the degree of risk aversion from the elasticity of intertemporal substitution agents preferences are assumed of the Epstein–Zin family. Because the labour supply is elastic, the flexibility effect is at play in full and, when the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is low, this may induce a negative response of investment to an increase in future volatility. In fact the desire to smooth utility levels over time induces the representative household to increase current consumption in response to higher future returns. But agents are risk averse, and Saltari and Ticchi find that, even for relatively low degrees of risk aversion, the certainty-equivalent future return is actually reduced, which re-establish a positive investment–uncertainty relation. With the currently available estimates for the attitudes toward risk, and with a low elasticity of intertemporal substitution, a negative investment–uncertainty relation can hardly be found in their representative agent model. Agents populating an economy differ along many dimensions, and risk aversion, is a trait for which heterogeneity is of paramount importance. Kimball et al. (2009) find a significant dispersion in risk aversion for the survey responses in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), uncovering also a covariance in risk attitudes among family members. Heterogeneity in preferences is detected by studies based on experiments, such as von Gaudecker et al. (2011) who target a large set of Dutch households, and by analysis of financial market data, such as Chiappori and Paiella (2011), who focus on Italy. Here we develop a general equilibrium framework populated by individuals characterized by Epstein–Zin preferences, who are heterogeneous in their attitudes toward risk. We let labour supply be elastic, a choice dictated by the desire to keep the flexibility effect completely operational: in our economy firms can modify the usage of labour without inducing changes in the real wage, so that the expected return to capital is increasing in the volatility of the shock. We focus on the case of systematic risk, which is appropriate when financial markets are fully operational: in our economy, as in Coen-Pirani (2004), the presence of mature financial markets allows investors characterized by different degrees of relative risk aversion to trade safe bonds. The low risk-averse households take a long position in the risky asset, while the high-risk averse families own riskless bonds. These portfolio effects are of crucial importance for our results: they imply that an higher aggregate volatility increases not only the expected return of capital, but also the certainty-equivalent return for most investors. When the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is below unity, investors’ incentive to smooth utility over time implies that a higher certainty-equivalent capital yield in the future induces an increase in current consumption, and hence a reduction in investment. Notice that our framework offers elements of interest that go beyond the specific point we make. From the methodological perspective, we provide a neat illustration of the fact that the aggregate behavior of an heterogeneous agents economy can be different from the behavior originating from a representative agent with preference parameters that corresponds to those of the ‘average’ agent. We also show how to avoid the arise of degenerate wealth distributions in economies populated by heterogeneous agents. Some recent studies inspecting the consequences of risk aversion heterogeneity for income and wealth distributions, have shown that it tends to induce the dominance of a specific class of agents in the long run. Coen-Pirani (2004) populates an endowment economy with two types of Epstein–Zin agents who differ only in the risk aversion parameter; the more-risk-averse agents choose a portfolio with a lower average return, but also with a lower variance, which can lead them to dominate the long-run distribution of wealth. Roche (2011) shows how time discount, risk aversion, and intertemporal substitution contribute to shaping capital accumulation decisions. In his model, the more effectively patient agents dominate the wealth distribution, and they may well be the ones characterized by the lowest risk aversion.Footnote 1 In our model the risk aversion of each household changes stochastically over time, which stylizes aging or the arrival of new family members. This effect guarantees the existence of a non degenerate ergodic wealth distribution, and—keeping manageable the dynamics of heterogeneous agents macro-models—may prove useful for the stream of research proposing explanations for (international) finance puzzles. Our  model is solved by means of numerical techniques; following the pertinent literature, we compute how aggregate investment reacts to an increase in the variance characterizing the productivity process. We proxy ‘uncertainty’ matching the standard deviation of the return on capital with the stock market volatility, and assuming that this standard deviation follows a Markov process. We parameterize the average risk aversion and its degree of heterogeneity across agents consistently with the recent empirical literature, and we find that an elasticity of intertemporal substitution below unity implies a negative investment–uncertainty relation. Moreover, we consider the effects of portfolio constraints framed in line with those prescribed by U.S. regulations. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. After a brief discussion of the pertinent literature, Sect. 2 describes the model and characterizes the recursive equilibrium, while Sect. 3 provides details concerning the maximization problems. Section 4 solves the model numerically and presents the simulation results, while Sect. 5 draws the conclusions. The Appendixes contain the more technical material. In their survey, Carruth et al. (2000) report that although the contributions based on aggregate data did not find, until the early 90s, a statistically significant negative investment–uncertainty relation, more recent macroeconometric analysis has tended to be conclusive. A recent example in this vein is Meinen and Röhe (2017), who focus on the Euro area, and document a pronounced negative investment responses to uncertainty shocks.Footnote 2 Moreover, most of the contributions based on micro data point to a negative investment–uncertainty relationship. Leahy and Whited (1996), with U.S. data, uncover a negative correlation between investment and firm’s returns variance. Robust evidence is provided for Italy by Guiso and Parigi (1999), who find that an increase in volatility has negative effects for firms with a relevant market power and for those characterized by high irreversibilities. When both the market power and the degree of irreversibility are low, the investment–volatility relationship is still negative, although less significant. However, according to Ghosal and Loungani (2000), in the U.S. the negative impact of profit volatility on investment is substantially greater for industries composed of small firms. Bloom et al. (2007) quantify uncertainty following Leahy and Whited (1996), and—when considering the interaction between volatility in stock returns and sales—find a significant negative effect on investment for a panel of U.K. manufacturing firms. An increase in volatility negatively affects investment as well, while the level of past volatility is less significant. Panousi and Papanikolaou (2012) find, for the U.S., that idiosyncratic volatility at firm level induces a reduction in investment, which is due to managerial risk aversion. However, they also find an effect, although barely significant, of systematic volatility on investment. The empirical evidence can hardly be interpreted by the literature building upon the competitive models by Hartman (1972) and Abel (1983). When the elasticity of demand is finite—as in Caballero (1991)—a firm increasing output in response to a positive productivity shock brings down its goods price, which weakens the flexibility effect. Caballero uncovers a negative investment–uncertainty relation when couples such a weakened effect with asymmetries in the adjustment costs. In fact, to reduce the risk of suffering high resale costs, firms shrink their investment when uncertainty increases. Many contributions incorporating various types of irreversibilities have found a negative effect of risk on investment. In a volatile environment, if conditions worsen, the irreversibility constraint may become binding, which generates a ‘value-of-waiting’. When business conditions become more risky, this effect becomes stronger. Chirinko and Schaller (2009) identify an ‘irreversibility premium’ in the discount rate used by a panel of U.S. firms. However, Abel and Eberly (1999) identify the ‘hangover effect’, according to which investment irreversibility prevents the firm from selling capital when the marginal revenue product of capital is low, so that the average long-run capital stock is higher than in the case with full reversibility. Higher uncertainty reinforces both the value-of-waiting effect and the hangover effect, so that no unambiguous result can be obtained. When investment, in addition to being irreversible, is also indivisible, the-value-of waiting is higher. In fact, not only the irreversibility constraint may become binding if conditions worsen, but also a firm—sinking an investment project—loses the possibility of investing in the future in a more favorable situation. Nevertheless, the effects of returns volatility on investment are not clear cut: a riskier project may attain larger values sooner, which prompts for an earlier investment, as suggested by Sarkar (2000). To explain the negative relationship between investment and risk in competitive markets, several contributions have considered the role of risk aversion in general-equilibrium frameworks. Craine (1989) and Zeira (1990) concentrate on the effect of risk on the reallocation of savings and investment across sectors, but in their frameworks aggregate savings (and investment) are a constant fraction of output, and therefore their papers are not focused on the effects of aggregate volatility on investment.Footnote 3 In Saltari and Ticchi (2007) a risk aversion effect is at play: individuals take their decisions considering the certainty-equivalent return on capital and not the return itself, and hence the increase in future returns may actually involve a reduction in the certainty-equivalent return. Such a reduction creates—when the elasticity of intertemporal substitution is lower than 1—an incentive to shrink current consumption to smooth utility levels over time. Saltari and Ticchi’s (2007) general equilibrium approach is shared by Angeletos (2007), who presents a model of idiosyncratic capital income risk. He finds that, in absence of risk-sharing, capital accumulation suffers from an increase in volatility. This is due to the fact that risk averse agents value more their (riskless) human wealth as the capital income risk increases, and this ‘wealth effect’ reduces savings. In Angeletos’ model, labour supply is rigid, which dampens the Hartman–Abel effect, because, at the aggregate level, the increase in labour demand fostered by an increase in the marginal revenue of capital partly resolves into an increase in wage.Footnote 4 Hence, he consider a case which is polar to the one we analyze, so that our contribution can be seen as a complement to his own.",2
127.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,27 October 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-018-0640-2,Gradual trade liberalization in a North–South model of the product cycle,August 2019,Adolfo Cristóbal Campoamor,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Globalization, understood here as a gradual reduction in international trade costs, is a sweeping phenomenon with multiple economic implications. As pointed out by many authors, like Ben David and Loewy (1998), lower international trade barriers have always led to much discussion on the prospects for: (a) convergence between countries; (b) the possibility of higher welfare for all parties concerned or only for a subset of them. In particular, the analysis of North–South trade relations often addresses those considerations within the setting of product cycle models, which are a specific tool to deal with these issues. The modern theoretical analysis of North–South trade relationships was affected considerably by the “new trade theory”, inaugurated by Krugman (1980), which offered a rationale for the intra-industry trade of similar varieties. In particular, according to Chui et al. (1998), 11 “developing countries are increasingly specializing in exports of [...] new productsFootnote 1; for some countries—Singapore and Malaysia in particular—they comprise over half of their manufactured exports”. This fact has made the concept and theory of the product cycle especially valuable to understand the recent North–South, catchup phenomena. Empirically, the patterns of North–South trade show a division of production where the North typically retains the elaboration of new, unstandardized goods and services while relegating the South to making standardized products at lower cost. The pioneering work of Vernon (1966) and the follow up literature on product cycle analysis shed light in understanding these patterns of trade and technology transfer. In a seminal exogenous-growth model of the product cycle, Krugman (1979) advanced some of the determinants of North–South convergence, which depend on the relative strength of the innovative sector and the technological imitation in the South. His work allowed Grossman and Helpman (1991, henceforth GH) to identify some determinants of the speed of innovation and imitation, which could be affected by public policy. The subsequent literature on endogenous product cycles has further extended GH’s model to identify the main determinants of international income distribution [see Lai (1995) or Chui et al. (2001)]. The realities of FDI, international migration or intellectual property rights were incorporated to product cycle settings by Helpman (1993), Glass and Saggi (2002), Mondal and Gupta (2008), Sener and Zhao (2009), Biswas (2015) or Liu et al. (2016). Other articles, like Dinopoulos (2006), Grieben and Sener (2009), Spinesi (2009) or Gustaffson and Segerstrom (2010) considered the effects of an incremental decay in trade costs in product cycle models. With the exception of Gustaffson and Segerstrom (2010)’s paper, they all present rising-product-quality models instead of expanding-product-variety settings. The second and the third of these papers analyze the impact of higher trade freeness on per-capita output growth rates, rather than North–South inequality. In contrast to our results, Spinesi (2009) comes to the conclusion that “globalization can reduce the per-capita output growth rate of all countries”. Gustaffson and Segerstrom (2010) is clearly the contribution whose model is closest to our framework. More specifically, we prove that freer trade will promote North–South convergence as long as the population size and R&D productivity in the South is sufficiently small, relative to the North. Therefore, we confirm the generality of Gustaffson and Segerstrom (2010)’s qualitative results (see their Theorem 4), by extending them to any initial level of trade costs and also by expressing our convergence condition in terms of the parameters. Furthermore, we show that a gradually deeper globalization always increases the long run welfare levels in the North and the South.Footnote 2 The economic dimension of a national market depends on the size of its population and the productivity of its labor force. Both of them determine the aggregate income of the country. Unlike Das (2005) or Oyama et al. (2011), in our setting homogeneous labor is the only productive factor in the manufacturing sector. This implies that higher freeness of trade has no comparative advantage effects and the relative market size fully determines the results of our trade liberalization. The market size effect implies that, as trade costs fall, if the Northern aggregate income is larger, the relative profitability in the smaller market will rise. And then local firm entry will increase the Southern relative welfare level. In that respect, our paper is also related to the literature on the size-welfare nexus and the home-market-effect [see e.g. Felbermayr and Jung (2015) or Ramondo et al. (2016)]. Since the South can only replicate the Northern products, its technological dependence explains that Southerners remain poorer even when their local market could be larger. Trade liberalization will then trigger convergence (divergence) only when the Southern market size is smaller (larger). Our theoretical results are testable as well. As anticipated above, the testable hypothesis is that trade liberalization will induce North–South convergence when the economic size of the South is smaller than the North. This result suggests that the imitating economies whose population and/or productivity increase fast may stop converging with the North, since eventually their relative market size becomes so large that globalization induces a lower rise in profitability for them. As to the effects of trade liberalization on welfare, we can show analytically how cheaper imports for North and South always result in higher real income for both geographical blocks. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in the next section we will lay the foundations of the model, which is itself an extension of GH; in Sect. 3 we will apply our North–South convergence analysis; in Sect. 4 we will delve into the welfare issues; Sect. 5 will assess the relevance of our assumptions for an appropriate parameterization; finally, Sect. 6 concludes. Some lengthy mathematical derivations will be contained in the final Appendices.",1

As this situation is not expected to change for some time, governments are asked “to do better with less by spending smarter” (OECD 2014, p. 6). With the objective of dealing with some of these challenges, this paper addresses the optimal delegation from the public to the private sector of sequential tasks for the realization of strategic public investment that can enhance long-term growth rates, accumulate public capital, and generate long-term outputs (ECB 2016). One critical aspect of the delegation process in long-term projects is the allocation of connected activities among multiple agents. On one hand, the presence of positive externalities among tasks may motivate the adoption of ex-ante “bundled” contracts with a single private contractor to allow governments to exploit economies of scope and increase the efficiency of projects (Iossa and Martimort 2015; Martimort and Pouyet 2008). On the other hand, in the presence of future uncertainty and low competition for bundled contracts, governments may prefer “unbundled” schemes, where tasks are sequentially allocated to agents through independent awarding procedures (Li et al. 2015; Hoppe and Schmitz 2013; Bentz et al. 2002). Public authorities have traditionally selected unbundled contracts to procure investments. The idea of bundling tasks for the realization of a public project has become common thanks to developed and developing countries’ growing use of public–private partnerships (PPPs). PPPs have been implemented in a wide array of sectors, from standard projects for which the main source of revenue is user fees (e.g., motorways, parking facilities, and public transport), to highly complex projects in which private profits come from government subsidies (e.g., hospitals, schools, and prisons).Footnote 1 In PPPs, the private consortium that is in charge of designing, realizing, and managing the infrastructure can assume the role of financier, and the risks are optimally shared between public and private partners (OECD 2013). The focus in this paper is on a particular aspect of PPPs—that is, the bundling of tasks—while setting aside the analysis of such aspects of PPPs as the transfer of risks, control, and cashflow rights from the public to the private sector. In particular, the paper compares “bundling” with “unbundling” given the presence of an externality between sequential activities whose magnitude is ex-ante uncertain and unobserved by the government, while the private operator is able to infer this information during the first stage of the project. Moreover, as in Auriol and Picard (2009a, b, 2013) the study assumes that the principal has a budget constraint and, hence, faces a shadow cost of public funds. Using the contract theory methodology (Laffont and Tirole 1993), the theoretical analysis relaxes the usual assumption of perfectly observable externalities by using a more realistic environment in which a budget-constrained public authority that seeks to maximize the project’s net social welfare decides whether to select bundled or unbundled contracts without having all of the relevant information ex-ante. The results of the study reveal a trade-off: The advantage of the government’s choosing bundling is related to the first stage of investment, and it increases with the level of ex-ante uncertainty about the real impact of the building investment in its operational activity. On the other hand, if the government chooses unbundling, it can save informational rents, as the contract with the operator is written after the building stage once it has observed the real value of the externality. These results may explain the rationale behind the increased adoption of bundled contracts like the BOT (Build, Operate and Transfer), the BOOT (Build, Operate, Own and Transfer), and the FDBO (Finance, Design, Build, Operate and Transfer) in sectors like public transport, health, sanitation, and energy. In these sectors the link between building investment and operational costs can be significant but also highly uncertain at the ex-ante stage. In such frameworks, public administrations generally understand the need for investment in technologies that can control operational costs (e.g., intelligent transportation systems, medical technologies, energy-efficient instruments, waste water treatments), but these administrations usually cannot perfectly assess up front the long-term impacts and risks of such innovations (OECD 2014). The involvement of private contractors in the design, realization and future management of the project may allow public administrations to exploit their stronger market/sector knowledge and expertise for the provision of efficient investment levels in adequate innovative solutions (Iossa and Russo 2008). The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the related literature. Section 3 lays out the model, and Sects. 4 and 5 discuss the unbundling and bundling scenarios, respectively. Section 6 uses a welfare analysis to identify the net surplus the scenarios produce, and Sect. 7 concludes.",8

Nevertheless, public and semi-public (partially privatized) firms are still important players in the global economic arena, but are highly concentrated in a few sectors with large portions of the world’s resources.Footnote 1 Particularly, public firms successfully compete with their private counterparts in a wide range of industries, such as healthcare, education, financing (e.g., banking and insurance), transportation (e.g., railways and airlines), telecommunications and energy-related industries (e.g., electricity, power generation and natural gas). Therefore, privatization in these industries attracted extensive policy attention from economics researchers in developed, developing, and transitional economies, such as Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia, including China.Footnote 2 The early analyses on mixed oligopolies date back to at least Merrill and Schneider (1966), although only more recently the literature in this field has become richer and more diverse. Specifically, the literature on mixed oligopolies adopted the partial privatization model formulated by Matsumura (1998), who discussed the optimal degree of privatization in mixed oligopolies. Since then, partial privatization models have been analyzed by a rapidly growing literature, and numerous recent works showed various factors affect the optimal degree of privatization.Footnote 3 Nonetheless, most papers assume private enterprises having homogeneous objectives maximize their profits.Footnote 4 On the other hand, driven by capital market and industry associations, corporate social responsibility (CSR) has become a global mainstream business strategy. According to KPMG (2013), nearly 85% of the 250 largest companies worldwide issued CSR reports and above 90% of companies in Japan adopted CSR activities. CASS (2017) releases that the yearly average proportion of CSR reports announced by the listed companies in China is 71.4%. While a large number of firms worldwide issue various CSR statements and activities, several belong to industries characterized as mixed oligopolies, in which CSR firms compete with public ones. That is, the heterogeneity of objectives among private firms emerges as an important research topic in the literature on mixed oligopolies. The recent CSR topic have also received increasing attention from broad research using both empirical and theoretical analyses in business and economics.Footnote 5 The concept and scopes of CSR are wide, ranging from investment in human capital to the social impact of firms’ traditional concerns, such as investments in R&D, product design, prices, and quantities, and the expansion of market shares. Many studies formulated theoretical papers on the CSR-initiatives and analyzed different models of oligopolies, where profit-maximizing private firms compete with other private firms that implement CSR activities.Footnote 6 Particularly, they utilized a model in which the private firm adopts consumer surplus as a proxy of its own CSR concerns. Subsequently, a CSR-related incentive combines both profitability and consumer surplus and, thus, the objective of a CSR firm is a convex combination of consumers’ surplus and its own profit. As CSR is a growing trend in many industries, including those characterized by mixed oligopolies, in which the investigation of privatization policies is significant, it is thus restrictive to assume private firms have homogeneous objectives, wherein they maximize only their own profits. Therefore, it is also important to examine the interactions between the CSR activities of private firms and optimal privatization policies on public firms. As such, we adopt the formal CSR approach and investigate how the heterogeneity of objectives among private firms affects optimal privatization policies in a mixed oligopoly, in which a public firm competes with CSR firms. The main contribution of our paper is providing different results by determining the optimal privatization policy in a mixed oligopoly with CSR firms. We show that, depending on the level of CSR and cost differences among firms, either nationalization or full privatization can be optimal. This result strikingly contrasts to the literature on mixed oligopolies. Since Matsumura (1998) first analyzed partial privatization under moderate conditions in a homogeneous mixed duopoly, several other studies examined optimal privatization policies under different aspects of economic phenomena and proved the optimality of partial privatization is robust.Footnote 7 For identical cost functions, furthermore, we find the optimal degree of privatization is decreasing with the level of CSR in private firms and, thus, nationalization can be optimal if they have homogeneous objectives. However, if there is significant objective heterogeneity among private firms, the optimal degree of privatization is non-monotone with respect to the CSR level but nationalization cannot be optimal. This result suggests the optimal privatization policy depends on the CSR level, which affects the heterogeneity of objectives among private firms. This highlights the role of CSR activities in the magnitude of heterogeneity of objectives for choosing an optimal degree of privatization and its effects on the non-monotonicity of privatization policies in a mixed oligopoly. Recently, Ouattara (2017) and Itano (2017) examined optimal privatization policies with the CSR activities of a private firm, but focused only on a mixed duopoly where both public and private firms have identical cost functions. Chang et al. (2018) also analyzed CSR activities of a public social enterprise in a mixed duopoly by taking the degree of caring about the profit of a private firm into consideration. However, the heterogeneity of objectives among private firms is absent in their models and thus, the results are more restrictive than ours. As related works, Goering (2008), Flores and García (2016), and Leal et al. (2018) showed that technology efficiency is crucial in determining whether welfare increases or decreases as the social concern of a non-profit firm raises. Yet, they did not consider the optimal degree of privatization. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we briefly review the CSR in the economics literature. We construct the basic model of mixed oligopolies with CSR firms and analyze the optimal policies in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we focus on the identical cost functions and discuss two specific cases: (i) both private firms have the homogenous CSR and (ii) one firm is a profit-maximizer, while the other firm adopts CSR. The final Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",57

Ramsey (1928) assumed a social planner who maximizes an infinite, non-discounted sum of current and future utilities. The discounting of later enjoyments in comparison with earlier ones was for him an unacceptable practice. Later, Cass (1965, 1966), Koopmans (1965, 1967), Malinvaud (1965) and Samuelson (1965) generalized Ramsey’s approach to allow for the discounting of future utilities. In an explicit overlapping generations setting where individuals are pure life-cyclers, Diamond (1965) adhered to the maximization of the utility level of a representative individual under the constraint that any other achieves the same welfare level, giving rise to what the subsequent literature coined as the Two-Part Golden Rule, i.e., the combination of the Biological Interest Rate and the Golden Rule of (physical) capital accumulation (Samuelson 1968, 1975a, b). Adding to this framework the dimension of intergenerational altruism à la Barro (1974), so that individuals behave as if they maximized dynastic utility, the question arises of whether considering the welfare level enjoyed by a representative child only (Carmichael 1982) or that of all children (Burbidge 1983). Clearly, each of these views of social welfare leads to a different optimal resource allocation. But all of them share the feature that they assume economies without productivity growth, in which a steady state is a situation where consumption levels per unit of (natural) labour are kept constant. In contrast, in the presence of productivity growth that translates into consumption growth, these consumption levels will grow without limit. Under these circumstances, a social planner will be unable to choose the stream of consumption levels that maximizes a sum of utilities. The reason is simple: the utility index itself will grow without limit, and will be infinite along the balanced growth path. The standard way to sidestep this issue is, of course, to assume that the planner maximizes a discounted sum of utilities. This is the approach adopted by Caballé (1995), Kemnitz and Wigger (2000) and Docquier et al. (2007) to characterize the optimal growth path in an endogenous growth model with overlapping generations and individuals who are either dynastic savers or life-cyclers. There are, however, two uncomfortable features of this approach. First, as mentioned before, altough positing a social discount rate has become customary, the choice of a particular one can be seen as inherently arbitrary. Second, as highlighted in Del Rey and Lopez-Garcia (2012), the precise cardinalization of the utility function (more precisely, its degree of homogeneity) fundamentally affects both the characterization of the social optimum and the policies that support it. Indeed, the optimal balanced growth path will be characterized by a version of the “Modified Golden Rule” where the rate of growth of productivity has to be adjusted for the degree of homogeneity of the utility function (see footnote 7 below). This means that even if we accept that future utilities should be discounted at an entirely arbitrary rate, we are left with the fact that the optimal policy varies when we use different mathematical specifications representing the same  economic problem. One could reasonably claim that this is also an unpleasant feature of the whole approach.Footnote 1 In light of these facts, it is tempting to ask whether it is possible for a social planner to continue to adhere to the Utilitarian criterion of maximizing a sum of individual utilities but, (i) without having to postulate something as elusive and inherently arbitrary as a social discount rate; and (ii) without having to choose a specific functional form to cardinalize individual preferences. In this paper we argue that the answer to this question is affirmative, accounting for both (i) and (ii), when the social planner maximizes a non-discounted sum of individual current and future utilities defined over consumption levels per unit of  efficient rather than natural labour units. Strictly speaking, and to be precise, the social planner would not maximize the plain sum of welfare levels but that of the divergences between these levels and a “bliss utility” à la Ramsey. We show therefore that it is possible for a Utilitarian social planner to treat all generations equally and be respectful of individual preferences. On the one hand, in a growth environment, treating all generations alike involves the choice of some utility index that eventually converges. In order to ensure convergence of the utility index we can divide consumption levels by another variable that grows at the same rate along a balanced growth path. The level of physical capital and the level of human capital are two natural candidates to be this divisor. However, as consumption and physical capital are denominated in the same units, dividing consumption levels by physical capital would yield a pure number, with no dimension and with no intuitive interpretation. Dividing by human capital, on the contrary, just “re-scales” consumption, measuring it in terms of units of output per unit of efficient labour. On the other hand, it is important to stress that this “new” utility function is obtained by means of a monotonic transformation of the one guiding individual’s behaviour, thus being fully respectul of individual ordinal preferences. Notice also that, assuming convergence, the limit of the time sequence of consumption levels expressed in terms of output per unit of efficient labour will be measured in such a dimension, as will be any variable which is constant along a balanced growth path. A less “technical” rationale can be provided for the maximization, on the part of the social planner, of a non-discounted sum of individual utilities with consumption levels expressed in terms of output per unit of efficient labour. Individuals live for a limited time span, but the social planner is assumed to be infinitely-lived. As the latter has to weigh the lifetime utility levels of individuals born at different periods, she can consider the following reasoning. An individual born at time t is endowed with a given amount of human capital, productivity, or efficiency units. On the one hand, her grandparents, who were born at, say, \(t-2\), had of course a lower level of human capital. They used to play with wooden trucks and rag dolls. On the other, her grandchildren, to be born at \(t+2\), will be endowed with a higher level of human capital, and will be able to enjoy fabulous computers and on-line games. When comparing the utilities achieved by these three generations, will the social planner only compare their respective consumption levels per unit of natural labour? Or will she instead take into account their level of “productivity” (i.e., human capital)? Although the de gustibus non disputandum clause of course applies, if the social planner wants to provide an equal treatment to all the generations involved, she may well consider that, if confronted with a wooden truck or a rag doll, a grandchild can be taken to be worse off relative to her grandparent. Just because the grandchild is endowed with a higher level of human capital, the social planner may claim that, in order to be on an equal footing with a previous generation, their respective consumptions per unit of efficient labour have to be the same. And this obviously requires a higher consumption per unit of  natural labour (i.e., the resources required to build a computer being much greater than those of a wooden truck/rag doll). If discounting is deliberately set aside and the social planner adheres to Utilitarian postulates, this reasoning immediately leads to the social objective of maximizing a function involving an infinite non-discounted sum of utilities derived from individual consumption per unit of human capital. This approach to the characterization of the entire optimal growth path implies a generalization of Del Rey and Lopez-Garcia (2013). Their analysis ignores initial conditions and focuses on the long-run  balanced growth path that maximizes the lifetime welfare (derived from consumption per unit of efficient labour) of a representative individual subject to the constraint that everyone else’s welfare is fixed at the same level. They show that along this optimal “Golden Rule” balanced growth path, a tax on education investments and positive pensions to the elderly are called for. As the analytics below will show, this “Golden Rule” balanced growth path is the one towards which an economy converges when commanded by a social planner who, given some initial conditions, maximizes a function involving a non-discounted sum of individual utilities defined over consumption per unit of efficient labour. It is well known, however, that the results characterizing the public policy that supports the optimal balanced growth path are not very instructive when, as in the present case, the focus turns from balanced growth paths to the entire time trajectory leading to them. In other words, results that pertain to long-run equilibria will in general be a poor way to approach optimal policy out of such states. An example is the well known Chamley (1986) and Judd (1985) result of an asymptotical zero capital income tax in the presence of infinitely-lived individuals, which however provides no indication concerning the time sequence of optimal capital income taxes. In this paper, we explicitly adopt a strict Ramsey approach, i.e., entailing non-discounting, in an endogenous growth model. Our purpose is to characterize those optimal policies that, once superimposed on private behaviour and interaction in the market-place, allow the social planner to decentralize the entire optimal growth path. We identify the optimal subsidies to the education acquired by younger individuals, and the lump-sum taxes to be levied on the working population and the retirees along the entire growth path, and enquire about their sign. We find that, in the current setting, education expenditures should not only be taxed along the optimal balanced-growth path but also along the entire optimal growth path (Proposition 1). Concerning pensions, it is shown that they will also be positive along the whole transition path leading to the optimal balanced growth path (Proposition 3). The sign of the lump-sum tax on the working middle-aged is, however, ambiguous. And, importantly, these results hold regardless of the initial conditions for physical and human capital in the situation taken as a starting point. We thus generalize our previous results to the whole growth path. A tax on education investments is certainly an odd result from the point of view of the received literature (Boldrin and Montes 2005; Docquier et al. 2007). In our setting, it results from the assumption of the existence of perfect credit markets where younger individuals can acquire any amount of desired education, and from the particular interaction between human and physical capital that takes place when we adopt the aforementioned normative criterion. A clear-cut sign of the pensions received by retirees is also in sharp contrast with the message emerging from overlapping-generations models with exogenous growth à la Diamond (1965). Indeed, in this latter case, whether optimal intergenerational transfers are to or from retirees is in general indeterminate, and depends on whether the laissez-faire capital-labour ratio is greater or less than its Golden-Rule counterpart (Samuelson 1975b). This paper shows that the optimality of education taxes and positive pensions is not an oddity related to the existence of a balanced growth path. On the contrary, these results apply to the whole optimal growth trajectory. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and analyzes the market equilibrium in the presence of government. Section 3 discusses the optimal growth path chosen by a social planner who maximizes an objective function involving a non-discounted sum of individual utilities defined over consumption per unit of efficient labour. Section 4 characterizes the optimal tax policies that allow to decentralize the optimal growth path. Section 5 concludes.",
128.0,2.0,Journal of Economics,17 December 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-018-0649-6,Heterogeneity and monetary policy,October 2019,Nurlan Turdaliev,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"While the representative-agent framework has been the workhorse in macroeconomics over the last several decades, economists have long been interested in heterogeneity (e.g., Huggett 1993; Rios-Rull 1995). It has recently become an important modelling approach in macroeconomics (e.g., Krusell and Smith 2006; Molico 2006; Heathcote et al. 2009; Carroll 2013; Ahn et al. 2018) as it was recognized that many important questions cannot be addressed without heterogeneity. In this paper, we build a simple model with heterogeneous population in which monetary policy is shown to have different effects on different groups of population. The only difference between agents in the economy is their productivity. We demonstrate that a central bank that cares about heterogeneous groups of agents according to their fractions in population, would choose a level of inflation that is higher than when population is homogeneous. The resulting allocation is shown to be below the Pareto frontier. This outcome arises because such a central bank would be to a certain extent preoccupied with the redistribution effect of its policy. This classic trade-off between efficiency and equity arises in the model only due to heterogeneity – it disappears once heterogeneity is removed. We next study the problem of optimal delegation of monetary policy pioneered by Rogoff (1985). A benevolent social planner chooses the weights on the utilities of the two types of agents that guides the behavior of the central bank. And the central bank than chooses optimal monetary policy. We consider two alternative social planners. The first has access to lump-sum redistribution applied to an equilibrium allocation and seeks to maximize social welfare. We show that the optimal delegation leads to an inflation rate lower than the one without delegation but higher than the efficiency level. The second social planner uses a criterion of Pareto unimprovability. Namely, a monetary policy is called Pareto improvable when its allocation is Pareto dominated by the allocation of another policy when some lump-sum redistribution to the latter can be applied. This social planner’s goal is to achieve the allocation of a Pareto unimprovable policy. We demonstrate that the optimal delegation in this case leads to a Pareto efficient allocation. In his seminal work, Rogoff (1985) argues that appointing a central banker who dislikes inflation more than society does allows to overcome the problem of inflation bias and improves social welfare. Our model features a similar outcome of optimal delegation: it is socially beneficial to appoint a central bank that is more inflation averse than society on average. The higher level of inflation aversion of such a central bank stems from a higher weight it puts on utility of the high-productivity workers. While in Rogoff’s paper the trade-off faced by the central bank stems from the assumption that the economy exhibits some sort of distortion (in, say, the labor market), the source of the trade-off in this paper is heterogeneity in productivity among workers. 
Friedman (1969) proposed a rule that minimizes the cost of holding currency by setting the nominal interest rate to zero. As the Friedman rule is at odds with the practice of central banks many of whom have adopted inflation targets somewhere between 2 and 3.5%, a literature has emerged to account for this discrepancy. Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2010) succeed in this regard by adding such frictions as incomplete tax systems, downward rigidity of prices, and the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates; these features induce the optimal policy to deviate from the Friedman rule. However, they report that it is hard to theoretically justify deviations of inflation from near-zero optimal inflation rates. Our work adds a modest contribution to this research. The paper finds that optimal delegation of monetary policy results in a departure from the Friedman rule. And perhaps more importantly, we also find a tendency of monetary authorities to deliver an inflation rate higher than in the case of homogeneous population. This effect is present in both the case with and without delegation of monetary policy. Thus we believe that heterogeneity may be an important modelling device in accounting for the difference between observed inflation rates and the near-zero optimal levels reported in Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2010), who use a homogeneous environment.Footnote 1 Justifying positive inflation rates on theoretical grounds has proven to be a challenge. For example, Coibion et al. (2012) confirm the findings of Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2010); in their work the optimal inflation rate is typically less than 2%. Similarly, for a standard U.S. calibration, Carlsson and Westermark (2016) find a Ramsey optimal inflation rate to be 1.16%. Di Bartolomeo et al. (2015) push this analysis further and in an environment with an incomplete tax system and realistic size and composition of public expenditure demonstrate that the optimal inflation rate varies between 2 and 12% depending on the transfers-to-GDP ratio. This work is one of only few in the literature that demonstrate how public finance can justify positive inflation targets. Chen et al. (2011) build an optimal growth model with resources spent on imagining future pleasures and show that in their environment the Friedman rule does not hold; they find that the optimal inflation rate is 2.09% and the welfare gain of switching from the zero-inflation regime to the optimal inflation is almost 7% per year. And finally, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2012) study inflation in a model with a foreign demand for domestic currency. Various calibrations of the model yield Ramsey optimal rates of inflation between 2 and 10%. Our work is not the first to find a higher inflation rate in heterogeneous environments. In Menna and Tirelli (2017), the social planner chooses a higher steady-state inflation rate than that obtained under the representative agent assumption. If theirs is an outcome of a simulation of a calibrated model, our paper exhibits this effect as a general theoretical result. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 present the model. Section 4 characterizes the Pareto frontier. Section 5 presents the main theoretical results. Section 6 summarizes and concludes. Proofs are in the “Appendix”.",1

For example, after testing positive for a gene mutation associated with a high risk of breast cancer, the actress Angelina Jolie decided to take a radical surgery: prophylactic double mastectomy. Some non-surgical procedures, like coronary angioplasty, although painful in the short run, reduce the probability of future heart attacks in patients with chronic cardiovascular diseases. Less drastic measures, such as the flu vaccination, produce the unintended effect of fever right after the injection, but significantly lowers the probability of contracting a flu virus in the future. This kind of preventive treatment is widely used and corresponds to behavior usually called “primary prevention” in medical and health care literature. The activities involved reduce current health level in exchange for a lower probability of falling into a future less healthy state and suffering from an illness. In such cases, the burden of primary prevention is mainly on a DM’s health. Despite this, to our knowledge, the literature on prevention always models the cost of preventive treatment only as a decline in DM’s wealth, and ignores the potential burden on DM’s health. The first aim of this work is thus to extend the analysis by studying a model where a DM’s utility is bivariate in terms of both wealth and health, and the activity of prevention in health (henceforth health prevention) generates both a cost in the wealth dimension and a cost in the health dimension. As first noted by Menegatti (2009) in a financial framework, prevention often takes place in a multiperiod context where a DM makes a preventive action in the present in order to reduce the probability of a negative event in the future. The same reasoning holds for the kind of health prevention discussed here. In a multiperiod model of health prevention, it seems natural to consider the role of saving as another important intertemporal choice for the DM to maximize her welfare over time. A joint study of health prevention and saving, however, has as yet never been conducted. One main reason for this fact is that, as emphasized by the literature on choice bracketing (e.g. Read et al. 1999), a DM tends to bracket choices of the same type together. The consequence of this is that the analysis in decision theory often distinguishes choices involving financial variables from choices involving health variables. Nonetheless, there are many questions on whether and how the bracketing process occurs. One strand of literature thus started analyzing risk management in multiple dimensions. For example, Liu and Menegatti (2017) recently investigate the substitutability or complementarity between optimal choices of health investment and financial investment when these two decisions are made simultaneously. Their analysis suggests that a similar approach can be applied to the current study of joint decisions on health prevention and saving. Moreover, a recent work by Peter (2017) shows that, in a univariate framework where utility only depends on wealth, the conclusions on optimal choice of financial prevention may change significantly in the presence of saving. It would thus be interesting to identify the conditions under which his findings carry over to a more general framework where utility is bivariate in terms of both wealth and health. Following the research line described above, this work examines the interaction between contemporaneous decisions of health prevention and saving. These two instruments of risk management are chosen in a two-period framework under a bivariate utility of wealth and health. We then introduce a mean-zero background risk in wealth (e.g. Eeckhoudt et al. 1996, 2012; Gollier and Pratt 1996) in the second period and analyze its effects: whether there is a motive of precautionary payment for each of the two choices, as shown by most of the literature on the single-choice problems of saving or prevention. To some extent, this risk can be used to reflect an exogenous risk regarding a DM’s future earnings. For instance, there could be a possible cut in social insurance programs on health care, a strategy often adopted by governments in an ageing economy.Footnote 1 We show that optimal choices of saving and health prevention can be either substitutes or complements, and that a key element distinguishing between these two cases is whether a DM is correlation averse or correlation prone. A further analysis shows that, when the interest rate changes, the reactions of optimal saving and health prevention depend on: (1) the relative importance of the substitution effect over income effect on saving; (2) the sign of correlation attitude (aversion or loving); (3) the alternative fact that the DM has positive saving or is borrowing. Lastly, several combinations of preferences concerning correlation aversion/loving, prudence/imprudence in wealth and cross-prudence/imprudence in health are also provided, in order to determine unambiguous effects of a background risk in wealth on the two optimal choices. This work is related to a wide literature on prevention, either in isolation or jointly with other decisions. Menegatti and Rebessi (2011), Steinorth (2011), Hofmann and Peter (2016) and Peter (2017) examine the interaction between simultaneous decisions about saving and financial prevention in a context where utility is univariate and only depends on wealth. The choice of health prevention alone is studied by Lee (2005) and Courbage and Rey (2006), while the interaction between health prevention and cure is analysed by Hennessy (2008), Menegatti (2014) and Brianti et al. (2018). None of these papers considers the case that the cost of prevention occurs in the health dimension, or introduces saving. In a broader sense, health-related decision problems also include models of health investment with a health cost by Eeckhoudt et al. (2007),Footnote 2 health investment with a financial cost by Denuit et al. (2011), and preventive treatment in the form of self-insurance in health by Courbage and Rey (2016),Footnote 3 all of which are one-choice models. Wang et al. (2015) study a general form of precautionary payment for stochastic improvements on future risk in a context where utility depends both on wealth and health. They also focus on a single instrument of risk management, either saving or prevention with a financial cost. As mentioned above, two instruments of risk management together in a context of bivariate utility are recently analyzed by Liu and Menegatti (2017). Two important features, however, distinguish that article from the present work. First, Liu and Menegatti (2017) study saving together with health investment, which is defined as a reduction in present health generating an increase in future health. Health investment thus does not affect the probability distribution of future health status and, consequently, is different from health prevention.Footnote 4 Moreover, unlike the present work, Liu and Menegatti (2017) do not analyze the effects of the presence of a background risk. As it studies the effect of a background wealth risk, our analysis is also related to Eeckhoudt et al. (2012), who examine the same issue in a model of prevention with a financial cost and do not take into account the intertemporal role of saving. Baiardi et al. (2014) study instead the effects on saving of different kinds of risk (including a background risk in health). Their work, however, introduces a single instrument of risk management and does not consider the role of prevention. Lastly, some linkages can be found between the analysis in the present paper and that of changes in risk in recent studies on one-period models of effort (Chuang et al. 2013; Crainich et al. 2016; Wong 2017). The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the model and analyzes optimal levels of health prevention and saving. Section 3 analyzes the effect a change in the level of the interest rate. Section 4 studies the impact of the introduction of a background wealth risk. Section 5 concludes.",5

A subsequent stream of literature translates the idea into oligopoly games to show that divisionalization may be an instrument to acquire a dominant position, or, replicate Stackelberg leadershipFootnote 1 (Corchón 1991) but, since all firms share this incentive, the outcome is definitely procompetitive and may even drive the industry towards perfect competition if divisionalization is costless (Polasky 1992).Footnote 2
Baye et al. (1996a, b) add up a fixed cost per-division to show that the resulting equilibrium, with the same finite number of divisions per-firm, can be socially efficient if the industry is a duopoly.Footnote 3 This literature relies on product homogeneity and linear variable costs. To the best of our knowledge, the only exception contemplating product differentiation in the representative consumer approach used in the bulk of the aforementioned literature is Ziss (1998), where each firm’s product is an imperfect substitute of the rivals’ products, in such a way that intra-firm (resp., inter-firm) competition takes place in differentiated (resp., homogeneous) products. Leaving aside the issue of social efficiency, Ziss (1998) treats the number of divisions as a continuous variable and illustrates the effect of product differentiation on the number of divisions at equilibrium. Ziss (1998) assumes products to be differentiated across firms but not across divisions and demonstrates the existence of a pure-strategy equilibrium with symmetric multidivisional firms, even in the limit case in which divisionalization is costless, for any degree of product differentiation. This finding has a twofold implication: (i) the result outlined in Polasky (1992) emerges only when the product is homogeneous also across firms and not only across the divisions belonging to the same firm; and (ii) the perfectly competitive outcome remains out of reach even when divisionalization costs are nil, provided products are not perfect substitutes. Moreover, Ziss (1998) also shows that the peak of the optimal per-firm number of divisions is sensitive to both industry structure and product differentiation. This approach, as well as the bulk of the aforementioned literature, focusses itself on the existence and characterization of optimal divisionalization, under the (somewhat implicit) assumption that firm will divisionalise themselves. By doing so, it overlooks the possibility for a firm facing a rival which goes multidivisional to respond by not divisionalising itself. This is the route we take here, to produce the following results. Accounting for the integer problem, the decision on divisionalization gives rise to a discrete-strategy game in which firms maintain the option not to do it, and indeed don’t divisionalise themselves if the cost of divisionalization is too high and product substitutability is low enough. It is worth stressing that an analogous result has emerged in the aforementioned debate. In particular, González-Maestre (2000, Props. 1(i) and 3(i), pp. 327–328) shows that single-division firms will appear at equilibrium in a homogeneous good duopoly where divisionalization and strategic delegation à la Vickers (1985) coexist. This is due to the fact that if the number of firms is small, then every firm obtains a relatively high fraction of industry profits; consequently, the possibility of becoming multidivisional is not appealing, as the incentive to increase market share is more than offset by the damage created by the increase in the intensity of market competition. Moreover, González-Maestre (2001, Prop. 1(ii), p. 1303) uses a spatial model à la Salop (1979) to find, amongst other things, that if the number of firms is sufficiently small as compared to the elasticity of the transportation cost function borne by consumers, then firms will remain single-division entities. Additionally, Corchón, (1991, Example 1, p. 2) using a hyperbolic demand function for a homogeneous good, proves that the number of divisions is undetermined in duopoly (which admits the case of single-division firms). There exists an intermediate range of values of fixed costs and product substitutability in which multiple equilibria arise, including, with a positive probability, asymmetric equilibria. The alignment of private and social preferences towards industry-wide divisionalization occurs only for sufficiently low levels of fixed costs and product differentiation. To keep the model manageable, we confine our attention to the duopoly case, although we also extend the analysis to the scenario in which, should firms speculate about becoming multidivisional, they could examine the possibility of activating a finite generic number of divisions. The interesting feature emerging from this slight generalisation consists in the fact that the choice between a single division or more than two does not give rise to a prisoners’ dilemma. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The model is laid out in Sect. 2. The solution of the game is outlined in Sect. 3. Section 4 deals with the welfare analysis. the extension to a generic number of divisions is assessed in Sect. 5. Section 6 contains some concluding remarks.",3

128.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,02 November 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-019-00683-7,"Vague, Richard: A brief history of doom",December 2019,Claudio Sardoni,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"For Vague, the fundamental driver of all major financial crises is the dynamics of private debt. An excessive expansion of lending and debts inevitably leads to excessive production and the consequent crisis when the prices of the overproduced gods start falling and so affecting the borrowers’ ability to service their debts. More specifically, Vague points out that in most crises, the dynamics of loans channelled to the real estate sector has been of great significance. Vague’s views about the general fundamental features of financial crises, as explicitly acknowledged by him, have a Minskyan flavor (see, e.g. Minsky 1986[2008]). Market economies are characterized by instability, with booms inevitably followed by crashes in which the behavior of the financial sector is crucial. Booms are boosted by a significant expansion of lending and the recessive phases are longer and deeper because of the agents’ attempt to ameliorate their financial positions by deleveraging.
 Vague holds that most mainstream economists have failed to see the decisive role that the dynamics of private debts, and their excessive expansion during booms, plays in the explanation of crises. He offers a number of reasons for the economists’ ‘blindness’. He argues that, in more recent times, this might have happened because, for a long span of time (1950–1980) private debt was very low and because of the very large influence of central banks, which tend to concentrate on the government finance and reserve accounts.Footnote 3 At a more general level, this might have happened because most economists tend to overlook, or ignore altogether, that private debt creates new money and thus affects demand. The possible reasons of the economists’ ‘blindness’ put forward by Vague are certainly acceptable but, it is argued here, there is an underlying more general explanation which, comprehensibly, is not taken into consideration in the book, given its nature and intents. This more general explanation has to do with the way in which economic theory in general, and macroeconomic theory in particular, evolved in the course of the twentieth century. During large part of the twentieth century, macroeconomics, which is the branch of economics naturally tasked with explaining fluctuations and crises, has almost ignored the role of banks and finance and their interactions with the real economy (see, e.g. Gertler 1988; Goodhart 2005–2006; Ingrao and Sardoni 2019). As a consequence, concerns about the debt structure of the private sector vanished as well, either by aggregating the positions of heterogeneous agents, or by assuming that the macroeconomic behavior of the economy could be effectively represented by models with a single representative agent. The essential reason why macroeconomics evolved in such a way is that, at the least since the 1950s, macroeconomics has been characterized by the attempt to set the analysis within the theoretical framework of a neo-Walrasian general equilibrium model (Ingrao and Sardoni 2019). Although it is undoubtedly correct to set macroeconomic analysis in a theoretical framework in which all the relevant interrelations among sectors and agents are taken into account, to identify such a framework with the neo-Walrasian (Arrow–Debreu) general equilibrium model clashes with the fact that in such a model money and, a fortiori, banks and finance cannot play any significant role. Something that has been clearly acknowledged by general-equilibrium theoreticians (see, e.g. Hahn 1965). Therefore, it is not surprising that the dynamics of the financial sector does not play an important role in mainstream explanations of crises. To be sure, things have changed in recent years. Especially after the 2008 crisis, mainstream macroeconomists have produced an impressive amount of models which contain a financial sector which interacts with the rest of the economy and tends to amplify and prolong the effects of the shocks that hit the economy. These contributions certainly are important and praiseworthy, but they still seem to be unable to provide a fully satisfactory account of the economic dynamics leading to crises. An important exponent of the current mainstream macroeconomics has recently stated: ‘none of the extensions of the New Keynesian model proposed in recent years seem to capture an important aspect of most financial crises—namely, a gradual build-up of financial imbalances leading to an eventual “crash” characterized by defaults, sudden-stops of credit flows, asset price declines, and a large contraction in aggregate demand, output, and employment. Most of the extensions found in the literature share with their predecessors a focus on equilibria that take the form of stationary fluctuations driven by exogenous shocks’ (Galí 2018, p. 107). The building-up of imbalances is exactly the factor that, in Vague’s view, explains the eventual eruption of financial crises. Vague argues that the building-up of financial imbalances—namely excessive lending and the accumulation of debts—is largely due to the competitive environment in which financial institutions operate.Footnote 4 The excessive expansion of lending by banks and other financial institutions is essentially due to their necessity to behave in such a way to not be expelled from markets which, at that time, appear as extremely profitable and not facing any serious risk of contraction. Mainstream macroeconomics, with its focus on equilibria and disturbances to them in the form of external shocks, is largely unable to look at the dynamics of such competitive processes, which are a fundamental feature of the world in which we live. This requires looking at competition as something deeply different from the abstract and static notion of competition underlying the neo-Walrasian equilibrium, even though some imperfections and frictions are superimposed on it to make models better reflect and rationalize some aspects of the actual economy.Footnote 5",

In the real world, such productive resources are often owned by public authorities: as a primary example for this, Agrawal et al. (2008) point out that Central governments own about 86% of the world’s forests and wooded areas. Nevertheless, many government-owned forests are managed as common property for multiple uses by local communities and community-based organizations, whereas many other forests classified under public ownership are effectively governed by logging companies.Footnote 1 In all these cases, a public authority regulates the access to the resource and its exploitation in various ways, by implementing public policies, which can also involve the output market. Of particular economic interest are tax/subsidy policies: since Hotelling (1931), it is well known that taxation can constitute a good policy in the commons. As a relevant real world example, consider forest taxation: a commonly observed class of forest taxes, especially in Scandinavia and central Europe, consists of harvest taxes, which are sometimes levied on the timber volume harvested.Footnote 2 Can a similar tax policy be designed in order to implement the first-best exploitation levels over time, if more firms share the access to the same resource and sell their products in the same market? To address this issue, we adopt a differential game approach and we focus on the piecewise linear Feedback Nash Equilibrium (FNE) of the oligopoly model. As for the dynamic evolution of the resource stock, which constitutes the state variable of the game, we adopt the specification proposed by Benchekroun (2003), which, at the same time, maintains the main properties of the logistic equation, while allowing for closed-form solutions. In this setting, we show that, by means of a simple linear Markov tax, more specifically a tax rate levied on the output, and specified as an affine function of the resource stock available at each time instant, the public authority can achieve the first-best outcome, i.e. the competing firms choose the production levels that maximize a social welfare functional, defined -as usual- as the discounted sum of consumer surplus and firms’ profits. It is worth noting that, in our framework, more specifically under the assumption that the produced output is proportional to the amount of exploited resource, the considered tax can be equivalently levied on the resource that is harvested at each time instant. Our contribution is related mainly to two streams of the literature. First of all, it builds on the differential oligopoly game studied by Benchekroun (2008), which generalizes the already mentioned duopoly model by Benchekroun (2003). Other investigations on the duopoly model are carried out by Fujiwara (2008), Colombo and Labrecciosa (2015), Lambertini and Mantovani (2016).Footnote 3 Several investigations and extensions of the oligopoly model can be found in Fujiwara (2011), Benchekroun et al. (2014), Lambertini and Mantovani (2014), Benchekroun and Gaudet (2015).Footnote 4 The mentioned papers contribute to the literature dealing with the exploitation of natural resources in a differential game framework [see, e.g., the survey paper by Van Long (2011)]. The other related strand of the literature is concerned with first-best tax/subsidy policies in a differential game framework. Benchekroun and Van Long (1998) address the problem of the emission of pollutants in an oligopoly game and show how to determine a linear Markov tax which leads the oligopolists to adopt the welfare-maximizing production plan.Footnote 5 Relatedly, Menezes and Pereira (2017) consider a duopoly model with differentiated products in which firms can undertake R&D activities in order to reduce the environmentally damaging emissions generated by the production activity, and determine the optimal mix of emissions tax and R&D subsidy. Thus, optimal regulation in a differential game framework has been studied in models with dynamic interactions between two sources of externalities: on the one hand, the pollutant emissions, on the other hand, the firms’ market power.Footnote 6 Other contributions [see Clemhout and Wan (1985), Akao (2008)] deal with the optimal taxation in the commons, assuming that agents maximize the utility of consumption: hence, the only externalities are due to the tragedy of the commons, and the tax policy is aimed to achieve the cooperative solution. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, the design of a first-best tax/subsidy policy in a dynamic game in which firms’ market power interplays with the externalities arising from sharing the access to a renewable productive resource has not been considered so far.Footnote 7 This paper aims to fill this gap within the literature. Our main results can be summarized as follows. Firstly, we show that, depending on the initial resource stock availability, the socially optimal extraction plan consists either in the endless repetition of the perfect competition output or, when the initial resource endowment is below a certain threshold, in output levels increasing over time and converging to the perfect competition one. By comparing this solution with the FNE of the (unregulated) oligopoly game considered in Benchekroun (2008), we find that the competing firms adopt a less conservationist approach for low values of the resource stock, due to the tragedy of the commons, while the opposite holds true for higher resource stock levels. As far as the first-best tax policy is concerned, we show that in a monopoly it takes the simple form of a state-independent tax, i.e. a constant per-unit tax, which actually turns out to be a subsidy. A similar, very simple, tax rule achieves the first-best solution in oligopoly only in steady-state, whereas an affine Markov tax can be designed to make the entire equilibrium path of the game coincident with the welfare-maximizing solution -in the most interesting subgames in which the initial state is low enough such that the tragedy of the commons is relevant-, in any industry comprising at least three firms. Interestingly, in a certain range of the resource stock, despite the output levels in the unregulated oligopoly are higher than it would be socially optimal, the production is subsidized, and this leads the firms to reduce the exploitation (up to the socially optimal level), in view of more conspicuous future subsidies: in brief, the positive dynamic externality associated with lowering the output, created by the considered policy, is able -together with the firms’ market power- to counterbalance the negative externality related to the common access to the resource, entailing lower output when the resource stock is relatively scarce. At the same time, for higher values of the resource stock, the mentioned subsidy leads the oligopolists to expand production above the Cournot static level, up to the socially desirable quantities. Thus, our results suggest that harvest taxes levied on the harvested amount of resource can be an effective policy in regulating the commons, provided that the tax rate is properly linked to the available resource stock. However, as mentioned above, these results do not hold in a duopoly: in the present setting, the first-best solution is not achievable in that case. Such a surprising result probably deserves further investigations. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we set-up the model; in Sect. 3, we characterize the first-best solution and compare it with the (unregulated) oligopoly model; in Sect. 4, we determine and discuss the optimal linear Markov tax; Sect. 5 concludes.",4

Encouraging continued work is often thought to be the main way of alleviating the current financial distress of pension systems. In fact, after a period of intense reform, many OECD countries have increased the official pension age above the age of 65 years and today it can be said that “67 has indeed become the new 65” (OECD 2015). The effects of these reforms however, are called into question by an important fact observed in the U.S.. Unlike the past, when a single spike in retirements at the full retirement age was observed (Gruber and Wise 1999), a second spike in retirements now occurs at age 62, which, under normal conditions, is the first age for early retirement (Gustman and Steinmeier 2005). The behavior of U.S. workers is puzzling because postponing retirement beyond age 62 is a good deal for most people, given that future Social Security benefits are increased at a better than the actuarially fair rate (Gustman and Steinmeier 2015; Shoven and Slavov 2012a, b). This fact has a potentially big impact on retirement age reform and requires investigation. The present analysis addresses this issue, starting from the preliminary observation that retirement is a form of insurance against labor income variability which allows workers who are eligible for retirement to replace an uncertain labor income with a certain stream of pension payments. This means that, similarly to what happens for precautionary saving, retirement can be used to reduce the disutility caused to a risk-averse agent by an uncertain level of labor income. Hence a precautionary motive for retirement may arise and be responsible for the observed retirement peak at age 62, because a risk averse worker may be pushed to plan an earlier exit from the labor market in the face of higher uncertainty in labor income.Footnote 1 We study the precautionary motive for retirement in a simple model where an agent chooses the level of saving and the timing of retirement in the presence of labor income risk. We assume that a pure redistributive pension system is in place where payments are certain and largely independent of individual contributions.Footnote 2 This type of system which primarily aims at granting its members a safe minimum benefit of a size known in advance, is a Beveridgean system which partially resembles the U.S. Social Security system.Footnote 3 Following a long tradition in decision theory which starts from Pratt (1964), we focus on the case of small risks. Our analysis characterizes and interprets the conditions for the precautionary motive for retirement and for saving to operate in two different settings. In the first setting, agent utility depends only on income, and a sufficiently low level of the index of absolute prudence is necessary for precautionary retirement. On the contrary, for the precautionary motive for saving to operate a sufficiently high index of absolute prudence is required, implying that for intermediate levels of the index, precautionary saving and precautionary retirement can coexist. In the second setting, agent utility also depends on leisure. Under the assumption of Edgeworth–Pareto complementarity between income and leisure, three conditions are sufficient for the precautionary motive for retirement and saving to jointly operate: prudence, a sufficiently low index of absolute prudence and cross-prudence in leisure. Our results enrich the description of the relationship between retirement and labor supplyFootnote 4 and suggest that a higher level of labor income risk, deriving from the effects of demographic change, may play a role in the increase in retirement at age 62. Papadopoulos et al. (2017) in fact point out that this risk has faced baby-boomers who are now approaching retirement age with diminished labor market prospects and decreased employment stability. This explanation is novel to the literature and contributes to the debate over the causes of the observed spike at age 62 where two alternative explanations are found. One explanation points at the deterioration in the macroeconomic scenario after the Great Recession, which caused workers suffering a negative earning shock to be pushed into early retirement due to reduced labor market opportunities (Card et al. 2014; Coile and Levine 2011a, b). A second explanation considers a microeconomic aspect related to worker preferences i.e. the heterogeneity in time preferences (Gustman and Steinmeier 2005). The presence in the population of individuals with high time preferences causes the spike in the retirement age at the first age for early retirement. The present analysis is mostly related to this last strand of the literature which focuses on the role of agent preferences, and in this context, introduces a new element, i.e preferences toward risk. A further contribution of the analysis is the characterization and interpretation of the conditions for precautionary retirement to crowd out precautionary saving. Analyzing the crowding out between retirement and saving is especially relevant in the light of the results obtained by Engen and Gruber (2001), and more recently by Chen et al. (2015). These authors find that unemployment benefits, which, like retirement, are a form of insurance against labor income risk, reduce the scope for precautionary saving. Our results show that in the case of precautionary retirement, this is not necessarily the case. In the setting where utility depends solely on income specific features of worker preferences, including prudence and temperance, are in fact crucial for the crowding out to occur, while in the setting where utility depends on income and leisure, no crowding out occurs. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the basic model where agent utility depends solely on income. Section 3 defines the conditions for the precautionary motive for retirement and for savings to operate, in the presence of labor income risk. Section 4 characterizes the mutual relationship between precautionary retirement and saving. Section 5 introduces agent preferences over leisure, and studies the sufficient conditions for the precautionary motives for saving and for retirement to operate jointly. Section 6 discusses the results, and Sect. 7 concludes.",1

Gryc,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The online auction marketplace of eBay has been well-studied in academic literature [see, for example, Hasker and Sickles (2010) for an overview of the subject]. The original auction mechanism of eBay involves a timed auction with a proxy bidding system and, as argued in Lucking-Reiley (2000), is well-modeled using a second-price payment rule. One option eBay gives sellers using this original auction mechanism [which we will call the California auction going forward, following Steiglitz (2007)] is to set a buy-out price, which eBay calls a “Buy-It-Now” price. Before any bids are placed on the item (or a secret reserve is met in the case the seller sets a secret reserve), any bidder can choose to pay the buy-out price and win the item immediately and with certainty. Giving sellers such an option seems, at first blush, a curious decision by eBay, as buy-out prices put a ceiling on the possible revenue the seller (and thus eBay) can earn from the auction. This initial intuition is validated by the fact proven by Mathews (2006) and Gupta and Gallien (2006) that, in their respective models of the California auction, risk-neutral and time-insensitive sellers facing risk-neutral and time-insensitive bidders whose values are independent and identically distributed will in equilibrium choose a buy-out price higher than any bidder is ever willing to bid.Footnote 1 But this theoretical model is too idealized to likely capture real world behaviors, and by changing the conditions above authors found theoretical reasons why sellers might post buy-out prices that buyers would use with a positive probability.Footnote 2 The two variations that authors have considered that result in buy-out prices that buyers would consider in equilibrium are time sensitivity and risk aversion. Mathews (2004, 2006), and Gupta and Gallien (2006) each considered models with a time sensitivity component to both sellers and bidders. With respect to time sensitivity, since a bidder using the buy-out price ends the California auction immediately, an auction in which the buy-out price is utilized will end more quickly than one where it is not utilized. As one might expect, these papers showed that time-sensitive sellers are willing to offer lower buy-out prices that time-insensitive buyers in equilibrium will exercise with a positive probability. Conversely, time-sensitive bidders are willing to exercise higher buy-out prices that will increase a time-insensitive seller’s expected revenue. The models utilized in Mathews (2004, 2006), and Gupta and Gallien (2006) are continuous-time models, a complicating but necessary component as modeling time-sensitivity requires utility to depend on time. The second variation that results in buy-out prices that will actually be exercised in equilibrium is risk aversion. This situation was considered in Budish and Takeyama (2001), Maslov (2018), Mathews and Katzman (2006), and Reynolds and Wooders (2009). Mathews and Katzman (2006) examined risk aversion in sellers and showed that a risk-averse seller will set a buy-out price low enough that risk-neutral bidders in equilibrium will exercise it with positive probability. Both Budish and Takeyama (2001) and Reynolds and Wooders (2009) consider risk-averse bidders with risk-neutral sellers. Budish and Takeyama (2001) consider a setting where there are only two bidders whose values can only equal two possible constants. In this case, they prove that a seller can increase his expected revenue in a second-price auction by including a suitable buy-out price. Furthermore, and more surprisingly, they prove that with a suitable buy-out price, a second-price auction with a buy-out price will result in more expected revenue than a first-price auction. This result lies in stark contrast with one of the classic results proven by Riley and Samuelson (1981) that when bidders are risk-averse (and have values drawn from a continuous distribution) the second-price auction generates less expected revenue than a first-price auction. Maskin and Riley (1985) confirmed this classic result in the same discrete setting considered by Budish and Takeyama (2001). To summarize, a first-price auction generates more expected revenue than a second-price auction when bidders are risk-averse. However, Budish and Takeyama (2001) showed that adding a buy-out price on the second-price auction can reverse this relationship. We note here that Budish and Takeyama (2001) did not investigate whether a well-chosen buy-out price could increase the expected revenue of a first-price auction. A natural question to ask with these results is whether they hold for bidder values drawn from continuous distribution. Reynolds and Wooders (2009) verified that the first result of Budish and Takeyama (2001) holds in a continuous case by showing that when bidders exhibit constant absolute risk aversion (CARA), then a range of suitably chosen buy-out prices will result in increased expected revenue for the seller. This result gives a satisfying reason why a seller would include tempting buy-out prices in a California auction. Furthermore, Maslov (2018) also indicates buy-out prices will increase expected seller revenue when bidders exhibit constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) in an environment where items are sold both in second-price auctions without a buy-out price and posted prices.Footnote 3 We will say more about generalizing the second result of Budish and Takeyama (2001) below. Thus far we have concentrated on the known theory surrounding buy-out prices in a California auction. However, buy-out prices appear elsewhere on eBay. Indeed, this main focus of this current study is not buy-out prices attached to the California auction, but to another selling format in the eBay marketplace. eBay also allows sellers to list items for a fixed price. That is, these are items with a “Buy-It-Now” price but no California auction attached to it. However, sellers can also attach a “Best Offer” option to the fixed-price listing, creating a “Buy-It-Now or Best Offer” mechanism. In these auctions, bidders make offers that a seller has up to 48 h to address by either accepting the offer, rejecting the offer, or making a counteroffer. A bidder can make up to five offers and a seller can make up to four counteroffers.Footnote 4 The fifth offer the bidder makes is a take-it-or-leave-it final offer. If an offer is accepted, the bidder pays her offer and receives the item. Where the California auction with the “Buy-It-Now” option is essentially a second-price mechanism with a buy-out price, the “Buy-It-Now or Best Offer” auction is a first-price mechanism with a buy-out price. The “Buy-It-Now or Best Offer” mechanism is also popular with sellers. In Table 1 below, we give the number of eBay listings in certain categories that eBay labels as “Auctions” (which is our California auction) and “Best Offer” which is our “Buy-It-Now or Best Offer” auction. Note that in the categories included that the number of “Best Offer” listing far exceeds the number of “Auction” listings, often by more than a factor of four. In this study, we are interested in comparing expected revenues between a second-price auction with a buy-out price (like the California auction with a Buy-It-Now price) with a first-price auction with a buy-out price (like a “Buy-It-Now or Best Offer” mechanism) when bidders are risk-averse. A first-price auction with a buy-out price admittedly simplifies many of the aspects of the “Buy-It-Now or Best Offer” auction, but we will argue in the next section as well as in the discussion section that the study of the former gives us insight into the latter. To that end, we will first consider the case where bidders draw their values with a continuous distribution. In this case, we derive equilibrium strategies for risk-averse bidders who exhibit either CARA or CRRA for a first-price auction with a buy-out price. We will show that for any fixed buy-out price, the first-price auction with the buy-out price earns more expected revenue than the second-price auction with a buy-out price (Theorem 2). This result yields an initial explanation to why sellers generally seem to prefer the “Buy-It-Now or Best Offer” mechanism to the California auction, as seen in Table 1. As mentioned previously, both Budish and Takeyama (2001) and Reynolds and Wooders (2009) show that a well-chosen buy-out price can increase seller revenue in a second-price auction when buyers are risk-averse. Here we will prove that this property does not generally hold in the first-price setting when bidder values are drawn from a continuous distribution. Specifically, we show that under some modest conditions on the continuous distribution of values (that is, that distribution is log-concave and twice differentiable), to maximize expected revenue a risk-neutral seller will set a buy-out price above what any bidder exhibiting either CARA or CRRA would ever utilize in equilibrium (Theorems 3, 4). That is, a seller cannot increase their revenue in a first-price auction by including a buy-out price even when bidders show some form of risk-aversion. Note that since expected revenue is maximized in the first-price auction when the buy-out price is set higher than any equilibrium bidder would bid, we see that if bidders exhibit CARA and have a continuous distribution of values that is log-concave and twice differentiable then a second-price auction with a buy-out price always generates less expected revenue than a first-price auction (Corollary 1). This shows that the second result of Budish and Takeyama (2001) mentioned above does not generally hold when bidders have a continuous distribution of values. The above result presents a discrepancy between the continuous model and the discrete model of Budish and Takeyama (2001), which motivates the question on how a buy-out option in a first-price auction affects seller revenue in the discrete model. We model this auction in the two-bidder-two-value setting of Maskin and Riley (1985) utilized in Budish and Takeyama (2001) and show that in this case a well-chosen buy-out price can increase seller revenue in the first-price auction when buyers are risk-averse (Theorem 6). In fact, the optimal buy-out price is the same for both first and second-price auctions and the two auctions generate the same amount of expected revenue with this optimal buy-out (Corollary 2). Considering these results across the continuous and discrete settings, we see that the first-price auction with an optimally chosen buy-out price will generate as much or more expected revenue than a second-price auction with an optimally chosen buy-out price. Thus these theoretical results support the thesis that a first-price mechanism is superior to a second-price mechanism in an online marketplaces where sellers are risk-neutral and buyers are risk-averse and explain to the prevalence of “Buy-It-Now or Best Offer” listings on eBay over the more traditional California auction. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we detail the specifics of the first-price with buy-out auction model for bidders whose values are continuously distributed and state Theorem 1 which gives the equilibrium strategies for bidders under CRRA and CARA risk profiles. In Sect. 3 we give our results on expected revenue in this continuous model that are stated above. In Sect. 4, we analyze a two-bidder-two-value discrete model for the first-price with buy-out auction comparable to the model considered in Budish and Takeyama (2001) by deriving equilibrium strategies for this case and give the results on expected revenue stated above for this discrete model. In Sect. 5 we discuss these results and how they relate to eBay. Finally, in the “Appendix” we give formal proofs of the lemmas and theorems found in the paper.",3
129.0,2.0,Journal of Economics,05 September 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-019-00678-4,Does add-on presence always lead to lower baseline prices? Theory and evidence,March 2020,Marco Savioli,Lorenzo Zirulia,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Add-ons, i.e. optional goods and services that consumers can add (at a price) to a baseline product, are ubiquitous. In the hotel industry, the price for a room typically does not include additional services such as telephone calls or minibar items. Similarly, airline tickets, especially in the case of low-cost carriers, do not include on-board meals. Appliance stores offer additional warranties to consumers after they buy. A long list of other examples could be provided. Often, prices for such add-ons are difficult (or costly) to observe before the baseline product is bought. This gives firms market power when selling add-ons even if the baseline product is offered in competitive markets. Consequently, add-on prices tend to be high and firms compete on the baseline product price, which then tends to be low. This pricing scheme is the well-known “razor and blades” strategy, named after another typical example of a baseline product (i.e. the razor) and add-on (i.e. the blade). The literature on add-on pricing is as rich as the business practice (Lal and Matutes 1994; Verboven 1999; Ellison 2005; Gabaix and Laibson 2006; Shulman and Geng 2013), focusing both on firms’ strategy and the implications for antitrust and consumer policy (Shapiro 1995; Gabaix and Laibson 2006). Our focus is on the former. In particular, the aim of our paper is to clarify the effect that offering add-ons has on baseline prices. The contribution of our paper is both at the theoretical and empirical level. At the theoretical level, we provide a model of add-on pricing in a duopoly context with two distinctive features. First, we consider the choice of offering the add-on, if this entails a fixed cost. Second, we allow firms to have varying degrees of market power over the add-on, associated with the ability to capture the value that consumers obtain from such additional goods. The main result of our analysis is that the presence of add-ons does not necessarily lead to a lower price for the baseline product. On the one hand, when both firms offer the add-on, the price for the baseline product is lower compared to the case when the add-on is not offered. Moreover, the higher the market power over add-ons the lower the price for the baseline product. These results are intuitive and follow quite directly from the “razor and blades” argument that is frequently put forth in the literature. However, in asymmetric equilibria, in which only one firm offers the add-on, things change. The firm offering the add-on unambiguously obtains higher profits, but its price for the baseline product can be higher or lower depending on the degree of market power in the add-on market: baseline product prices are lower only when firms can extract ex-post a significant share of consumer surplus. Intuitively it can be argued on the one hand that the add-on provides higher utility to consumers, thus creating a competitive advantage for the firm offering it, which consequently can fix higher baseline product prices. On the other hand, the additional value to the firm that each consumer brings through the add-on leads to more aggressive pricing. The second effect prevails only if the proportion of surplus that the firm can appropriate is sufficiently large. At the empirical level, we estimate a hedonic price function on a dataset of cruises offered worldwide, assessing the extent to which the offer of a specific type of add-on impacts baseline prices. Therefore, we focus on the implications of the model when the equilibrium is asymmetric, for which the cruise industry constitutes an ideal setting. In fact, in this industry, add-ons abound and the data show that the revenues associated with such add-ons are a fundamental source of profitability. However, add-ons differ with respect to the share of consumer surplus that can be captured by firms. In line with the model, as consumers have few alternatives while on board, we find those activities associated with on-board sales reducing cruise ticket prices. This is the case for casinos and shops. On the contrary, as travellers can self-organise and other businesses can compete, market power is limited for shore excursions, for which we find a positive effect on price. Our model predictions are also supported by additional regression analysis in which we introduced two proxies of market power for shore excursions. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the theoretical and empirical literature on add-on pricing. The model is described and solved in Sect. 3, while the empirical analysis is conducted in Sect. 4. Section 5 provides further implications arising from our results. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",

Should the public school quality distribution be degenerated so as to provide everyone with the same quality of education? Does this policy produces efficient outcomes? If the school quality distribution is not uniform, who should receive the best school places in the economy? What is the impact of these educational distortions on the labor and education markets? According to Jencks (1988), the public educational supply policy may be designed in many different ways. It may be conceived as an egalitarian and democratic system that gives equal opportunities to all individuals in the economy, regardless of their social and racial origin or differences in their economic background. Alternatively, it can be designed from a moralistic and compensatory view, giving students with worse initial conditions the best school choices available in the economy or even from an opposite perspective, giving the best students the best school options. Finally, from a utilitarian perspective, the educational system may also be designed in such a way that individuals have full freedom to apply for all school options available in the economy.Footnote 1 Thus, only the set of individuals who value education the most will choose the best schooling options. Despite the noticeable attractiveness of fair educational systems, where, in theory, social and economic contexts have no impact on the quality of the school attended, what is observed is the uneven provision of school quality within and between countries. Individuals with high per-capita income or living in richer or better-managed regions often have access to the best school, while those with inferior socioeconomic background study at the worst schools.Footnote 2 The link between the heterogeneous supply of local-based public goods and different socioeconomic conditions has emerged to explain the inequality of educational outcomes observed between regions and individuals with different characteristics.Footnote 3 According to this view, if individuals value school quality and this is a local public good, only those agents with greater financial conditions can afford to live in regions close to the best schools.Footnote 4 Now, since these optimal residential decisions lead to the agglomeration of individuals with the best socioeconomic background in places with the best schools, there is a positive externality acting in those regions. This externality generates an additional increase in the quality of these better schools, leading to greater educational inequality and the propagation of income dispersion in the economy.Footnote 5 An alternative to combat the previous problem of inequality of educational opportunities is the public school choice policy, considering that, in case of oversubscription, the assignment of students to school places occurs through a non-selective and biased process, such as admission lotteries.Footnote 6 The proponents of this theory argue that since it allows parents to freely choose their children’s school from all available schools in the economy, including those outside their residence area, it implies a reduction in barriers that may reduce school enrollments and aggregate students’ performance. According to Lee (1997) and Barseghyan et al. (2014), this policy brings at least three benefits to the education system. First, by inducing competition among schools, it generates quality and efficiency gains to the whole school system. A second advantage of this policy is that as it increases the range of school options available to each family, it is expected to cause an increase in school enrollment. Finally, one last advantage of this policy is to promote equity in the educational system, allowing everyone to have the same initial opportunities and thus compete equally for better economic prospects. The use of admission lotteries as a mechanism to solve the problem of oversubscription to elite schools also has its praise and criticism.Footnote 7 According to Stone (2013), it is a fair and impartial mechanism, allowing any student to have the same chance of joining an elite school.Footnote 8 This also insures that students’ academic performance does not depend on their race, gender or family background, but is a function of their academic effort only. However, this advantage is also, for many, a criticism. If the number of students seeking school openings is too extensive, what is the impact of selecting them that way? Isn’t the efficiency of the whole education system being degraded with this policy? The present work examines these questions, suggesting an answer to the impacts of educational supply policy distortions on the labor markets. We are particularly interested in assessing the aggregate impact of open enrollment and school equity policies by answering the following questions: What is their impact on the aggregate demand for education and the quality of the educated workforce? Do they have a positive impact on the labor market, in particular by reducing unemployment and increasing wage rates? Do they produce efficient outcomes in both the labor and the educational markets? Specifically, we build a macroeconomic model to study the effects of an open enrollment policy and the elimination of admission lotteries on the individual decisions to study and their impacts on the labor market.Footnote 9 In our model, there are two productive sectors: educated and non-educated.Footnote 10 All agents are identical, except for their educational costs. An individual who decides to study works exclusively in the qualified sector and the set of school vacancies available in the economy is heterogeneous with respect to quality. Following the empirical evidence, we assume that the public school quality is supplied through a policy that assigns the best school places to individuals with the lowest educational costs and the worst school places to individuals with the highest schooling cost in the economy, and when there is oversubscription, the admission decision is made through lotteries.Footnote 11 We show, in a general equilibrium model with endogenous schooling decisions and labor market frictions, that these two policies generate ambiguous results. In particular, an open enrollment policy generates an increase in the mass of educated workers, but has ambiguous effects on their quality. Whenever the policy impact on the aggregate demand for education is stronger than the additional school quality gains, there is a reduction in the average quality of the educated workforce. This reduction, in turn, generates an additional distributional effect in the labor market, by reducing the relative attractiveness of the skilled sector. Assuming that there is an increase in the quality of the skilled labor force after the policy implementation, this implies an increase in the wage rate and the unemployment rate and greater job creation dynamics in this segment. The same impacts on the wage rates arise if we eliminate the admission lottery policy. However, it now has strong effects on the composition of the skilled workforce in the economy. The skilled labor force is now composed of individuals with the highest educational costs, while the unskilled workforce is made up of individuals with the lowest costs of schooling in the economy.Footnote 12 We also have shown that this policy generates ambiguous results on the skilled unemployment rate. In addition to the previous inefficient outcome, we also find that the use of admission lotteries generates overemployment in the unskilled sector. In turn, we detect that whenever this admission policy induces an excess of demand for education, so that it exceeds the efficient measure of educated individuals, there is underemployment in the schooled sector compared to the social planners’ solution. To better understand our previous results, consider an economy with a distorted school supply policy that provides its best school places to individuals with the lowest schooling costs, and in case of oversubscription, uses admission lotteries to select students. The government then puts in place a policy that increases the set of school options available to all agents in the economy. The expansion of the school supply generates a direct increase in average quality of the skilled labor force. However, the government school supply policy also exerts an indirect and negative effect on the economy. Since there is an increase in the average quality of schools available to each agent, it becomes more advantageous to study. The higher education demand thus reduces the average quality of the skilled labor force and indirectly depresses the skilled sector due to the composition effect.Footnote 13 The final outcome depends on these two opposing effects. Notice that the change in the average quality of the skilled labor force is closely related to the shape of both the school quality and the schooling cost distributions. If the additional school quality gains are greater than the increase in the measure of students, the policy is followed by an increase in the average quality of the skilled labor force. This may happen, for instance, if the two distributions are asymmetric and the school quality distribution has negative skewness, while the schooling cost distribution has a tail to its right. Our model is related to a growing literature that studies the determinants of workers’ investments in education and how the decentralized equilibrium compares to the social optimum outcome. On the one hand, some authors have argued that the decentralized equilibrium is characterized by a low and inefficient level of human capital investments. Thus, government interventions are necessary to reduce inefficiency, as suggested by Acemoglu (1996).Footnote 14 On the other hand, some authors present evidence of high and inefficient levels of education investments. Charlot and Decreuse (2005), for instance, sustain that when education investments and labor market returns are positively related, the overeducation phenomenon arises. They argue that as the size of the educated workforce increases, there will be a reduction in the average skills of both the schooled and unschooled segments of the labor force, which implies a decrease in firms’ incentives hire more workers. They conclude that any welfare improvement policy should be designed to deter low-skilled individuals from entering the schooled segment of the economy.Footnote 15 We show that this result can be found in a more general model with a distorting school supply and an endogenous demand for education. In particular, whenever the decentralized demand for education is lower than the efficient demand, the optimal policy is the one proposed by Charlot and Decreuse (2005), that is, a reduction in the mass of individuals who seek schooling. The present model is also related to the recent contributions of Lee (2015) and Benegas and Corrêa (2017). The first builds a partial equilibrium model to assess the impact of school tracking policies on student effort and academic achievements, while the second examines the impact of a first-order improvement in school quality distribution within the mass of educated workers and the aggregate productivity. This article shows that a policy that seeks both equity and expansion of the school supply, such that everyone can access all schools available in the school system, generates ambiguous results in the economy. On the one hand, there is a direct and positive impact on the average productivity of the educated workforce employed in the skilled sector, but there is also an indirect and negative effect that leads to a reduction in the average productivity resulting from the education demand. There is extensive literature addressing the issue of individual heterogeneity in two-sector and imperfect labor market models with different labor and product market assumptions. Many of these works address the impacts of different levels of market segmentation on the aggregate equilibrium and economic welfare. Blasquez and Jansen (2008) and Albrecht et al. (2010), for instance, argue that there is a negative externality generated by a higher measure of workers that self-select in education in the unskilled segment of the economy. They contend that schooling investments affect both average productivity in the skilled sector and labor market tightness in the skilled and unskilled sectors. In turn, Moen (2003) and Charlot et al. (2013) state that the main problem related to human capital investments is not that skilled workers hurt unskilled employees, but the opposite. There is also a recent literature that aims to explain the reasons for the recent rise in wage inequality among firms, sectors and educational levels. For instance, Acemoglu (2003) argues that this phenomena is closely related to a recent increase in the skill premium induced by skill-biased technological progress, while Altonji (2014) and Card et al. (2013) suggest that to better understand the recent trend in wage inequality it is necessary to study in-group wage dispersion and the way in which firms and workers self-select their jobs. Our paper is related to this previous literature. The more dispersed the public school quality distribution is in our model, the greater is the wage inequality among individuals who decide to study. In turn, the more exclusive the schooling option is, the higher the wage inequality among groups tends to be. Besides this introduction, this paper has four more sections. In the next one we introduce the benchmark model and describe the decentralized equilibrium. The following section shows the impacts of educational policy distortions. Section 4 characterizes the social welfare allocations while the last section contains the main concluding remarks.",

The assessment aims to compare the performance of 15-year-old students through standardized tests of practical knowledge in reading, mathematics, and science. More precisely, “the tests are designed to gauge how well the students master key subjects in order to be prepared for real-life situations in the adult world” (see http://www.oecd.org/pisa/aboutpisa/). PISA and other standardized assessments of educational attainment guide education policymaking at both national and international levels. To inform policy makers and the public, the scores of students in a country are frequently averaged to show how the averages evolve over time and how individual countries perform when compared to other countries. For example, Mervis’ (2010) country ranking, based on PISA 2009 math scores, suggests that students from Shanghai posted the top scores in mathematics, with an average score of 600, followed by Singapore (562), Hong Kong (555), Korea (546), Chinese Taipei (543), Finland (541), Liechtenstein (536), Switzerland (534), Japan (529), and Canada (527). The 2009 ranking and an update based on PISA 2012 are provided in Table 1. The table suggests that the ranking is relatively stable over time: The ranking of the first three countries is the same in both years, and only two top-ten countries from 2009, Finland and Canada dropped out in 2012, replaced with Macao China and the Netherlands. The obtained ranking is interpreted in the sense of performance differences in performance. The OECD (2012a, p. 4) argues, “Shanghai-China has the highest scores in mathematics …. Singapore, Hong Kong-China, Chinese Taipei, Korea, Macao-China, Japan, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and the Netherlands … round out the top ten performers in mathematics” (OECD 2012a, p. 4). The practice of cross-country (and inter-temporal) comparisons of average scores as a proxy of students’ average ability ignores that the information obtained on abilities in such scores is ordinal: Unlike quantitative variables, such as student height, ability does not have a natural unity of measure.Footnote 1 The ordinal measurement limits the information content of the scores. For example, suppose Sandra’s math score is 500 and Peter’s 250. This means Sandra performed better than Peter. It does not mean she performed twice as well. The implications of the practice to average ordinal scores to obtain country rankings is an issue with a long research tradition (for early papers, see Stevens 1946; Lord 1975; Spencer 1983; Klein 1987). As early as 1946, Stevens argues, “the statistical manipulations that can legitimately be applied to empirical data depend upon the type of scale against which the data are ordered” (p. 677), and continues, “It is proper to point out that mean and standard deviations computed on ordinal scale are in error to the extent that the successive intervals on the scale are unequal in size” (p. 679). In the same spirit, Spencer (1983) argues, “test scores often represent only ordinal rather than cardinal (or interval) attributes, and therefore, average scores may be difficult or impossible to interpret meaningfully” (p. 249).Footnote 2 In this paper, we make two contributions to the above research. On the theoretical side, we suggest two procedures for ranking groups based on ordinal information, thus enabling us to understand the possible range of the rank of a country within a ranking. The procedures have the desirable features of being informative and robust. By “informative,” we mean that by means of quantile comparisons, they consider the scores throughout the entire score distribution of ordered students. A ranking criterion like the median score, in contrast, ignores much of this information. By “robust,” we mean that the obtained ranking is insensitive to monotonic increasing transformations of the students’ underlying ordinal test scores. A ranking by country-specific mean scores violates robustness (but is informative). The central ingredient of the procedures is an honor guard, also known as Pen’s parade, borrowed from the literature on economic inequalities. Suppose that every student has a height (i.e., ability equal to their performance in an exam (the taller the better), which are sorted and lined up based on the order of performance. The sight we see is the honor guard. By normalizing the abscissa to be of size one and assigning every student the same weight, the honor guard can be derived from the cumulative distribution function by swapping abscissa and ordinate. The two proposed procedures work as follows: Random-number generator (RNG). Each country is compared to each other country in a pairwise manner. When comparing country A to country B, imagine a point being assigned for the performance of each quantile of the student population. If the performance threshold for the 1st quantile of country A is higher than country B, country A gets a point. If the performance threshold for the 2nd quantile of country B is higher than country A, country B gets a point. We repeat this for all quantile ranks, accumulate the points and then divide by the number of quantiles. Hence, 1 full point is granted if the honor guard of the country of interest dominates the guard of the comparison country (first-order stochastic dominance, FOSD). Finally, for every country, the points received from every pairwise comparison of countries is accumulated and the countries are ranked in decreasing order of points accumulated over pairwise comparisons. Because the rank of a country is determined by the probability that the students in this country outperform the students in the competitor countries, the procedure is equivalent to the idea that an examiner uses a random number generator to set the difficulty distribution of the questions in the exam. Substitute for variance (SFV). This procedure provides a means to quantify the probability that a country would outperform X of Y competitor countries, assuming that the part of the ability distribution assessed is randomly drawn. The procedure relies on best and worst possible ranks, a country substitute for the variance. Within this range, the probability that a country is better (worse) ranked than competitor countries depends on the share of the country’s students who rank higher than (lower than) students from other countries. Further, the procedure allows an assessment of the probabilities that a country is ranked better or worse than a particular number of comparison countries. On the empirical side, we implement the two procedures and compare the derived rankings with the standard ranking procedure, the ranking of countries in decreasing order of average test scores. The PISA 2012 data on student achievements in math serve as our empirical database. Thus, we focus on OECD countries. The obtained country rankings are sensitive to the ranking procedure applied. As a first example, consider the Netherlands. According to average test scores, students from the Netherlands are ranked fourth. This rank is consistent with an RNG-based ranking, but the SFV procedure suggests that the possible rank varies between 1 and 15. Our paper relates to previous research on achievement scores in eco- and psychometrics. On the theoretical side, the closest paper to ours appears to be Nielsen (2015). He assesses the sensitivity of standard measures of achievement gaps to violation of the cardinality assumption and defines a distance measure over possible weighting functions to derive the “worst-case bounds for the bias in the estimated achievement gap” (Nielsen 2015, p. 1). On the empirical side, several papers investigate the sensitivity of achievement gaps or achievement changes to order-preserving transformations (Lord 1975; Lang 2010; Bond and Lang 2013; Cascio and Staiger 2012; Reardon 2007, 2011; Nielsen 2015).Footnote 3 The structure of the paper is as follows: Sect. 2 describes the ordinal properties of scores and its implications for country rankings. Section 3 describes procedures for deriving robust and informative country rankings from an ordinal variable.

In fact, television and press markets exhibit a very limited degree of price competition as they compete primarily on product attributes, and in particular, quality. However, as the OECD points out: “Access to premium content is a serious bottleneck and a source of market power. In particular, premium sport events (e.g. Olympic Games or football matches) and new releases of movies, which have no substitutes, are essential to the successful functioning of pay TV providers. Barriers to accessing content can arise [...] Premium content may also have an impact on competition in other non-TV markets [...]” (OECD 2013). Given that premium content such as important sporting events and television series are examples of quality in broadcasting (see, D’Annunzio 2017), the nature of competition among media platforms in terms of the quality of content, as well as the possibility of preventing entry by means of investing in quality, deserves closer attention in the media market debate. First, it is worth elucidating what quality is in media markets. At first glance, it appears to be associated with two different dimensions, namely technology and content. Indeed, technological innovations have greatly affected broadcasting quality, for example through higher-definition images and interactive services. Meanwhile, the quality of content is associated with providing not only entertainment but also education, learning, and cultural excellence, without ignoring niche interests (Costera Meijer 2005; Collins 2007). There is clear evidence in broadcasting that lowering production values to reduce costs tends to greatly reduce the appeal of a program to viewers (Barwise and Ehrenberg 1988; Jankowski and Fuchs 1996). Analogously, in the press market newspapers of higher quality enjoy higher circulation (Lacy and Fico 1991; Lacy and Martin 2004). However, providing high-quality broadcast programs and a high-quality bundle of press content is extremely expensive (Liu et al. 2004).Footnote 1 Second, according to the above assessment of media quality, there is the puzzle of determining which economic model is better suited to the analysis of media quality. In fact, there is no clear distinction between horizontal and vertical dimensions in media content; furthermore, what is conventionally defined as quality is not always assigned a positive value by all individuals. For example, were quality to be measured in terms of the extent to which a program informs and educates people (e.g., BBC programsFootnote 2), it would be controversial to assume that all individuals considered this to be a net benefit.Footnote 3 In this case, it would be more accurate to refer to a preference for variety and to use a horizontal differentiation framework.Footnote 4 In contrast, clear examples of a vertical dimension to quality are the accuracy and immediacy of information, the presence of star journalists, and the ability to screen live performance events (including sports, music, and dance). Finally, taking the crucial role of quality as a given, it is important to note that markets for news and entertainment are idiosyncratic examples of two-sided markets with media platforms competing on both sides. Platforms, as broadcasters or newspapers, compete for both audienceFootnote 5 and advertisers in order to maximize their profits; that is, they need to attract individuals as well as advertisers. On the one hand, advertising is typically considered to be a nuisance for the audience, or in other words, a negative externality; on the other hand, the audience exerts a positive externality on advertisers. The present paper aims to analyze the strategic competition between platforms in a two-sided market characterized by vertical differentiation. We present a duopoly setup in which media platforms competing simultaneously to attract the audience set the advertising levels, subscription fees, and endogenous quality provision. Then, by considering a sequential duopoly setting in which the platforms move sequentially, we investigate how the possibility of potential entry affects not only the dominant position of the incumbent but also the quality provision of each platform and the degree of product differentiation. Finally, we focus on the incumbent platform’s selection of quality as an entry-deterring strategic device. In this respect, we explore the incumbent platform’s strategy of “limit quality” to maintain its dominant position in the presence of network externalities.Footnote 6 More precisely, we illustrate the feasibility and profitability of the limit-quality deterrence strategy in a two-sided market. Thus, we shed new light on the outcome of entry deterrence based on an endogenous quality choice, elaborating on the features peculiar to a two-sided structure and the strategies that platforms use to defend their incumbency advantage. Moreover, we assume single-homing readers/viewers but multi-homing advertisers; thus, platforms have monopoly power in providing their multi-homing side access to their single-homing customers. In this respect, the platforms act as “bottlenecks” between advertisers and consumers, by offering exclusive access to their respective sets of consumers.Footnote 7 This assumption is crucial in explaining the prevailing competition on the consumer side. Furthermore, it is the driving force behind the “profit neutrality” outcome in a duopoly, where profit neutrality implies that advertising does not affect equilibrium profit. In fact, revenues from commercials are counterbalanced by a decrease in subscription fees. We also model advertisers as non-strategic: their payoffs do not depend on other advertisers’ actions but derive from an advertising benefit related to market demand. This behavior is appropriate in the case of informative advertising. In this framework, the effects of endogenous quality provision on different market structures deserve closer attention. In fact, in this setup two forces are at stake. Higher quality induces consumers to pay higher subscription fees to join a platform. In turn, the platform can extract a surplus on the advertisers’ side and “invest” this in a reduction in subscription fees, implying that advertisers cross-subsidize single-homing consumers. Therefore, given profit neutrality a sort of substitution between quality and advertising arises. We show that the threat of entry may induce lower differentiation in terms of quality, whereby the degree of product differentiation is no longer maximal. Finally, we describe the conditions under which quality represents a bottleneck and a source of market power as an entry deterrence strategy for the incumbent platform. A media market represents an idiosyncratic example of a two-sided market (as seminal references, see Caillaud and Jullien 2001, 2003; Anderson and Coate 2005; Armstrong 2006; Hagiu 2006; Rochet and Tirole 2006). In this stream of the literature, the issue of quality has recently received noticeable attention. For example, Armstrong and Weeds (2007) and Weeds (2013) considered a model of endogenous quality provision in the two-sided context of digital broadcasters. By comparing competition in two different regimes, i.e. free-to-air and pay TV, they showed that program quality was higher for pay TV and was also optimal from a social point of view . However, they did not consider a sequential game or the entry issue. Anderson (2007) examined a similar setting with endogenous quality, but focused mainly on the effect of an advertising cap on both the quality provision of a monopoly broadcaster and welfare. He found that advertising time restrictions can improve welfare but may also reduce program quality. More recently, Lin (2011) extended his analysis to direct competition between two platforms: one operating as a free-to-air broadcaster, the second a pay TV broadcaster. In this framework, he found that the platforms vertically differentiated their programs according to the degree of viewers’ dislike for advertising. Again, the author did not extend the analysis to the sequential game or the possible strategic use of quality as a barrier to entry.Footnote 8 Conversely, González-Maestre and Martínez-Sánchez (2015) developed a model using a publicly owned platform and a private one competing in a free-to-air broadcasting market. The platforms were differentiated on two dimensions: content (horizontal differentiation) and quality (vertical differentiation). Assuming that each platform chooses its advertising and quality levels, they calculated the subgame perfect equilibrium in terms of quality, advertising, and welfare under private and mixed duopoly competition. Our analysis departs from the above study by, on the one hand, considering a more general business model that allows for free-to-air competition as well as pay TV. Thus, we can endogenously determine not only advertising and quality but also subscription fees. On the other hand, González-Maestre and Martínez-Sánchez (2015) focused on welfare aspects and policy implications, while our main aim is to model competition, entry, and quality. Finally, the paper by Gabszewicz and Wauthy (2011) should be mentioned. These authors showed that in a platform competition with cross-network externalities, equilibrium outcomes resemble those obtained in standard models of vertical differentiation. In their setup, quality in one of the two markets is determined by outcomes in the other: the agents’ participation on each side determines the perceived quality of the other side. Therefore, it is the size of the network that endogenously determines willingness to join the platform and, in turn, the quality of the platform. In this way, the authors’ model diverges from the standard quality definition we use in our framework. Nevertheless, their results emphasize the importance of a vertical differentiation framework when dealing with competition between platforms. Note that all the above contributions except that of Anderson (2007)Footnote 9 focused on the case of a duopoly, neglecting monopoly behavior. In contrast, we discuss the case of a monopoly in the Appendix 7.1. Furthermore, none of the above authors considered entry or pre-emption. 
Ribeiro et al. (2016) and Roger (2017) extended the original one-sided analysis described by Gabszewicz and Wauthy (2011, 2014) to two-sided markets, nesting horizontal and vertical differentiation. Roger (2017) fully characterized a duopoly equilibrium in a pure strategy (and a mixed one) in a platform competition, with no specific reference to the media market. The same author also reported the existence of a quality distortion in the presence of cross-market externalities. In a similar setting and using nested horizontal and vertical differentiation, Ribeiro et al. (2016) showed that a negligible shock on the consumer side can be disruptive for market equilibrium when platforms compete on two sides. The authors also tackled the issue of the entry of a third platform, and found that inter-group externalities facilitated the deterrence of an inferior-quality entrant and the capture of the whole market by a superior-quality entrant. Apart from the different approach to modeling vertical differentiation, the present paper departs from these contributions by focusing on the incumbent platform’s decision to prevent entry by investing in higher quality. In terms of competition between broadcasters, we refer in particular to Gabszewicz et al. (2001), Crampes et al. (2009) and Peitz and Valletti (2008). The first paper analyzed competition between two newspaper editors in a framework of horizontal differentiation of political opinion, in which readers were single-homing and advertisers multi-homing. The authors reported a tendency towards minimal differentiation in political messages, the so-called “La Pensée Unique,” in order to sell a larger audience to advertisers. We diverge from this paper in two aspects: on the one hand, we use a setting of vertical differentiation in which the platforms endogenously choose different levels of quality; and on the other, we consider different timings whereby subscription and advertising fees are set during the same stage. In this way, advertising tariffs do not strictly determine subscription fees or in turn, quality levels. These two aspects are behind our different outcome in terms of maximal quality differentiation. The second paper mentioned above, that by Crampes et al. (2009), examined the relationship between prices, advertising, and entry in a framework of horizontal differentiation, while we consider competition and entry with endogenous quality provision. Finally, Peitz and Valletti (2008) compared advertising intensity and content programming in a market with a duopoly of broadcasters choosing the degree of horizontal differentiation (i.e. the platforms chose the degree of program “diversity” in the horizontal space rather than vertical program quality). From this perspective, our model could be interpreted as a translation of Peitz and Valletti’s (2008) work into the vertical differentiation context, while also extending to the analysis of entry competition. Finally, our paper relates to an older stream of the literature on industrial organizations in relation to vertical differentiation (see, e.g. Gabszewicz and Thisse 1979). In particular, we are indebted to the well-known study by Shaked and Sutton (1982, 1983), which demonstrated market equilibrium when firms compete in a vertically differentiated framework and are ranked according to their quality levels. More recently, Donnenfeld and Weber (1992, 1995) extended Shaked and Sutton’s simultaneous model to the case of sequential entry. In their 1992 paper, the authors produced a model that generated maximal differentiation between the equilibrium qualities of the first two firms to enter. Meanwhile, in both papers they showed how an incumbent firm can use limit quality to deter entry, as a result of which, according to a large fixed cost of entry, a high level of product differentiation is to be expected. With the same non-simultaneous entry, we extend their conditions to our two-sided framework to explain the role of entry in platform competition and the level of quality differentiation. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the general model; Sect. 3 provides a full characterization of the equilibrium in a duopoly. Section 5 deals with competition and entry; and Sect. 5.3 investigates the strategy of entry deterrence in particular. Some concluding remarks (Sect. 6) close the paper.",6

Pinopoulos,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A classic topic of antitrust economics is the welfare effects of horizontal mergers—that is mergers between competitors. Nowadays, a large number of nations worldwide have laws or regulations which call for merger control [e.g., US Horizontal Merger Guidelines (2010), EC Horizontal Merger Guidelines (2004/03)]. Since vertical relations are ubiquitous in real-world markets, it is widely acknowledged, by both economic theorists and antitrust agencies, that the vast majority of horizontal mergers take place in either the upstream or the downstream sector of vertically related industries. In this paper, we study upstream horizontal mergers. A key aspect of our analysis is that one of the merging parties is vertically integrated. In other words, one insider party to the upstream merger is also present in the downstream market. This assumption is motivated by a number of merger cases, e.g., BP/ARCO (1999), Arvin Meritor/Volvo (2004), DFDS/Norfolk (2010), Arla Foods/Milk Link (2012), Holcim/Lafarge (2014).Footnote 1 To the best of our knowledge, a formal economic model of upstream horizontal mergers involving a vertically integrated firm has not been developed yet. Filling this gap is the main objective of this paper. In doing so, we show that such type of upstream mergers may benefit consumers even in the absence of exogenous cost-synergies between merging firms, depending on contract (un)observability and the degree of downstream cost-asymmetry. Following much of the existing literature on upstream horizontal mergers that take place in vertically separated markets (see e.g., Horn and Wolinsky 1988; Ziss 1995; Fumagalli and Motta 2001; Milliou and Petrakis 2007; Milliou and Pavlou 2013),Footnote 2 we consider a standard model with two competing vertical chains. In each chain, there is a single upstream firm that produces an input which a single downstream firm uses in one-to-one proportion in the production of a differentiated final good. We abstract from the existing literature by assuming that one vertical chain is vertically integrated whereas the other chain is vertically separated. At some point, the integrated chain (or integrated firm) considers merging with the independent upstream supplier. Such a merger is qualified as horizontal (because both firms are active in the upstream market) and not vertical (because the downstream division of the vertically integrated firm does not use the independent upstream firm’s input before the merger), it has nevertheless important vertical implications (since post-merger the independent downstream firm procures the input from the upstream counterpart of its rival in the downstream market). The timing of the game is as follows. At the first stage, the vertically integrated firm and the independent upstream supplier decide whether to merge horizontally. At the second stage, the independent upstream supplier (if the merger does not occur) or the newly merged firm (if the merger occurs) makes the independent downstream firm a take-it-or-leave-it offer consisting of an input price and a fixed fee (two-part tariff). At the last stage, downstream competition is in quantities (Cournot). We initially assume that, pre-merger, the contract stipulated in the vertically separated chain is observable by the vertically integrated firm. Under a general demand function, we show that the upstream merger raises the independent downstream firm’s cost: the input price paid by the latter increases, yielding greater market share to the downstream affiliate of the merged entity. This raising-rival’s-cost effect implies higher final-good prices and lower total output thereby making consumers worse off. This result holds for any given relationship between downstream costs. We consider a modification of the baseline model by relaxing the assumption of observable contracting pre-merger: we assume that the contract stipulated in the vertically separated chain can be unobservable by the vertically integrated firm. In such setting, we show that the input price may decrease and thus consumer surplus may increase as a result of the merger even in the absence of exogenous cost-synergies between the merging firms. A necessary condition for this finding is that the independent downstream firm is more cost-efficient than the downstream division of the integrated firm. In the pre-merger case, the two-part tariff contract stipulated in the separated chain loses its commitment value thereby eliminating any strategic effect on the vertically integrated firm’s behavior and resulting in upstream marginal-cost pricing.Footnote 3 The upstream merger restores the commitment value of the contract and has an additional effect on the input price besides the raising-rival’s-cost effect identified above: any reduction in the input price will decrease the merged firm’s downstream sales, which in turn will increase independent downstream firm’s final-good price and thus the profits that can be captured by the merged firm through the fixed fee. This output-shifting effect is identified by Reisinger and Tarantino (2015) in the context of vertical mergers. When the downstream division of the vertically integrated firm is sufficiently less cost-efficient than the independent downstream firm, it is optimal for the merged firm to set an input price below marginal cost, thereby shifting final-good sales to the more profitable downstream rival. The input-price reduction leads to a reduction in final-good prices thereby making consumers better-off. In all cases under consideration, the merger is always profitable. In the pre-merger case, the input price is chosen so as to maximize the vertically separated chain’s profits rather than total industry profits. In the post-merger case, however, the input price is chosen so as to maximize overall industry profits. Therefore, it must hold that overall industry profits increase as a result of the merger. Since overall industry profits increase, and the independent downstream firm’s net profits remain unaffected (in both cases are equal to zero due to the fixed fee), it must hold that the combined net profits of the vertically integrated firm and the independent upstream supplier increase, implying that the merger is beneficial for the merging parties. As already mentioned above, the existing literature on upstream horizontal mergers focuses on vertically separated markets. A key insight from this literature is that upstream mergers are beneficial to consumers only when they entail efficiency gains. One exception is the paper by Milliou and Petrakis (2007). By considering the case of two-part tariff contracts and downstream Cournot competition, these authors show that, in the absence of exogenous cost-synergies, an upstream merger between two vertically separated firms decreases the input price and increases consumer surplus, however, it is never profitable for the merging parties. In the present context, where one of the merging parties is a vertically integrated firm, the merger is always profitable thus allowing us to provide a theoretical explanation of observed upstream mergers that might be beneficial for consumers even if they do not generate efficiency gains in production. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe the baseline model under a general demand function and observable contracting in the pre-merger case. In Sect. 3, we modify the baseline model by considering the case of unobservable contracting pre-merger. In Sect. 4, we discuss the relation of our model to comparable vertical mergers. In Sect. 5, we provide some real-world examples of upstream mergers that involve a vertically integrated firm. Section 6 concludes the paper. All proofs are relegated to the “Appendix”.",1
130.0,1.0,Journal of Economics,17 July 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-019-00670-y,Demographic change and real house prices: a general equilibrium perspective,June 2020,Alessandro Piergallini,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The effects of major demographic changes on the long-run path of real house prices have received considerable attention in the literature. In a seminal paper, Mankiw and Weil (1989) predicted that, in the 2 decades since 1987, real house prices in the United States could fall by 3% per year, on average, due to both the ‘baby bust’ and ‘baby boomers’ liquidating their housing and financial assets. On the contrary, after the dramatic rise in house prices observed between 1970 and 1980, the real price of housing continued to increase over the long run, in sharp contrast with the Mankiw–Weil forecast. On average, it increased by 3.2% per year between 1987 and 2006, by 1.5% between 1987 and 2017—a period which includes the 2007–2011 price bust occurred over the financial crisis—and, remarkably, by 4.8% between 2012 and 2017, in the post-crisis period.Footnote 1 An analogous upward trend in real house prices is also visible in the OECD countries as a group.Footnote 2 Such a ‘puzzle’ has been explored mainly in partial equilibrium frameworks.Footnote 3 The contribution of the present paper is to provide an explanation based on a general equilibrium macroeconomic model where demographic factors and housing-wealth effects are explicitly incorporated. Specifically, we examine the long-run impact of demographic change on real house prices in an overlapping generations setting of the type originally proposed in the seminal work by Yaari (1965), then further developed by Blanchard (1985) and Weil (1989), and here extended, for our purposes, in order to include monetary variables and internalize housing in the households’ asset menu. The resulting model proves to be a useful setup for making aggregate demand sensitive to housing wealth effects—as predicted by much empirical evidence (Iacoviello 2004, 2012; Campbell and Cocco 2007; Muellbauer 2007; Dvornak and Kohler 2007; Carroll et al. 2011; Zhu et al. 2019)—and for formalizing transparently the interactions between demographic forces and house-price dynamics.
 There is an extensive body of research, both empirical and theoretical, examining the interactive nexus between housing markets and macroeconomic variables. Leung (2004) and Leung and Ng (2018) provide prominent literature reviews, before and after the global financial crisis. According to Leung (2004), although housing was not included in traditional macroeconomics, there is a growing recognition about the importance of the connections between housing markets and the macroeconomy (see, among others, Chang 2000; Leung 2003, 2017; Davis and Heathcote 2005; Iacoviello 2005; Iacoviello and Minetti 2008; Chang et al. 2011; Karsten et al. 2013; Cesa-Bianchi et al. 2015; Davis and Van Nieuwerburgh 2015; Piazzesi and Schneider 2016; Favilukis et al. 2017). According to Leung and Ng (2018), although a general decrease in the relationships among housing market variables and macroeconomic variables occurred after the global financial crisis with respect to business cycle frequencies, there still exist particularly significant interactions over the medium run—especially with reference to macro-financial variables. Theoretically, however, the existing general equilibrium frameworks (see, eg., Iacoviello 2005, 2010, and references therein) are typically based on Ramsey-type infinitely lived optimizing agents, hence overlooking the potential nexus between demographic factors and house-price dynamics—the objective of this paper. Prominent exceptions are the life-cycle setup proposed by Iacoviello and Pavan (2013), which however abstracts from endogenous housing prices, and the overlapping generations settings elaborated by Galí (2014, 2018), which focus instead on the possible occurrence of asset-price bubbles, unconnected to ‘fundamentals’. In the macroeconomic literature—it should be emphasized—there are relevant attempts to investigate the effects of the ‘retirement wave’ of baby boomers, with a particular focus on stock price dynamics.Footnote 4 Using an overlapping generations general equilibrium model with rational expectations, Abel (2001) argues in favor of the plausible occurrence of an anticipated decline in the price of capital when baby boomers retire, which is shown not to be attenuated by the introduction of a bequest motive. In an overlapping generations setting à la Diamond (1965), further including a social security system, Abel (2003) reinforces these theoretical arguments, showing that the price of capital is mean-reverting, so that the initial increase in the price of capital is followed by a decrease. Overlapping generations setups to study the macroeconomic effects of demographic changes are also remarkably employed in the theoretical works of d’Albis (2007) and Hock and Weil (2012). d’Albis (2007) analyzes the impact of the population growth rate on steady-state capital per capita and finds that the functional relationship between those two variables is non-monotonic (see also Gan and Lau 2010). Hock and Weil (2012) analyze the effects of population aging, due to declining fertility and rising elderly life expectancy, on consumption decisions, and investigate the related feedback effects. They highlight how decreases in consumption associated with greater elderly life expectancy might be offset by endogenous increases in the fertility rate. Markedly, the macroeconomic consequences of the ongoing demographic transition in the context of overlapping generations models are further studied with reference to the question of how the population aging relates to the observed decrease in the real interest rate in the United States (Gagnon et al. 2016), Japan (Sudo and Takizuka 2018), and other developed economies (Carvalho et al. 2016). For our purposes, it is worth pointing out that while the literature on the interplay among housing and the macroeconomy typically abstracts from demographic variables, the above literature on the macroeconomic implications of demographic changes, on the other hand, abstracts from housing markets and monetary variables. The present analysis is an effort to fill this gap. In particular, the contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we extend in an analytically tractable way the overlapping generations framework à la Yaari (1965), Blanchard (1985), Weil (1989) in order incorporate monetary variables and housing-wealth effects. Second, using the discipline of the proposed general equilibrium optimizing setup, we demonstrate that evolving demographic changes—declines in the birth rate and in population growth, associated with increases in life expectancy—per se tend to dampen aggregate demand and boost saving, thereby triggering deflationary dynamics. When the monetary policy emphasis is placed on stabilizing inflation, real interest rates fall. Declines in the rate of real interest turns to sustain agents’ housing demand and thus prices. In other words, the demographic transition of the type observed in developed economies generates a situation of real house-price increases and not of real house-price decreases. In this environment, ceteris paribus, falling prices in the housing market are possible only when self-fulfilling boom–bust dynamics—unrelated to demographic ‘fundamentals’ and associated to ‘off-equilibrium’ arbitrary revisions in house-price expectations—take place. Thus, overall, the present study provides a novel perspective to explain the nexus between demographic change and housing price change, based upon the implied interactions with macroeconomic variables. The findings demonstrated in this paper give sound theoretical foundations to the view that employing a general equilibrium setting, whereby interest rate and inflation dynamics enter the analysis, might be essential for a general characterization of the effects of the demographic transition on real house-price dynamics. The setup here presented could then be used as a fruitful benchmark for more complex analysis along the foregoing lines. The scheme of the paper is as follows. Section 2 sets forth the macroeconomic model. Section 3 analyzes the issue of equilibrium dynamics and derives the connections between demographic factors and real house prices. Section 4 provides a summary of the main findings and concludes.",1

This “no-poaching” request was an explicit attempt to suppress competition. In an e-mail to Jobs, Colligan said that the agreement was “not only wrong, but likely illegal.” In response, Jobs told Colligan “I’m sure you realize the asymmetry in the financial resources of our respective companies” and to “take a look at our patent portfolio before you make a final decision here”.Footnote 1 This anecdotal evidence highlights use of the threat of patent litigation as an instrument to enforce a collusive outcome. The traditional economic wisdom considers patents to be an instrument that, in a Schumpeterian perspective (Schumpeter 1942), should grant firms temporary monopoly; however, if this were the case, in industries characterized by relevant R&D expenditures and huge patent portfolios (e.g., knowledge-based sectors), we would rarely see firms entry. On the contrary, the empirical evidence shows that competitors do enter in markets protected by patents, and collusion does emerge among patenting firms. Accusations of collusion have involved companies in highly innovative markets all over the world. For instance, in 2005, in the USA Samsung pleaded guilty to conspiring with Infineon and Hynix Semiconductor, to fix Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) priceFootnote 2 in 2006, the French government fined 13 perfume brands including L’Oré al, Chanel, LVMH’s Sephora and Hutchison Whampoa’s Marionnaud for price collusion between 1997 and 2000;Footnote 3 in 2008, in the USA, LG Display Co., Chunghwa Picture Tubes and Sharp Corp., agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to fix the prices of Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) apnels;Footnote 4 a similar fine was imposed in 2010 in Europe on LG, Chimei Innolux, AU Optronics, Chunghwa Picture Tubes Ltd., and HannStar Display Corp.;Footnote 5 in 2012, South Korea’s antitrust regulator fined Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics for conspiring to fix the prices of some appliances (washing machines, flat-panel TVs, laptop computers).Footnote 6 Finally, some of Silicon Valley’s giants (Apple, Adobe, Google, Intel among others) were accused of collusion over an agreement not to hire each other’s staff, in order to keep wages low.Footnote 7 Overall, it is clear that these markets have a common fundamental characteristic: the existence of a huge number of patents protecting their innovations. The proliferation of patents is a recognized phenomenon that has relevant economic and legal implications. Its scale is impressiveFootnote 8: in the last 30 years, the number of patents has more than quadrupled, leading to an increase in both patent intensity and the proportion of patents that remain unexploited (the so called new patent paradox).Footnote 9 Not surprisingly, the proliferation in the number of patents has determined an increase in litigation rates in many industries.Footnote 10 However, only a small fraction of these eventually are contested, with an even smaller fraction of disputes over patent infringement resulting in a verdict.Footnote 11 Firms’ use of patents as a complementary instrument in the definition of their competitive strategies, has been assessed in the Industrial Organization literature from several perspectives. Patents have been considered a quality signal for markets and investors,Footnote 12 a defensive tool in patent infringement lawsuits,Footnote 13 a means to defend a dominant position,Footnote 14 or as an instrument affecting R&D decisions.Footnote 15 This paper analyses the strategic use of patents from a novel perspective; patents are seen as a means available to the incumbent firm to control entry and, more importantly, as influencing the post-entry market interaction process effectively, by creating the conditions that might favour collusion.Footnote 16 In our context, the strategic value of a patent lies in the option offered to the owner to start a litigation process which, in principle, could weaken the aggressive stance of rival firms. More specifically, an incumbent firm might choose to protect its status with patents. However, whatever the amount of resources invested in this process, there is no patent system that provides complete protection since, in principle, a court could invalidate the relevant patent, thus granting to a rival the possibility of entry.Footnote 17 Therefore, the monopoly position can be challenged and an incumbent might find it profitable to explore another opportunity offered by patents, that is, to set up a pro-collusive industry environment. More specifically, since in the context of an infinitely repeated game, the sustainability of tacit collusion is inversely related to the level of the profit in the punishment stage the threat of denunciation for patent infringement facilitates collusion, lowering the profits in the punishment stage and, thus, reducing the level of the critical discount factor. This paper contributes to the literature which examines how the sustainability of collusion is affected by firms’ asymmetries. According to the Industrial Organization literature, collusion is most likely to occur in the case of symmetric firms and that the coordination problem becomes harder when firms are different.Footnote 18 Papers on collusion, in the case of asymmetry, focus on product differentiation,Footnote 19 asymmetric capacity,Footnote 20 different discount factors,Footnote 21 cost asymmetry,Footnote 22 or the presence of a ringleader.Footnote 23 This literature recognizes that asymmetric firms find it difficult to sustain a collusive agreement as a non-cooperative Nash equilibrium in a repeated game, since the incentive constraint is more severe. Differently from the previous literature, which focuses on structural differences (such as cost), we focus on the asymmetry arising from the different structure of the patent portfolio, selected strategically by the firm. This allows the incumbent to control market access: by fixing the level of patent protection, the incumbent raises the entrant’s expected costs, thereby reducing the incentive to defect from the collusive path. This asymmetry turns out to facilitate collusion. Moreover, this mechanism may sustain collusion even if the firms’ discount factors are different. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 1 introduces the model; Sect. 2 describes the equilibrium outcomes for three different game scenarios: (1) full deterrence; (2) non-collusive entry; (3) accommodation and collusion. Section 3 presents the main results. Section 4 concludes. ""Appendix A"" provides the proofs; ""Appendices B and C"" extend the analysis to product differentiation, and lawsuit cost asymmetries; ""Appendix D"" describes symbols and notations used in the paper.",2

Teruyama: the changing japanese labor market: theory and evidence, XI",July 2020,Sebastien Lechevalier,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A little more than two decades ago, the Japanese labor market was still at the center of the attention of European economists. Unemployment in Europe was at its highest, including Germany. At that time, Japan was in the middle of the lost decade, even more affected by the 1997–1998 Asian crisis. The unemployment rate in Japan was nonetheless around 3.5% on average and 7.5% for youth. From a theoretical viewpoint, the Japanese employment practices were praised for their ability to deliver both security and flexibility. After more than two decades of economic stagnation, during which Japan has done even worse than Europe as a whole in terms of growth, the interest for its economy (and its labor economy in particular) has decreased in both academic and non-academic circles. To us, the book by three renowned Japanese labor economists, Kitagawa, Ohta and Teruyama, The Changing Japanese Labor Market. Theory and Evidence, should lead European economists to pay more attention to the evolution of the Japanese labor market, both for theoretical and empirical reasons. This book is primarily concerned with labor market issues but, because of precise and pertinent micro-foundations, it also deals with employment practices at the corporate level. It is composed of five chapters: after one chapter that both introduces some stylized facts and proposes an overview, it includes two theoretical chapters, followed by two chapters, which provide micro based empirical evidences on some of the implications of the models developed in the previous chapters. As indicated by its title, this book opposes to the dominant view that economic stagnation in Japan from the 1990s was due to the lack of change in its economic institutions. As explained in Lechevalier (2014), the image of “arthritic Japan” is indeed not supported by any empirical evidence. After having reviewed the characteristics of the “classical” Japanese employment system as they were recognized in the 1980s—job security, wage profile, and firm based union (which is not the focus of the book)—Kitagawa, Ohta and Teruyama revisit several stylized facts that are considered as having characterized the Japanese labor market since the early 1990s: a moderate increase of unemployment (for European standards) but a difficult decrease of unemployment during periods of expansion, the growth of non-regular employment (which is more or less equivalent to atypical or non-standard employment in Europe and in the US), and the stagnation of nominal wages. In being more specific, the authors show that the job-worker attachment of full-time workers in the Japanese labor market has weakened and their wage profiles have become flatter over the period. These facts are at the center of the theoretical and empirical investigation of the book.",

Moreover, most developed countries face low fertility rates and population aging. On the contrary, developing countries face high fertility rates and high mortality rates. In addition, most developed countries more actively undertake R&D and realize more rapid technological change than developing countries. Figure 1 shows the relationship between the enrollment ratio and the level of R&D expenditure per unit of GDP. According to Fig. 1, we find positive correlation between the enrollment rate and R&D activity. Figure 2 shows the relationship between the fertility rate and the level of R&D expenditure per unit of GDP. We find negative correlation between the fertility rate and R&D activity. Meanwhile, Fig. 3 shows the relationship between the old-age dependency ratio and the level of R&D expenditure per unit of GDP. As Fig. 3 shows, there is positive correlation between the old-age survival rate and R&D activity. This remarkable empirical evidence suggests that there are mutual relationships among demographic changes, education, and R&D activity. Therefore, this study examines how demographic changes and human capital accumulation influence R&D activity. We show that education and the human capital accumulation play an important role in economic development in an R&D-based growth model. We clarify the historical conditions that determine whether a country becomes a developed country or a developing country. Source World Bank. Cross-country data for 2015.

Source World Bank. Cross-country data for 2015. Simple ordinary least squares estimation shows that there is statistically significant positive correlation between the old-age dependency ratio and the level of R&D expenditure per unit of GDP R&D expenditure and old-age dependency ratio.  We construct a simple overlapping-generations model of R&D-based growth with endogenous fertility, mortality, and education choice. Each individual lives for three periods. In the first period of their lives, individuals do not make any decisions. In the second period, individuals raise children and invest in their education, supply efficient units of labor, pay income tax, consume differentiated goods, and save any remaining income. In the final period, individuals retire and consume differentiated goods. Old individuals live through old age with an endogenous survival rate, which is determined by the government’s public health policy. In this model, there is a production sector and an R&D sector. In the production sector, a single firm produces a differentiated good by using effective labor. Similarly, in the R&D sector, R&D firms use the effective labor to invent new differentiated goods. The equilibrium dynamics of this economy are characterized by the level of human capital. We show that multiple steady states can exist in this economy. One of them has a high level of human capital and the other has a low level. In the steady state with the high (low) level of human capital, there is a high (low) level of R&D activity, a low (high) fertility rate, and a high (low) old-age survival rate. In addition, we examine how government policy affects this economy. We show that the government can steer an economy away from a poverty trap trajectory by investing in public health. We also show that an improvement in the government’s public health policy has an inverted U-shaped effect on the growth rate at the steady state. We examine how the improved public health policy affects welfare and show that the government may face a trade-off between improving the welfare levels of the current generation and those of future generations. This study is related to research on demographic change, human capital accumulation, and R&D-based growth. In particular, this study is related to research in the unified growth literature, such as Galor and Weil (2000), Galor and Moav (2002), and Galor (2011). They explain the transition from the Malthusian regime to the sustained growth regime by considering the interrelationship of demographic change, human capital accumulation, and technological change. These studies argue that demographic change, human capital accumulation, and technological change play an important role in shifting from the Malthusian regime to the sustained growth regime. In addition, they argue that the difference between developed and developing countries is their timing in taking off from the Malthusian regime. Specifically, developing countries do not stay in the Malthusian regime and automatically move to the sustained growth regime. However, many developing countries face sustained challenges of low economic growth, high fertility rate, and high mortality rate. Therefore, developing countries may be caught in a poverty trap, thereby hindering the transition from the Malthusian regime to the sustained growth regime. Hence, many studies allow the existence of multiple steady states with the poverty trap, including Blackburn and Cipriani (2002), Moav (2005), Kimura and Yasui (2007), Chen (2010), and Chakraborty and Chakraborty (2018), taking endogenous fertility and education choice into account. They argue that individuals’ education decisions play an important role in economic development. However, they do not consider R&D activities. In contrast to this research, we consider the relationship between demographic change, education, and R&D activity simultaneously. This study is also related to Chakraborty (2004), Hashimoto and Tabata (2005), and Agénor (2015). whose works endogenize the old-age survival rate by focusing on public health policy and exploring the dynamic relationship between mortality and economic growth. However, they do not consider fertility, education, and R&D simultaneously. In contrast to this research, we consider these factors and can explain the facts shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. Furthermore, this research is related to Chu et al. (2013), Strulik et al. (2013), and Hashimoto and Tabata (2016), who investigate the relationship between demographic change, education, and R&D activity simultaneously. However, Chu et al. (2013) and Strulik et al. (2013) do not consider mortality. Hashimoto and Tabata (2016) consider mortality but regard it as exogenous; moreover, they do not refer to a multiplicity of steady states. In contrast to this research, we consider endogenous mortality and show the existence of multiple steady states. Lastly, this study is related to Futagami and Konishi (2019), who explore the dynamic relationship between endogenous fertility, mortality, and R&D. In addition to their research, we study how education and human capital accumulation affect the economy. This rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sect. 2 shows the basic structure of the model, Sect. 3 analyzes equilibrium and dynamics. Sect. 4 analyses government policy. Finally, the conclusion is described in Sect. 5.",4

Heywood,Dongyang Li,Guangliang Ye,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"While extremely common, anti-trust officials and policy frequently misunderstand delivered spatial price discrimination (McChesney and Shugart 2007). One important issue is the extent to which the insights from other models of price collusion carry-over. For example, Helfrich and Herweg (2016) demonstrate that when firms can price discriminate, collusion on price becomes less likely as the required discount factor to insure stability must be higher. This might cause one to anticipate that price collusion under delivered spatial price discrimination is also less likely than under uniform pricing. We show this need not be the case. Instead, whenever differentiation is modest (transport cost is not too large), collusion becomes more likely under spatial price discrimination as the required discount rate for stability is lower. This happens when the entire market is competitive. When portions of the market are natural monopolies, this reverses and collusion under spatial price discrimination is, indeed, less likely than under uniform pricing. We compare uniform FOB pricing with delivered spatial price discrimination. We examine a duopoly on a linear market with downward sloping demand at each location. Price collusion with uniform pricing has the firms agreeing to a shared monopolistic mill price. In this setting having the customers pay for transport costs or the firm add it to the collusive mill price is irrelevant. We contrast this with the classic model of spatial price discrimination in which firms compete by providing a delivered price that includes transport to the consumer’s location. Absent collusion each firm engages in Bertrand competition as its delivered price is constrained to be no higher than its rival’s delivered cost. Price collusion has the two firms setting the monopoly delivered price at each consumer’s location and splitting the market. In what follows, we first put our research in context. We highlight that no previous research compares collusion vs. rivalry under uniform pricing to collusion vs. rivalry under delivered spatial price discrimination. The third section describes our basic model. The fourth section derives results when the entire market is competitive. The fifth section derives results when portions of the market are natural monopolies. The sixth section concludes.",4

In other words, what matters in the process of production is not the mere presence of factors but what they do. The present paper accounts for this observation and develops a novel interpretation of the neoclassical production sector where capital and labor perform factor-specific tasks to produce output. A task may be thought of as a unit of work activity that contributes to the production of output. The task-based interpretation of the neoclassical production sector sheds new light on the intricate relationship between factor-augmenting technical change and relative and absolute factor prices. In particular, we establish that the effect of factor-augmenting technical change on relative and absolute factor prices can be decomposed into a productivity effect and an effect on the demand for tasks, henceforth referred to as the task-demand effect. These effects appear since the task-based approach distinguishes between the demands for tasks and the demands for factors. This perspective provides a new intuition for the emergence of relative and absolute factor biases and the role of the elasticity of substitution. The findings of the present paper are derived in the following steps. Section 2 introduces tasks into the neoclassical production sector, defines the competitive equilibrium, and provides a detailed interpretation of the notion and the modelling of tasks. The novel features include a production function defined over factor specific tasks and input coefficients that provide the link between each task and the required amount of the factor that accomplishes it. For expository purposes, we refer to them as capital and labor. Taking tasks as the primitive means that firms maximize profits to find the optimal number of tasks performed by capital and labor. These choices determine their factor demands as well as their output supplies. Section 3 analyzes the model under the assumption that factor specific tasks are homogeneous in the sense that the productivity of factors in the performance of their respective task is the same. We establish the existence of a unique competitive equilibrium in Sect. 3.1 and show that the resulting allocation coincides with the one obtained for a neoclassical production sector where the production technology of firms is directly defined over their efficient capital and labor inputs. In this sense the suggested interpretation based on tasks provides an intellectual underpinning of the neoclassical production sector used in the literature. Section 3.2 develops a new intuition for the way in which factor-augmenting technical change affects relative and absolute equilibrium factor prices. Arguably, this is the main result of this paper. We show that the relative factor bias of technical change hinges on the tension between a positive productivity effect and a negative task-demand effect. To grasp the intuition, consider an increase in the relative productivity of capital. Then, according to the productivity effect, the relative price of capital increases since, at a given ratio of tasks, the relative marginal product of capital increases. The task-demand effect reflects the adjustment of the ratio of performed tasks necessary to maintain full employment in both factor markets. Since capital becomes relatively more productive, the relative demand for tasks performed by capital has to increase. To accomplish this with profit-maximizing firms requires a decline in the relative price of capital. Hence, the task-demand effect is negative. The strength of the decline in the relative price of capital hinges on the ease with which factors of production can be substituted. If it is easy enough (difficult) to substitute then the required decline in the relative price of capital is small (high). If firms operate under a CES production function then the measure of the degree of easiness is the elasticity of substitution. This leads to the conclusion, that the productivity effect dominates the task-demand effect if and only if the elasticity of substitution exceeds unity. Similarly, the effect of a higher capital productivity in the performance of tasks on the equilibrium rental rate of capital can be decomposed into a positive productivity effect and a negative task-demand effect. For a given amount of tasks performed by capital, the productivity effect reflects the higher marginal product of capital. Accordingly, the rental rate of capital increases. The task-demand effect captures adjustments in the factor market for capital. A higher capital productivity requires more tasks to be performed by capital to ensure full employment of capital. As these additional tasks are associated with a lower marginal product, the task-demand effect is negative. Section 4 introduces heterogeneous tasks. Tasks differ on the input side. Additional tasks have larger input requirements and, therefore, are more expensive to perform. First, we establish the existence of a unique competitive equilibrium in Sect. 4.1. The implications of task heterogeneity for the effect of factor-augmenting technical change on factor prices is the focus of Sect. 4.2. We find that heterogeneity adds two important new facets to the analysis. First, a key determinant of (relative) factor prices is the productivity of the marginal task. As factor-augmenting technical change increases the market size for the tasks to which it applies, additional tasks must be performed to maintain full employment. However, the productivity of the respective factors of production in the marginal task will be lower than for inframarginal tasks. Accordingly, the factor price falls. The second novel feature concerns the market size effect. As input requirements increase across tasks, a given percentage increase in the factor-augmenting productivity parameter leads to a less than proportionate increase in tasks. This weakens the role of the elasticity of substitution for the adjustment of factor prices in response to a change in efficient factor factor supplies. Both features lead to the conclusion that the relative price of capital may decrease in response to a hike in capital-augmenting or labor-augmenting technical change even if the elasticity of substitution exceeds unity. Moreover, factor-augmenting technical progress reduces the absolute price of the factor to which it applies even if the elasticity of substitution exceeds unity. This paper builds on and contributes to at least two branches of the literature interested in the possible implications of technical change in factor markets. The first branch takes a new look at the old question of factor-price biases of technical change [see, e.g., Acemoglu (2007), Acemoglu (2010)]. While technical change is exogenous in the present paper, the results we derive are informative on the conditions under which technical change increases or decreases the relative and the absolute marginal product of factors. As to relative marginal products, our emphasis on tasks provides an intuitive interpretation of the role played by the elasticity of substitution for the sign of these effects in terms of a productivity and a task-demand effect. Second, we contribute to the literature that studies relevant economic phenomena emphasizing the role of tasks. Examples include Dornbusch et al. (1980) with an application to international trade patterns, Champernowne (1961) and Zeira (1998) with a focus on economic growth and capital-labor substitution, the contribution of Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2001) analyzing productivity differences between advanced and less developed countries, or Acemoglu and Autor (2011) who study employment and earnings profiles across skill groups. Related is also the recent “endogenous growth” literature emphasizing tasks in the context of automation incentives and economic growth [see, e.g., Irmen (2017), Irmen and Tabaković (2017), Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018a), Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018b), Irmen (2020a), or Irmen (2020b)]. Unlike this literature, the technology for each task is exogenous in the present paper. This focus allows for a reinterpretation of the neoclassical production sector in terms of tasks. Moreover, it provides new intuitions and new predictions about the effect of exogenous factor-augmenting technical change, e.g., on relative and absolute factor prices. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sect. 2 introduces tasks into the neoclassical production sector. Section 3 derives our main results for homogeneous tasks. Section 4 considers the case of heterogeneous tasks. Section 5 concludes. Proofs are relegated to the Appendix.",1

Saleeby,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Investors’ attitudes toward risk play a central role in their investments decisions. Most of the literature about investors’ risk attitudes, considers two types of risk tolerance: risk-neutral investors and risk-averse investors. In a recent paper on risk preferences, Falk et al. (2018) conduct a study on global variation in economic preferences in 76 countries and find out that there is a substantial heterogeneity in preferences across countries, and that these preferences drive the individual decision making. Our paper allows for risk heterogeneity among the investors and studies the impact of such risk heterogeneity on their financial decisions in the presence of insider trading. There is a large body of applied and theoretical studies of the insider trading problem and its impact on the financial markets. The importance of this problem is highlighted by the policies adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its push to investigate and prosecute those accused of insider trading. The celebrated (Kyle 1985) model provided a framework for the study of insider trading and it has been extended in several directions. Most of these extensions assume either risk neutral insiders or risk averse insiders.Footnote 1 This paper, is the first to our knowledge,Footnote 2 to investigate the effect of hybrid risk attitudes on the financial decisions of two insiders trading in the stock market. There are few extensions of the Kyle (1985) model to the case of risk-averse insiders, for example Subrahmanyam (1991), Holden and Subrahmanyam (1994), Vitale (1995), Zhang (2004) and Baruch (2002). Except for Subrahmanyam (1991), in most of the discrete models, the comparative analysis studies were found numerically and this was due to the introduction of the risk-aversion type of the insider which made the computational analysis quite complex. Subrahmanyam (1991) extended the Kyle (1985) model to the case of a partially informed insider and proved analytically many of her comparative analysis with respect to the risk-neutral case. Holden and Subrahmanyam (1994) extended Kyle’s (1985) multi-period auction model to include multiple risk-averse informed traders with long-lived information. Vitale (1995) generalized Kyle’s (1985) model to the case of a risk-averse informed trader where the solution methods are based on LEQG dynamic programming problems. Tighe (1989) extended Kyle model to multiple informed traders, all risk-neutral. Nevertheless, none of these extensions studied the case of multiple informed traders with different risk attitudes. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the risk attitudes of two insiders trading in the stock market. We follow a static version of the Kyle (1985) model with two insiders. Insider 1 is risk neutral while insider 2 is risk averse with negative exponential utility. Our paper has two objectives. Similar to Subrahmanyam (1991), our first objective is to prove analytically the existence and uniqueness of the linear equilibrium of the model as well as carry out analytically all the comparative statics analysis with respect to the duopoly static model of Holden and Subrahmanyam (1994) and to the risk-neutral insiders duopoly case studied in Tighe (1989).Footnote 3 It should be pointed out to the reader that in the risk-neutral case, the normality distribution of the exogenous variables together with the linear structure of the stock price, simplify the existence and the characterization of the linear Bayesian equilibrium. Thus, the comparative statics analysis becomes straightforward. However, when the risk-aversion structure is introduced, the computation of the linear Bayesian equilibrium becomes less tractable and the analysis turns out to be more complex. In this paper, we overcome much of the involved complexities and provide exact results for the equilibrium outcomes as well as the comparative statics analysis. Our second objective consists of rigorous analysis of the impact of the risk attitudes on the equilibrium outcomes, and mainly on market liquidity and market efficiency. Liquidity is an important aspect of financial markets for investors, researchers, and regulators. Vayanos and Wang (2013) surveyed theoretical and empirical work on market liquidity in the presence of six imperfections: participation costs, transaction costs, asymmetric information, imperfect competition, funding constraints, and search. They found out that asymmetric information and imperfect competition increase the market depth measure \(\lambda \) with respect to the full information and perfect competition case. However, the relationship between market liquidity and risk aversion has been given relatively less attention by academicians. As pointed out by the European Central Bank (ECB) report in December 2007: “ the relationship between risk aversion and financial market liquidity is usually found to be negative-i.e. higher risk aversion is associated with lower market volatility- the interdependence between the two is quite complex”.Footnote 4 Recent empirical results studied the impact of uncertainty on market liquidity. For example, Chung and Chuwonganant (2014) showed that the market uncertainty measured by VIX, decreased the market liquidity in the US markets. Ma et al. (2019) showed that increased risk perception (measured by VIX) reduced liquidity around the world. In this paper, we analytically characterize the relationship between the insiders’s risk tolerance and market liquidity. First, we show that the level of risk-aversion affects the trading order of the risk-neutral insider. Indeed, the different types of risk attitudes, induce a non symmetric equilibrium trading orders and both insiders orders depend crucially on the level of the risk aversion. However, we show that regardless of the value of the risk aversion coefficient, the risk-neutral insider order is always greater (in absolute value) than the risk-averse insider order. Intuitively, this result is associated to the fact that the risk averse insider trades less aggressively than the risk-neutral one. Second, our model reveals that similar to risk-averse Kyle type models Subrahmanyam (1991) and Holden and Subrahmanyam (1994)) the market liquidity measure \(\lambda \) (defined by Kyle 1985 as the inverse of the market depth measure), depends on the the level of risk aversion. When compared to the Tighe (1989) model, that is, when the two insiders are risk-neutral, we find that the market liquidity is reduced in our model than in Tighe (1989). Intuitively, the presence of the risk averse insider in our model, drives the insiders to trade less aggressively and thus reducing the market liquidity than in the presence of two risk-neutral insiders (Tighe 1989). Note that this result is consistent with the empirical work mentioned above. On the other hand, the comparison between the market liquidity measures in our paper and in Holden and Subrahmanyam (1994) is not straightforward. We show how the risk-aversion coefficient is a fundamental determinant of this comparison as pointed out by the ECB report. Similarly to Subrahmanyam (1991), we show that the market liquidity measure in our work is unimodal with respect to the level of risk-aversion, when it is compared to the case of two risk-averse insiders (Holden and Subrahmanyam (1994). In other words, we were able to determine a benchmark level of risk aversion above which the market liquidity measure in our model is lower than the market liquidity measure in the case of two risk averse insiders, whereas for a level of risk aversion below this benchmark, the liquidity of the market is greater in this case. Finally, we study the impact of different risk attitudes on price revelation. We show that the equilibrium price in our model reveals more information than the stock price in Holden and Subrahmanyam (1994), whereas it reveals less information than in the case of Tighe (1989). The paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2, we describe the model and characterize the unique linear Bayesian equilibrium of the model. In Sect. 3, we conduct a comparative statics analysis of the equilibrium outcomes with respect to Holden and Subrahmanyam (1994) and Tighe (1989). All proofs are relegated to the “Appendix”.",2

Novo-Peteiro,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Firms often compete in a multicharacteristic space where the decision made about one product feature can be influenced by decisions related to the other product features. This implies that the incentive to provide quality may depend on how the goods’ overall positioning in the characteristics space is affected (Degryse and Irmen 2001a). Beside cost-side motivations related to scope economies in the provision of quality dimensions, there are motivations that originate in consumer preferences: the valuation of changes in one characteristic frequently depends on the level of other characteristics due to a relationship of either complementarity or substitutability among them. However, the literature on multi-attribute preferences has mainly focused on the pure effects of competitive positioning along each dimension (for example Ansari et al. 1998; Irmen and Thisse 1998). As Degryse and Irmen (2001b) point out, this requires the assumption of attribute independence, or in other words, an additive valuation of attributes by the customers. The role of attribute dependence in the firm’s product placement decisions has been studied as an interaction between vertical and horizontal differentiation (Neven and Thisse 1990; Degryse 1996; Canoy and Peitz 1997; Degryse and Irmen 2001a, b; Piga and Poyago-Theotoky 2005). This paper contributes to this literature by introducing attribute dependence in the analysis of vertical product differentiation: when the quality of a product has several dimensions, one may reasonably assume that the contribution of the qualities to consumer utility could be multiplicative in some settings. Attribute dependence in vertical differentiation may originate in several ways. First, it may be a matter of consumer preferences. Some of the examples mentioned by Garella and Lambertini (2014) help illustrate this point: a positive interaction can exist between a taste for well tailored dresses and a taste for garments made with high quality fabric if the consumer’s valuation of the design quality increases in proportion to the quality of the cloth. Conversely, a negative interaction between quality dimensions can be found in products such as smartphones: business users might find the introduction of a new function to allow for faster playing in videos games less exciting than the accessibility of voice and data transmission. Second, attribute dependence can also be a consequence of technical aspects related to the way the attributes interact with each other, and then how the consumer can enjoy those characteristics. Consider one of the examples offered by Lauga and Ofek (2011): digital storage solutions are typically evaluated by their capacity to store data as well as how quickly data can be accessed for processing. Both quality dimensions are actually complementary, given that faster processors are needed to work more efficiently with enhanced capacity storage solutions (i.e. the marginal utility provided by enhanced capacity increases when processors work faster). Similar considerations can be made for software products in terms of two basic quality dimensions, namely security and performance. Another example can be found in banking services: if we consider accessibility as a quality variable, we could consider two dimensions of accessibility to banking services, physical accessibility (the expected distance to the bank determined by number of branches, ATMs, POSs, etc) and remote (on line) accessibility. In this case, one could say there is a certain degree of substitutability between both qualities. Network externalities and compatibility are also examples of positive quality interdependence to the extent that these externalities create an element of vertical differentiation, and therefore the marginal utility of increased network size is higher, the greater the product’s inherent quality (Baake and Boom 2001; Sun et al. 2004; Shy 2011). Finally, the importance of interdependence in markets for products with multiple qualities is shown in the empirical literature on quality differentiation; examples of this are given by Bajic (1993) for the automobile industry, Tay (2003) for the hospital care market, or Zhang et al. (2014) for software products. The aim of this paper is to contribute to the literature on vertical product differentiation with multiple qualities. In particular, the model is related to models by Vandenbosch and Weinberg (1995), who obtain the basic outcomes of strategic interaction with two vertical characteristics, Lauga and Ofek (2011), who tackle the influence of quality costs on this kind of strategic competition, Garella and Lambertini (2014), who analyze the role of the dominance of one quality over the other, and Benassi et al. (2019), who study the role of the properties of preferences in vertical differentiation models, specifically regarding the implications of agent heterogeneity by considering non-uniform consumer distributions. The formulation proposed in the paper is also related to Baake and Boom (2001) and Sun et al. (2004), who deal with the interdependence between network externalities and quality differentiation. The basic contribution of this paper is to introduce attribute dependence in a two-dimensional model of vertical product differentiation and to show how the type and magnitude of the interaction between the quality characteristics (either complementarity or substitutability) determine the nature of the differentiation equilibrium. Our analysis shows that attribute dependence gives rise to maximal differentiation in both qualities, in contrast with the standard outcome in multicharacteristic models, which states that firms differentiate their products in just one quality dimension: firms choose maximum differentiation along one of the characteristics and minimum along the other (i.e. single quality leadership).Footnote 1 Specifically, we obtained three types of product market equilibrium configurations. The first one is a MaxMax equilibrium that corresponds to a situation in which one firm specializes in high quality (in both dimensions) whilst the other offers a low quality product (i.e. double quality leadership). This occurs if the degree of complementarity between the qualities is sufficiently high. The second equilibrium outcome is also a MaxMax equilibrium, which entails a different kind of specialization (relative to the previous one) where each firm specializes in a given quality, that is, one offers maximum quality in one dimension and minimum in the other, whilst its rival chooses the opposite combination of qualities (i.e. cross quality leadership). This outcome is obtained if the qualities have a sufficiently high degree of substitutability. Finally, a third equilibrium outcome is achieved for independent qualities, and for low degrees of both substitutability and complementarity. This outcome corresponds to the standard MinMax outcome in multidimensional differentiation models. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the basic model. In order to focus our attention on the implications of quality dependence, Sect. 3 studies the price and quality decisions under the assumption of zero production costs. Section 4 is devoted to the implications of our analysis for the strategic relationship between degrees of differentiation, and Sect. 5 incorporates the quality costs to the model and discusses their implications for the product market configuration. Finally, Sect. 6 presents our conclusions. In order to facilitate comprehension of the model characteristics and applicability, a series of illustrative examples of vertical differentiation in the banking industry are included in Sect. 2.3 (regarding the characteristics of preferences and demand structures), and in Sect. 3.3 (concerning the implications of our analysis for product market configurations). This industry has been chosen because it provides a variety of non-price competition dimensions which have been analyzed in depth in both theoretical and empirical works.",3

132.0,1.0,Journal of Economics,16 August 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-020-00712-w,Intra-brand competition in a differentiated oligopoly,January 2021,Michèle Breton,Lucia Sbragia,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In response to consumers’ increasing concern for the environment and interest in making greener choices,Footnote 1 firms have started investing in production practices that allow them to receive a label certifying their compliance with certain set standards (e.g. organic, bio, sustainable, fair trade). Firms that earn a “green” label diversify their product offering from a conventional one. For example, in the fishery industry, when a company adopting a specific production technique receives the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) label following a certification process, it diversifies its product offering and competes against companies selling non MSC-certified products. Moreover, certified firms may also compete against each other. In this paper, we use the term inter-brand competition to designate competition among firms selling different but interchangeable products (substitute goods), and intra-brand competition to designate competition among firms selling the same (homogenous) product. Inter-brand and intra-brand competition have been mainly studied in the contexts of vertical agreements or of supply channels. In the legal literature, issues consist of assessing whether vertical agreements (e.g. between manufacturers and retailers) may prevent or restrict competition. In the economics literature, vertical agreements in oligopolistic markets have been analyzed under a strategic perspective, for instance to determine the equilibrium contract offered by the upstream firms and the resulting impact on downstream competition (see for instance Saggi and Vettas 2002), or to examine whether cooperation or collusion among competitors may be beneficial (see for instance Kawasaki et al. 2019). A large body of papers in the marketing-channel literature define intra-brand competition as the competition between retailers of the same product, while inter-brand competition occurs between manufacturers of substitutable products. This literature is primarily concerned with the coordination of marketing channels, using pricing and/or marketing mix variables (see Cai et al. 2019 for a survey). Unlike the above-cited literature, we do not assume coordination, integration or agreements between firms. Using the emergence of green production practices as a motivating example, the objective of this paper is to analyze various sources of competition in a differentiated oligopoly. For instance, the introduction of green products in an oligopolistic market corresponds to introducing inter-brand competition in a context where intra-brand competition is present. On the other hand, moving from a differentiated duopoly to a differentiated oligopoly corresponds to introducing intra-brand competition in a context with inter-brand competition. We extend the duopoly model of Singh and Vives (1984) by assuming that two varieties of a product are supplied by two groups of homogeneous firms that compete in quantity. This is different than having N firms producing one variety each, as in Vives (1985), Häckner (2000) or Amir and Jin (2001), since it accounts for both inter-brand competition and intra-brand competition. Furthermore, in our model, each firm pays a fixed cost related to the product variety supplied, which is a sine qua non condition to access different markets. Finally, for a given industry size, we allow firms to revise their decision about which product variety they will supply. This decision is based on the different groups’ relative economic performance. We first analyze the differentiated oligopoly model for the Cournot solution corresponding to a given industry size and composition. We then investigate the impact of changes in three different sources of competition, that is, in the degree of product substitutability, in the total number of firms, and in the industry configuration, specifically examining the consequences of such changes on equilibrium quantities and social welfare. We also characterize the equilibrium industry configuration when firms can change their decision about which product variety to supply. Finally, to derive further insights, we perform some numerical simulations in which, rather than adopting simplifying assumptions on the parameter values, we make conjectures about their relative values, based on what we would see in an industry providing a certified “green” product and a conventional “brown” one. The first part of our analysis is related to what is done in Saggi and Vettas (2002) and Dou and Ye (2017). Both papers use a special case of the differentiated duopoly model where the two markets for the substitutable varieties are identical. In Dou and Ye (2017), the cost structure of the firms is absent, so that the two groups of firms only differ in terms of size, and results are expressed in terms of market composition only. In Saggi and Vettas (2002), the costs (fixed and variable) and group sizes result from upstream decisions. In our model we adopt an asymmetric context that encompasses both the Dou and Ye (2017) and Saggi and Vettas (2002) models: firms sustain different production costs, and markets exhibit different features, so that all the model parameters are asymmetric. This allows us to express our results not only in terms of market composition, but also of market conditions and firms’ characteristics. This broad asymmetric context is encapsulated in one parameter called “weighted relative efficiency” (WRE), expressed as the two types of firms showing different WRE levels (e.g. small and large). Symmetric results can be retrieved from ours as a very special case, when firms in both groups have the same WRE, which can still be replicated in our model by firms and markets characterized by different parameter values. This is because, in our differentiated oligopoly, it is the relationship among the parameters that matters rather than their individual values. In terms of findings, one of our main contributions regards the impact of product substitutability on the individual equilibrium quantities. We find that a stronger horizontal product competition can have a positive effect on a firm’s output in the presence of intra-brand competition, which is not possible in a simple differentiated duopoly. This beneficial effect on a firm’s output is related to the interaction between the degree of product substitutability and the (negative) variation of the other product-type quantity. We identify the market conditions, firms’ characteristics, and industry composition that result in a positive impact of product substitutability on the individual equilibrium quantities. A second main result comes from the analysis of the social welfare impact of changes in the market composition due to either firm entry or to firms switching from one group to the other. We find that positive impacts are driven by two facets: an increase in the overall industry efficiency, and/or an increase in intra-brand competition. A third main result concerns the impact of intra-brand competition on the equilibrium supply of individual firms when the size of the industry is fixed, that is, when firms switch from one group to the other. An intensification of intra-brand competition in the smaller group always has a negative effect on the individual quantity produced in this group, no matter its WRE. However, an intensification of intra-brand competition in the larger group can have positive consequences on the individual quantities produced by its members, due to the interplay between the degree of product substitutability and the (positive) impact of inter-brand competition. When we turn to the equilibrium analysis of the industry composition for a fixed overall industry size, we find that all configurations are possible (single-variety market of any type or market with two varieties), according to the values of the model parameters. Comparing the equilibrium market composition to the social optimum configuration, we obtain that social welfare is always maximized when the majority of firms pertains to the group with the highest WRE, while the equilibrium industry composition rather depends on the relative importance of fixed (e.g. certification) costs. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the differentiated oligopoly model with two varieties produced by N firms. Section 3 analyzes the impact of product substitutability on the equilibrium solution of the game. Sections 4 and 5 investigate the consequences of intra-brand competition, resulting from changes in the size or composition of the industry, on firms’ equilibrium output and on social welfare, while Sect. 6 characterizes the equilibrium market composition arising when firms can switch from one group to the other. Finally, Sect. 7 presents some numerical illustrations and Sect. 8 concludes the paper.",4
132.0,1.0,Journal of Economics,01 August 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-020-00713-9,Multitasking: incentivizing agents differing either in their work ethic or intrinsic motivation,January 2021,Carsten Helm,Franz Wirl,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Managing multitasking is a widely acknowledged problem. Indeed, the contribution of Bengt Holmström was a major justification for awarding him the Nobel prize in 2016. An agent’s positive contribution to an unobservable and, therefore, not incentivized task requires an intrinsic motive. As known since the seminal paper of Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991), incentivizing an agent with respect to an observable output will lower the agent’s effort on the unobservable task and thus will impose costs beyond the usual agency costs. The IT-business provides an example where intrinsic motives are important. Fulfilling use-needs, personal enjoyment and satisfying a quest for learning (Benbya and Belbaly 2010) stimulate individuals up to the point of working free of charge in non-traditional production communities like Wikipedia, Linux and Mozilla (see e.g., Lakhani and Wolf 2005 on what motivates hackers and more recently Kolbjørnsrud 2016 accounting for agency problems in such communities). Recently, Goes et al. (2018) find that multitasking lowers customer satisfactions with firms offering consumer service chats enabled by information technology. Our objective is to compare incentives, which are offered to agents who differ about what they hold as private information: either about their work ethic, which reduces their effort cost, or their  intrinsic motivation, i.e. their private benefit from the non-observable task. This differentiation is close to the application of the multitasking framework to bonus culture in Benabou and Tirole (2016). Our characterizations of types imply the same performance in the absence of incentives and are in this sense observation-equivalent. This property is the only reason for choosing work ethic instead of productivity as Benabou and Tirole (2016). Moreover, work ethic and productivity are equivalent in the case of a single task with and without incentives. We are interested whether the two observation-equivalent types receive different incentives and, how they differ in terms of efforts, wages, employment and output. We also examine under which circumstances incentives are feasible, and which types particular firms might actively seek. We find that very similar and in the above sense even equivalent characterizations lead to the following surprising results:  Incentivizing leads to different contracts and the difference can be substantial. The order of efficiency (in terms of the tasks prescribed and of the point of no distortion from the first best) is reversed for intrinsically motivated types, i.e., the lowest type is asked to deliver the highest output, although high types are more efficient under a fixed wage. Sufficient importance of the unobservable task constrains what the principal can demand in terms of the observable task. Adding this binding constraint still allows for incentives if the agents are characterized by their work ethic but can render incentives impossible for intrinsically motivated agents. The first point is not confined to multitasking and is a general warning far beyond the particular case. It applies to all applications in which the agents’ utility function is additively separable—e.g., to represent a cost-benefit trade-off—so that one has to decide to which term the private information should be attached. Although  observation-equivalence seems to suggest that one can choose between attaching the private information to either term, this is not the case so that this choice must be exercised with reason and care. The other two points are specific to multi-tasking. The reversing of the ordering of an agent’s efficiency is puzzling because the principal prefers high types under no incentives for both characterizations and also if incentivizing agents differing with respect to their work ethic. Clearly, a high work ethic allows for higher demands of the observable output and only this output can be incentivized. A high intrinsic motive of providing the necessarily unincentivized unobservable task makes it harder to incentivize the observable task. This makes high types less attractive for a principal using incentives. The reason for the third point—the impossibility to incentivize agents characterized by their intrinsic motive—is linked to the above explanation. The necessity of a minimal contribution to the unobservable task constrains what the principal can demand from the observable task. Given the observation-equivalence, the same observable output results contingent on the unobservable one and is increasing with respect to both types, work ethic and intrinsic motivation. However, the interior mechanism is a declining one for intrinsically motivated agents for the above given reason. Combining the declining interior with the increasing boundary solution violates the requirement of monotonicity and thus renders incentives impossible. In contrast, agents characterized by their work ethic can be incentivized even if a contract must ensure a minimal output of the unobservable task. This has the empirically testable implication that the market should provide incentives in one case (work ethic) but much less so in the other case (intrinsic motivation). A further consequence is that the introduction of incentives due to liberalization, more (including international) competition and in the extreme case of a transition from socialism to markets, depends on the kind of types that were observation equivalent in the absence of incentives. Furthermore, a firm has to attract the most suitable types for the firm’s particular needs, which can be highly different across firms, e.g., between IT and public administration. This last implication, incentives (possibly steep ones) for one category of types and tasks but no incentives (i.e., fixed wages) for another category allows for a (partial) explanation of some of the recently heavily debated differentiation and segmentation of the labor markets and the related increase of the Gini-coefficients in industrialized societies contrary to Kuznet’s hypothesis and to trends during the whole 20th century. According to our findings, this can be partially attributed to the broad replacement of flat wages and hierarchies by incentives during the last decades. The introduction of incentives ranges from the CEOs down to the shop floor, from Western societies to former Communist or Socialist countries many of them developing countries. However, this change affected different industries and tasks differently, in particular, more in IT-related industries and services compared to old industries like steel manufacturing and to public administration, teaching etc. While there is no difference for fixed wages, dramatic differences emerge under incentives depending on which side—work ethic (or productivity) or intrinsic motive - a particular job falls. Intrinsic motives combined with multitasking seem to play a crucial role in professions like teaching, nursing,Footnote 1 etc. Those jobs face already Baumol’s cost disease and are in addition constrained in applying incentives. For the example of climate change, Helm and Wirl (2016) already pointed out that the climate contracts in Martimort and Sand-Zantman (2013, 2016) as well as in Helm and Wirl (2014) differ substantially depending on whether private information is attached to the benefits or costs of mitigation efforts. To analyze this issue more systematically, in this paper we construct a model that is observation equivalent in the absence of contracts. Moreover, we explore the relevance of this issue in the widely applied setting of multi-tasking and outline some implications for the use of incentives in labor markets. The chosen multitasking framework and its potential applications are related to many papers in industrial organization, labor and managerial economics. For example, Kragl and Schöttner (2014) consider the probability of completing a task by an agent engaged in two kinds of efforts with costs similar to our model, but no benefits from an intrinsic motivation. It falls into the line of multi-tasking papers going back at least to Feltham and Xie (1994), who analyze how to reward an agent on the basis of a performance measure, strictly separable cost functions, and risk. Baker (2002) emphasizes the trade-off between risk aversion and performance distortion in this framework. Schnedler (2008) allows for costs described by positive definite quadratic forms (as in our model) and emphasizes the signal to noise ratio associated with the performance measure.",1
132.0,1.0,Journal of Economics,30 July 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-020-00710-y,"Optimal stopping time, consumption, labour, and portfolio decision for a pension scheme",January 2021,Francesco Menoncin,Sergio Vergalli,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"According to the Finnish Centre for Pensions,Footnote 1 in the EU15 countries, the average retirement age is 65 years. Instead, in the other 12 EU countries, the retirement age is lower, but it is planned to be raised to the same level over the next decade. Furthermore, Germany, Denmark, France, and Spain have decided to increase the retirement age from 65 to 67 years, while the goal is 68 years in both UK and Ireland. Most of the changes in retirement ages are scheduled for the 2020s. In Italy, the Netherlands, Finland, Cyprus, Denmark, Greece, Portugal, UK and Slovakia, the retirement age will be linked to the development of the life expectancy. “European pension systems are facing the dual challenge of remaining financially sustainable and being able to provide Europeans with an adequate income in retirement” (European Commission 2017). Actually, life expectancy after the age of 70 has been constantly increasing over the last decades, generating the so-called “longevity risk” (European Commission 2018a). Thus, without a counterbalance increase in the retirement age, the level of contributions paid by the workers, could not be able to suitably finance the pensions that will have to be paid for increasingly longer period of time. Combined to this, the calculation of the optimal retirement age plays a crucial role (Farhi and Panageas 2007). Let us assume a worker that must decide the level of consumption for the coming years including the retirement period, given his level of wealth. This agent would be exposed to both market risks and mortality risk. In this work we study the problem of such an agent whose wage, investment opportunities, and death are all stochastic. We show that a part of the optimal strategy for the agent is to invest in a life annuity and to borrow against his human capital. It is well known that social security wealth,Footnote 2 which typically constitutes the biggest share of a retiree’s wealth, comes in an annuitised form. In some countries, annuity markets are growing, especially in UK where pension schemes have transferred \(\pounds \)135bn of liabilities to insurers over the last decade, and this is set to quadruple over the next 10 years,Footnote 3 while in the US the annuity market is around 234 billion dollars.Footnote 4 In this work we do not take into account any pension scheme. Instead, we investigate the choice of an agent who can only rely on both his wage and his financial investments. Actually, in some countries, future retirees will have to rely less on social security schemes and more on funded pension plans (Feldstein and Siebert 2002; Diamond and Orszag 2005; Rusconi 2008), which mostly leave to each individual the choice between annuitising and cashing-out pension wealth at retirement. There exists a wide literature about optimal investment in financial market and annuitisation, and it mainly refers to life cycle frameworks with uncertainty. Benitez-Silva (2000) presents a dynamic model of labour/leisure, consumption/saving, considering additional sources of uncertainty, introducing annuities and Social Security, and providing a general framework which allows for policy experimentation in a life cycle model. Friedman and Warshawsky (1990), focus on annuity pricing in order to explain the almost nonexistence of a market for these instruments and do not consider investment uncertainty. Longevity uncertainty and purchase of annuities is taken into account in Brugiavini (1993) in a two/three period model with different behaviour of employees and entrepreneurs. Mitchell et al. (1999) calculate the expected present value of the annuities by using the term structure of interest rate rather than a fixed interest rate, and they find that retirees should value annuities even if they are not actuarially fair. Brown (1999a, b), introduce uncertainty and use data on older Americans to construct a measure of the consumer’s valuation of additional annuitisation and to test the hypothesis that old individuals purchase term insurance to offset the excessive annuitisation imposed by the government social programs. Kotlikoff and Spivak (1981) study the role of the family as an incomplete annuities market, with the annuity decision made at exogenous points in time. Eichenbaum and Peled (1987) analyse the over accumulation of private capital in a two period model of competitive annuities with adverse selection. Recently, Menoncin and Regis (2017) found that individuals should optimally invest a large fraction of their wealth in longevity linked assets in the pre-retirement phase, because of their need to hedge against stochastic fluctuations in their remaining lifetime at retirement. In a two period framework, Magnani (2020) studies the optimal retirement problem for an agent who can also chose how to save from his/her (risky) salary. In line with the previous statements, in this paper we solve the problem of a representative agent who must decide, at the same time: (1) how much to work, (2) how much to invest on financial market, (3) how much to consume, and (4) when to retire. The agent’s time horizon coincides with his death time and the optimisation problem is subject to some risks: (1) the market risk on the financial market (mainly price risk), (2) the mortality risk on agent’s lifetime, and (3) the wage risk on agent’s wealth. We model the risk through a Wiener process and we solve the problem to maximise the expected utility of agent’s inter-temporal consumption and leisure (defined as nonworking hours). After retirement, we assume the agent is still able to work, but he will receive a fraction of the wage. Of course, the agent must finance his consumption over his whole life time. The utility of leisure is assumed to be proportional to agent’s received wage and, accordingly, reduces after retirement. Here, we define the human capital as the total expected discount value of future wages. This work builds on the same framework studied in Menoncin (2008) and Menoncin and Regis (2017). In both these papers, a longevity linked security is listed on a complete arbitrage-free financial market, but the retirement age is compulsory. Instead, here we take into account only the mortality risk, but we solve the problem of the optimal retirement age. We use a two step approach: first we find the optimal consumption, labour supply, and portfolio for any possible (stochastic) stopping time, then we compute the optimal stopping time by maximising the value function that solves the first problem. We solve the problem by using both the so-called martingale approach and the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman partial differential equation. The framework of an optimal stopping time problem is often applied to the real options,Footnote 5 when an irrevocable decision must be taken. Actually, also in this case, the decision to retire cannot be called off and it permanently affects the dynamics of agent’s problem. Bodie et al. (1992) suggested that “one current research objective is to analyse the retirement problem as an optimal stopping problem and to evaluate the accompanying portfolio effects”. Also Kula (2003) wrote that “the retirement decision may be treated as an investment process: first we collect capital/retirement wealth, and if we have accumulated enough we invest/retire, depending on the actual and expected prices/wages”. Finally, Farhi and Panageas (2007) extended Bodie et al. (1992) in a optimal stopping problem, also focusing on the “importance of the real option to retire for portfolio choice”. In solving our problem we must assume that the market is complete. This means that the agent is able to borrow against his future wages (human capital) and any risk on the financial market can be perfectly hedged through a suitable portfolio. When we turn to the second problem, that is the optimal stopping problem, we are able to find a closed form solution only if we assume that the inter-temporal preference parameter coincides with the risk aversion parameter. Under this hypothesis, the value function of the second problem can be written in closed form as a function of a wage threshold. When this threshold is crossed, then the agent finds it optimal to retire. Finally, we calibrate our model to the US data and we present some numerical results that allow to investigate the dynamic behaviour of the optimal consumption, labour supply, and portfolio. In the simulations we study two cases: (A) when the agent is not allowed to work any longer after retirement and so his salary immediately drops to zero, and (B) when the agent is still allowed to work but at a reduced salary (one third of the original salary). We show that the optimal retirement should happen after about 50 years of working (on average) in case A and 35 years in case B. If we assume that an agent begins working when he is about 25, this choice implies a retirement age that is close to the statutory value in case A, but which is much lower than the statutory age in case B. The optimal labour supply is of course higher in case A then in case B, while in case B it remains positive even for a very old age. Furthermore, we show that cases A and B differ a lot also for the optimal choice of consumption and portfolio. In case B both optimal values are monotonic function of time. In particular, the optimal consumption is a reducing fraction of wealth over time, while the optimal portfolio is an increasing function of time. This last result suggests that agent should invest in a less risky portfolio when they are young, and increase the risky proportion when they grow older. This result is definitely different in case A: the fact that the agent cannot count any longer on a wage after retirement, deeply modify his portfolios strategy. The optimal portfolio composition is highly volatile during the middle age of the agent, while after retirement the percentage of risky asset becomes constant. In fact, when there is no more (wage) risk to hedge against, the optimal portfolio is just given by its speculative component. In case A, the optimal consumption ratio is decreasing over time for a young agent, but then it starts increasing and it becomes constant after retirement. In fact, we know from the literature, that without labour income, and with constant relative risk aversion preferences, the optimal consumption is a constant percentage of wealth. The remaining of the paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 shows the framework, Sect. 3 presents the result of the first problem, i.e. the optimal consumption, labour supply, and portfolio. Section 4 shows the optimal stopping problem, and solves it in closed form. Section 5 presents a numerical simulation calibrated on the US data. Section 6 concludes, and some technical results are gathered in three appendices.",

Jansen,Liqun Liu,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The relationship between migrations and the fiscal policies of local governments has drawn extensive economic analyses.Footnote 1 It is properly emphasized in these studies that the causal effect in this relationship could run in both directions. On the one hand, the high tax/debt policy in a jurisdiction may cause its residents to migrate to another jurisdiction, a mechanism referred to as tax/debt-driven migration. On the other hand, the presence of migration, or even the threat to migrate, helps shape the fiscal policies in jurisdictions that are connected through migration. In this paper we analyze the effects of inter-jurisdiction migration on the fiscal policies of two local governments in a two-period setting. Local fiscal policies are determined in the first period, and individuals in each jurisdiction face a probability of migrating to another jurisdiction between the two periods. The residents in a jurisdiction have a tendency to run excessive debt because, once moving to the other jurisdiction, they are no longer responsible for the debt repayment in their original jurisdiction. In this aspect, our analysis is closely related to those that have previously examined the debt-increasing effect of migration, including Daly (1969), Oates (1972), Bruce (1995), Schultz and Sjostrom (2001, 2004), Ben-Gad (2018), and Gordon and Guerron-Quintana (2019), among others.Footnote 2 However, our analysis goes beyond those earlier analyses by making a distinction between government spending on public consumption (which produces a publicly-provided good in period 1) and government spending on public investment (which produces a publicly-provided good in period 2). With a positive probability of out-migrating in the future, residents in a jurisdiction view public investment in their jurisdiction as less valuable than when migration is impossible. Therefore, spending on public consumption and spending on public investment should be treated as separate variables in the model of the fiscal policies of local governments that are connected by migration. Making a distinction between these two types of government spending facilitates obtaining two new, clear-cut theoretical findings within a two-jurisdiction, two-period model in which initially identical residents in each jurisdiction choose both public consumption and public investment in period 1, before knowing their migration status in period 2. First, as the between-jurisdiction migration intensifies, both jurisdictions in the Nash equilibrium incur more spending on public consumption, less spending on public investment, and more total spending. Further, this total spending will equal the level of government debt, because in the Nash equilibrium both jurisdictions opt for debt financing in the presence of migration. Compared to the earlier studies on the effect of migration on local governments’ debt levels that do not treat public consumption and public investment separately, the result above explicitly attributes the increased debt level due to migration to increased public consumption (or more precisely, government spending incurred to provide goods in the current period). Indeed, in response to a heightened probability of migration, public investment (or more precisely, government spending incurred in the present to provide goods in the future period) actually decreases exactly when the total government spending increases. Put differently, the distinction introduced in this paper sharpens the opposing equilibrium effects of an increase in the probability of migration on public consumption and public investment. Second, while the Nash equilibrium without any restriction on local government debt is characterized by too much public consumption, too little public investment and excessive debt, the first-best allocation can be achieved through Nash play by imposing the restriction that public consumption should only be financed by a contemporary tax and not by borrowing.Footnote 3 The intuition for this result is that, because the financing decision of both public consumption and public investment is made in period 1 before migration occurs, this financing restriction avoids the intergenerational/life-cycle opportunism of the mobile representative individuals, thereby internalizing the fiscal externality that otherwise exists. This result provides a theoretical justification, based on migration, for the widespread practice of national governments imposing debt limits on local governments.Footnote 4 In contrast, a balanced-budget restriction, which prohibits government borrowing, would not achieve the first-best allocation. This result is the same in spirit as that obtained by Bassetto and Sargent (2006) in a model of overlapping generations without migration. They find that whenever demographics do not imply Ricardian equivalence, a “golden rule” that separates capital and ordinary account budgets and finances only capital spending with debt is approximately optimal. In the real world, and especially when the jurisdictions are countries rather than subnational regions within a country, migration is often one-directional, where one of the two linked jurisdictions is the migration destination (e.g., the U.S., Australia or Canada) and the other is the migration origin (e.g., Puerto Rico, Mexico, China or India). So the paper goes on to analyze how the intensity of one-directional migration affects the fiscal policies of the two jurisdictions. It finds that migration’s effects on the migration destination are very similar to those obtained in the model with mutual migration, and that migration’s effects on the migration origin critically depend on how responsive the fiscal policies of the migration destination are to migration. The analysis in this paper is related to a few recent studies on the effects of migration on the fiscal policies of local governments. Schultz and Sjostrom (2001) study the effect of migration on local government debts and find that the level of local debts is higher under higher level of migration. Our analysis differs from theirs by making a distinction between public consumption and public investment. With this distinction, we find that the increased debt level is caused by a larger spending on public consumption, and the spending on public investment actually decreases. Moreover, this distinction facilitates a new result that the Nash equilibrium outcome of the fiscal-policy game between local governments is identical to the first-best outcome if local governments are required to finance their public consumption with contemporary taxation. Borck et al. (2007) also consider fiscal competition between jurisdictions with mutual migration, and make a distinction between government spending that benefits mobile skilled workers and government spending that benefits immobile unskilled workers. Their focus is on migration’s effect on the composition of these two types of local government spending. Our analysis instead focuses on migration’s effect on local government debts and on the composition of public consumption and public investment in government spending. More recently, Gordon and Guerron-Quintana (2019) consider the effect of migration on local government borrowing in a model where there exists no productive capital to transfer resources between the two periods, but local governments can borrow/lend from one another to help resident citizens smooth consumption over time. In equilibrium, the total net borrowing from all regional governments must be zero, characterizing an endogenous interest rate. In their model, while migration has a direct positive effect on local government borrowing, it also has an indirect negative effect on local government borrowing through its positive effect on the interest rate. Indeed, the direct positive effect and the indirect negative effect must exactly offset each other in order to reach the equilibrium characterized by zero net borrowing. In our model, in contrast, individuals can invest in productive capital to smooth consumption over time, and local governments borrow from their own residents rather than from other local governments. Finally, Dai et al. (2019a, b) analyze the role of restrictions on local government debts in a federal system where the federal government can redistribute income across regional governments but how one region differs from another is the regions’ private information. Our analysis differs from theirs in that we focus on the interregional externalities caused by migration; our analysis is not concerned with the federal government’s redistributive policy and asymmetric information. Moreover, the optimal restrictions on local government debts take very different forms in Dai et al. (2019a, b). The main results are established in Sect. 2 in a model with two identical jurisdictions, separable utility functions, a perfect dichotomy between public consumption and public investment, no cross-jurisdiction debt holding, and exogenous migration. The focus of this section is on the effects of mutual migration on two linked jurisdictions’ fiscal policies.Footnote 5 We consider an alternative model of migration and local government debts in Sect. 3, and show that the main results obtained in Sect. 2 remain valid. Section 4 extends the analysis to the asymmetric case where the two linked jurisdictions/countries can be of different population sizes and migration is one-directional. The analysis in this section addresses migration’s effects on two linked jurisdictions/countries’ fiscal policies in situations where one jurisdiction/country is the destination of migration and the other is the origin of migration. Section 5 shows that the results obtained in Sect. 2 can be generalized to the case of non-separable utility functions, the case where the dichotomy between public consumption and public investment is imperfect (i.e. the case where the publicly-provided goods are durable), the case of cross-jurisdiction debt holding, and the more general case of endogenous migration. Section 6 concludes.",3

To attract those developers, platforms have to offer them enough tools to innovate, and let them exploit their innovations profitably. For example, Android and iOS provide system development toolkits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs) that allow third-party developers to build new applications, such as Whatsapp, Uber, or Airbnb. Thus, via SDKs or APIs, platforms disclose part of their core to foster innovation (they “open” themselves), and grant developers control rights over their innovations to exploit them. Some of those platforms have been quite successful and have created multimillionaire businesses, such as Google or Amazon, which have also attracted the attention of public authorities, who under the idea that there is a “mismatch” between where value is created and where taxes are paid, have proposed reforms of corporate tax rules. Nonetheless, given the difficulty to tax the corporate income of global digital platforms, several countries have implemented other tax instruments, such as the “YouTube Tax” in France, which taxes advertising revenues.Footnote 1 In contrast with corporate taxes, these new taxes directly influence the competition among platforms. However, could those taxes influence how control rights are allocated? In other words, could those taxes influence the intellectual property (IP) policies of platforms? Could those taxes be used to promote platform openness? How? These questions belong to a strand of literature that has been scarcely addressed in the last decade, the competition in non-price features. As Jullien and Sand-Zantman (2019) or Foros et al. (2015) point out, the gratuity of digital platforms shifts the locus of competition from prices to the non-price features, such as privacy or intellectual property rights. In this sense, to the best of my knowledge, only Parker and Van Alstyne (2018) address the role of intellectual property rights in two-sided platforms. Therefore, to answer those questions, I extend the Parker and Van Alstyne (2018) model, in which a monopoly chooses the openness degree and the length of the exclusivity period awarded to developers to exploit their innovations. Following this framework, I address the impact of taxation on the original model and the duopoly extension. In the monopoly case, ad-valorem taxes have clear effects on openness and the exclusivity period, but unit taxes have ambiguous effects in general. Ad-valorem taxes levied on developers reduce openness and the exclusivity period. Intuitively, the attractiveness of future profits derived from cumulative innovations is less appealing, which reduces the incentive to support third-party developers’ activities. However, the impact on welfare is generally ambiguous. Only when the optimal exclusivity period is perpetual, the effect is unambiguously negative. In other words, an ad-valorem tax on developers’ revenues may reduce welfare if the platform never incorporates developers’ innovations to its core. This is, for example, the case of video game platforms, where developers keep the control rights over their games indefinitely. In this case, such a tax reduces the available tools for developers, their innovations, and welfare. The opposite would be true if taxes would be levied on users. In the duopoly extension, I find that, in general, competition decreases the length of the exclusivity period, but it may reduce openness, which has ambiguous effects on welfare. Nonetheless, taxes have a similar effect as in the monopoly case. The effect depends on which side taxes are levied on, and in general, when developers’ revenues are taxed, the openness degree is smaller. Thus, platforms are not so prone to share their technology with developers because part of the profits of such interaction is taxed. Therefore, openness is reduced, which reduces innovation on platforms. In terms of welfare, the effects are intuitively similar to the monopoly case. When it is optimal to set a perpetual exclusivity period, taxes on developers’ revenues have an unambiguously negative effect on welfare. In the rest of the cases, such effects are ambiguous. Lastly, when developers can be on both platforms at the same time (multihoming), the exclusivity period increases because multihoming mitigates competition on that side. There are no gains in competing for developers. Therefore, platforms behave as monopolies on that side, as the multi-sided theory predicts, and the intuitions about taxation are unchanged. I conclude by highlighting how the taxation of digital platforms modifies the optimal IP policies of platforms. It matters who pays. If we tax developers or the side that creates value (apart from a pure network effect), platforms will be less open. Therefore, if the Digital Service Tax (DST) proposed by the European Commission comes into force in its current form, it may lead to a lower level of openness and innovation in the European Union.",9
132.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,05 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-020-00725-5,Corporate social responsibility and partial privatisation of state holding corporations,April 2021,Quan Dong,Juan Carlos Bárcena-Ruiz,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper analyses partial privatisation of public firms. The study of this area began with the paper by Matsumura (1998) and has been extended to analyse different factors that affect partial privatisation of public firms.Footnote 1 We focus on a recent extension of this work that considers partial privatisation of public firms that compete with private firms which care about corporate social responsibility (CSR).Footnote 2 Most of the papers in question consider that private and public firms produce only one good. However, today’s economy shows that firms can produce various goods, which may be substitutes or complements. The partial privatisation of public firms that compete with private firms which care about CSR when firms produce several goods has not been studied. We seek to fill that gap in the literature in this paper. An analysis of the behaviour of firms in the product market reveals that they can have different objective functions. The most widely analysed case is that in which firms are pure profit maximisers (see, for example, Tirole 1988). Empirical evidence shows that the public sector has a significant percentage of ownership in many firms, so another widely analysed case is that in which public and private firms compete in the same market (see, for example, De Fraja and Delbono 1989, 1990; Corneo and Jeanne 1994). Most papers that analyse mixed and private markets assume that private firms maximise their own profits. However, the objective function of private firms may include CSR along with their own profits.Footnote 3 KPMG (2013, 2015) provides evidence of firms that concern themselves with CSR, which becomes an important business strategy. As a result, this issue is receiving increasing attention from researchers who analyse private and mixed markets.Footnote 4 In this paper we analyse partial privatisation of public firms when they compete with private firms that care about CSR. The literature that analyses mixed markets has widely studied the privatisation of public firms.Footnote 5 Most of the papers in this literature share two main characteristics: first, they assume that private firms are pure profit maximisers. Second, they consider a single public firm that produces a single good at a single production plant. However, CSR has become an important business strategy for private firms, and governments usually own firms that produce various types of goods at various production plants organised as state holding corporations. In recent years, the literature on mixed markets has analysed partial privatisation of public firms that compete with private firms concerned with CSR. In this framework, Ouattara (2017) and Itano (2017) analyse partial privatisation assuming a mixed duopoly when firms have identical cost functions. They show that as private firms become more concerned with CSR, the optimal privatisation ratio of the public firm decreases. In addition, if the CSR level is high enough the government chooses full nationalisation.Footnote 6 Kim et al. (2019) study partial privatisation considering a mixed triopoly when private firms have a different cost function than the public firm. Their results differ from those of the papers cited above. They show that depending on the CSR level and cost differences between firms, both nationalisation and full privatisation can be optimal. In addition, when cost functions are identical, the optimal degree of privatisation decreases with the CSR level, so nationalisation can be optimal. However, the optimal degree of privatisation is non-monotone regarding the CSR level if there is significant objective heterogeneity between private firms; in this last case nationalisation is not optimal. These papers assume that firms produce a homogeneous good and have just one production plant. Dong and Wang (2019) extend the above analysis and study CSR adopted by a private firm that only produces one product and competes with a public firm that produces two goods under fixed levels of privatisation. The theoretical literature on mixed oligopoly has analysed the privatisation of state holding corporations (henceforth referred to as state corporations) when they compete with private firms.Footnote 7 Bárcena-Ruiz and Garzón (2017) consider a state corporation with two plants that produce differentiated goods. They study whether the government fully privatises the state corporation, and if so whether the two plants are sold to different private investors or to a single investor. Dong et al. (2018) extend the above analysis by assuming that the government may partially privatise the state corporation. Finally, Bárcena-Ruiz et al. (2020) extend the above paper by considering that the private sector is partially foreign-owned. In these papers private firms are not concerned with CSR. Thus, the literature on mixed markets has not analysed partial privatisation of state corporations that compete with CSR firms. To fill this gap in the literature, we consider in this paper that private firms are run by their owners, are concerned with CSR and produce the same goods as the state corporation. There is empirical evidence supporting the issue analysed in the paper. Dong et al. (2018) describe evidence supporting the idea that partial privatisation of state corporations is a relevant issue. Moreover, there are state corporations that compete with private firms that care about CSR. For example, Dong and Wang (2019) note that the Russian energy corporation Rosneft, owned partly by the Russian government, compete in the domestic market with the private firms BP and Total; these two firms care about CSR, as shown in their corporate websites. Other example is the case of Orange, a French telecommunications corporation partly owned by the French government. It competes in the European market with private firms that care about CSR, such as Vodafone.Footnote 8 To analyse this issue we consider an industry made up by a state corporation and a private sector. The private sector comprises two private plants that are concerned with CSR and that produce differentiated goods, and those goods may be substitutes or complements. Those plants may be owned by different investors (henceforth uniplant firms) or by a single investor (henceforth the multiplant firm). The state corporation owns two production plants each of which produces a differentiated good. When privatising the state corporation the government has two options: it may sell a percentage of the ownership of both plants to a single private investor or a percentage of the ownership of each plant to a different private investor. As a result, the optimal degree of privatisation of the state corporation depends on three factors: whether goods are substitutes or complements, the degree to which private firms care about CSR (the CSR level), and whether firms are uniplant or multiplant. Kim et al. (2019), Outtara (2017) and Itano (2017), among others, point out that it is important to analyse how optimal privatisation of public firms depends on social concern of private firms. We want to further explore this issue by considering uniplant and multiplant firms, since both types are very important in the real world.Footnote 9 Furthermore, in today’s economy private firms are increasingly concerned with social issues, so it is important to study how optimal privatisation is affected by the degree to which private firms are concerned with those issues. All this makes the goal of the study set out in the paper relevant.Footnote 10 Our paper extends the studies by Kim et al. (2019), Outtara (2017) and Itano (2017). They assume that firms produce a homogeneous good and have just one production plant. We consider firms that may be uniplant or multiplant, and that there are two goods that can be substitutes or complements. This means that the optimal level of privatisation may depend on factors not considered in their papers. Our study is also different from that undertaken by Dong and Wang (2019) in several respects. They assume that the percentage of shares in the state corporation owned by the private sector is exogenously given, and determine the optimal level of CSR of the private firm. In our paper, we consider that the level of CSR is exogenously given (as, e.g., in Kim et al. 2019) and determine the percentage of shares of the state corporation that is sold to the private sector. In addition, we consider that the private sector produces two goods that can be substitutes or complements, while they consider that goods are substitutes and that the private sector produces just one good. As a benchmark we consider the case in which private firms are not concerned with CSR (Dong et al. 2018). In that case, the government partially privatises the state corporation. When goods are substitutes the government keeps a larger stake in the state corporation if its plants are sold to a single private investor than if they are sold to different private investors. Moreover, considering who the plants are sold to, the government retains a larger stake if private firms are uniplant than if they are multiplant. If goods are complements the opposite result is obtained. We find that when the degree to which firms are concerned with CSR is low enough, this result holds. The above result changes if firms are sufficiently concerned with CSR. We obtain that the privatisation policy of the government crucially depends on the CSR level. When that level takes an intermediate value the government partially privatises the state corporation, but if goods are substitutes (complements) the government keeps a larger (smaller) stake in the state corporation if private firms are uniplant than if they are multiplant. This result holds regardless of whether the plants of the state corporation are sold to a single private investor or to different private investors. When the CSR level is high, with substitute goods the government keeps the state corporation fully public with uniplant private firms and partially privatises with a multiplant private firm, so there is more privatisation in the latter case. When goods are complements the opposite result is obtained, so there is more privatisation with uniplant private firms. Finally, when the CSR level is high enough and goods are substitutes or low-level complements, the government maintains full ownership of the state corporation in all cases. Next, we analyse which organisational structure of firms generates greater welfare. When the CSR level is low, social welfare is greater with uniplant private firm if goods are substitutes and with a multiplant private firm if goods are complements. However, this result is reversed if private firms are highly concerned with CSR. This means that the preference of the government as to the organisational structure of firms crucially depends on the CSR level. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the model. Section 3 analyses the partial privatisation of the state corporation assuming uniplant private firms. Section 4 extends the analysis by considering a multiplant private firm. Section 5 compares the two cases and Sect. 6 concludes.",7

Recently, economists’ interest has been attracted to the long-run implications of migration on macroeconomic dynamics and economic growth. This literature comprises, among others, contributions by Ben Gad (2004, 2008), Klein and Ventura (2007, 2009) and Mandelman and Zlate (2012). In this set of papers, workers’ movements are supposed to be sluggish and migration is taken to be a permanent change of locations, with the result that local indeterminacy of the equilibrium, i.e. a continuum of equilibrium paths converging towards a unique steady state, never appears because of international labor mobility. In this vein, the unique exception is my own paper (Parello 2019), in which I show that free-labor mobility and temporary migrationFootnote 1 can be responsible for the emergence of indeterminacy of the equilibrium in a standard one-sector Neoclassical growth model of a small open economy. This paper takes a step forward in this direction and shows that indeterminacy may also emerge in a one-sector Ramsey economy with closed capital account and even in the absence of external effects. With respect to my previous study, the main innovation of this paper is in the determination of the interest rate. Indeed, while in small open-economy models the interest rate is totally delinked from the marginal returns of domestic capital and fixed by world capital markets, in this paper it equates the rate of return on capital and is set so as to balance the internal supply and demand of funds for capital accumulation. As is known, changes in the composition of the domestic workforce can affects macroeconomic equilibria in different ways depending on whether the capital account of the economy is supposed to be closed or open to international capital markets. It is then interesting to investigate whether the indeterminacy result of Parello (2019) can be extended to a more standard Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans economy, in which the host economy is no longer a price-taker in financial markets. To do this, in this paper I construct a one-sector perfectly-competitive economy based on the following assumptions: \(\left( i\right)\) labor is freely mobile across countries; \(\left( ii\right)\) the host economy, i.e. the economy that hosts immigrants, is closed to international trade and characterized by only one domestically-created asset: physical capital; \(\left( iii\right)\) technology is described by a strictly concave production function of three inputs: capital, native labor and immigrant labor; \(\left( iv\right)\) migration is assumed to be temporary and determined by an Harris–Todaro migration function (cf. Harris and Todaro 1970). Under these assumptions, I find that the unique steady-state equilibrium is locally indeterminate and also that migration can serve as an impulse for fluctuations in final output. In particular, I find that, for indeterminacy to arise, the diminishing marginal returns to private inputs have to be strong enough to make the trace of the Jacobian show the right sign. When this happens, first-order and transversality conditions are not sufficient to select a unique converging path, with the result that the host economy is characterized by extrinsic uncertainty and macroeconomic instability. The policy implication of this finding is that immigration quotas can serve it well to smooth belief-driven output fluctuations. My results are in line with the empirical literature on migration and the business cycle, finding that migration is procyclical and that the response of output and income to country-specific shocks becomes stronger in the presence of migration. For instance, in the SVAR literature, Furlanetto and Robstad (2019) find that immigration shocks are non-negligible drivers of the Norwegian business cycle, explaining on average around 15–20 percent of the output fluctuations. Using similar econometric techniques, Kiguchi and Mountford (2019) and Smith and Thoenissen (2019) find that an unexpected positive migration shock improves GDP per capita in US and New Zealand, albeit the short-run effects on unemployment, consumption and capital intensity are found to be negative. As for the European countries, estimates show that migration matters for the business cycle and vice versa. Huart and Tchakpalla (2015) report that differences in business cycles—measured through cross-country differences in the unemployment rates—are the main drivers for intra-EU migration, while D’Albis et al. (2016) report that immigration positively affects GDP per capita in France, but also that optimistic expectations about France’s macroeconomic perspectives have a sizable impact on migration. The latter result is also confirmed by Lozej (2019), who finds evidence, for many EEA, of large and positive correlations between net migration and output dynamics on the one hand, and the tendency for migration to amplify host economies’ cyclical fluctuations on the other. This paper provides a possible economic explanation for how migration might amplify business cycle fluctuations based on equilibrium indeterminacy. In summary, when agents come to believe that migration will increase tomorrow, they act as if the marginal product of capital shifted up. In turn, the expected rise in the rental rate of capital will drive up both the pace of capital accumulation, through an increase in agents’ investment rate, and the level of the wage rates, through an increase in firms’ demand for labor (including immigrant labor). However, the increase in immigrants’ wage rate will incentivize foreign workers to migrate to the host economy, thereby making the initial guess of agents about a future increase in migration self-fulfilled. Eventually, the economy reaches a new steady-state equilibrium in which both income per capita and immigration ratio have increased because of the belief-driven increase in immigration. This paper can be seen as unifying two different branches of economic literature. On the one hand, the paper extends and challenges previous results of the literature on the macroeconomic effects of international migration. For example, in the Neoclassical growth settings with legal migration of Ben Gad (2004, 2008), Klein and Ventura (2007, 2009), Khraiche (2015), Mandelman and Zlate (2012) and Ikhenaode and Parello (2020), the long-run equilibrium of the receiving economy is always determinate, implying that migration never behaves as a possible source of macroeconomic instability. In contrast, this paper shows under what conditions free movement of workers across countries can be responsible for the emergence of equilibrium indeterminacy. In particular, because free-labor mobility causes migration to act as an extrinsic random variable, the paper shows how swings in agents’ sentiment about future migration can cause the host economy to either “select” low performing equilibrium paths or lead to events of macroeconomic instability not directly driven by macroeconomic fundamentals. On the other hand, an important branch of literature explores the sources of indeterminacy in one-sector models of Neoclassical growth. In this research area, indeterminacy emerges when: (i) the production activity is able to generate both negative factor externalities and increasing social marginal products (Boldrin and Rustichini 1994; Xie 1994; Hintermaier 2003; Wirl 2011; ii) the magnitude of labor externalities are large enough to guarantee that the demand for labor is upward-sloping (Benhabib and Farmer 1994, 1996; Benhabib and Nishimura 1998; Garnier et al. 2013; iii) the rate of time preference of consumers is endogenously related to some social variables (Drugeon 1998; Meng 2006; Yanase and Karasawa-Ohtashiro 2019; iv) income tax rates are determined under a balanced-budget rule with a pre-set level of “wasteful” government spending (Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe 1997; Guo and Harrison 2004, 2008). My paper contributes to this literature as follows. First, it introduces an endogenously-determined mechanism of labor migration in a naïve Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model of growth and shows that migration can be taken as a further source of indeterminacy. Second, it shows that indeterminacy does not require the existence of any form of production externalities or market imperfection to emerge. Third, the paper provides a detailed analysis about the mechanics leading to local indeterminacy and demonstrates that the emergence of a multiplicity of equilibria can be attributed to the presence of diminishing marginal returns to immigrant labor. In this context, it is also shown how immigration quotas can be used as a stabilizing device to select among different convergent paths. The outline of the paper is the following. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework. Section 3 characterizes the dynamic equilibrium of the model and analyzes the conditions for indeterminacy. Section 4 discusses the economic implications of indeterminacy and provides some policy considerations. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",2

A growing number of corporations have implemented CSR activities: in 2017, more than 60% of the firms in all industry sectors now report on CSR all over the world, with 83% in the Americas region, 78% in the Asia Pacific region, 77% in Europe and 52 % in Africa (KPMG 2017). An increasing interest for CSR has characterized the economic literature in the past years. Several approaches to the definition of CSR and why firms engage in CSR activities have been proposed. In general, two types of CSR activities are identified: not-for-profit and strategic CSR (Kitzmueller and Shimshack 2012). The former refers to CSR decisions as private (corporate) provision of public goods (Bagnoli and Watts 2003; Kotchen 2006; Besley and Ghatak 2010). The latter refers to the fact that CSR practices affect the interaction between firms and stakeholders, such as socially or environmentally concerned consumers, political activists, employees, and competitors. Our focus is on the role of imperfect competition, which has brought substantial developments in the analysis of strategic CSR. Some relevant contributions in a static framework are Goering (2008a, 2008b, 2010), Kopel and Brand (2012), Lambertini and Tampieri (2015), among others. This literature shows that, in general, firms may strategically commit to CSR activities to obtain higher profits than their profit-seeking competitors. A typical feature of that strand of literature is the tacit assumption that firms are “ privately” held by a small number of shareholders, who are not willing to go public (offering shares). While modelling firms as private companies is often the relevant configuration of firms’ ownership, it is not, however, the only possible configuration, given the presence of “ public” companies whose ownership is divided into shares of stock held by consumers/savers.Footnote 1 Examples of large public companies are Apple, Shell and Wells Fargo (Forbes 2019). A different structure of company ownership entails different business objectives. Managers of public companies have, then, more than an incentive to maximize shareholders wealth, in line with the CSR modelling in the management literature (Mc WiIlliams and Siegel 2001). The empirical evidence supports this view. A large bulk of literature shows that publicly held firms are more likely to engage in socially responsible activities (Lee 2009; Tagesson et al. 2009; Lourenço and Branco 2013), which comes with no surprise since their funding depends, at least in part, on the investor base. Setting aside the variety of the incentives that give rise to CSR (Benabou and Tirole 2010), standard theory on CSR generally assumes a clear distinction between consumers and firms, where the latter are owned by entrepreneurial agents (privately-owned firms). This approach cannot be extended to the case where a large number of shareholders (the consumers) play a crucial role in targeting the business behavior (publicly-owned firms). As a result, what welfare scenarios may arise from publicly-owned firms engaging CSR activities remain unclear, and so are also the welfare effects of strategic interaction between competitors differentiated by ownership structure and CSR engagement. In this paper, we provide an answer to these issues by studying the welfare effects of a CSR oligopoly of privately-owned vis à vis publicly-owned companies. The first part of the analysis focuses on symmetric markets, which is our baseline model. We compare the level of welfare when the underlying oligopoly is composed of socially responsible firms with the level of welfare when the oligopoly is composed of standard profit-seeking firms. Our analysis is assessed on two different firm ownership structures, privately-owned and public-owned firms. As a starting point, we assume that the oligopoly is composed of privately-owned companies, and we compare the two alternative cases where all firms are either profit seeking or socially responsible. Socially responsible behavior is introduced in the form of a modified objective function of the firms which, in this case, are assumed to maximize profits plus an exogenously given weight of consumer indirect utility (or consumer surplus). We show that the outcome resulting from a socially concerned oligopoly leads to a decrease of the general price level and profits and an increase of the quantity of the consumption good produced, consumer surplus, and social welfare. The economic intuition is straightforward. If the objective function of the firms includes consumer surplus, besides profits, then prices are lower than those that arise when the objective function of firms contains profits, only. As a result, the quantity of the consumption good produced increases. However, the decrease of profits entails that there are no incentives to engage in welfare-enhancing CSR activities when the oligopoly is composed of privately-owned firms. Next, we show that this result does not hold when consumers own the industry, so that each firm is in fact publicly owned. In this configuration, consumers enjoy a share of dividends as part of their income. Adopting a CSR statute still lowers profits and thus their dividends, but the gain in terms of consumer surplus from lower prices more than offsets the profit loss. This consumers-driven incentive puts pressure on the firms’ governance and justifies a CSR market configuration, which ultimately raises social welfare. In addition, while privately-owned companies are willing to implement only a low level of social concern, which is inversely proportional to the number of firms in the oligopoly, publicly-owned companies, conversely, have more than incentive to commit themselves to any level of social concern. To understand why, notice that, when CSR is engaged by public companies, social concern implies also concern towards what consumers own, that is, companies shares. This, in turn, entails that the CSR objective function, in this case, always allows for positive equilibrium profits. Finally, an oligopoly composed of publicly-owned CSR firms is welfare-improving with respect to an oligopoly composed of publicly-owned profit-seeking firms but, quite surprisingly, not with respect to an oligopoly composed of privately-owned CSR firms. In this case indeed, equilibrium quantities are set at a lower level than in the case of privately-owned CSR firms, suggesting that the socially concerned effort is stronger in private companies. This result is again related to the fact that publicly-owned CSR firms take into account the consumers’ ownership, that is, the earnings from consumers’ shares. However, for high levels of social concern, a market configuration based on privately-owned CSR firms may not be implemented since profits may be negative. Conversely, a market configuration based on publicly-owned CSR firms remains still possible and is welfare-enhancing with the increase of the level of social concern. To this respect, we evaluate the condition to reach the Pareto Optimum, whenever possible. The second part of the analysis focuses on asymmetric markets, that is, industry configurations composed of different company types, differentiated by either the ownership structure or the production strategy. We start by considering an industry configuration which includes all types of companies (privately-owned CSR firms, privately-owned profit-seeking firms, publicly-owned CSR firms, publicly-owned profit-seeking firms). Here, we first study the stability of the industry configuration to verify whether there exist the conditions such that no company, either publicly-owned or privately-owned, has an incentive to switch production strategy, CSR or profit-seeking. Our findings show that, unless CSR requires specific investment costs, a market configuration with all types of companies is unstable. Then, we study the stable asymmetric oligopolies. These are composed of (i) publicly-owned CSR companies and privately-owned profit-seeking companies or (ii) of publicly-owned and privately-owned companies, both with a CSR production strategy. For each market configuration, we evaluate the effects of an endogenous CSR commitment, determined either by the government or the CSR company. There exists a large body of literature that has studied how consumer ownership and production strategies affect firm behavior and equilibrium outcomes. Although with a different aim and approach, our paper is related to the literature of mixed oligopoly (De Fraja and Delbono 1989; Fershtman and Judd 1987; Corneo and Jeanne 1992) and the literature of consumer ownership (Farrell 1985; Mas-Colell and Silvestre 1989, 1991; Corneo 1997). Our model departures from these earlier papers in two main aspects. First, our analysis adopts a general equilibrium approach, which allows us to disclose the price mechanism behind the trade-off between social welfare and profits in different production objectives, CSR and profit-seeking. Second, we do not focus on price discrimination, but, rather, on the final effects of CSR activities on social welfare, and we conduct this analysis for different market structures, private and public. Our study shows that, in a market structure of public companies, CSR activities are welfare-enhancing compared to profit-seeking activities, for any level of social concern. Most importantly, we show that CSR activities lead to Pareto optimum only in a market structure of private companies. Our results are also related to those in Planer-Friedrich and Sahm (2020), who study strategic CSR in imperfectly competitive markets. Although we use a different approach, we share with their model the finding that private companies always choose a positive level of CSR and such a degree of concern is decreasing with the number of companies in the market. However, Planer-Friedrich and Sahm (2020) study the interplay between CSR concern and market structure (concentration), while we study the interplay between CSR and ownership structure (private or public). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the model. Section 2.1 analyzes and compares the results in the different oligopoly configurations in terms of ownership structure and production behavior. Section 3 endogenizes the market structure, with a focus on the two stable market configurations. Section 4 concludes.",2

In contrast, a procyclical labor income tax rate is able to maintain saddle path stability. On what concern distortionary consumption taxation a similar result applies (see for instance Nourry et al. 2013). However, for such a result to hold, the main ingredient is the specification of preferences. Indeed, in a one-sector neoclassical growth model, Giannitsarou (2007) finds that indeterminacy cannot occur when preferences are additively separable in consumption and leisure, while Nourry et al. (2013) show that indeterminacy exists when preferences are non-separable.Footnote 2 However, these works do not consider the interplay between financial market imperfection and consumption tax. The aim of the present work is to show that the presence of money as a medium of exchange represented by a partial liquidity or cash-in-advance (CIA) constraint, together with a progressive consumption tax, could generate indeterminacy even though preferences only depend upon current consumption. In this paper we study how the introduction of a fiscal authority into an endogenous growth economy with a monetary authority that pegs the money growth factor affects the stability of the economy. In our framework, the demand of money is motivated on the ground of a fractional liquidity constraint on consumption expenditures in the final good which compels agents to buy a share of the value of such good out of the money balances. It is well known that when one introduces positively valued fiat money in infinite horizon economies, the stability features of the stationary solutions may be richer than those characterizing the non-monetary environments. The introduction of money represents indeed a friction in the capital market, since transactions now require a specific medium of exchange whose real value is determined by the price level and thus by the inflation path which in turn affects the whole structure of the relative prices. Moreover, there exists a fiscal authority that levies a possibly distortionary consumption tax to finance public spending each period.Footnote 3 The presence of a fiscal authority into a monetary economy allows us to analyze the stability properties in two different scenarios. In the first case, only the monetary authority operates while in the second case both the monetary and fiscal authority, which levies a procyclical consumption tax, operate. This allows us to examine the interplay between financial market imperfections and procyclical consumption tax rates and show that procyclical consumption tax could be a source of indeterminacy. We first show the existences of a unique balanced growth path (BGP) and a unique growth factor. When only the monetary authority operates, local indeterminacy requires a low enough intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) in consumption. It is in sharp contrast to Bosi and Magris (2003), which considers an exogenous growth model with a monetary authority that pegs the money growth factor. They show that the steady state is locally indeterminate under two configurations: (1) the strength of the liquidity constraint is low enough; (2) the IES is low enough when the strength of liquidity constraint is high. Conversely, when both the monetary and fiscal authority operate, indeterminacy occurs through the interplay between the progressivity of the consumption tax, the strength of the liquidity constraint and the IES. Specifically, the introduction of a fiscal authority will be stabilizing provided that the strength of the liquidity constraint is high enough. However, the fiscal policy will be destabilizing when the strength of the liquidity constraint is low enough. Our numerical examples also confirm the theoretical results. Our results have several implications. First, in both cases, the presence of money growth pegging and a partial liquidity constraint are crucial to our stability results. In our framework, the emergence of indeterminacy and stochastic endogenous fluctuations, driven by volatile expectations, is due to monetary distortions, whose effects are modified by the presence of a fiscal authority levying progressive consumption tax. These results improve our understanding on how distortions and the interaction of policies can affect the stability of economies. Second, contrary to the literature, such as Giannitsarou (2007) and Nourry et al. (2013), we show that procyclical consumption tax does not immunize against local indeterminacy and the associated fluctuations. The difference between our paper and those studies is that we show the effects of fiscal policy on indeterminacy crucially depend on the financial market imperfections existing in the economy. The closest study to our work is Xue and Yip (2019) which analyzes the joint effect of money growth pegging and consumption tax on the stability. In a continuous time model with a full liquidity constraint and a preference separable between consumption and labor, they find indeterminacy is possible. Our paper goes one step further showing that in a discrete AK endogenous growth economy with a partial liquidity constraint and progressive consumption tax, indeterminacy occurs even when preferences only depend on consumption. Another important remark of our study on the stability analysis is the presence of flip bifurcation. When only the monetary authority operates, flip bifurcation occurs and thus period-two cycles occur. However, once the fiscal authority is introduced, flip bifurcation might disappear. Indeed, when the level of tax progressivity is low enough, flip bifurcation still occurs but when the level of progressivity is high enough, flip bifurcation is ruled out. This paper is closely related to the vast literature about the impact of monetary policies on stability properties in exogenous growth models and in endogenous models. The first strand of literature examines the effects of different monetary policies in exogenous growth models. In models where monetary authorities peg the money growth rate, Bosi and Magris (2003), Bosi et al. (2005a, 2005b) show that when the strength of the liquidity constraint decreases, the scope for local indeterminacy improves.Footnote 4 Carlstrom and Fuerst (2001, 2003) examine this issue in money-in-utility (MIU) models. Moreover, in models where monetary authorities implement a Taylor rule, existing studies have explored the existence and stability of multiple equilibria. Specifically, both Benhabib et al. (2001) and Le Riche et al. (2017), considering respectively a MIU and a CIA framework, argue that local dynamics is not enough since an unintended stable liquidity trap equilibrium may emerge. The second strand is the studies emphasizing the impact of monetary rules on the stability properties of endogenous growth models. Le Riche et al. (2020) confirms the results of Benhabib et al. (2001) and Bosi et al. (2005b) in a two-sector endogenous growth model with partial liquidity constraint. Lai and Chin (2013) extend this literature to a small open economy and examine the effects of different monetary rules on the stability. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we present the economy. Section 3 describes the intertemporal equilibrium and provides the steady state analysis. Section 4 is devoted to the analysis of the stability properties around the unique stationary solution without and with progressive consumption tax. Section 5 discusses the role of timing in affecting stabilities. Some concluding remarks are left to Sect. 6. The proofs of the propositions are gathered in the Appendix.",2

Granero,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In recent decades, both the consumption and the production of green goods have been a topic of increasing interest in the economics literature as well as in politics. One of the main reasons is that green goods are environmentally cleaner products that can reduce pollution and waste. Based on that, governments have adopted policies such as taxes and subsidies, public campaigns, education, and performance standards in order to increase the consumption of green goods and also to encourage firms to invest in the production of those goods (e.g., see OECD 2008). A basic argument behind those policies is that production can lead to externalities that induce governments to promote green goods. For example, in the case of polluting emissions which those goods tend to reduce, one such policy consists of taxes. According to classical environmental economics, we know that Pigouvian taxes can be socially useful in the face of welfare effects from emissions not entirely internalized by agents. To the extent that output implies emissions, a tax per unit of output can work as if the firms’ marginal production costs had increased and then a lower level of output, and thus of emissions, is induced. In the context of green products, however, the issue also includes the firms’ investment in green production and the consumers’ willingness to pay for green products. Additionally, many green goods are produced under product differentiation, which can contribute to imperfect competition in the product market (Schinkel and Spiegel 2017) and can affect the firms’ incentives to enter the industry. The empirical evidence in Wu (2009) documents that firms’ strategies can, in fact, lead to an excessive provision of green goods in some situations. As is shown by Espínola-Arredondo and Muñoz-García (2016) for an exogenous market structure, the observation of insufficient green investments at an aggregate macroeconomic level does not prevent that they can be excessive in microeconomic contexts of relevant industries. In this paper, we attempt to contribute to a better understanding of linkages between the private provision of green goods and market structure under imperfect competition and endogenous firm entry. In our setting, consumers’ willingness to pay for (environmentally cleaner) green goods allows for internalizing a fraction of externalities from production (e.g., polluting emissions), stimulates the firms’ investments in cleaner products, and ends up affecting equilibrium profits and thus firm entry. However, in our analysis consumers’ willingness to pay for green goods does not imply that the private provision of those goods is a first-best provision, even if that willingness to pay is relatively high.Footnote 1 The literature has shown that imperfect competition in output markets can be relevant in a variety of environmental issues. Among other aspects, previous contributions have examined the role of taxes on the average environmental quality consumed (e.g., Cremer and Thisse 1999), eco-labels (Kuhn, 1999, and Clemenz 2010), green consumerism (Eriksson 2004, and Conrad 2005), and price competition with some forms of product differentiation (Rodríguez-Ibeas 2007; Garcia-Gallego and Georgantzis 2009, and Espínola-Arredondo and Zhao 2012). A common assumption in most of this literature is the absence of firm entry, whereas we consider firm entry as endogenous. Previous work with endogenous market structure suggests that firm entry can be important in the context of environmental economics. That literature includes the work by Katsoulacos and Xepapadeas (1995), who consider a Cournot oligopoly model on environmental policy, as well as subsequent work that extends or qualifies these authors’ findings.Footnote 2 Our focus on consumer willingness to pay for green goods reveals that private incentives to enter an industry can affect social welfare in the presence of emissions through a number of new effects relative to previous work. In order to identify those effects in a unified framework, we consider monopolistic competition with the spokes model by Chen and Riordan (2007), which extends the conventional Hotelling model of spatial product differentiation to an arbitrary number of firms.Footnote 3 One of the advantages of this setting is that monopolistic instead of perfect competition yields the limiting configuration when the number of firms becomes large, in contrast with oligopoly models such as Cournot. This feature is particularly appealing in environmental issues such as pollution that can affect many consumers and producers.Footnote 4 Our results suggest that market structure can affect the equilibrium level of green output and thus of emissions, so that the level of green production may be insufficient or excessive relative to the socially optimal level. The reason is that entry may have two contradictory effects on social welfare. On the one hand, aggregate output rises and increases the participation of consumers in the market. On the other, the average green content of the goods provided to consumers declines (e.g., emissions increase). This yields two inefficiencies in our setting: first, some monopoly power on the firms’ side from product differentiation and consumer lock-in for those consumers who can only buy from one firm; second, insufficient or excessive investments in the environmental quality of the goods in the presence of environmental externalities that are not fully internalized by the consumers. Therefore, the assumption in most of the policies adopted by governments that green production should be always promoted must not be taken for granted without further study, particularly when both firm entry and the investment in green production are costly. A key feature in our analysis is that the relative weight of those two contradictory effects of firm entry on welfare will depend on consumers’ willingness to pay for green goods. The reason is that this willingness to pay leads to partial internalization of the overall negative externalities from production. In fact, the available empirical evidence documents that consumers’ willingness to pay an extra premium for sustainable products has increased over recent decades, perhaps due to subjective sustainable consumerism or to objective attributes of environmentally cleaner goods (Kahn 2007). Complementarily, microeconomic theory suggests a kind of altruism as a plausible rationale for sustainable consumption, according to which consumers partially internalize the overall welfare impact of emissions (e.g., see Andreoni 1990; Bergstrom 1995; Popp 2001; Bagnoli and Watts 2003; Garcia-Gallego and Georgantzis 2009, and Schinkel and Spiegel 2017). We rely on this literature in considering the presence of consumers who are willing to pay an extra premium for green goods. In our results, mediated through firm entry, this plays a key role in determining private incentives that lead to an excessive or insufficient level of green output and thus of emissions relative to the first-best level when green production imposes costs on firms. In our analysis, we study end-of-pipe abatement technologies that are conventional both in practice and in the related literature.Footnote 5 For exogenous market structures, Clemenz (2010) shows that underinvestment in these technologies is likely to occur even with environmentally aware consumers. Here, we find that a non-monotonic pattern of underinvestment and overinvestment can take place when market structure is endogenous. In particular, when the negative externality from emissions is sufficiently large, there is excessive firm entry, so that private incentives yield underinvestment in green production and an excessive level of emissions relative to the economic first best. Under such circumstances, some effective policies resemble traditional instruments such as Pigouvian taxes. This contrasts with situations where the environmental externality is not so large. Specifically, in the presence of firm entry and costly investment in green production, we find a non-monotonic pattern with underinvestment or overinvestment due to several effects identified in our analysis. Then, in situations with insufficient firm entry there will be overprovision of the extent to which products are green, and some effective policies resemble subsidies (which stimulate firm entry) rather than taxes. The rest of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces the model and the welfare benchmark. Then, Section 3 examines monopolistic competition and the free-entry equilibrium, and Sect. 4 compares the equilibrium and the socially optimal configurations. The proofs of the results are in the Appendix.",1

The relevance of the debate over this subject is ongoing regarding the latest decisions of the Dispute Settlement case between the United States and the European Union within the World Trade Organization on September 22, 2016 and on October 13, 2020; the decision was made concerning the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures in the aircraft industry (WTO, 2016; The Seattle Times, 2016; The Economist, 2020).Footnote 1 This feature of contemporary economics is timely and relevant for investigation. A renewed debate on whether free trade or trade policies are suitable to improve the national welfares of countries engaged in international trade is high on the current political agendas. Consider, for example, the case of the United States. Recently, the Obama administration supported bilateral free-trade agreements with countries including Colombia, Panama, and South Korea. Moreover, it has been conducting and promoting negotiations on two large regional multi-lateral agreements, the Asia-centered Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union. The subsequent Trump administration has chosen to reassess those avancements, instead considering the opportunity to introduce trade policies (see Scott and Glass, 2016; Scott, 2016). The strong suggestion of the early Brander and Spencer’s approach (Brander, 1981; Spencer and Brander, 1983; Brander and Spencer, 1985, 1988) is that, in an export-rivalry context, the implementation of a trade policy is optimal for the national social welfare. Therefore, those contributions have provided theoretical support for a resurrection of neo-mercantilist/neo-protectionist ideas, even though limited to the assumptions of quantity competition, duopoly and short period context (no entry).Footnote 2 However, even accepted the argument that unilateral trade policies are welfare-enhancing for the activist government, the possibility of retaliation not only weakens but also totally reverses the outcome, once a correct ""game-theoretic approach"" is considered. In fact, the well-known prisoner's dilemma game structure in which both governments decide whether to subsidise implies the paradox that while firms and worldwide consumers benefit from the trade policies, national social welfares are harmed. The subsidy policy is undeniably effective to gain an advantage when the rival country does not intervene. However, if the other country also uses that policy, the outcome is that both exporting countries would be better off if none of them had used it. As Spencer (1986, 70–71) remarks, a crucial point is the recognition of the types and characteristics of industries to be targeted with the subsidy policy instrument because the “identification of these characteristics is a preliminary step toward translating theory into practical policy proposals”. Recently, Fanti and Buccella (2016a) have extended the Brander and Spencer’s approach, developing a model in which strategic trade policy occurs between economies with unionised labour markets and showing that the scope of bargaining between firms and unions depend on how governments compete between them in export/tax subsidies. On the other hand, the current financial globalisation suggests that it would be fruitfully to embed this phenomenon into the Brander and Spencer’s approach. Indeed, a stylised fact of increasing importance in international oligopolistic industries is the widespread presence of interlocking cross-shareholdings. Companies in cross-ownership structures are linked by horizontal cross-shareholdings that reinforce and strenghten the power of central controllers. Thus, in cross-holding structures the voting rights used to control a group remain distributed over the entire group (Bebchuk et al., 2000). Most studies have considered a simple ownership structure with only one shareholder having participation in both firms.Footnote 3 In the real world, there are more complex cross-shareholdings links: for instance, ""cross participations"" with each firm possessing a small amount of shares of the other (i.e. two-sided cross-ownership, e.g. Cai and Karasawa-Ohtashiro, 2015), or ""multiple participation"" with more complex direct as well as indirect links (e.g. Gilo and Spiegel, 2003; Dietzenbacher and Temurshoev, 2008). In particular, Cai and Karasawa-Ohtashiro (2015) investigate the impact of international cross-ownership of firms on the strategic privatization of a partially privatized public firm. In a third-country model in which a domestic public firm competes with a foreign privately owned firm, the authors show that, under Cournot competition with a linear demand function, the domestic ownership of foreign firms can hamper privatization. On the other hand, the foreign ownership of the domestic public firm can promote the privatization policy. Moreover, under certain conditions, the domestic ownership of foreign private firm can make both complete privatization and complete nationalization sub-optimal. If competition takes place á la Bertrand, complete nationalization becomes always the optimal policy. However, those authors abstract from the analysis of strategic trade policy. The present paper does not consider the subject of strategic privatization and focuses on the strategic trade policy in an export-rivalry model with mutual (two-sided) minority cross-participation at the ownership level.Footnote 4 Empirically, foreign equity ownership has demonstrated to lessen considerably, and sometimes invalidate, the accepted results of the strategic trade policy. For example, Dick (1993) shows that the levels of United States (minority) cross-ownership decrease the average optimal export subsidy by 47% compared with those Brander and Spencer (1985) estimate. Because the relationship between strategic trade policies and two-sided cross-ownership, to the best of our knowledge, has not been fully explored, this paper questions if the common wisdom that the public interventions lead to a Pareto-inferior equilibrium (i.e. the game between governments is a prisoner's dilemma) still holds under the presence of interlocking cross-ownership between rival exporting firms. The paper develops a two-stage game. In the first stage, governments of the exporting countries decide simultaneously and independently on the optimal subsidy to maximize their own social welfare. In the second stage, by playing a non-cooperative Cournot oligopolistic game, firms’ owners choose their output and employment levels, taking subsidies as determined in the prior stage. We proceed, as usual, by backward induction to determine sub-game perfect Nash Equilibria (SPNE). The essential feature of the existence of a two-sided cross-ownership in the output market (abstracting from the possible trade policy) is that both firms behave in a “more collusive” way because each firm internalizes the fact that both firms compete in the product market.Footnote 5 The collusive behaviour of firms in the product market affects the government’s behaviour, in the sense that each government reduces the subsidy (or increases the tax) when the degree of ""collusion"" increases. In turn, this government’s behaviour tends to transform the effects of ""more collusion"" on profits from positive to negative. In the absence of cross-ownership, trade policy (1) is always under the form of a subsidy and (2) always leads to a Pareto-inferior (resp. efficient Pareto-superior) equilibrium when products are substitutes (resp. complements). In other words, under product substitutability, the game played by governments presents the structure of the prisoner's dilemma. The main result of the paper is that the presence of reciprocal cross-ownership eliminates the prisoner's dilemma structure under appropriate degrees of product competition, and thus, in contrast to the traditional wisdom, public intervention is optimal in equilibrium. This result also relates to the above-mentioned debate about the weakness of the public intervention suggestion, showing that in the presence of mutual cross-ownership and differentiated products, a corresponding retaliatory action following a unilateral trade policy could lead to a welfare-superior Nash policy equilibrium with regard to the free trade for both countries. This unconventional welfare result occurs because mutual cross-ownerships always increase profits (and thus social welfare) under free trade; however, under trade policy, on the one hand, cross-ownerships always reduce profits, but on the other hand, they reduce the subsidy spending or increases the tax revenue to such an extent that the fiscal gain outweighs the profit loss. As a consequence, social welfare may surpass that under free trade for a sizable range of intermediate values of the product differentiation degree. Therefore, this finding that the national social welfare benefits from the trade policy in the presence of the anticompetitive practice of mutual interlocking cross-ownership offers an interesting policy implication: export firms with interlocked cross-ownership with the rival firm could be targeted for a subsidy/tax policy. Furthermore, one empirical implication is that trade policies should be more often observed when the targeted firms mutually cross participation. The rest of the article is organised as follows. Section 2 describes in detail some real-world cases of bilateral cross-ownership. Section 3 presents the Cournot duopoly model under trade policy, along with the equilibrium analysis. In Sect. 4, the welfare analysis is presented, and the main results are shown and discussed. Section 5 discusses some extensions of the basic model and Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",5

Together with insurance, which mitigates the negative effects of bad events but leaves the probability of their occurrence unchanged, prevention is recognized as one of the most important instruments of individual risk management. The individual benefits of prevention have been widely studied by decision theory, as described below. Beyond these individual benefits, however, there is a growing consensus on the idea that prevention is also beneficial at social level. Several examples can be provided. One is disease prevention. The recent COVID pandemic has shown clearly that individual behavior in terms of risk prevention is a crucial element in determining the spread of contagion in the population. Similarly, prevention of diseases related to obesity and smoking has positive effects on health systems. Positive social effects of prevention, however, are not limited to prevention of health risks. For instance, prevention of car accidents has beneficial effects at the individual level but it also helps to keep traffic flow efficient. Similarly, prevention of financial risks has a social impact in lowering the probability of impoverishment and thus the potential need for social security interventions. Lastly, preventing the risk of homelessness has positive effects on crime rates and on the livability of urban areas. Recognising the social impact of prevention entails that, in many cases, policy interventions aimed at increasing it can be justified and promoted. Significant evidence of subsidies/taxes introduced for this purpose can be found in different fields. For instance, different mixes of subsidies and taxes have been introduced in order to prevent diseases by promoting a healthy lifestyle (e.g. Thow et al. 2018; Zorbas et al. 2020,). Different kinds of measures, involving penalties in case of violations, have recently been introduced in many countries to eliminate behaviors spreading infection in the COVID pandemic (e.g. Bruinen de Bruin et al. 2020). Subsidies are widely used in the prevention of homelessness and housing instability (Brisson and Covert 2015 and Szeintuch 2017). Lastly, specific kinds of subsidies are currently under design to incentivize the use of safety devices, for instance, in the automobile sector.Footnote 1 Morevoer, the literature compares different types of subsidies/taxes both from an empirical and from a normative perspective, and finds that there are significant differences in the degree of effectiveness of different instruments (e.g. Ludbrook, 2019 and Bruinen de Bruin et al. 2020). Possible limitations on the effectiveness of public intervention aimed at affecting people’s behavior were also recently identified in the case of COVID pandemic since the actions implemented by governments and regulators to make people adopt behaviours reducing the spread often had small effect (e.g. Jacobo 2020, Pennycook et al. 2020, Schnell 2020 and BBC 2020). Despite its significant role, the study of the effects of subsidies or taxes on risk prevention, has, to my knowledge, been completely ignored by decision theory. As noted above, the literature usually defines prevention as a costly activity performed by a decision maker in order to reduce the probability of a future loss, which can be of different nature. A well known approach to studying prevention was proposed in the seminal paper by Ehrlich and Becker (1972), who study an action taken by a decision maker in the same period that he risks incurring the loss. This kind of contemporaneous prevention has been widely studied in works examining the role of different aspects of preference in determining the choice of its optimal level (Dionne and Eeckhoudt 1985; Eeckhoudt and Gollier 2005; Courbage et al. 2017; Lee 2019) and the effects of changes in risk of different kinds on this level (e.g., Jindapoin and Neilson, 2007, Huang 2012; Crainich et al. 2016). In a more recent paper, Menegatti (2009) argued that, in many cases, the effort in preventing a risk is made in a time interval which precedes the period where the decision maker faces the risk of incurring the loss.Footnote 2 Various aspects of this advance prevention have also been widely studied in recent years (e.g., Eeckhoudt et al. 2012; Courbage and Rey 2012; Menegatti 2014; Xue and Cheng 2013; Wang and Li 2015). Lastly, a model where both contemporaneous and advance prevention are introduced together has been analyzed by Hofmann and Peter (2015) and by Menegatti (2018). As emphasized above, this literature neglects the issue of how different subsidies may affect decision makers optimal choices on prevention activities. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap. We study the issue with reference to both advance and contemporaneous prevention. This will be done by examining contemporaneous prevention in Ehrlich and Becker’s (1972) one-period model, advance prevention in Menegatti’s (2009) two-period model and in a two-period model which includes both kinds of prevention together. There are two reasons for studying these different models. The first is the aim to provide a complete analysis of the effects of subsidies, considering all the main frameworks in which prevention has been studied in the literature. The second reason is that we do not know a priori whether choices on advance and contemporaneous prevention are made jointly or separately. In fact, as emphasized by the literature on choice bracketing (e.g. Read et al. 1999) people make choices by grouping them in different ways, and it is very difficult to know a priori which choices are made together. In particular, in this respect, choices on advance and contemporaneous prevention may be made both jointly and separately: they may be made jointly as they relate to the same problem and they may be made separately as they are made in different periods. It is thus useful to study them both in separate specific models and together. In these different frameworks, we consider four different kinds of subsidies potentially affecting prevention: a subsidy reducing the cost of contemporaneous prevention, a subsidy reducing the cost of advance prevention, a subsidy increasing first-period wealth and a subsidy increasing second-period wealth. Moreover, we also analyze the effects of social security subsidies on prevention, and examine a particular variation of these policies. Lastly we briefly discuss the role of the choice on saving, which can be made either together with or separately from the choice on prevention. The paper proceeds as follows. Sect. 2 studies the effects of subsidies in the one-period model with contemporaneous prevention. Section 3 analyzes the same effects in a two-period model with advance prevention. Section 4 considers both advance and contemporaneous prevention together. Section 5 studies social security subsidies. Section 6 concludes.",2

Turner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Taxation typically takes one of two forms. An ad valorem tax is expressed as a percentage of the price. A specific tax is proportional to the quantity of a product sold, regardless of its price. When the effects of taxation are analyzed in the context of a one period static game, ad valorem taxation is often more efficient (Delipalla and Keen 1992; Anderson et al. 2001). Colombo and Labrecciosa (2013); Azacis and Collie (2018) compare specific and ad valorem taxation in a dynamic setting where the possibility of collusion is permitted. Azacis and Collie (2018) find that the critical discount factor, above which collusion is sustainable in a repeated game, is identical under both forms of taxation when marginal costs are constant and symmetric. Colombo and Labrecciosa (2013) find that ad valorem taxation facilitates collusion when marginal costs are increasing. There is therefore a range of discount factors in which collusion would be sustainable with ad valorem taxation but not sustainable with the comparable specific tax. Both (Colombo and Labrecciosa 2013; Azacis and Collie 2018) consider symmetric marginal costs. The purpose of this study is to establish that ad valorem taxation may result in a larger critical discount factor than specific taxation when firm costs are instead asymmetric and constant. Both homogenous product models of Bertrand competition and a differentiated product linear city model of Bertrand competition are examined. In both models, marginal costs are constant and asymmetric. When taxes are such that average Nash equilibrium prices, in the stage game, are the same under both forms of taxation, ad valorem taxes result in a larger critical discount factor if and only if costs are asymmetric. When taxes are such that tax revenue is equal under both forms of taxation, ad valorem taxes again result in a larger critical discount factor. The findings arise because an ad valorem tax effectively increases marginal cost multiplicatively, whereas a specific tax increases marginal cost additively. The degree of asymmetry, or difference between the two firm’s marginal costs, is unchanged under specific taxation but amplified under ad valorem taxation. Collusion is more difficult to sustain between firms with greater cost asymmetries (Ivaldi et al. 2003). The more efficient firm has a greater incentive to defect, as it can achieve greater profits in both the defection and punishment phase. Ad valorem taxation effectively amplifies differences in marginal costs relevant to pricing, while specific taxation does not, hindering collusion. Section 2 presents the repeated game framework. Section 3 presents results under homogenous product competition and Sect. 4 presents results under differentiated product competition. Section 5 concludes. All proofs can be found in the ""Appendix"".",

In our monetary architecture, however, the opposite process is at work. Banks start lending to firms and simultaneously create deposits which are nominal contracts with claims on central bank money. Firms use deposits to buy investment goods, and deposits flow to households who decide about their portfolio of bank deposits, bank equity, and other assets they want to hold. Subsequently, households buy consumption goods, and deposits are transferred back to firms who repay their loans. This approach is called the “money-creation approach to banking.” In which circumstances do the money-creation approach and the loanable-funds approach yield the same outcomes? In our paper, we establish a simple benchmark result. In the absence of uncertainty, both processes yield the same allocation and no bank default occurs. Hence, in such cases, using the loanable-funds model as a shortcut does not imply any loss of generality. More specifically, we develop the result in a simple two-period general equilibrium model in which a fraction of firms has to rely on banks to obtain physical goods since the firms cannot pledge to repay their bonds. The other firms are financed through the bond market. There is no production risk. We consider two different financing architectures of the economy. In both architectures, households decide on consumption and savings in the first period. The latter is split into bank deposits, bank equity, and bonds. Firms obtain loans to undertake production through banks and the bond market. In the loanable-funds approach, the households’ savings, in the form of bank deposits and bank equity, are lent to some firms. In the money-creation approach, however, bank lending creates the deposits that are necessary for households to invest in bank deposits and bank equity. In order to establish our benchmark result, we deliberately assume favorable manifestations of some other potential frictions and distortions in the economy. In particular, we make the following assumptions: Banks act as delegated monitors and can eliminate moral hazard problems of firms that do not obtain financing in the capital market.Footnote 1 Banks are therefore essential for the financing of a fraction of firms. For simplicity, we set monitoring costs to zero.Footnote 2 When a government bail-out is needed, the required taxation of households is lump-sum and therefore does not lead to additional distortions. We show that under these circumstances, both the money-creation approach and the loanable-funds approach yield the same allocation and no bank default occurs in equilibrium. Bank defaults may occur out-of equilibrium. Hence, in the absence of production risk and together with the manifestation of frictions outlined above, using the loanable-funds model as a shortcut does not imply any loss of generality. In the extension, we indicate that when there is aggregate risk with complete contracts and complete markets, a restricted equivalence result holds in the following sense: There is an equilibrium in the money-creation model that replicates the investment and consumption allocation in the equilibrium of the loanable-funds model, but the set of equilibria in both models differ. Our work relates to two rather recent analytical papers.Footnote 3 Jakab and Kumhof (2015) use a DSGE model to compare the money-creation approach with the loanable-funds approach to establish differences and similarities. In particular, they predict that in the money-creation approach, shocks to the creditworthiness of bank borrowers have a more pronounced and more immediate impact on the amount of outstanding bank loans and on output than in the loanable-funds version of the same model. Faure and Gersbach (2021) investigate the welfare properties of a general equilibrium model with bank money creation and an aggregate productivity shock. They demonstrate that the level of money creation is first-best in symmetric equilibria when prices are flexible, but that it is not necessarily first-best in asymmetric equilibria. Moreover, they show that when prices are rigid, there may be circumstances for which money creation by banks is not bounded. In such cases, the monetary system breaks down. Faure and Gersbach (2021) prove that capital requirements may restore the existence of equilibria with finite money creation, and in some cases, may even implement the first-best allocation. In the present paper, we develop a model to study constellations when the loanable-funds approach and the money-creation approach to banking might deliver similar results.Footnote 4 For this purpose, we use a two-sector macroeconomic model, but we abstract from any type of uncertainty. More specifically, the model is much more general than in Faure and Gersbach (2021), as it incorporates consumption/investment choices and it replaces the linear production function in one of the sectors with a concave production function. However, the present model is more restricted than in Faure and Gersbach (2021), as it assumes away any type of uncertainty, which will ensure that default does not occur in equilibrium.Footnote 5 Our main result is that all the newly detected phenomena linked to money creation are connected to the presence of risks and bank default. In the absence of idiosyncratic and aggregate risks, the loanable-funds approach and the money-creation approaches are equivalent, since the allocations are identical. In this paper, we rely on an important line of reasoning which shows that fiat money can have positive value in a finite-horizon model when, first, there are sufficiently large penalties when debts to governments—such as tax liabilities—are not paid, and, second, there are sufficiently large gains from using and trading money.Footnote 6 To this literature we add the two-tier structure with privately and publicly created monies. Commercial banks create bank deposits (privately created money) when they grant loans to firms enabling them to buy investment goods. Bank deposits will be used later by households to buy consumption goods.Footnote 7 The central bank creates reserves (publicly created money) when it grants loans to commercial banks, enabling them to settle claims on privately created money among banks. The publicly created money is often called “central bank money”. The essential assumption for a positive value of fiat money in our paper is that banks (the shareholders) face large penalties if they default against the central bank, and thus banks will never choose to default. An explicit deposit-in-advance constraint is not needed. The paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 gives an overview of the two models. Their common features are detailed in Sect. 3. Section 4 describes and analyzes the loanable-funds model, and Sect. 5 describes and analyzes the money-creation model. Section 7 concludes.",1
135.0,2.0,Journal of Economics,26 August 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-021-00754-8,"Taxation, capital accumulation, environment and unemployment in an efficiency wage model",March 2022,Manash Ranjan Gupta,Priya Brata Dutta,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"There are various alternative theories to explain unemployment in a macro economic model; and ‘Efficiency Wage hypothesis’ is one of them. According to the traditional version of this efficiency wage hypothesis, the efficiency of a worker varies positively with her wage rate and the unemployment rate in the labour market. A higher wage rate motivates the labourer to work hard. A higher unemployment rate lowers the marginal disutility of work effort in the presence of a threat of firing; and this, in turn, makes the labourer more disciplined and hardworking. Many models in the existing literature introduce unemployment problem using efficiency wage framework.Footnote 1 A few of them are intertemporal in nature; and attempts to explain the interaction between economic growth and unemployment.Footnote 2 However, majority of these existing efficiency wage models do not consider the problem of environmental pollution. Introducing efficiency wage hypothesis into a dynamic model with environmental pollution and capital accumulation, one can easily study the interaction among capital accumulation, unemployment and environment; and can also analyse simultaneous effects of different policies on all these macro economic variables. Unfortunately no existing model takes care of this interaction. On the other hand, many dynamic models deal with the interaction between economic growth and environmental pollution.Footnote 3 However, none of these models consider the problem of unemployment. It is always important to analyse this interaction between unemployment and environment because many developed countries and developing countries in the world suffer from both the unemployment problem and the environmental pollution problem. In less developed countries, many underemployed workers are employed in labour intensive informal sectors; and productions in these sectors generate substantial emissions leading to pollution of air and water.Footnote 4 Unemployed workers and dishonest businessmen often earn income destroying natural resources. Thus growing unemployment degrades the quality of environment through the growth of anti social as well as informal economic activities. The agricultural sector in a less developed economy contributes substantially to national employment. However, application of scientific farming with chemical fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides etc. not only raises the agricultural productivity and level of employment but also leads to water pollution in lakes and canals. A few works introduce environmental pollution in efficiency wage models. Albert and Meckl (2001) and Schneider (1997) develop models with efficiency wage and green tax to improve environment. However, their models are static and short-run equilibrium models; and hence do not focus on capital accumulation and economic growth. Lai et al. (2002) is the only dynamic model in this context. However, in Lai et al. (2002), we find an intertemporal analysis without capital accumulation. Moreover, environmental quality does not directly enter into the efficiency function of labour in these models. We develop an one sector dynamic model with an unemployment equilibrium to be explained by the efficiency wage hypothesis.Footnote 5 Only one commodity is produced with capital and labour as inputs; and labour is measured in efficiency unit. The special property of the present model is that efficiency of labour varies positively not only with the wage rate and the unemployment rate but also with the quality of environment; and this property follows from the rational behaviour of the worker who derives utility from environmental quality as well as from consumption and when these two arguments in the utility function are complementary to each other. So the motivation of the worker to work hard is also improved because the improvement in the environmental quality raises her marginal utility of consumption which, in turn, raises her marginal benefit of working harder. This efficiency enhancing effect of environment is missing in the existing efficiency wage models.Footnote 6 Environmental quality is defined as a combined stock of natural gifts consisting of fresh air, pure water, fertility of land, plants, animals etc.; and we ignore the problem of aggregation of these different natural gifts in this theoretical exercise. It may be treated as an aggregate public durable consumption good of the worker available free of cost. Emission generated from the production sector is a flow variable and is different from this stock of environmental quality. This environmental quality changes over time; and emission from production causes intertemporal degradation of environmental quality while an abatement activity leads to its upgradation. Many existing models treat environmental quality as a stock variable making it different from emission which is a flow variable.Footnote 7 However, many other models assume environmental quality to be identical to emission; and hence it is treated as a flow variable there.Footnote 8 The distinction between environment stock and emission flow makes sense in a dynamic intertemporal model. In this paper, our goal is to make a dynamic long run equilibrium analysis with intertemporal accumulation of capital as well as of environmental quality. The model takes care of the negative effect of production activity on environmental degradation assuming that the level of emission is proportional to the level of output. Proportional tax is imposed on the rental income on capital; and the tax revenue is spent to finance abatement activities. The change in environmental quality is defined as the old emission removed by abatement activity plus the natural improvement of environmental quality minus the present emission generated by production. So the environmental quality changes over timeFootnote 9 due to negative environmental effects of production activity and positive effects of abatement activity. Capital accumulation which is the source of economic growth also takes place over time through investment of savings. These two features justify the dynamic long run equilibrium analysis to be done at the end. We derive a few interesting results from this model. First, an exogenous improvement in the environmental quality given the capital stock lowers the efficiency wage rate and unemployment rate but raises the rental rate on capital and the level of output in the new short run equilibrium. Second, an exogenous increase in the capital stock given the environmental quality raises efficiency wage rate and level of output but lowers rental rate on capital and unemployment rate in the new short run equilibrium. Third, an exogenous increase in the tax rate on rental income on capital raises capital stock, national income and environmental quality but lowers unemployment rate in the new long run equilibrium when tax revenue is utilized to finance abatement expenditure. This third result is valid not only in the exogenous saving model but also in the endogenous savings model. The first and the third result can not be obtained from traditional efficiency wage models where labour efficiency is independent of environmental quality. Capital income taxation as a policy instrument is chosen from the view point of equity.Footnote 10 Abatement expenditure is productive in this model because labour efficiency varies positively with environmental quality; and so an improvement in environmental quality leads to a redistribution of income in favour of the capitalists raising the rental rate on capital and lowering the efficiency wage rate of labour. Abatement activities cause improvement in environmental quality. Thus our analysis attempts to justify a policy combination of taxing capitalists income and utilizing the tax revenue to finance abatement expenditure. However, this justification can not be made in the absence of any efficiency enhancing effect of environment. Existing efficiency wage models do not incorporate the efficiency enhancing effect of environment. Micro foundation of the efficiency function is provided in Sect. 2. We develop the basic short run equilibrium model in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4, we introduce intertemporal accumulation of capital and degradation of environmental quality to make the model dynamic. Savings rate is assumed to be exogenous with capitalists and workers having different savings propensities. We analyse properties of long-run equilibrium in sub-Sect. 4.1; and study comparative steady-state effects in subsection 4.2. The Ramsey savings problem is solved in subsection 4.3 using a representative household framework. Section 5 is used to make concluding remarks.",

Gestsson,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In a seminal contribution Yaari (1965) showed that full annutization of all pension saving is optimal for households since it eliminates survival risk from the savings decisions. The intuition is that idiosyncratic mortality risk can be fully diversified by life-annuities making payments only in the case of survival. Annuities therefore offer a higher rate of return than standard assets and there are no unintentional bequests (of no value absent bequest motives). Later workFootnote 1 has extended this result considering the role of bequests, other types of risks, and imperfect annuity markets, but the core insight stands, see Davidoff et al. (2005). The Yaari-result is a cornerstone in the pensions literature and many attempts have been made to explain the socalled annuity puzzle, that individual pension savings in annuities is very low, see Modigliani (1986) and Benartzi et al. (2011). This discussion implicitly takes it for granted that there is a welfare case for intervention to support full annutization of pension savings, but the issue whether full annuitization of pension savings is socially desirable has not been explicitly analysed. However, the social welfare case for full annutization is not trivial, even if markets are competitive. It is well-established that in a dynamic efficient economyFootnote 2, finite lived agents do not save enough to reach the Golden Rule allocation maximizing steady state welfare (Diamond (1965)). It is also well-established that there is no steady state welfare case for a PAYG pension (transfers from the young to the old) in a dynamic efficient economy since it reduces savings moving the equilibrium allocation further away from the Golden Rule level (Aaron (1966)). By implication, transfers from the old to the young may improve welfareFootnote 3. This is pointed out in the seminal paper by Atkinson and Sandmo (1980) arguing that the Golden Rule allocation can be implemented by an appropriately designed lump-sum tax transfering resources from the old to the young. However, this result does not generalize to a setting with heterogeneous agents. In this case both inter- and intragenerational lump-sum taxes are needed to implement the Golden Rule allocation, and such taxes can not be implemented in an environment where the charactertistics of agents cannot be observed, see Andersen (2020). Accordingly, the starting point of this paper is that instruments implementing the Golden Rule allocation are not available, which is also consistent with the empirical fact that economies are in the region with dynamic efficiency, see e.g. Blanchard (2019) for a recent discussion. This raises the second-best question of how other instruments work in an environment where the Golden Rule allocation cannot be implemented. There is a vast literature exploring the role of capital income taxation in such an environment, see e.g. Stiglitz (2015) for a survey. This paper considers the specific role of annuities since they play an important role for the eventual transfer of resources from the old to the young. If all savings are in annuities there are no such transfers (beyond bequest motives). However, less than full annutization implies unintentional bequests which increases savings and this is welfare improving in a dynamic efficient economy. Therefore full annutization of pension savings is not socially optimal. This result is very general and basic, and therefore we demonstrate it in the simplest conceivable setting, namely a two-period overlapping generations economy. Since agent heterogeneity is not essential to this result, an representative agent setting is adopted. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 lays out the standard setting showing how annutization affects intergenerational transfers in a simple setting with exogenous factor prices. Section 3 explores the social optimal degree of annutization. Section 4 considers the more general case with endogenous factor prices, and section 5 offers some concluding remarks.",

New inputs are often provided by a limited number of input suppliers or even by monopolists, which supply them at less competitive prices. The commitment to procure advanced inputs may be risky if rival firms do not adopt them and other competitive input suppliers do not supply them.Footnote 1 Thus, the firms may hesitate to adopt advanced inputs, unless their demand-enhancing effects are sufficiently large. The following example highlights the type of situation that this study focuses on. In the early stage of development, Sharp was the only supplier of liquid crystal display panels made with IGZO (indium-gallium-zinc-oxide) and TFT (thin-film transistor that provided high energy-saving performance. Introducing such displays improves the quality of mobile phones, tablets, and laptops substantially, and downstream producers can advertise their product quality by announcing the introduction of this new advanced input. However, major downstream firms such as Apple had recognized the advantage of this input but have not adopted it. Additionally, we observed the adoption of organic electroluminescent displays for TV sets, where LG Electronics was the only large panel supplier at a reasonable cost. In this study, we investigate the adoption of new inputs embodying advanced benefits and analyze firms’ incentives to adopt a specific input that enhances their demand. In the presented vertical model, downstream firms first choose whether they purchase the high-quality input that enhances demand from the monopolist or the standard input from the competitive market and then the input suppliers choose their prices.Footnote 2 We then examine the role of the demand-enhancing effect and provide the conditions under which firms adopt specific inputs. We first analyze non-integration and integration cases. In the non-integration case, the specific inputs are produced by an independent supplier. However, in the integration case, one of the two downstream firms produces the specific inputs in-house, and the other downstream firm chooses whether to purchase these inputs from its rival or the standard input from the competitive market. In the case of non-integration, we analyze the equilibria in three subgames: no firm adopts the specific input, only one firm adopts it, and both firms adopt it. We show that if no firm adopts the specific input, the private incentive to adopt the specific input is insufficient from the welfare viewpoint. In contrast, if only one firm has adopted it already, the private incentive for the additional adoption of the new input by another firm may be insufficient or excessive. Thus, the private incentive to adopt the high-quality input as a pioneer is always insufficient for social welfare, but that of the second adopter can be excessive. In integration, we analyze the equilibria in two subgames: only the integrated firm adopts the specific input, and both firms adopt it. We show that the decision of the rival firm to adopt the input depends on the size of the demand-enhancing effect. Only when the market-enhancing effect is strong, the rival firm also adopts the input. However, this might be harmful to welfare. We then compare the results in the non-integration case with those in the integration case and show that integration stimulates the unintegrated downstream firm to adopt the specific input. That is, a downstream firm has a stronger incentive to adopt the new input when the rival firm supplies it than when the independent firm supplies it. The intuition is that the adoption of input from the rival firm can mitigate price competition because the firm’s decisions on prices are strategic complements. We also show that integration can be harmful to welfare, although it partially eliminates the distortion from double marginalization, improving welfare. The merger encourages the unintegrated downstream firm to adopt the new input supplied by the integrated rival. The adoption of the new input by the rival induces higher pricing by the integrated downstream firm. That is, there exists an implicit collusion effect in deciding higher prices under vertical integration. Thus, procuring new inputs from the rival increases downstream firms’ profits and reduces welfare. Our analysis highlights a new aspect of the possible anti-competitive effect of new technology adoption and vertical integration.Footnote 3 Our analysis may also explain the welfare implications of Yahoo’s search engine strategy that invokes intensive discussions in the anti-trust context (Harbour and Koslov 2010). Yahoo tried to introduce Google’s advanced search engine technology to improve its search quality and save the investment and maintenance costs of its own search engine. The anti-trust departments of the United States and the European Union were against this strategy because it stagnates innovation in the search engine market. As a result, Yahoo gave up on introducing Google’s search engine technology. Our results suggest that Yahoo’s search engine strategy has more direct anti-competitive effects, supporting the judgment of the anti-trust departments of the United States and the European Union. Our results also imply that the adoption of the rival’s input may have a direct price-raising effect in downstream markets such as internet advertising markets. Our analysis can also be applied to other broad contexts where commitment is influential in business strategies such as procurement with corporate social responsibility (CSR) and biological food with non-genetically modified organisms (non-GMO). For example, firms often commit to purchasing CSR-oriented inputs (e.g., child-labor-free, CO2-free, fair trade products). Announcing the adoption of these inputs as CSR is appealing for consumers and may enhance demand.Footnote 4 Thus, the commitment to CSR activities is popular even though few suppliers of these specialized inputs exist, meaning that firms adopting such CSR-oriented inputs may face a hold-up problem in the future. That is, once firms obtain certification under commitment, it is difficult for them to switch from a CSR-oriented input to a non-CSR-oriented input. Adopting non-GMO agricultural inputs in the food industry is another example. Products made from non-GMO soybeans are highly valued and can be sold at higher prices than standard products. However, non-GMO soybeans are not popular globally, and it is difficult to prevent the contamination of non-GMO soybeans. Consequently, few suppliers can stably provide this input. Once a downstream firm advertises its products as GMO bean-free, it is difficult to switch from the monopolistic supplier to competitive suppliers that do not offer non-GMO soybeans. Our result can thus apply to these situations. We discuss some relations with a strategic approach mentioned in the previous literature on vertical integration. Similar to Ordover et al. (1990), we demonstrate that the anti-competitive effect of vertical integration enables the integrated firm to raise its rival’s costs. In our model, however, we identify a specific supplier providing a specific (new) input that can enhance its demand even though the input market is competitive, in the sense that vertically unintegrated firms have the option to purchase inputs from outsiders. Chen (2001) also considered a vertical model in which two differentiated downstream firms use homogeneous input produced by two or more upstream firms where one firm may be more efficient than others in the upstream market while it can choose its supplier before the downstream prices are determined. He demonstrated that a vertical integration induces both efficiency gains and collusion effects. The competitive effects depend on both the cost of switching suppliers and the degree of product differentiation in downstream. In our model, however, we considered the commitment power where downstream firms first choose whether to abandon the outside option and commit to purchasing the input from a specific firm. Since the downstream firms can choose specific quality of the final product, it is seldom for them to switch suppliers flexibly. This happens when it is difficult for input suppliers to pre-commit to a future price level in the long run. In such circumstances, it is risky to commit to the monopoly supplier, but vertical integration with the monopoly supplier of advanced technology enhances the adoption of the new technology by the unintegrated downstream firm. Moreover, we incorporate the demand-enhancing effect of adopting the high-quality input and examine welfare consequences, which are not discussed in Chen’s (2001) study. We can also emphasize that the adoption of high-quality input may be motivated by improving product quality. Nevertheless, under vertical integration, this adoption of the high-quality input may reduce welfare because of the implicit collusion effect. This study is different from the previous literature on exclusive contracts.Footnote 5 In our model, each downstream firm has the option to deal with competitive input suppliers; if a downstream firm expects to be excluded, it never commits to adopt the input supplied by the monopolistic supplier in the equilibrium. Instead, its reliance upon input procurement provides a cost-increasing effect, which might push up the price of competitive products. Thus, the entry deterrence effect from the exclusive contracts does not matter in our analysis. The present study is different from the existing literature on strategic outsourcing, where the production of key inputs is outsourced to a vertically integrated retail competitor.Footnote 6 The standard outsourcing approach takes the reversed timing sequence: the vertically integrated firm sets its input price, and then downstream firms choose the supplier. This timeline may be more realistic in the short run, where the vertically integrated input supplier commits to its price. However, from the viewpoint of outsourcing decisions by downstream firms, this approach could not consider the anti-competitive effect of our analysis. In addition, our timeline captures a possible hold-up problem, namely, the risk that suppliers raise their prices after downstream firms commit to adopting their new inputs.Footnote 7 In this sense, our timeline may be realistic in the long run.Footnote 8 We believe that our analysis suggests new policy implications on the welfare consequences of the vertical model and provides an insight into the strategic choice of vertical integration by the input supplier, which is also ignored in the literature on outsourcing. The remainder of this article is organized as follows. Section 2 constructs a product differentiated duopoly model of a vertical structure. We analyze the non-integration and integration cases under commitment in Sects. 3 and 4, respectively. Section 5 compares these two cases and examines the welfare consequences. Section 6 examines the extended game with a hold-up problem by incorporating a standard timing sequence. Finally, Sect. 7 concludes the article.",1

Relational feelings, incentive pays and supervisory violations",June 2022,Stefano Dughera,Alain Marciano,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Motivating workers is a major problem in organizations, that can be solved by using incentive pays.Footnote 1 The latter are studied under two forms in the literature. First, bonus payments, that correspond to a premium that is paid in case of good performance. Second, efficiency wages, that consist in a dismissal or wage reduction that comes along with bad performance (Shapiro and Stiglitz 1984). Both mechanisms have respective advantages and limits, that have been discussed in an abundant literature (see e.g., MacLeod and Malcomson 1989). They also share a common difficulty: workers’ performances may not be evaluated truthfully.Footnote 2 Since the objective evaluation of workers’ output is in all likelihood impossible – for instance, because of multitasking concerns, measurement cost and flexibility issues – performances cannot but be evaluated subjectively by a supervisor (Bull 1987; Gibbons, 1998; Prendergast 1999; Baker et al. 1994; Levin 2003; Gibbs et al. 2004). Indeed, “thinking of any job in which subjective evaluation or supervisor discretion does not play some role in incentives is difficult” (Gibbs 2013: 411). The key implication is that supervisors may have reasons to be dishonest and provide false evaluations of their supervisees’ performances. This occurs, it must be noted, whether or not hard evidence about performances exists. As a consequence, the way incentive payments are used (as well as their effectiveness) depend on how supervisors appraise the workers’ performance. Such subjective evaluations can be performed either by self-interested or, one should rather say, egoist supervisors (see, among many others, Tirole 1986; Laffont and Martimort 1997; Chang and Lai 2002, Bac and Kucuksenel 2006; or, in a different context, Prendergast and Topel 1996) or by supervisors who have relational feelings toward their employees (e.g., Kucuksenel and Saygi, 2019). The key implication of allowing for other-regarding preferences is that supervisors may decide to lie about their supervisees’ performances either because they care about them they are altruistic or because they want to harm them they are spiteful.Footnote 3 This is the question we study in this paper: how altruism and spite affect the way supervisors evaluate their supervisees’ performance, and how it affects the use of bonus payments as a worker discipline device. Previous research has analyzed the effects of other-regarding preferences on the design of self-enforcing relational contracts between principals and agents (e.g., Prendergast and Topel, 1996; Brown et al., 2004, 2012; Casadesus-Masanell, 2004; Sliwka, 2007; Dur and Glazer, 2008; Kragl and Schmid, 2009; Shchetinin, 2010; Lee and Persson, 2011; Cordero Salas and Roe, 2012; Non 2012; Dur and Tichem, 2015). The closest works to the topic of the present paper are obviously those that study the effect of altruism and spite in organizations. Brown (2004) and Brown et al. (2012) theorize and experimentally prove that reciprocity leads to the emergence of long-term relational contracts and high effort provision. Cordero Salas and Roe (2012), in turn, analyze the interaction between a selfish agent and an altruistic principal and find that the credibility of the bonus is increasing in the principal’s altruism. The result is confirmed by Dur and Tichem (2015), who additionally show that when also the agent is altruistic or spiteful towards the principal, the optimal bonus depends on her other-regarding preferences as well. Thus, these articles show that both positive and negative relational feelings affect effort and performance. The analyses developed in these works, however, remain in a two-tier structure. For obvious reasons, it is less reductive and more realistic to use a three-tier structure, in which a principal hires a supervisor to report about the performance of a group of agents. Indeed, real-world corporations normally have complex pyramidal structures, where each hierarchical level is headed by an employee-supervisor who, as already recalled by Marshall in his Principles (1980: 259), “has still to obey as well as to command”. Hence, “once the layer of supervisors is integrated into a firm's hierarchy, a host of new problems will be spawned under incentive theories” (Chang and Lai, 2002: 28). Therefore, our contribution complements the literature on relational contracts by showing under what circumstances the possibility of supervisory violations annihilate the effort-inducing function of incentive pays. The key intuitions are as follows: while a caring manager may find it hard to be harsh on loafing employees, spiteful supervisors may be unjust towards those who work hard to satisfy their psychological inclination. In both cases, the effort-enhancing function of bonus payments may be impotent due to the distortion of these supervisory infractions. The actual effect of these violations on effort and performance, however, also depends on the workers’ response to the possibility of receiving a wrongful evaluation. Indeed, our results suggest that altruistic (resp., spiteful) workers interacting with an altruistic (reps., spiteful) supervisor have greater incentives to provide effort because they want to avoid (resp., induce) their supervisor to commit a violation and run the risk of being punished by the principal. Three-tier hierarchies were introduced in agency theory by Tirole (1986), who first considered an organization composed by principal, a supervisor and an agent to study collusive behaviors between supervisors and workers. Ever since then, this three-layered structure has become quite common in the analysis of organizational corruption (e.g., Laffont and Martimort, 1997; Chang and Lai, 2002; Bac and Kucuksenel, 2006) and not only (e.g., Prendergast, 2007), although, to the best of our knowledge, few have used it to study the impact of other -regarding preferences in organizations (Kucuksenel and Saygi, 2019). There are important similarities between our study and the literature on organizational corruption to which our paper relates tangentially–but also, some important differences (e.g., Tirole, 1986; Laffont and Martimort, 1997; Chang and Lai, 2002; Bac and Kucuksenel, 2006; Saygili and Kucuksenel, 2019). Indeed, our approach is close to the one developed in Saygili and Kucuksenel (2019). The latter are to the best of our knowledge the only ones who use a three-tier hierarchy to analyze the impact of relational feelings on the relationship between agents and supervisors. Even if they study a different type of other-regarding preferencesinequity aversion they nonetheless derive conclusions in terms of effort and performance that are interesting for us. They show that the more inequity-averse agents are, the more effort they exert they do not want to receive a lower wage than the supervisor does. This compares to our result, according to which altruistic (resp., spiteful) workers tend to exert more effort than spiteful (resp., altruistic) workers when they are coupled with an altruistic (resp., spiteful) supervisors. However, their purpose differs from ours. Indeed, while they study how other-regarding preferences affect the side-contract between corrupt supervisors and agents, we focus on the relationship between relational feelings and incentive pays. As a further development, it would be interesting to analyze how relational feelings affect the supervisors’ incentive to accept a bribe, and, more generally, to incorporate altruism and spite in the literature on organizational corruption. Are altruistic supervisors less open to bribery than spiteful ones? Or the reverse? And moreover: would hard-workers suspecting their supervisors to be biased against them may want to send a signal to the principal or agree to be extorted and to pay a bribe to avoid the forthcoming untruthful evaluation? All the conclusions we could suggest in the present paper, however, would remain tentative, since (let us insist) our paper does not discuss collusion between supervisors and agents, but rather, analyze organizational infractions that take place before the flourishing of corrupt activities in firms. In this sense, our analysis can be seen as a “side investigation” of the determinants of organizational corruption, thus shedding light on the antecedents of collusion in firms. We leave the possibility of studying the effect of other-regarding preferences on organizational corruption to future research. Finally, our contribution extends the discussion that analyzes the inefficiency of the efficiency wage (Chang and Lai 2002) to bonus-pay settings. Indeed, our findings suggest that some of the inconsistencies that have been found in efficiency wage theory i.e., that salaries are not always effective in promoting effort (Chang and Lai 2002) and that the wage and the supervision incentives cannot always be used as substitutes (Groshen and Krueger 1990; Chang and Lai 1999) carry over to bonus payments as well. In addition, our paper provides support to the findings of Campbell and Kamlani (1997), who argue that good-quality supervisor–employee relationships are more important in determining effort than good working conditions, high wages, and monitoring. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews the evidence on relational feelings in organizations. Sections 3 and 4, respectively, present and analyze the model. Section 5 concludes.",1

We take off from (Corchon and Fradera 2002) and explore the following set of questions. (i) Suppose there is an increase in market size. That is, for any given level of output, the inverse demand curve shifts up. This may be due to an increase in income or an improvement in export opportunities. How do the number of active firms, output per firm and total output in a free entry equilibrium change with such a shift? (ii) Given a fixed market size, suppose the cost of entry rises. This may be due to more stringent regulatory requirements (for example, stricter environmental norms that all active firms are mandated to follow). How does this affect the number of active firms, output per firm and total output in a free entry equilibrium? Conventional wisdom tends to suggest that the number of active firms, output per firm and total output in a free entry equilibrium should increase with market size and decrease with entry cost. However, we show this is not always true. A larger market size may, in fact, lead to fewer active firms, lower total output and lower output per firm. We also show that while higher entry cost always leads to a reduction in the number of active firms and total output in a free entry equilibrium, it can also lead to an increase in individual firm’s equilibrium output. The effects of an increase in market size (or entry cost) are crucially dependent on the shape of the demand curve and the nature of products (strategic substitutes or strategic complements). We use the implicit function theorem to derive our results. This makes the analysis simpler and enables us to provide a complete characterization. In most of our propositions, we provide both necessary and sufficient conditions. We now proceed to provide a brief overview of our set-up and the main results. Consider a homogeneous product, symmetric cost, Cournot oligopoly with free entry. There is a parameter, A, which we call the “market size” . Higher is A, greater will be the demand. Possible examples are as follows: \(P=A-Q\), \(P=\frac{A}{Q}\) etc. The total output is Q. If a firm decides to enter, it must incur entry costs of F. In propositions 1(i), 2(i) and 3(i) we explore the effects of an increase in the market size, A. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for the active number of firms at a free-entry equilibrium, output per firm and total output to increase (or decrease) with an increase in the market size. To illustrate the above let’s suppose that an increase in A leads to a parallel shift in the demand curve. That is, for any given output, Q, the slope of the inverse demand does not change with such a shift. In this case, we show that if demand in concave then the total number of active firms at a free entry equilibrium increases with an increase in the market size. This in turn implies that the total number of active firms at a free entry equilibrium will decrease with an increase in the market size only if the demand is convex. We also show that output per firm decreases with an increase in market size if and only if the demand is convex. Note that convexity of demand is a necessary condition for the products to be strategic complements. This means that if products are strategic complements then an increase in market size may lead to a decrease in the number of active firms and output per firm at a free-entry equilibrium.Footnote 1 We demonstrate that if an increase in A leads to parallel shift in the demand curve, then any increase in the market size always leads to an increase in total output. However, if the shift in the demand curve is not just a parallel shift (for instance, an increase in A also affects the slope of the inverse demand curve for a given output), then a larger market size may lead to lower total output. We illustrate all the above results with specific examples. Thereafter, we provide some possible economic intuition behind our propositions. In Propositions 1(ii), 2(ii) and 3(ii) we explore the effects of an increase in the entry cost, F. We show that while higher entry cost always leads to a reduction in the number of active firms and total output in a free entry equilibrium, it can also lead to an increase in individual firm’s equilibrium output. The effect of an increase in entry cost on the individual firm’s equilibrium output is crucially dependent on the strategic substitutability or strategic complementarity of the products. In fact, in Proposition 2(ii) we demonstrate that output per firm will increase with an increase in entry cost if and only if the products are strategic substitutes. As noted before, our exercise takes off from the paper by Corchon and Fradera (2002). However, our approach differs from Corchon and Fradera (2002) in the following crucial ways.  Corchon and Fradera (2002) assume that products are strategic substitutes. In our model we have a more general demand function that allows for strategic complements. We show how some results are sensitive to whether goods are strategic substitutes or strategic complements. For example, in theorem 2 of their paper (Corchon and Fradera 2002) show that a rise in entry cost always leads to an increase in individual firm’s output. However, we show that this is true if and only if the products are strategic substitutes. That is, if products are strategic complements, a rise in entry cost will always lead to a decrease in individual firm’s output. Unlike (Corchon and Fradera 2002) our model does not deal with general aggregative games, but we specifically consider Cournot games in a homogenous product market. The advantage of this construct is that it allows us to analyze the role of the curvature of the demand function. We demonstrate clearly how the results depend on the shape of the demand curve (concave or convex). Unlike (Corchon and Fradera 2002) we ignore the integer constraint and assume the number of firms, n, to be a continuous variable. We do this primarily for expositional purposes and to enable us to make use of the implicit function theorem. This approach simplifies the analysis and enables us to provide a complete characterization. In most of our propositions, we provide both necessary and sufficient conditions.  It may also be noted that ignoring the integer constraint does not take away the crux of our argument. In fact, in one of the illustrative examples that we provide, the equilibrium number of active firms is an integer (for instance, see the table-1 in example 1). In short, we extend and generalize the results of Corchon and Fradera (2002). The use of implicit function theorem enables us to provide a fuller characterization. Our approach essentially complements the approach taken in this paper. In the next section we provide the model of our exercise. Section 3 provides the equilibrium analysis, all the main results and the illustrative examples. In Sect. 4 we give some concluding remarks. Lastly, we provide the relevant computations and proofs of all the results in the appendix.",

We study existence and uniqueness of a price-equilibrium for distributions that do not satisfy the standard conditions introduced in the seminal article of Caplin and Nalebuff (1991), extending the work of Benassi et al. (2019). To obtain analytical solutions, most of the literature tends to rely on the Uniform distribution. Although convenient, this assumption still forces researchers to engage in lengthy and tedious algebraic derivations. Moreover, as we show in our applications, the Uniform distribution fails to capture the impact of dispersion on an economy, which limits the generality of the predictions and of resulting policy recommendations. When moving beyond the Uniform, log-concavity of the density is commonly invoked. For our purposes, this assumption is also restrictive as it excludes distributions of practical interest, such as the Log-Normal or the Weibull. To motivate the use of a general approach over the Uniform case, we present two applications where dispersion drives the main results. First, we illustrate the numerical impact of a change in a distribution’s Gini indexFootnote 1 (as in Yurko 2011), on equilibrium prices and profits. We find that high-quality firms prefer extreme levels of dispersion, whereas low-quality firms favor high inequality. The Uniform is the only distribution that fails to reproduce these outcomes, exhibiting monotone relationships for all the variables. Finally, we identify a restriction on the primitives of the model, that we label Condition-\(\eta\), to determine when the duopoly collapses into a monopolyFootnote 2. With a Uniform distribution, it is known that competition crumbles when the support becomes less dispersed. For general distributions and positive marginal costs we prove that a natural monopoly dissolves not only when the distribution becomes more dispersed, but also when it becomes very concentrated. The first contribution of our article is the characterization of the equilibrium in Full Coverage duopoly models under distributions that are traditionally excluded from economic theory, but that are relevant for empirical work. While we recognize that the Full Coverage setting is restrictive, it allows us to simplify the analysis and to focus on issues of existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium in prices that go beyond this class of models. Our results shed light on the applicability of these distributions to different literatures, such as Mechanism Design. Although we carry the narrative using the Vertical Differentiation (VD) setting, the results equally apply to general location-then-price duopoly models in the style of Anderson et al. (1997). Cremer and Thisse (1991) show that Hotelling-style models are special cases of the VD setting. It is easy to see that, under the Full Coverage assumption, also the VD model presented in this article can be mapped into a Hotelling one. For this reason, conditions that guarantee existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium in prices will apply to either case. The equivalence stops holding under Partial Coverage, which we address in a different article. We show that, in imperfect competition models, the traditional sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium in prices are generally satisfied for the firms that serve the left tail of the distribution of consumers’ valuations, for instance, the low-quality firm in a VD model. However, the same conditions may fail for firms serving the right tail. Underlying this mathematical property, one can often draw an interesting economic intuition. For example, in a VD model, a high-quality firm could opt to backward-leapfrog, match the price of the rival and win its market shares. Such behavior generates a downward discontinuity in its best response function.Footnote 3 Notice that, because the demand facing the high-quality firm is similar to that served by a monopolist, the problems of existence and uniqueness in the two settings are connected. The difference lies in the range over which each firm optimizes its profit. Interestingly, even though we open the analysis to a large set of distributions, our numerical simulations consistently show only three types of shape that the first order condition (FOC) of the firm serving the right tail can take. Borrowing the terminology from Mechanism Design, we label this FOC as the Virtual Value or Virtual Function. The first pattern is the one captured by distributions that induce quasi-concave revenue functions (Benassi et al. 2019). This is, for instance, the case of distributions that admit log-concave densities. The second pattern is produced by most of the remaining distributions, and generates a revenue function that has multiple local maxima. The Log-Normal is the only distribution that we encountered that showed a third behavior, and only for a particular range of its parameters. This result is not dependent on the Full Coverage assumption, and applies to several imperfect-competition and monopoly settings, including Mechanism Design. Furthermore, we introduce a novel and easily testable condition for uniqueness of a pure strategy (henceforth, PS) equilibrium in prices that is weaker than the standard of log-concavity of the density. This condition asks for the Single Peakedness of the function \(x^2 f(x)\), which is satisfied by all families of distributions used in our study, including those that failed to comply with any form of \(\rho -\)concavity,Footnote 4 such as the Log-Normal and the Weibull. We use this approach to extend the Principle of Maximum Differentiation (Hotelling 1929; d’Aspremont et al. 1979) to distributions that do not possess log-concave densities when the market is fully covered, even for the case of mixed strategies. Finally, we summarize our results in a toolbox that allows applied researchers to skip tedious derivations and to run interesting comparative statics, under the Full Coverage setting, even with the Uniform distribution. The rest of the article is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we present a brief literature overview. In Sect. 3 we describe the model and introduce first preliminary results. In Sect. 4 we define conditions for existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium in prices in all subgames. Section 5 addresses the equilibrium level of differentiation, and illustrates comparative statics effects of dispersion on prices, profits and on the degree of industry concentration. In Sect. 6 we present a set of tools and steps to follow for applied researchers, with some examples drawn from the literature. Finally, in Sect. 7 we present our conclusions. All the technical proofs are left in Appendix A.",

Formal firms have to compete not only against other formal firms, but also against firms in the informal sector. This certainly increases the level of competition, which may have a positive effect on welfare. However, at the same time, the presence of informal firms may alter formal firms’ incentives to carry out investments (Mendi and Costamagna 2017), which may negatively affect welfare. Therefore, we may a priori identify a positive effect on welfare of the presence of informal firms, through increased competition, and a potentially negative effect, via a distortion of formal firms’ incentives to invest. In this paper, we analyze this issue by considering a model of an industry with an upstream and a downstream sector. There are two formal firms downstream and a formal firm upstream. We allow for the possibility of the formal upstream firm competing with informal firms to sell a lower-quality input to the downstream firm, and we assume that the informal sector is perfectly competitive. We use the model to analyze how the existence of informality upstream, and more generally, an alternative, competitive, lower-quality input source, affects the incentives of the upstream firm to engage in quality upgrading and its welfare implications. Specifically, while the presence of informal input suppliers increases competition in the downstream industry, it may also distort the upstream firm’s incentives to invest in quality upgrading. We find that there are parameter values such that welfare decreases with informal input suppliers. This result holds for both quantity and price competition, but does not arise if the upstream firm may impose two-part tariffs. In our model the fundamental difference between the inputs sold by formal and informal suppliers is quality. We assume that informal input suppliers are a competitive fringe that sell a lower-quality substitute for the formal upstream firm’s input. We also allow downstream firms to have different transformation capacities, which could give rise to vertical differentiation in the final product even though there is no differentiation in the inputs that they use. Therefore, in our model, vertical differentiation arises from purchasing inputs with different qualities, or from the fact that downstream firms have different transformation capacities. In the presence of consumers with heterogeneous willingness to pay for quality, higher willingness-to-pay consumers will purchase the high-quality product, whereas consumers with lower willingness to pay will purchase the low-quality product, and some others will not purchase at all. We find that the results depend on the industry structure downstream, as well as on the transformation capacities of the downstream firms. In particular, if there is a monopoly downstream or two symmetric firms downstream, the presence of informal input suppliers always increases the incentives to invest on the side of the upstream firm and is welfare-increasing. However, when there is an asymmetric duopoly downstream, then the upstream firm’s incentives to invest may be greater in the absence of informal input suppliers, which could more than offset the positive effect on welfare of the presence of informal input suppliers, via enhanced competition. This is the case when the asymmetry is high enough so that in the absence of informal input suppliers the upstream firms manages to sell its input to both firms, whereas it only sells to the most efficient downstream firm in the presence of informality upstream in the value chain. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the contributions to the literature that are relevant for our analysis. Sects. 3 and 4 study the cases of a downstream monopoly and duopoly, respectively. Sect. 5 extends the analysis to the cases of price competition downstream and two-part tariffs, and Sect. 6 presents the conclusions of the study.",
136.0,2.0,Journal of Economics,03 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-021-00768-2,New results on precautionary saving and nonlinear risks,July 2022,Claudio Bonilla,Marcos Vergara,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"When an expected utility decision-maker faces an increase in future risk, he changes his optimal saving decision in order to better accommodate his intertemporal consumption and risk exposure. The usual concept that arises in this type of analysis is the precautionary saving effect, which is the extra saving produced in response to the increase in future risk. Under additive risks, this effect is guaranteed as long as the third derivative of the utility function is positive (Leland 1968; Sandmo 1970; Kimball 1990). Most of the literature on precautionary saving assumes additively separable intertemporal utility functions and linear risks that are most frequently associated with a risk shock to future wages or to the interest rate (Menegatti 2007; Baiardi et al. 2014). In particular for interest rates, Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger (2008) show that, when there is an increase in the Nth-degree risk in the return on saving, we observe a precautionary effect as long as the measure of relative \((N+1)\)th-degree risk aversion exceeds N. This result is a generalization of the idea that, for second-order risk increases, the condition that ensures precautionary saving is that the partial prudence index is greater than 2 (Rothschild and Stiglitz 1971). Recently, Magnani (2017) and Wong (2019) provided a new interpretation of these ”threshold conditions” for the cases of second- and higher- order risk increases that enrich the intuition. However, all these previous results are based on separable preferences and linear risk structures. In this paper, we advance the literature by relaxing both of these assumptions. This allows us to obtain new conditions, which help explain empirical findings that seem to be at odds with precautionary saving (Dercon 2005). It is easy to find contexts where preferences are not intertemporally separable and risk structures are not linear. For example, heterogeneous agents with intergenerational transfer (which is a common feature of wealthy households) imply nonseparable intertemporal preferences (Ponce and Yuki 2006). We also have the case of ambiguous environments in dynamic settings (Gomes 2014; Peter 2019), or of habit-persistent models where past consumption has a direct effect on present utility (Díaz et al. 2003). Nonlinear risk effects are also not difficult to find in real world examples. For instance, Gunning (2010) describes developing economies that present nonlinear risk shocks due to credit market constraints and unsolved asymmetric information problems. In the insurance literature, we also find nonlinear effects in health care applications (Echazu and Nocetti 2013), where the health production function incorporates nonlinear cross effects between the marginal productivity of investment in health and the random variable that captures the risk effects. We also find nonlinear effects in self-insurance with technology risk (Li and Peter 2021) when decision-makers lack precise information about the benefits of risk mitigation. For these cases and others, a positive third derivative of the utility function (known as the prudence property) may not be enough to secure the precautionary effect (Eeckhoudt and Schlesinger 2008; Vergara 2017; Baiardi et al. 2020; Vergara and Bonilla 2021). Therefore, modeling nonseparable preferences and nonlinear risks are the key to understand decision-making in those contexts. To study the effect of risk on saving, we decompose the risk shock using Davis’s (1989) compensation method to distinguish between income and substitution effects of a risk increase. In our context, the income effect induces the prudent agent to save more in order to increase his expected income in the second period, when the uncertainty is present, whereas the substitution effect induces the risk-averse agent to save less in order to avoid the effect of an increase in risk. We show that a nonlinear risk shock amplifies both effects, and it also generates new effects that make it more difficult to sign the net effect on saving. We also show that, for the linear multiplicative risk case (interest rate and wealth risk), the income and substitution effects are slightly different from those found in Dardanoni (1988) for a utility function with two arguments and in Baiardi et al. (2020) for intertemporally separable preferences. We share the perspective of Gunning (2010), who analyzed various sources of risk and studied labor, interest rate and wealth risk, and suggested that individuals in developing countries are exposed to great uninsured risks that are mostly nonlinear and have different effects on optimal decisions. Our paper is also related to Snow (2003) and Machina and Pratt (1997). The former decomposes a mean-preserving spread into a substitution and income effect but only for the case of an additively separable utility function with no specific applications whatsoever, and the latter extends the Rothschild and Stiglitz (1970, 1971) characterization of a mean-preserving spread to a more general definition with an extension to second-order stochastic dominance. In this paper we develop specific applications and connect our results with recent literature on decision-making under risk through a perspective of using the signs of covariances that appear in optimal saving problems. This covariance representation has the advantage of incorporating not only the sign of the effects but also the magnitude of the slope of change. It is, therefore, potentially more informative than the usual representation of the typical comparative static analysis. It is important to mention that we provide a theoretical grounding for the case in which increases in risk induce reductions in saving. This empirical regularity observed in the developing world (Dercon 2005 and Elbers et al. 2007)Footnote 1, can now be explained under nonlinear shocks when comparing the effect of the income and substitution effect revealed using Davis (1989)’s method.",2

In such mixed markets, where public and private providers coexist, competition typically takes place among providers with different objectives and which are subject to different regulatory schemes. This raises several policy issues. For example, should private providers be included in public funding schemes? And if so, should such providers be allowed to distribute profits? In education markets, for example, many countries do not give public funding to for-profit private schools, while others, including several US states, permit publicly funded charter schools to be operated by for-profit providers (Boeskens 2016; Lee 2018). Furthermore, in health and education markets quality is a key concern, and designing policies to ensure a satisfactory provision of quality requires an understanding of how public and private providers strategically interact, and how they respond to different funding schemes. In this paper we analyse the optimal design of a public funding scheme in a spatial oligopoly market consisting of one public provider and two private providers, and where consumers choose providers based on quality, price and transportation costs. We assume that the providers differ in terms of objectives and regulatory constraints. Whereas the public provider is assumed to maximise social welfare, the two private providers are profit-maximisers. Furthermore, the revenues of each provider depend on whether the provider is included in the public funding scheme. A publicly funded provider receives a regulated price per unit of the good supplied, part of which is paid by the provider’s consumers according to a copayment rate set by the regulator. On the other hand, a provider that is not included in the public funding scheme must raise all its revenues from the market by charging a price for its services. In this setting, competition between providers takes place along two different dimensions: quality and price. Whereas all providers choose qualities, only providers without public funding are free to choose prices. Within this framework, we study the optimal design of the public funding scheme, where a welfarist regulator sets the funding parameters (price and copayment rate) and chooses which providers to include in the funding scheme. Under the basic assumption that quality is not verifiable and thus not contractible, we show that the first-best outcome is not attainable when only the public provider is funded. In this case, the policy that minimises aggregate transportation costs leads to underprovision of quality because of a negative competition externality between the two private providers, whereby each provider has an incentive to reduce its quality in order to induce a price increase from the rival provider. This problem can be solved by including one of the private providers in the public funding scheme, which removes the said competition externality and ensures that the private provider outside the funding scheme always has socially optimal incentives for quality provision. The regulator can then use the two funding instruments (price and copayment rate) to ensure socially optimal incentives also for the included provider, and to ensure an optimal demand allocation across the three providers. Thus, the first-best solution can be implemented by the optimal design of a public funding scheme that includes both public and private providers. Furthermore, inclusion of only one of the private providers is sufficient to induce the first-best outcome. In this sense, our analysis provides a rationale for the co-existence of different types of providers in the same market: public and private providers within the public funding scheme and private providers outside the scheme. Although our model is not tailor-made to fit one particular industry, our analysis applies in particular to regulated markets such as health care and education. In the health care markets of many European countries, patients can choose between public and private providers within the national health system, where prices and copayments are regulated, or alternatively choose a private provider outside the national health system and pay the expenses either out-of-pocket or via private health insurance.Footnote 1 A similar mix of provider options is present in education markets, where tuition fees in publicly funded schools tend to be either absent or regulated, while independent private schools rely on the fees charged to their students. In such markets, publicly funded private schools have become a prominent feature across OECD countries (Boeskens 2016).Footnote 2 Average OECD figures for 2018 show that 13.2% of 15-year-old students attended government-dependent private schools, 81.9% attended public schools, while 4.9% attended independent private schools (OECD 2020). Both in health care and education markets, the extent of public funding coverage for private providers is a contentious issue in many countries. In education markets, for example, proponents of extending funding to private providers argue that this stimulates inter-school competition and offers incentives for innovation and quality improvements. On the contrary, opponents argue that funding private education might lead to public sector resource depletion and ultimately result in a reduction of educational quality (Boeskens 2016). Our analysis in the present paper can help shed some lights on one particular aspect of this issue, namely how the inclusion of private providers in the public funding scheme can improve incentives for quality provision and thereby reduce inefficiencies in the market. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In the next section we present a relatively brief summary and discussion of related literature, before presenting the model in detail in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 we derive the equilibrium quality provision under two different assumptions about public funding coverage, where either no or one private provider is included in the funding scheme, and we analyse how the quality provision depends on the funding parameters (price and copayment rate). In Sect. 5 we derive the first-best solution and show how the attainability of this solution depends on the funding coverage. In this section we also compare the equilibrium quality provision across the different providers when the copayment rate differs from the first-best level. Finally, some concluding remarks are offered in Sect. 6.",1

However, the analysis of the interconnections between upstream input suppliers (unionized labor markets) and downstream product market competition is not fully explored. Therefore, the mechanisms through which imperfections in the upstream (labor) markets impact on the imperfections in the downstream product market are not yet indisputably clear. Economic theory has stressed that several features must be taken into account when input price (wage) negotiations take place. One of the most relevant is the level of coordination between the parties during the bargaining process: either decentralized (uncoordinated) bargaining at each single upstream–downstream related unit or semi/full coordination among the parties during the negotiation process. The present paper precisely studies this aspect of negotiations. In particular, this work investigates the impact of upstream decentralization/coordination in input price bargaining and the competitive level of the downstream sector on downstream firms’ profitability. The rationale for the focus on those bargaining structures is as follows. If input suppliers are considered labor unions, upstream coordination represents the case of an industry-wide union, widely observed in the real world, that conducts negotiations separately in different companies. Despite the decentralization trend in (wage) negotiations that has taken place in the OECD countries, this bargaining configuration is still extremely relevant in the European Union. In particular, it represents a central labor market institution in continental Europe (see e.g. Buccella 2018). The present paper focuses on the effects of different upstream coordination levels in negotiations on downstream firms profitability, stressing the relevance of different levels of downstream market competition/cooperation, measured both by a conjectural variation model, particularly by the conjectural derivative (CD) parameter and the degree of differentiation among goods. The main reason for choosing the CD in this work, despite its theoretical shortcomings (lack of direct link to observable primitives like the share of cross participation, see e.g. Symeonidis 2008, and Mukherjee 2010; involvement of pseudo-dynamics on intrinsically static models, see e.g., Varian 1992, p. 302, and Martin 2002, p. 45), is the key virtue of this analytical tool, i.e. its adaptability in encompassing the study of different market structures. In essence, the CD covers the full range of market competition levels, from Bertrand competition to joint profit maximization, using a unique, simple parameter. Moreover, the decisions of the firms in an industry with regard to tacit collusion (e.g. restriction of production or price cutting avoidance) may not be related to a directly observable variable (Ivaldi et al. 2007). The degree of product differentiation is also seen as another measure of the intensity of product market competition in industrial economics: the less the products are differentiated, the harsher the competition is among firms (Singh and Vives 1984; Shy 1995, pp. 138–140; Zanchettin 2006; Fanti and Meccheri 2014). Thus, the degree of product differentiation represents an additional element of analysis of the impact of market competition on the bargaining and, therefore, on firms’ profitability. The key results of the paper are as follows. In sharp contrast to the conventional wisdom that the more the collusion is, the higher the profits for firms are, it is shown that more collusion can be detrimental for downstream firms’ profitability. The precise level of semi-collusion changes as the degree of product differentiation and the relative parties’ bargaining power vary. In this respect, the present paper generalizes the well-known non-merger paradox identified by Horn and Wolinsky (1988). More precisely, the following relations hold. First, for a given level of the upstream suppliers’ bargaining power, the more differentiated the products are, the higher the downstream firms’ collusion level is to maximize their profits, regardless of the upstream suppliers’ autonomous/coordinated bargaining structure. Second, while with decentralized input price (wage) bargaining, for a given degree of product differentiation, the higher the upstream suppliers’ bargaining power is, the lower the collusion level is of the downstream firms’ behavior to maximize profits, with bargaining coordination of the upstream input suppliers a U-shaped relation exists between the upstream firms’ bargaining power and the downstream sector’s competition level. In fact, downstream firms’ profits are at their maximum with high collusive levels, either when the upstream firms’ bargaining power is extremely low or extremely high, while profits are at their maximum for moderated levels of collusion when the upstream firms’ bargaining power is intermediate. In so doing, this work attempts to contribute in shedding light on (and, therefore, provides a better understanding of) those links that are crucial both for the design of industrial policies and regulatory economics. In fact, the policy insight is that governments and antitrust authorities need a complete analysis of the related upstream sector(s) practices (or the labor market institution in place) and characteristics of the downstream one before designing a policy intervention to regulate product market competition in an industry. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3 presents the model and the results. Section 4 briefly discusses some extensions of the basic model. Section 5 closes with an outline of the future research.",1

Figure 1 shows the evolution of the ratio of government debt to GDP for the G7 countries over the last 20 years. The figure shows that the ratio of government debt to GDP in G7 countries, with the exception of Germany, has been on an upward trend, and that among others, Japan’s ratio is remarkably high. Motivated by this current situation, a number of theoretical and empirical studies on fiscal sustainability have been conducted. This study is one such attempt. Specifically, it examines how a stylized fact called “limited asset market participation” is related to fiscal sustainability (or the maximum sustainable level of government debt). Government debt/GDP (%) in G7 countries (Source: IMF database) It is well-known that in developed countries, only a fraction of households own stocks, i.e., their participation in stock markets is limited (Mankiw and Zeldes 1991; Haliassos and Bertaut 1995; Campbell 2006, and so on).Footnote 1 Various reasons can be adduced as to why stock market participation is limited,Footnote 2 but the relationship between financial literacy (the ability to properly gather and analyze investment information) and stock market participation is one reason that has received special attention recently. Holding risky assets, such as stocks, requires a higher level of financial literacy than holding safe assets, such as bank deposits. Since acquiring financial literacy comes at a cost, it is reasonable to forgo participation in the stock market if its cost is high. In fact, many empirical studies, such as Kimball and Shumway (2006), van Rooij et al. (2011), Yoong (2011), and Thomas and Spataro (2018) show that low financial literacy significantly reduces the rate of stock market participation.Footnote 3 What impact would the above characteristics of limited stock market participation have on fiscal sustainability (or the maximum sustainable level of government debt)? Consider a situation where participation in the stock market is stimulated by the increased financial literacy of individuals. This situation, on the one hand, makes it easier for firms to raise capital investment funds through the stock market, and this could have a positive impact on economic growth. Since the ratio of government debt to GDP gradually decreases with increased economic growth, it improves fiscal sustainability. Increases in financial literacy and stock market participation, on the other hand, will reduce the share of individuals who hold safe assets such as bank deposits. Table 1 shows the proportion of domestic outstanding government bonds held by domestic and foreign banks in G7 and several other countries in 2020. This table suggests that private banks are non-negligible holders of government bonds, and accordingly that savings in the form of bank deposits are more likely to be used to underwrite government debt. Hence, increases in financial literacy and stock market participation could worsen fiscal sustainability by reducing the underwriters of government bonds and pulling up the government bond yield. Which of these two conflicting effects dominates? The purpose of this study is to examine this point theoretically. To investigate the above issues, we construct a simple overlapping generations (OG) model with the following characteristics: There are three types of assets: physical capital (which corresponds to stocks), bank deposits, and government bonds. When saving, individuals can choose between physical capital, which is more profitable but costly to hold, and bank deposits, which are less profitable but not costly to hold. In investing in physical capital, individuals must allocate a portion of their endowed time to acquiring financial knowledge. The more time they spend on it, the higher the return from their savings. Learning ability (more precisely, the extent to which time spent on improving financial literacy increases the return on savings) varies across individuals. Banks are assumed to invest a given proportion of their total bank deposits in physical capital and the rest in government bonds. The government manages its finances in such a way that past debts are repaid only by issuing new bonds (i.e., the government plays the “Ponzi game”). Under the above model setup, we show the following results. First, there exists one stable balanced growth path (BGP) and one unstable BGP in our model. In the stable BGP, all individuals are physical capital holders; hence, the ratio of government debt to physical capital in the economy is zero. Contrariwise, the ratio of government debt to physical capital in the unstable BGP corresponds to its maximum sustainable value; if the actual ratio of government debt to physical capital in the initial period is larger than this value, the actual ratio will diverge and the government will go bankrupt. If the initial actual ratio is smaller than this value, on the other hand, the actual ratio will decline over time, and the economy eventually converges to the stable BGP. Second, under plausible numerical settings of parameters, an increase in each individual’s learning ability (or equivalently, each individual’s financial literacy) reduces the maximum sustainable ratio of government debt to physical capital, while increasing the economic growth rates in both stable and unstable BGPs. This result is very important for countries that have introduced educational programs to improve financial literacy, with the increasing importance of financial literacy due to the increasing complexity of financial markets and rising life expectancy.Footnote 4 Our results imply that while such a policy certainly has the positive effect of raising the potential rate of economic growth, it also has the negative effect of worsening fiscal sustainability and increasing the likelihood of government bankruptcy. Third, we examine the impact on fiscal sustainability when banks change their asset investment behavior. When banks decrease (resp. increase) the number of government bonds they underwrite, it would intuitively seem to worsen (resp. improve) fiscal sustainability. However, we show that when the average financial literacy of individuals is relatively low, the opposite result holds, that is, fiscal sustainability improves (resp. worsens) if banks decrease (resp. increase) the amount of government bonds they underwrite. This result implies that if banks decrease (resp. increase) the amount of government bonds they underwrite, the need for fiscal consolidation will conversely decrease (resp. increase) when the average financial literacy of individuals is relatively low. Previous studies that have investigated fiscal sustainability theoretically can be divided into two main categories: those based on the Ramsey model and those based on the overlapping generations model. The latter is relevant to this study. Tirole (1985) examined the conditions for the existence of asset price bubbles using Diamond’s (1965) neoclassical growth model and showed that positive bubbles can exist when the economy is dynamically inefficient. This result can also be interpreted as the sustainability condition of the government’s Ponzi game. King (1992) and Grossman and Yanagawa (1993) reexamined the argument of Tirole (1985) using an AK-type endogenous growth model and showed that the government Ponzi games can be sustainable when the economic growth rate exceeds the private rate of return on physical capital, even if the economy is dynamically efficient. Chalk (2000) studied the sustainability of fiscal management with permanent primary deficit using Diamond’s (1965) neoclassical growth model, and showed that it can be sustainable if the size of the permanent primary deficit is small. Bräuninger (2005) revisited Chalk’s (2000) argument using an AK-type endogenous growth model and confirmed that a similar conclusion holds. Using an endogenous growth model with the public investment of Barro (1990); Arai (2011) showed that when public investment/GDP is small, an increase in public investment spending improves fiscal sustainability. Yakita (2008), using an endogenous growth model with public capital accumulation of Futagami et al. (1993) type, showed that a larger initial value of public capital raises the maximum sustainable level of government debt. Using a model of human capital accumulation through both private and public education, Motoyama (2019) showed that the maximum sustainable level of government debt does not depend on the initial value of human capital. Using a model with involuntary unemployment based on the efficient wage hypothesis, Yakita (2014) showed that an increase in the primary deficit raises unemployment and the amount of capital stock in the new steady state, while the impact on the maximum sustainable public debt/GDP is ambiguous. While all of the above arguments are based on a closed economy model, Farmer and Zotti (2010), based on a two-country, two-goods model, showed that there is a negative correlation between the maximum sustainable levels of public debt in both countries, and that raising the amount of public debt in one country worsens capital accumulation in both countries. Thus, previous studies have considered the issue of fiscal sustainability in overlapping generations models under various model settings, but to the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated the relationship between limited asset market participation and fiscal sustainability. The contribution of this study is to derive new insights on this point. We now provide a brief overview of previous theoretical studies on limited asset market participation. Initially, the fact of limited asset market participation attracted attention on the grounds that asset price behaviors, which are difficult to understand rationally, can be explained to some extent by taking this fact into account (e.g., Mankiw and Zeldes 1991; Allen and Gale 1994). However, many recent studies of limited asset market participation have addressed this issue in relation to the theory of monetary policy. For example, Christiano and Eichenbaum (1995) and Alvarez et al. (2001) showed that the ""liquidity effect"" of monetary policy (i.e., the phenomenon that monetary easing lowers the nominal interest rate), which cannot be explained in the complete market model, can be explained by assuming limited participation in asset markets. Galí et al. (2004) and Bilbiie (2008) point out that under limited asset market participation, local determinacy may not hold in the New Keynesian model, even if the Taylor principleFootnote 5 is assumed. Thus, most of the theoretical studies of limited asset market participation are related to asset pricing theory or monetary policy theory, and to the best of our knowledge, no studies have considered this issue in the context of long-run economic growth. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We set up the model in Sect. 2 and examine the existence and stability of balanced growth paths (BGPs) in Sect. 3. Effects of changes in financial literacy (resp. banks’ asset investment behavior) on economic growth and fiscal sustainability are investigated in Sect. 4 (resp. 5). Finally, we conclude the paper in Sect. 6.",2

In MT (2022), individuals are endowed with one unit of time in their youth, and the household i, who holds its savings in the form of physical capital in period t, is assumed to allocate \(0 < \phi_{i,t} < 1\) of one unit of time to acquiring financial literacy and the remaining \(1 - \phi_{i,t}\) to labor supply. On the other hand, since financial literacy is not required to hold bank deposits, households who hold their savings in the form of bank deposits spend all of one unit of time to labor supply. In that case, the total labor supply \(L_{t}^{s}\) in period t must be as follows.
 In MT (2022), however, the total labor supply is set to be 1 when deriving the equilibrium factor price (see the explanation just before Eq. (11)). This is clearly incorrect. Under the above setup, the correct factor prices in equilibrium depend on \(\sigma_{t}^{*}\). However, if we proceed with the analysis under this correct factor prices, the model becomes far more complicated and there is no guarantee that we will obtain the same conclusion as MT (2022). However, we may introduce two minor changes in the following parts of (i) labor supply and (ii) the definition of the variable \(\phi_{i,t}\), keeping the correctness of the results of our article. The minor changes are as follows: (i) Individuals are endowed with one unit of time in their youth, and they allocate all of one unit of time to labor supply, independently of whether their savings are in the form of bank deposits or physical capital. Therefore, the total labor supply is \(L_{t}^{s} = \mathop \smallint \limits_{{\underline {\sigma } }}^{{\sigma_{t}^{*} }} \frac{1}{{\overline{\sigma } - \underline {\sigma } }}d\sigma_{i} + \mathop \smallint \limits_{{\sigma_{t}^{*} }}^{{\overline{\sigma }}} \frac{1}{{\overline{\sigma } - \underline {\sigma } }}d\sigma_{i} = 1\). (ii) When saving in the form of physical capital, individual i allocates a proportion \(\phi_{i,t}\) of her wage income (\(w_{t}\)) to the expenditure needed to acquire financial literacy and allocates the rest to consumption in the period of youth (\(c_{t}^{y}\)) and savings (\(s_{t}\)). Therefore, the budget constraint in youth is \(c_{i,t}^{y} + s_{i,t} = \left( {1 - { }\phi_{i,t} } \right)w_{t}\) and is same as the one in the article. Without any changes in the actual return from saving in the form of physical capital, old-age consumption is \(c_{i,t + 1}^{o} = \left( {1 - \left( {\sigma_{i} /\phi_{i,t} } \right)} \right)\left( {1 + r_{t + 1}^{k} } \right)s_{i,t}\) and remains unchanged. Thus, the optimization problem and the first order condition as for \(\phi_{i,t}\) remain unchanged too. In short, by changing the definition of \(\phi_{i,t}\)(in the third paragraph of Sect. 2.2) from ""the time devoted to acquiring financial literacy"" to ""the proportion of wage income spent to acquire financial literacy"" we can correct the error without modifying any of the subsequent analyses and results.",

Manenti,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In recent years, several industries have experienced a surge in patenting activities (see Comino et al. 2019). In high-tech sectors this has led to an increasing fragmentation in intellectual property rights and to the emergence of so-called patent thickets (Shapiro 2001). With patent fragmentation, firms rarely have full proprietary control over the technologies they employ; thus, they are often involved in licensing and cross-licensing agreements with their rivals in order to give themselves the freedom to operate. In this context, firms have incentives to intensify patenting and to use their intellectual property rights strategically, as bargaining chips in negotiations (Hall and Ziedonis 2001). Amassing large patent portfolios is a way for companies to reinforce their bargaining position with competitors, improving their chances to strike better licensing deals. Piling up sizable patent portfolios may be beneficial either for defensive or for offensive reasons. In the former case, firms use their patents as a safeguard against the possibility of rival firms taking legal action for patent infringement (Ziedonis 2004); in the latter, firms may want to use the patents aggressively against competitors (Walsh et al. 2016; Torrisi et al. 2016), or use them to induce entrant firms to engage in collusive behavior (Capuano et al. 2020). The proliferation of patents and their increasing fragmentation may have problematic consequences. Patent thickets may lead to multiple marginalizations and royalty stacking, and the associated increase in the distortions related to patent protection may eventually lead to reducing the use of patented technologies and to discouraging the development of follow-on innovations (Heller and Eisenberg 1998).Footnote 1 Intensified patenting activities may also distort the direction of firms’ research efforts. This is what is found in Hall et al. (2013). In their study, the authors employ data on nearly 30 thousand UK SMEs and find that the presence of patent thickets in a given technological field acts as an entry barrier in that area.Footnote 2 Similar findings are reported by Walsh et al. (2003) and Lerner (1995). The former study focuses on the pharmaceutical sector and finds evidence that companies tend to direct R&D investments to areas that are less covered by patents. Lerner (1995) looks at the patenting behavior of biotech firms and shows that companies with high litigation costs are less likely to patent in subclasses where many other patents are granted. A noteworthy historical account of the effects of patents on the direction of innovation can be found in Moser (2005). Using historical data for the inventions presented at two World’s Fairs in the second half of the nineteenth century, Moser shows the different technologies trajectories of firms in countries with and without a patent system. Based on this evidence, Moser (2005) concludes by saying that “patents help to determine the direction of technical change”, suggesting that the presence, and the effectiveness, of a patent system can have an impact not only on the extent of innovation but also on its direction. In this paper, we propose a theoretical model to study how patenting affects the technological trajectories of firms in a context where large patent portfolios are amassed for strategic reasons, i.e. to improve a firm’s bargaining position vis a vis a competitor. The interaction between two competing firms is modeled as a three-stage game. In the first stage, firms choose their technological trajectory, that is they select the area where they want to develop their technologies. If firms choose the same area, then we say that agglomeration occurs; if they choose different technological areas, then we say that there is separation. In the second stage, firms take their patenting decisions and develop their patent portfolios. The technological areas chosen by the two firms overlap to a certain degree, meaning that technologies and patents developed for one area can be (at least partially) used in the other area as well. In the third stage of the game, firms negotiate a cross-licensing agreement in order to use the technologies developed in the first stage. We model the licensing negotiations as a Nash bargaining game where a firm’s bargaining power endogenously depends on the strength of its patent portfolio. In this framework, we show that strong patent protection may distort the direction of R&D activities inducing firms to inefficiently concentrate on the same technological area in some cases or to excessively diversify their R&D projects in others. Specifically, firms may refrain from choosing the research trajectory which is optimal from the industrial point of view in order to induce the competitor to patent less intensively. The main message of our analysis is that on top of the classical deadweight loss associated with the monopolistic position that they grant, patents can be the source of another potential inefficiency related to the distortion they may cause in relation to technology choices. Different contributions in the empirical literature have shown a high degree of heterogeneity in how effective patents are considered by firms (Cohen et al. 2000; Graham et al. 2009). This fact suggests that a strengthening of patent protection may distort technological choices favoring sectors and firms for which patents represent a more effective legal tool. Interestingly, our analysis shows that the distortionary effects of patents may also occur in a symmetric context, i.e. in symmetric technological areas and with patents evenly affecting firms and sectors. Our paper contributes to the theoretical literature on the role of patents in stimulating innovation. Research in this field has focussed, almost exclusively, on investigating how patenting affects the scale of R&D activities (Hall and Harhoff 2012). Only a handful of articles looks at how some specific characteristics of patents may affect the direction of R&D. Bhattacharya and Mookherjee (1986) concentrate on the ‘winner-takes-all’ feature of patent races and study how firms choices are affected by the attitude to risk and by the distributional characteristics of the returns of research trajectories. When considering a context closer to ours – all trajectories are available to all firms – they find that maximum specialization (separation in our jargon) emerges in equilibrium, an outcome which is also efficient from the industry point of view. Chen et al. (2018) study the role of patentability standards and analyze how they induce firms to cluster and invest in a risky or safe project. The authors show that stricter standards have countervailing effects. On the one hand, they reduce the static incentives of investing in the risky project that may fail to lead to a patentable innovation; on the other hand, stricter standards increase the dynamic incentives to invest in the risky project by extending the period of incumbency. We contribute to this literature by focusing on some distinct features of patents and firms’ strategies in the context of high-tech markets. In these sectors, innovations are covered by patent thickets and firms accumulate sizable patent portfolios strategically in order to increase their bargaining power with competitors. As discussed above, this feature may represent an additional factor that induces firms to distort the direction of their R&D projects. A relatively well developed literature has investigated the factors influencing the direction, rather than the scale, of firms R&D activities but, unlike us, this literature focuses on determinants other than patents. A series of papers looks at the reasons why firms select similar and correlated research projects. Technological clustering may be due to the presence of strategic complementarities (Cardon and Sasaki 1998) or to firms failing to internalize the effect of their choices on competitors, leading them to choose projects that are too similar compared to what would be efficient (Dasgupta and Maskin 1987; Hopenhayn and Squintani 2021). Another stream of research looks at how the market structure influences the variety and extent of duplication of R&D projects. Sah and Stiglitz (1987) find the conditions under which the overall number of research paths pursued in a market is independent of the number of firms. This work was extended by Farrell et al. (2002). In a more recent contribution, Letina (2016) highlights the positive effect of competition on the variety of projects pursued by firms, while Chatterjee and Evans (2004) emphasize the role of R&D cost heterogeneity in determining too much or too little duplication compared to the social optimum. Our contribution to this literature is to show how the patent system too can play a decisive role in determining firms technological trajectories, by revealing that the strategic use of patents can lead to excessive clustering (agglomeration in our jargon) or specialization (separation in our jargon).Footnote 3 Our analysis shares some modelling features with von Graevenitz et al. (2013) and with Choi and Gerlach (2017). In the former paper, the authors present a model in which firms first choose the technological area of their R&D activities and then decide how many patent applications to file. A central difference with our framework is that in von Graevenitz et al. (2013) the main focus is on determining a firm’s patenting activity and, more specifically, on disentangling the effect of complexity on the increase in patenting observed in the data. With Choi and Gerlach (2017), we share the idea that firms compete ‘armed with’ their patent portfolios. In more detail, in Choi and Gerlach (2017) firms compete to develop a new product; each firm owns a patent portfolio of a given size and strength and when one firm successfully develops a product it may infringe on some of the patents held by the other firm. A central assumption of the theory developed by Choi and Gerlach (2017) is that firms portfolios are exogenous. In reality, as discussed above, firms accumulate large patent portfolios to increase their bargaining position with competitors; it is therefore natural to assume that the size of firms portfolios is endogenously determined by firms patenting choices. This is where our paper contributes to the analysis in Choi and Gerlach (2017). The paper is organized as follows. Section 2, presents the set-up of the model; Section 3 develops the analysis and sets out the main results while in Sect. 4 we present a couple of extensions to the baseline model. Section 5 concludes. The proofs of the results are presented in the mathematical Appendix.",2

However, despite conspicuous benefits, many business-to-consumer platforms in online retail chose not to adopt them (e.g., AmazonFootnote 1), while many consumer-to-consumer platforms did (e.g., eBay). In addition, platforms that have employed auctions have seen a steady decline in their use over the last decade. For eBay, this trend was documented in Einav et al. (2018). The authors argue that it is more convenient to sell goods by posted prices, and after having experimented with the auctions, sellers resort to simple price posting. The analysis in this paper suggests that the decline of online auctions may have also been associated with increased competition in online markets. One of the distinctive features of online consumer-to-consumer (C-2-C) markets is the structure of supply. Most sellers do not mass-produce the goods they sell, but rather offer a limited number of previously bought or uniquely handmade items. In addition, the same item for sale may vary in wear-and-tear due to differences in the intensity and years of use, which does not just affect the quality of a product, but switches its market into a different or more narrow segment (e.g., vinyl records of 60s vs 80s). It is not uncommon for a seller to have only one item for sale on such markets. eBay is the most well-known and the largest of the C-2-C platforms, which differs from its competitors in allowing sellers to list their items using four different mechanisms: posted price, second-price ascending auction (with or without a buy-it-now price), and “the best offer” (sealed-bid first-price auction). Other platforms are less diverse, but a second-price auction and a posted price are commonly used mechanisms (e.g., Artsy, LiveAuctioneers, PropertyRoom, and many others). The analysis in this paper focuses on the latter platforms thus omitting markets with more than two selling mechanisms (e.g., auctions with a buy-it-now price). While being an interesting and important direction for future research, even competition in two selling mechanisms presents significant technical challenges engendering a trade off between the realism of the model and its parsimony. Over the last several decades extensive literature has investigated competition in one selling mechanism.Footnote 2 A natural extension of the theoretical analysis of the selling mechanisms was to reunite them and allow sellers to choose between auctions and posted prices, but the models had to be simplified and/or solved numerically. The existing literature has studied the choice of a monopolistic seller between selling a good by a posted price and an auction on markets with effectively unlimited supply (business-to-business and business-to-consumer segments). It finds that by using second-price sealed-bid auctions and posted prices a seller can discriminate consumers based on different parameters to maximize his profit. Etzion et al. (2006) argue that a seller segments consumers into different groups by selecting an appropriate posted price, length and the lot size of an auction. Caldentey and Vulcano (2007) and Sun (2008) point to the importance of the size of inventory, buyers’ discount factor and their impatience. Etzion and Moore (2013) and Hummel (2015) show that previously established results extend to open-bid auctions as well.Footnote 3 When supply is effectively infinite (as in the aforementioned papers), what matters is the sorting of buyers into different selling mechanisms based on their valuations and the time of arrival to the market. After buyers commit to an auction, the bidding process becomes irrelevant. It is easy to see that no buyer will bid above the price of the goods available outside the auction. However, when there are more buyers than items for sale, some buyers may be left without them and have an incentive to leave the auction prematurely and buy the object at the posted price outside. Hence, the dynamics of bidding becomes important and relates current analysis to a strand of literature on auctions with a buy-it-now price (e.g., Mathews and Katzman 2006; Reynolds and Wooders 2009; Chen et al. 2013; Anwar and Zheng 2015), which finds that a seller can exploit the limited nature of supply by setting the buy-it-now (BIN) price with a premium. By implementing the BIN option a seller adds a posted price to an auction-style listing allowing buyers to either buy the item right away or place a bid in the auction. Maslov (2020) shows that the incentives of buyers are similar in auctions with a BIN price and auctions with an outside price (as in the current analysis). Contrary to the previous studies considering a monopolistic seller with unlimited supply and buyers committed to a chosen selling mechanism, this paper presents a model of dynamic bidding in the context of a dual selling mechanism (selling by prices and auctions) allowing buyers to exit the auction as its price progresses and buy the object at the posted price outside. It also adds to the literature by considering strategic interaction between sellers who arrive sequentially to a market and have a choice between two different selling mechanisms. Unlike a monopolistic seller, who uses a dual selling mechanism to maximize his profit, I find that when faced with competition, sellers use only posted prices in the equilibrium. Previous studies examining a monopolistic seller have shown that a dual selling mechanism as well as auctions with a BIN price generate the highest profit by discriminating consumers on a set of different parameters. Both BIN and outside prices are set with a premium to exploit either buyers’ time preference or risk aversion, which results in high-valuation buyers accepting the BIN price or exiting the auction and buying the good at the posted price. In both scenarios, the expected profit from the auction decreases. Hence, posted prices in some sense cannibalize on auctions by reducing the expected profit from the auction, but increasing the seller’s total profit. However, when these selling mechanisms are under control of different sellers, the seller with the auction is always at a disadvantage and has an incentive to divert to another selling mechanism (i.e., posted price). The paper is structured in the following way. The next section describes the model. Section 3 investigates equilibrium outcomes in three subgames: auction–posted price, posted prices only and auctions only. Section 4 analyzes the whole game. Section 5 discusses the results and their robustness to several extensions, and Sect. 6 concludes.",1

Gómez,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Consumption externalities can be a source of equilibrium inefficiency in dynamic equilibrium models. This may happen when individuals’ utility depends on an external reference level of consumption which is taken as given when they choose their optimal consumption paths, whereas a social planner internalizes the consumption externalities when determining the optimal consumption paths. Thus, both consumption paths might not coincide and, therefore, the market equilibrium could be inefficient. The literature has widely studied the welfare implications of externalities arising from current consumption (e.g., Rauscher 1997; Fisher and Hof 2000; Dupor and Liu 2003; Abel 2005; Liu and Turnovsky 2005; Aronsson and Johansson-Stenman 2010; Ghosh and Wendner 2017; Pham 2019) and from past consumption associated to the formation of an external reference level (e.g., Ljungqvist and Uhlig 2000; Alonso-Carrera et al. 2004, 2005, 2006; Gómez 2006, 2007; Turnovsky and Monteiro 2007). However, the welfare implications of spillovers associated to (anticipated) future consumption have only recently begun to be explored (Gómez and Monteiro in press). If spillovers arise from current consumption, Fisher and Hof (2000) and Liu and Turnovsky (2005) show that a necessary and sufficient condition for equilibrium efficiency in the neoclassical model is that the marginal rate of substitution between private and average consumption be constant along the equilibrium path. Alonso-Carrera et al. (2006) show that this condition is immediately satisfied in the Ak endogenous growth model if the requirements for endogenous growth to arise are met, so current consumption externalities do not generate inefficiency. Alonso-Carrera et al. (2006) also analyze the equilibrium efficiency in the Ak model with additive internal habits and current consumption externalities. They prove that constancy of the equilibrium marginal rate of substitution between the arguments of the utility function is also a necessary and sufficient condition for equilibrium efficiency. Unlike the standard Ak model, this condition is not readily satisfied, but if current consumption externalities enter additively into utility, the competitive equilibrium remains efficient. Spillovers arising from past consumption are typically associated to the formation of external (outward-looking) habits. In these models current utility depends on how current consumption compares to a reference consumption level—the habits stock—which is determined by economy-wide average past consumption levels (e.g., Abel 1990; Carroll et al. 1997). Gómez (2010) proves that external habits do not cause inefficiency in the Ak model if and only if the marginal rate of substitution between the arguments of the utility function is constant, so that they are perfect substitutes, which is shown to be equivalent to habits entering into utility in an additive form. Following the seminal work of Loewenstein (1987), several authors have examined the consequences of introducing anticipated future consumption in economic growth models; e.g., on portfolio choice (Kuznitz et al. 2008), on the effectiveness of monetary policy (Faria and McAdam 2013), on the dynamics of the neoclassical growth model (Monteiro and Turnovsky 2016) and the Ak model (Gómez and Monteiro in press; Gómez 2021), or on the Green Golden Rule (Faria and McAdam 2018). Among this still scant literature, only Gómez and Monteiro (in press) introduce an external reference level determined by anticipated future consumption, and compares the dynamics of the market and the socially-planned economies. They show that the competitive equilibrium is not efficient in the Ak model with multiplicative anticipated consumption. However, the welfare implications of alternative formulations of external anticipated future consumption have not been systematically studied yet. The purpose of this paper is to fill this gap. Furthermore, Gómez and Monteiro (in press) consider the altruistic case in which an increase in the external anticipated consumption reference level increases the agent’s own utility. However, the jealous case, in which an increase in the external reference level decreases the individual’s utility, is also plausible. Thus, we extend the previous literature to consider the models with altruism and jealousy. This paper studies the efficiency of the competitive equilibrium in an endogenous growth model in which individual’s utility depends on current consumption and a forward-looking reference level—the anticipated future consumption reference level—which is formed as an exponentially declining average of economy-wide average future consumption. In order to isolate the effect of introducing anticipated consumption into utility we choose the simplest Ak technology, so that the transitional dynamics is determined just by the individuals’ preferences. Consumption externalities can also affect the intratemporal consumption-leisure margin of choice (see, e.g., Ljungqvist and Uhlig 2000; Dupor and Liu 2003). Thus, to focus on the effects that consumption spillovers have on intertemporal dynamic inefficiency, we assume that labor supply is inelastic. Furthermore, we compare the effects of externalities associated to anticipated future consumption with the effects of spillovers arising from current consumption and from past consumption associated to external habits. Our main result is that the market equilibrium of the Ak model with external anticipated consumption is not efficient irrespective of the specification of the utility function. This result is in stark contrast with the case that spillovers arise from current consumption, in which the market equilibrium is always efficient, or from past consumption associated to external habits, in which the market equilibrium is efficient if and only if habits enters utility in an additive form. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 determines the market equilibrium. Section 3 determines the optimal growth path attainable by a central planner. Section 4 studies the efficiency of the competitive equilibrium. Finally, Section 5 concludes.",

We study a boundedly rational agent who evaluates alternatives based on multiattributes. The main idea captures the fact that people often focus on a particular subset of attributes, which stand out distinctively among all the other attributes. For example, a person comparing Coke and Sprite may only focus on their taste, since their other traits seem similar. However, once Perrier (carbonated water) becomes available, then she may focus not only on the taste, but also on the healthiness of beverages. Schkade and Kahneman (1998) provide evidence of people focusing on distinctive features of alternatives in a choice set in order to reach a decision. 
Stochastic Choice and the Luce Axioms
 Since the seminal work of McFadden (1978, 1981), the random utility model is widely applied to study stochastic choice. In this kind of models, one specifies a probability distribution over alternatives in a choice set and alternatives are chosen in accordance with that distribution. The concept of stochastic choice is compelling because we may be unable to learn the preferences, but can observe choice frequency in the data. Luce’s (1959) model offers one such description of individual choice behavior. The following two fundamental axioms form the basis of his model: (i) Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA), requiring the ratio of the probability of choosing one alternative to the probability of choosing another should be maintained regardless of the choice set, and (ii) Regularity, requiring that adding an alternative decreases the probability of choosing any given alternative belonging to the original choice set. Regarding the choice axioms of Luce (1959), a number of researchers have questioned their practical significance (Debreu 1960; Huber et al. 1982; Huber and Puto 1983). 
Multiattributes
 In our model, an agent perceives multiattributes for every alternative. In particular, she goes through a finite set of attributes, which may include price, quality, and so on. A probability distribution over alternatives is determined by the sum of values from the intensities of those multiattributes. Invoking multiattributes is not a novel idea in the economics literature. In individual decision making, Lancaster (1966) and Raiffa and Keeney (1976) consider a finite number of attributes in order to evaluate every alternative. In strategic decision making, multidimensional product differentiation is studied in the stage games by Economides (1989) and Irmen and Thisse (1998), among others. Status quo status in Masatlioglu and Ok (2005) can be viewed as an additional binary attribute. 
Selective Attribute Rules
 We further consider that an agent may utilize only a subset of attributes. These show greater differences between alternatives than “Just Noticeable Difference”. In experimental psychology, Just Noticeable Difference refers to the phenomenon of imperfect response sensitivity to small changes in attribute intensities. Luce (1956) adopts the concept to explain intransitivity of preferences.Footnote 1 We interpret the subset of attributes that an agent utilizes as salient attributes. Salience is well established in choice theory and takes into account the fact that typically not all attributes are considered in decision making (Bordalo et al. 2012, 2013; Kőszegi and Szeidl 2013).Footnote 2 We call a random choice rule based on attributes selected by Just Noticeable Differences a Selective Attribute Rule (SAR). Prima facie, ignoring some attributes goes against the aim for more flexibility and quest for more information, which is inherent in many economic models and often plausible: A very short restaurant menu may not list some of our favorites. A larger menu tends to offer more flexibility. It may contain more favorites, but also more interesting new items. In a similar vein, a more detailed description of each item helps differentiate between alternatives and arrive at a satisfactory decision. However, a larger choice set and more information on product attributes can become a curse. It may be too time-consuming to plough through a thousand item menu. It may prove impossible to keep the elaborate descriptions of a large number of products in mind. One may cope with an abundance of alternatives in many ways, by focusing on one food group, by considering one salient item from every food group or by employing other types of heuristics. One can deal with a multitude of attributes by disregarding some attributes. Hensher (2006) performs stated choice experiments to investigate what influences a person’s decision to ignore specific attributes. Among other things, he makes two observations: Observation 1. “As we increase the ‘number of alternatives’ to evaluate, ceteris paribus, the importance of considering more attributes increases, as a way of making it easier to differentiate between the alternatives.” Observation 2. “That is, respondents ignore more attributes when the difference between attribute levels is small.” These two observations also obtain when attributes are selected according to an SAR. Insofar, Hensher’s findings lend empirical support to our random choice model. 
Results
 In Sect. 3, we provide a characterization of (non-selective) attribute rules when the global choice set is of product form. These rules are axiomatized by Independence from Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) and Separability. In Sect. 5, we provide an axiomatic characterization of selective attribute rules when the global choice set is of the product form. One can infer from the data whether a random choice rule is an SAR. Moreover, suitable model parameters can be identified if the random choice rule proves to be an SAR. Finally, once the parameters of an SAR are identified, only instances where the set of salient attributes changes have to be checked for violations of the Luce axioms. To be precise, a violation of the Luce axioms can occur only when the set of salient attributes is augmented as a choice set is expanded. In our model, a rational agent—who takes into account all the attributes in decision-making—satisfies the choice axioms of Luce (1959). However, for a boundedly rational agent, who considers selective attributes in decision making, there exist exactly two possible cases. If the set of selective attributes has not been changed by adding an alternative, then the choice axioms still hold in the selective attributes model. Otherwise, violations of those axioms can occur. In particular, this happens when a new stand-out attribute yields high enough values. For instance, once people begin to care about healthiness for some decision problems, they tend to place enormous value on it. We find, by means of illustrative examples, that an SAR can lead to a violation of Luce’s and other axioms. For instance, Example 1 exhibits violations of both Regularity and IIA. 
Related Literature
 The model of Gul et al. (2014) is formally most closely related to ours in that they also consider multiattributes. They first determine a separate Luce-type random choice rule for each of the attributes and then form a weighted sum of these rules. In contrast, we first aggregate across the attributes selected by the Just Noticeable Difference criterion and then apply a Luce-type formula. We call the rules introduced by Gul et al. (2014) Generalized Attribute rules (GARs) to distinguish them from SARs. By construction, a GAR satisfies Regularity whereas an SAR can violate Regularity, as illustrated by Example 1. In Appendix A, we elaborate on the fact that Luce rules are both GARs and SARs, but not all GARs are SARs and vice versa. In particular, we show that SARs satisfying Regularity need not be GARs. The approach of Echenique et al. (2018) is most closely related to ours on an intuitive level. Incorporating perception, they also adopt a concept from psychology and behavioral economics. They presume a weak order on the set of alternatives, reflecting whether an alternative is perceived earlier or later than others. If an alternative is most preferred in a choice set, then it is assigned its Luce probability. Otherwise, the probability of an alternative is its Luce probability multiplied by a term involving the probabilities of not choosing the alternatives perceived before. This means that the choice probabilities over the elements of a choice set can sum up to less than 1. Thus their Perception-Adjusted Luce Model (PALM) obviously differs from ours, since the choice probabilities always sum up to 1 for an SAR. In a PALM, the residual probability is assigned to an outside option or no choice, which allows to explain choice overload. PALMs can further exhibit violations of IIA, Regularity and Stochastic Transitivity—as can SARs. But that does not mean that PALMs and SARs explain the same violations. Even if one disregards normalization of choice probabilities, there remain marked differences between the two approaches. For a given number of attributes, there can exist a PALM specification that causes more violations of IIA than any SAR. Conversely, there exist SARs that violate Moral Hazard IIA, one of the axioms characterizing PALMs. Again, the Luce model is contained in both model types, the PALMs and the SARs. But none of the two encompasses the other. We shall elaborate on their differences in Appendix B. Brady and Rehbeck (2016) consider random choice rules where the decision maker has strict preferences on the global choice set. Random choice results from randomness of choice sets, in contrast to random utility models and models following Luce (1959). 
Outline
 The concept of random choice rule and the Luce model are introduced in the next section. In Sect. 3, (non-selective) attribute rules are defined and characterized. The concept of selective attribute rule is developed in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5, we obtain an axiomatic characterization of selective attribute rules when the global choice set is of the product form. Section 6 contains comments on attributes and economic relevance. Section 7 consists of three illustrative examples. Section 8 concludes. In Appendix A, we establish by means of examples that GARs do not encompass SARs and vice versa. In Appendix B, we further explore the differences between PALMs and SARs.",

ISDS provisions are blamed to undermine national sovereignty as they allow foreign investors to take any kind of apparently unfair treatment to a tribunal. This tribunal may rule that the host country of the investment will have to indemnify the foreign investor if they find that the host country government policies have caused “unjustified” harm equivalent to expropriation. While ISDS provisions can be found in many bilateral investment treaties (see OECD 2012), the political opposition against ISDS provisions gained momentum when it became clear that they were supposed to become an integral part of both the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) Agreement.Footnote 1 For example, Article 9.8 of the TPP draft  (2016) specified that “[n]o Party shall expropriate or nationalize a covered investment either directly or indirectly through measures equivalent to expropriation or nationalization (expropriation) ...” Regulatory chill is a further concern and means that national governments, anticipating potential compensations, will constrain themselves and may not pursue any policy that might affect future multinational profits, leading to lower regulatory standards in host countries. Although the Trump administration abandoned both TTIP and TPP, ISDS provisions can be expected to become an integral part also in future agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.Footnote 2 The economic reasoning behind ISDS provisions is the well-known holdup problem that may arise in the context of foreign direct investment (FDI). Due to incomplete contracts, a government cannot credibly promise investor-friendly policies if the investment is very specific such that it has little or no value when relocated to another country.Footnote 3 As a consequence, some beneficial investment may not take place as the foreign investor will correctly anticipate her exposure to the holdup problem. International investment treaties specify rules by which disputes should be resolved.Footnote 4 This paper scrutinizes how these rules should be specified. There is a substantially large literature that investigates empirically the effects of international investment treaties on foreign direct investment. This literature finds that they increase investment (see Busse et al. 2010; Egger and Merlo 2012; Egger and Pfaffermayr 2004; Haftel 2010; Neumayer and Spess 2005; Rose-Ackerman and Tobin 2009, 2011), but the impact of ISDS provisions on FDI activities is unclear (see Berger et al. 2011). The theoretical literature on ISDS is not large. There is, however, a related literature on compensations for regulatory takings, see Blume et al. (1984), Hermalin (1995), Miceli and Segerson (1994) and Nosal (2001). As for ISDS, Kohler and Stähler (2019) find that an ISDS provision may improve aggregate welfare generated by a relationship between a foreign investor and a host country if strategic ownership changes could be ruled out. However, the ISDS provision will lead to further distortions and can never achieve the first best. Aisbett et al. (2010a) show that taking out some well-defined policies from any potential compensation claim (so-called “police powers carve-outs”) can improve even the host country’s welfare. Janeba (2019) discusses under which conditions ISDS can lead to regulatory chill, and he shows that a unilateral domestic ISDS provision reduces domestic welfare, but a bilateral ISDS provision may (or may not) increase welfare. Konrad (2017) develops a model with strategic interactions between a domestic and a foreign firm, but without an opportunistic government. In his model, the domestic firm will strategically over-invest without ISDS, and an ISDS provision will ensure equal treatment of the domestic and the foreign firm, leading to even more over-investment and overly permissive regulation. Schjelderup and Stähler (2021) show that an ISDS provision in an agreement among institutionally strong countries makes multinational firms more aggressive in terms of investment and market behavior. Overall, most of the empirical and the sparse theoretical literature has discussed the issue of investor protection only by looking upon the implications of past provisions and the expected effects of ISDS provisions for future multilateral agreements. This paper will not take ISDS provisions as given, but will develop a simple optimal mechanism that is able to solve the holdup problem. Consequently, the innovation of this paper is that it outlines how an ISDS provision should be designed that may not only mitigate the holdup problem, but will solve it. Aisbett et al. (2010b) consider the efficient compensation of (domestic and foreign) investors, but their model assumes a court that receives a stochastic signal on the harmfulness of the investment, and regulation will always shut down the investor’s operation. In the model of this paper, no third party receives any signal on the true intervention necessity. The papers closest to the model of this paper are Aisbett and Bonnitcha (2021), Bonnitcha and Aisbett (2021). These papers develop an optimal compensation rule, too, and their analysis accommodates both opportunistic behavior and new and unanticipated information. Unanticipated information implies that treaties cannot be complete. The difference is that they assume that benefits and costs are common knowledge and can thus be verified. This paper does not deal with unanticipated information, but does not assume that costs and benefits can be verified by any third party. There is also a substantial literature on arbitration and (re-)negotiation in trade agreements through institutions like the WTO, and most papers also assume in this context that an arbitration panel will receive a stochastic signal [see, for example, Beshkar (2016)].Footnote 5 The arbitrator in our model does not receive any signal, but manages an arbitration process according to rules the investor and the government have agreed upon.Footnote 6 The paper will show that such a mechanism must involve at least three parties, the investor, the government and an arbitrator. Since the mechanism does not work without arbitrator, the paper emphasizes that a proper investor protection mechanism could and should be managed by a supranational institution. Therefore, the paper will also make a contribution on the role of multilateralism versus bilateralism for investment liberalization.Footnote 7 The implementation literature has dealt with holdup problems in different contexts, see for example Moore and Repullo (1988) and Maskin and Tirole (1999). The seminal models have been developed in the context of incomplete contracts between private agents like firms and not between a government and a firm. The innovation of this paper is (1) to extend this analysis to ISDS and (2) to suggest a simple design that guarantees continued investor activity also off the equilibrium path. The implementation literature often suggests the stop of any activity as an alternative action plan, but this paper shows that an optimal ISDS design is feasible without the threat of discontinuation. In particular, all what is needed are two action plans and two transfer schemes, where one action plan has only to be less ambitious than the other. Consequently, the remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 will set up a model that will imply the holdup problem in the absence of any investor protection. Section 3 will develop a simple optimal ISDS mechanism, and Sect. 4 will present an example. Section 5 will offer some concluding remarks.",

The competition-reducing effect of a merger is often highlighted and competition policy mostly describes the restrictive conditions under which a merger should be permitted. In an important contribution, Salant et al. (1983) have shown that a merger is privately profitable only if a relatively high fraction of previously existing firms engage in the merging process. Specifically, they show that if demand and cost functions are linear, then an exogenous merger followed by Cournot competition is only profitable if at least 80 per cent of the firms engage in the merger. Kamien and Zang (1990) modelled mergers as an endogenous process through acquisitions and showed with a linear demand function and constant returns to scale there is no merger in the equilibrium, when initially there are more than two firms. In reality, mergers are observed to be a very significant phenomena in many industries. According to the Thomson Financial Securities Data, there were 87,804 mergers and acquisitions recorded for Europe in the period 1993–2001. In monetary terms, the total value of these deals adds up to USD 5.6 trillion (see Belleflamme and Peitz 2015). Mueller (1985) shows that out of the 1000 largest manufacturing companies of 1950, 384 companies had disappeared through mergers by 1973. In a seminal contribution, Deneckere and Davidson (1985) showed that the possibility of mergers can significantly increase under Bertrand price competition with differentiated products. Also, Perry and Porter (1985) focused on cost synergies due to mergers and claimed that aggregate profits of the merging firms will increase if the cost synergies are sufficiently large. While a merger reduces competition, does it necessarily reduce welfare?Footnote 1 In a seminal contribution, Farrell and Shapiro (1990) considered Cournot oligopolies with homogeneous goods and provided a procedure for analyzing the effect of a merger and focused on when the merger would be profitable and welfare-increasing. They showed that the equilibrium price increases under linear cost structures without cost synergies. Moreover, they derived a necessary and sufficient condition for a price increase under certain classes of non-linear cost functions and possible cost synergies. Farrell and Shapiro (1990) mainly focus on synergistic gains as the reason for welfare increase. In an interesting contribution, Ashenfelter et al. (2013) studies Whirlpool’s purchase of Maytag. The merger of Whirlpool and Maytag reduced the number of major appliance manufacturers (Whirlpool, Maytag, GE, and Electrolux) in the United States from four to three. They mention that “Both Maytag and Whirlpool had sales in seven of the eight major home appliance categories: dishwashers, clothes dryers, refrigerators, clothes washers, cooktops, ovens, and ranges. Within each appliance category there is substantial product differentiation. There are two leading sources of differentiation. The first comes from measurable product characteristics. Second, products are also differentiated by brand marketing."" Moreover, pre-merger Whirlpool was the largest manufacturer in each of these appliance categories, and Maytag was the second largest producer of washers and dryers. However, Maytag had relatively little market share for cooktops, freezers, ovens, and ranges. Thus, it seems that players in the oligopolistic market, may prefer to merge even when their quality (as well as market share) difference is high. To the best of our knowledge, this aspect of mergers has not been given adequate attention in the literature. Ashenfelter et al. (2013) also argues that “The degree of pre-merger competition between Maytag and Whirlpool, however, likely varied across product categories. Maytag and Whirlpool were major competitors in four appliance categories: dishwashers, refrigerators, clothes washers, and clothes dryers. In each of these categories, the markets appear to be highly concentrated with Whirlpool typically having about 40% of sales and Maytag having a share between 9 and 16% in these categories.” Maytag was also a relatively less important producer of cooktops, ovens, and ranges. The difference in the market shares depends heavily on the observed product characteristics. In this case study of Maytag-Whirlpool, Ashenfelter et al. (2013) has measured a product’s quality using observed product characteristics, which is a common approach used in the matching of new and discontinued products in price measurement. Thus, they have used measured product characteristics to control for product quality. Therefore, in these four appliance categories mentioned above, as Maytag and Whirlpool have different market shares, it can be argued that the quality of the products sold by Maytag and Whirlpool must be different in the pre-merger stage. The present model derives its motivation from such examples (where firms producing higher quality product may prefer to merge with a firm producing a lower quality product) and contributes to the literature on mergers with the possibility of both horizontal and vertical product differentaition, which depend both on product characteristics and brand value respectively. In this paper, we consider a merger between two firms in a three firm oligopolistic setting and allow for both vertical and horizontal product differentiation of the products in a market. We focus on the situations where profitable mergers occur and then look into the possibility of cases where welfare increases (while firms compete in quantities). In the pre-merger situation, the market share driven by brand value and product characteristics may differ. Thereby, we try to answer the following two interesting questions: a) With whom a firm with highest brand value or product quality (and thereby highest market share) in the pre-merger stage will merge? and b) When will a firm with highest brand value or product quality merge with a firm that produces a lower quality product? Interestingly, we discuss for the first time in the literature that a firm producing a better quality product may prefer to merge with a firm that produces a lower quality product than to merge with another firm with a better quality product. There are only a few works in the literature that analyze the possibility of a merger in a setting of both horizontal and vertical product differentiation. Kao and Menezes (2010) examine the possibility of merger in a duopoly setting with both vertical and horizontal product differentiation and found that a merger is always profitable. However, the model ignores the classic externality effect of the firms that are outside the merger process. In a vertical differentiation model with three incumbent firms, Norman et al. (2005) show that if a cost-reducing (due to cost synergies) merger occurs between two firms that produce lower quality products, then the merger leads to a reduction in the number of products available in the market resulting into higher prices. Ebina and Shimizu (2009) study the sequential merger incentives under the presence of horizontal product differentiation and show that merger incentives under product differentiations are found to be stronger for two firms producing closely related goods than more differentiated goods. Hsu and Wang (2010) in a model with four firms producing horizontally differentiated products shows that the merger of two firms is profitable provided that goods are sufficiently distant substitutes. Toshimitsu and Nakajima (2021) also founds a similar result. Cellini (2021) in a model of three firms under horizontal differentiation shows that a merger between firms that supply more similar product is more profitable as compared to the merger between firms supplying more differentiated goods. However, these papers consider that all the firms produce the goods at the same unit cost and there is no vertical product differentiation (quality difference). This is in contract to our paper where we assume that the production of a better quality product is associated with a higher unit cost. Sen and Narula (2021) is the only paper in the literature that discusses the possibility of a two firm merger in a setup of three firms with both horizontal and vertical product differentiation. The costs of the firms are different and the better quality goods require a higher unit cost of production and the firms compete in quantities. They show that the merger between the firms that produce the higher-quality product and the other firm next in the quality ranking is possible: if either the horizontal product differentiation or the quality difference (net of cost) is high. It also shows that the merger between the firms that produce the lower-quality products is never possible and it is always more profitable for a firm to merge with a firm that produces a higher-quality product than to merge with a firm that produces a lower-quality product. In Sen and Narula (2021) one firm produces the high-quality product and the other two firms produce the low-quality product. It discusses whether there will be a merger between the two firms that produce the low-quality product or between the high-quality producer and one of the low-quality producing firms. However, in the present paper, there are two firms that produce the high-quality products and there also exists another firm that produces the low-quality product. The current paper discusses whether there will be a merger between the two high-quality producing firms or between the low-quality producing firm and one of the high-quality producing firms. Thus, despite the difference between this paper and Sen and Narula (2021) as discussed here, the present paper also complements Sen and Narula (2021). In this paper, we closely follow the structure of Sen and Narula (2021) which discusses the possibility of a two firm merger in a setup of three firms with both horizontal and vertical product differentiation. In a three firm Cournot setting where only two firms can merge, we show that not only merger between firms that produce the better quality products is possible, but also between the firms which produce different quality products. In contrast to Sen and Narula (2021), we assume that the two firms produce the better quality product whereas the third firm produces a lower quality product. We show that the merger of two firms that produce better-quality products is possible if the quality difference (net of cost) or the horizontal product differentiation are high. On the other hand, the merger of firms producing different quality products is possible if either the horizontal product differentiation is high or the quality difference (net of cost) is high or both. These types of mergers however are not possible in Sen and Narula (2021). It is also shown that the low-quality product may be withdrawn post-merger and there can be an overlap of parameter regions (regions defined in terms of product differentiation and cost) where the different combinations of mergers coexist and the merging parties will choose the most profitable one. In such cases, we show that if the quality difference (net of cost) and the horizontal product differentiation are neither too high nor too low, then the firm that produces the better quality product will merge with the firm that produces a lower quality product, but not with the better quality producer. We do find that there are circumstances where a merger can be welfare improving and a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for this to happen is that the two firms that produce different qualities merge. On the other hand, if the two firms that produce the better quality product merge, then welfare always reduces. The empirical motivation of the paper comes from most of the examples of mergers around us, e.g. Whirlpool’s purchase of Maytag, merger of InBev (itself a merger between Interbrew from Belgium and AmBev from Brazil) and Anheuser-Busch from the United States.Footnote 2 It is very important to note that products of different firms are always differentiated either vertically or horizontally or on both dimensions. So real life merger story is to be captured through the lens of our theoretical model rather than other existing theoretical models focusing on either horizontal or vertical differentiation. Shapiro (1996) emphasized the need for a better understanding of mergers under differentiated products though the area is “confusing”. In general in such a merger context there would be product re-positioning and entry into the market and he advocated the measure of “diversion ratio” from one brand to another post-merger as a guiding principle for price rise which can be partly counteracted by rivals’ product re-positioning, entry and available synergy. Though we do not explicitly model the product re-positioning, entry or synergy in our model, we shed some important theoretical insights about the pattern of merging brands and its effect on competition, availability of brands post-merger and welfare under the Cournot market structure.Footnote 3 Norman et al. (2005) studies mergers under vertical product differentiation and follows the discrete choice approach as in Mussa and Rosen (1978) and Shaked and Sutton (1982).Footnote 4 In Norman et al. (2005) each consumer buys exactly one unit of the product that offers the highest utility from a specific firm out of three firms present in the market, provided that the utility is non-negative and not buy at all otherwise. An alternative approach is to model each consumer with variable demand for all products but to assume that all consumers are identical. This approach is called the representative consumer approach.Footnote 5 Deneckere and Davidson (1985), Ebina and Shimizu (2009), Kao and Menezes (2010), Cellini (2021) and Sen and Narula (2021) have followed this tradition for studying mergers under product differentiation. Moreover, to study merger under horizontal and vertical product differentiation the representative consumer approach, as followed by Kao and Menezes (2010) and Sen and Narula (2021), is tractable and allows us to show the effect of business cannibalization which depends not only on the degree of horizontal but also on vertical product differentiation. Bos and Vermeulen (2022) also shows that the same demand structure as in Hackner (2000) and can be easily derived directly from a population of heterogeneous consumers making discrete choices. Brekke et al. (2017) studies the effects of a horizontal merger when firms compete on price and quality in a Salop framework with three symmetric firms. Brekke et al. (2017) derives the demand from individual preferences which depend on price, quality and distance, which implies that products are horizontally and (potentially) vertically differentiated. They consider a pre-merger market structure with three identical firms symmetrically located on the Salop circle where two of the three firms can merge. The structure of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2, we discuss the basic model. Section 3 discusses the possibility of a merger between the firms that produce the better quality product. In Sect. 4, we discuss the merger of the firms that produce the different quality products. In Sect. 5 we make a comparison in terms of the surplus of the different types of mergers when different types of mergers are possible and finally, we conclude in Sect. 6.",

Its opponents raise the concern that it is unbearable to tax individuals at death. Moreover, taxing bequests discourages labor supply, savings and destroy small businesses. Supporters of this tax argue that it allows to achieve equality of opportunity and has low efficiency costs. The theoretical analysis of the optimal taxation of bequests raises a number of challenges. A first difficulty is that there is no clear empirical evidence about the bequest motive, the optimal level of bequests taxation being crucially dependent on this motive. Bequests could be driven by pure altruism (Barro 1974). They can also be accidental due to the absence of perfect annuity markets. It could also be true that individuals derive utility from the mere fact of giving (Andreoni 1989). Finally, it could be the outcome of a game between parents and children: parents exchange the promise of bequests with services provided by their children (Bernheim et al. 1985). Presumably, the decision to give results from a combination of these different motives and furthermore differs from an individual to another. To illustrate the importance of the bequest motive, consider accidental bequests. In that case, taxation is not distortive and as a consequence bequests should be taxed heavily (Blumkin and Sadka 2004; Cremer et al. 2012). In the pure altruism model on the other hand, taxation discourages individuals from leaving bequests and as such create distortions. We focus in this paper on this setting and ask what is the optimal bequest tax when individuals value the welfare of their offspring. Earlier arguments in the literature build on the work by Chamley (1986) and Judd (1985) on capital income taxation, who show that capital should not be taxed in the long run. In the representative agent framework, bequests and savings are equivalent, implying that the Chamley-Judd result extends to the taxation of bequests (Cremer and Pestieau 2006). This result is valid when there is no heterogeneity among agents, meaning that only the efficiency role of taxes is taken into account. With individuals differing in productivity within each generation, the standard equity-efficiency trade-off appears. The first attempt to analyze this trade-off is due to Kaplow (2001). His analysis generated two main insights. First, when bequests are interpreted as a particular form of consumption, the Atkinson-Stiglitz theorem (Atkinson and Stiglitz 1976) applies: under weak separability between consumption and leisure, there is no need to tax consumption. When applied to bequests, this suggests that they should not be taxed or subsidized. Second, the specificity of bequests is that they generate a positive externality from the donor to the recipient. As a consequence, bequests should be subsidized at the margin, acting like a Pigovian correction. Subsequent work has mainly developed these arguments (Kopczuk 2011; Cremer and Pestieau 2001; Farhi and Werning 2010). These studies put two main restrictions on the model of the economy: either perfect correlation between the parents and the children is assumed (Kopczuk 2011) or a two-period model is considered (Cremer and Pestieau 2001; Farhi and Werning 2010). Piketty and Saez (2013) developed a general model with individuals differing both in productivity and preferences. They analyze the steady state of this economy and consider the opportunity of taxing (linearly) bequests, when labor income is also subject to a linear tax.Footnote 2 They find that it may desirable to tax bequests, even with an optimally designed labor income tax system, and argue, using realistic simulations, that the marginal tax rate on bequests can be quite high. The main difference between Piketty and Saez (2013) and the previous articles is that the latter consider a bi-dimensional heterogeneity with individuals differing both with respect to their productivity and the amount of bequests received. We also consider a model with such a bi-dimensional heterogeneity and analyze the optimal taxation of bequests when there exists an optimal nonlinear tax system on labor income. In this model, individuals live one period and have each one child. They are altruistic towards their children and differ according to their productivity, which is a private information and can be of two types, low and high. Finally, the productivities of parents and children are assumed to be uncorrelated. We analyze the steady state allocations of this dynamic economy. This problem has close connections to the dynamic public finance literature,Footnote 3 and in particular to the seminal study by Golosov et al. (2003), who determine the optimal second best allocations of a dynamic economy with private information on the agents’ productivity levels. Contrarily to this literature, however, we are mainly concerned with the allocations achieved by means of a simple tax structure, while the dynamic public finance literature considers very general, and potentially complex, tax functions. Besides, in order to keep the analysis tractable, we are led to make the simplifying assumption that the allocation received by a given individual depend only on his own type and the type of his parent, rather than on the full history of the types of all his ancestors. We first describe the second-best optimum. The optimal allocation is such that the child of a highly productive individuals should be better-off than the one of a low productivity individual with the same productivity level. The rationale for this result is that making the allocation received by a child dependent on the type of his parent allows to relax the incentive constraint of the parent. This follows from the intertemporal nature of the incentive constraints, a key ingredient of the dynamic public finance literature. We then study the optimal design of separate labor income and bequests (nonlinear) tax functions. We demonstrate that these tax instruments do not allow to implement the optimum. As for the design of the bequests tax, we show through numerical simulations that it may be optimal, when individuals are sufficiently altruistic, to redistribute from high to low bequests. The opposite case is, however, also possible: under imperfect altruism, large bequests should be subsidized.",
138.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,13 December 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-022-00814-7,University dropout problems and solutions,April 2023,Giuseppe Bertola,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Policy reports and statistical research abundantly document that dropout varies across degree programs and student populations.Footnote 1 Public opinion and policy-makers view high dropout rates, such as those observed in American and Italian public universities, as an indicator of poor educational performance. However, students can drop out of non-mandatory degree programs only if they previously chose to enroll. Understanding why they did enroll is key to interpreting dropout, which can be the optimal choice, in light of new information, after an enrollment choice that was a worthwhile experiment.Footnote 2 This paper brings two insights to bear on how different problems and solutions determine enrollment and dropout across educational opportunities and groups of students. One is that dropout is optional, and options are well known to be more valuable when they make it possible to exploit better good news and escape worse bad news. The other is that a wider spread of possible news makes it more likely that they will be large enough to reverse an expectation at enrollment that completion would be better than dropout. Viewing enrollment and dropout as optional choices triggered by early and updated expectations of educational costs and benefits offers a new perspective on different dropout intensities across degree programs and student populations. If students who drop out more frequently (such as disadvantaged ones at public universities) are ex ante less sure about the costs and benefits of higher education, the dropout choices triggered by their larger revisions of expectations are efficient, and opportunities for them to enroll and possibly drop out are more valuable. Liquidity constraints and imperfect information can imply inefficiently high dropout rates, but attempts to remedy dropout symptoms rather than their underlying causes can introduce new inefficiencies. The formal derivations suppose that the distribution as of enrollment time of future educational outcomes in utility terms is continuous and well approximated by a stable function of their mean and variance. This approach, described and illustrated in Appendix, allows Sect. 2 to show concisely that wider dispersion of possible educational outcomes makes dropout more likely ex post if at enrollment it was expected to be worse than completion, and makes enrollment more appealing ex ante. Aggregating individual choices, Sect. 3 relates expectations and uncertainty to enrollment, dropout, and completion in an educational opportunity and its potential student population. Enrollment is higher and dropout less frequent in degree programs and population segments with better expected completion outcomes. An incomplete education can be valuable, however, and better expected dropout outcomes increase both enrollment and dropout. More interestingly, both enrollment and dropout also increase, and expected and average educational outcomes are better, when uncertainty is higher around enrollment-time expectations that are worse for dropout than for completion. Section 4 concludes discussing implications for empirical research and for corrective policies.",1
138.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,05 December 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-022-00808-5,Who should be regulated: Genuine producers or third parties?,April 2023,Keisuke Hattori,Keisaku Higashida,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"There are various product markets in which both genuine (brand name) and non-genuine (third-party) products are supplied. Typical examples are office supplies (e.g., genuine and generic ink cartridges), luxury brands (e.g., genuine and fake bags), computer accessories (e.g., certified and uncertified cables), and drugs (e.g., branded and generic drugs), among others. Consumers typically tend to believe that the quality of genuine products is higher than that of third-party products.Footnote 1 Two reasons underlie this belief. First, the quality of genuine products may truly be better than that of third-party products. For example, consumers know that a branded bag’s useful lifespan is typically much longer than that of a non-branded or fake bag, and that third-party Mac accessories are sometimes significantly inferior to the certified ones. Second, consumers may be misled by the producers of genuine products through persuasive and comparative advertising. In the case of perishable items, such as machine parts and ink cartridges, a genuine product may appear to fit a machine better than the third-party products, leading to genuine producers exaggerating the advantages of using their products. Consumer loyalty is an essential source of market power for genuine producers.Footnote 2 Some consumers prefer genuine products to third-party products, even if (i) the former is significantly more expensive than the latter and (ii) the difference in quality between the two types of products is small.Footnote 3 Others disregard the apparent quality differences and buy third-party products.Footnote 4 However, genuine producers can set higher prices because of consumers who are particular about genuineness. This market power provides genuine producers with greater opportunities to increase profits. First, as noted above, genuine producers can mislead consumers by running comparative advertising against third-party products, thus increasing the demand for their products.Footnote 5 Second, they can establish technical barriers against third-party products by making it expensive for third parties to produce compatible products. For example, Apple can make third-party (uncertified) iPhone cables unusable by updating its OS.Footnote 6 A notable example of such a market is that of printer ink cartridges, where the effects of comparative advertising and technical barriers are evident.Footnote 7 Consumers typically consider the quality of genuine cartridges to be higher than that of third-party cartridges. In a sense, this belief is true. Jeff (2008) tested both brand name and third-party inks to compare their image quality and fade resistance, proving that genuine inks produce better-quality prints and are more resistant to fading. However, in other cases, genuine suppliers may mislead people by emphasizing that genuine ink is more accurate and lasts longer than third-party ink, which they claim may cause toner leakages or even printer malfunctions. This type of comparative advertising stimulates consumer bias toward genuine inks.Footnote 8 The suppliers of genuine inks may also establish technical barriers to entry for third-party inks. For example, Canon changed the specifications of its IC chip for ink cartridges in 2017, which made some recycled cartridges unusable.Footnote 9 A common theme in such strategies is that genuine producers try to drive third-party products out of the market. The entry-deterrence effect of advertising by incumbents has been examined in the literature. Theoretical studies have examined the conditions (e.g., market size) under which advertising deters entry (Cubbin 1981; Bonanno 1986; Bennour 2007; Qi 2019).Footnote 10 Several empirical studies have examined this issue as well (Kessides 1986; Zellner 1989; Bunch and Smiley 1992; Brester and Schroeder 1995; Morton 2000; Sembenelli and Vannoni 2000; Paton 2008; Ellison and Ellison 2011 ). Empirical evidence indicates that the ability of advertising to deter entry depends on the advertising attributes and market conditions, while several studies have found that advertising does prevent entry. For example, Zellner (1989) found that advertising of food products is more persuasive than informative. Thus, it has an entry-deterring effect. Paton (2008) conducted a questionnaire-based survey of managers in the United Kingdom and found that advertising is considered a useful tool for entry deterrence, at least in specific industries. This paper examines the welfare effect of regulations enforced by the government, focusing on a genuine producer’s strategies to drive out third-party products. In particular, we examine the following: (1) how the strategic behavior (running comparative advertising, establishing technical barriers) of a genuine producer affects the market equilibrium; (2) whether the government should regulate such behavior by a genuine producer; and (3) whether the government should regulate the entry of firms that supply third-party products. In general, governments have several options to regulate genuine producers as well as third parties. For example, intellectual property law can be used to drive out third parties by granting a genuine producer an exclusive right to the market for a certain period. Patent law is instrumental in industrial goods, while a design right is equally effective in driving out imitators of dresses and bags.Footnote 11 Governments can also establish entry barriers by creating regulations, such as technical standards. On the contrary, antitrust laws can promote the entry of third parties by reducing a genuine producer’s monopoly power. The mandatory removal of technical barriers is another effective way to introduce competition into the market. Moreover, the government can regulate or prohibit comparative advertising. Many theoretical studies have examined the effect of policies that promote competition in an “aftermarket,” where equipment (foremarket product) and parts and maintenance services (aftermarket products and services) are complementary for consumers. Interestingly, several studies have demonstrated that such pro-competition policies may lead to efficiency losses (Chen and Ross 1998; Elzinga and Mills 2001; Kaserman 2007; Miao 2010; Fong et al. 2016; Zegners and Kretschmer 2017). Although the basic principles of antitrust laws make it difficult to justify the prohibition of third parties’ entry, we do not exclude this possibility. We adopt a model in which both genuine and third-party products are supplied. The former is supplied by one firm, whereas the latter is supplied competitively. Two strategies are available to the genuine producer to increase demand for its products in the basic model: (1) advertising; and (2) creating technical barriers. Advertising increases the perceived utility of consumers, while technical barriers increase the marginal cost of production for the third-party producers. Accordingly, both strategies result in a demand shift from a third-party product to a genuine one. Moreover, our theoretical model distinguishes between the surplus from the true quality and that from love of genuineness. We also introduce misperception of consumers created by advertising of the genuine producer. With this specific feature, we identify the relationship between the genuine producer’s strategic behavior and the difference in the true qualities of genuine and third-party products. The relationship between the genuine producer’s strategic behavior and the market size is also identified. Accordingly, we clarify the costs and benefits of the regulations, which makes it possible to obtain the desirable regulation. In contrast with the theoretical literature on the effect of advertising on entry deterrence (Cubbin 1981; Bonanno 1986; Bennour 2007; Qi 2019), we explicitly introduce the comparative and persuasive aspects of advertising and consumer heterogeneity into our model, and investigate the welfare impact of regulations. Persuasive advertising has been analyzed in the field of industrial organization for several decades.Footnote 12 Glaeser and Ujhelyi (2010) examined the welfare effect of misinformation when firms engage in Cournot competition. Hattori and Higashida (2012, 2014, 2015) also examined the effect of misleading advertising on welfare when firms’ products are differentiated.Footnote 13 Unlike Glaeser and Ujhelyi (2010), Hattori and Higashida (2012, 2015) we do not consider the advertising competition between firms. Instead, we consider a situation in which only a genuine producer can run advertising, and focus on the welfare effect of the genuine producer’s strategies in the presence of the complementarity between both advertising and technical barriers. Innovation has also been examined in terms of its imitation by follower firms (Klemperer 1990; Gallini 1992; Pepall and Richards 1994; Lyon and Huang 1996; Wright 1999; Ceccagnoli 2005; Bessen and Maskin 2009). Unlike the literature on innovation and imitation, we focus on the welfare effect of legal restrictions on the genuine producers’ anti-competitive strategies (i.e., comparative advertising and technical barriers). Moreover, as noted above, we investigate the regulation of third-party entry.Footnote 14 In addition to technical barriers, such as patent laws and standards, the prohibition of counterfeits is also related to our analysis in terms of regulations on low-quality products in the presence of vertical quality differentiation. On the one hand, consumers benefit from the entry of counterfeiters because fake products are usually cheaper than genuine products. Accordingly, some consumers prefer purchasing counterfeits over genuine products. On the other hand, counterfeits decrease the share of genuine products, which leads to the loss of surplus. Thus, many studies have analyzed markets containing counterfeits and the optimal regulations to control them (Yao 2005; Tsai and Chiou 2012; Tsai et al. 2012; Qian 2014; Qian et al. 2015; Biancardi et al. 2020; Klein 2020; Martínez-Sánchez 2020; Biancardi et al. 2021; Chang and Sellak 2021). In terms of regulations on non-genuine products, we extend the literature by incorporating the two types of strategic behavior of genuine producers to increase their share against third-party producers. Then, we compare the equilibrium in which the genuine producer chooses the levels of advertising and technical barriers with the optimal situation.Footnote 15 Moreover, our analysis can be applied to markets with legal third-parties, in which the strategic behavior plays an important role.Footnote 16 Our study’s main results are as follows: A genuine producer typically engages excessively in advertising and setting technical barriers in terms of social welfare, while a low level of advertising (technical barriers) improves (may improve) welfare. The reasons for improved welfare are as follows: The genuine product is insufficiently supplied due to the monopolistic price set by the genuine producer. As comparative advertising and technical barriers are implemented, consumption shifts from third-party products to genuine ones; this increase in the consumption of the genuine product mitigates the inefficiency caused by insufficient supply. However, advertising and technical barriers also have negative impacts on welfare—they are costly to the genuine producer, while the production costs of the third-party products also increase in the case of technical barriers. Moreover, an increase in demand for genuine products leads to a price increase. As the genuine producer does not consider the loss of consumers and the rise in production costs for third-party products, advertising and technical barriers are excessive at market equilibrium. However, if the levels of advertising and technical barrier are low, their positive effects dominate the negative effects. It may be difficult for a government to fine-tune the levels of advertising and technical barriers through regulations. In such a case, implementing prohibitive measures may be an option. Hence, we also investigated the welfare effect of possible prohibitive regulations. Advertising and technical barriers complement each other in terms of the genuine producer’s profit. Therefore, as the number of strategies available to the genuine producer increases, the more third-party products are driven out at market equilibrium. Since this impact on third-party firms is serious, welfare is necessarily greater under the complete prohibition of both advertising and technical barriers than at market equilibrium. We also find that prohibiting the entry of third parties may improve welfare. The entry of third parties does promote competition, but also incentivizes the genuine producer to engage more in comparative advertising and set higher technical barriers. Prohibition expunges the benefits gained from competition but also saves on the costs of advertising and technical barriers. Moreover, the entry prohibition of third parties induces purchasing shifts from third-party products to genuine products, which increases the gross surplus (the sum of the consumer surplus and the profits of the genuine producer). The latter positive effects of entry prohibition dominate the losses incurred from the dissipation of competition, particularly when the levels of advertising and technical barriers are high at the market equilibrium. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 constructs the basic model. Section 3 examines the welfare effects of regulations on comparative advertising and technical barriers, whereas Sect. 4 investigates the prohibitive measures’ welfare effects. Section 5 examines the impact of genuine quality improvement. Section 6 concludes the paper.",

With a general distribution of wages and both intensive and extensive margins of labour supply, we extend the existing literature on tax policy dealing with not only efficiency loss but also increased inequality. We show that an optimal tax should be higher than the negative externality and suggest a practical tax policy response to stronger concern for relative incomes: one that maintains constant employment. This policy does not require unrealistic information about unobservable variables and is valid under general objective functions. It will not only reduce the efficiency loss but also reverse KUJ and rising inequality. Conspicuous consumption due to affluence, as first criticised by Veblen (1899) and KUJ have become increasingly widespread under the influence of advertising and social media. While subjective wellbeing (SWB) or happiness rose slightly with economic growth in Europe and Japan in 1973–2007 (Stevenson and Wolfers 2008), it has remained largely constant in the west and even declined in the US over the last half century (Easterlin 1974, 1995, 2013, 2021; Easterlin and O’Connor 2020; Kaiser and Vendrik 2018; Rojas 2019), likely due to rising inequality and declining social mobility (Stiglitz 2012, 2019; Piketty 2014; Atkinson 2015). Happiness is found to be negatively related to the income share of the top 1% (Burkhauser et al. 2016) and screen time on social media (Nesi and Prinstein 2015; Twenge et al. 2018; Spitzer 2017; Mujcic and Oswald 2018). Following pioneering discussions by Duesenberry (1949), Leibenstein (1950), Runciman (1966), Layard (1980), Oswald (1983), and Frank (1985), recent evidence on the negative effects of comparison on SWB has been reviewed by McBride (2001), Clark et al. (2008), and Layard et al. (2010)Footnote 1. It is evident that income comparison leads to ‘keeping up with the Joneses’ (KUJ) (Bowles and Park 2005; Bracha et al. 2015; Goerke and Pannenberg 2013; Pérez-Asenjo 2011), which contributes to persistent long working time, in contrast to Keynes’s (1930) prediction of a 15-hour work week by 2030. To deal with inefficient income comparison, Boskin and Sheshinski (1978) first recommend tax responses and find that the optimal marginal tax can be close to 100% even under a utilitarian objective, but the precise level depends on unobservable strength of comparison. Assuming identical workers Ljungqvist and Uhlig (2000) obtain an optimal consumption tax equal to the (unobservable) negative externality of comparison. Allowing different agents, Corneo (2002) shows that progressive income taxes can be a Pareto improvement. Tax responses with a representative agent are generalized to various circumstances by Dupor and Liu (2003), Guo (2005) and Mujcic and Frijters (2015). With two types of workers Aronsson and Johansson-Stenman (2008) find that the elegant result of Ljungqvist and Uhlig (2000) remains Pareto efficient if two types of workers have the same marginal rate of substitutionFootnote 2, which does not hold in general and not in Ljungqvist and Uhlig (2000) if there were two types. In general, a real economy contains far more than two types of agents, and the optimal tax must depend on how these types are distributed across the population. With specific income distributions and numerical simulation Kanbur and Tuomala (2013), Tuomala (2016), FitzRoy and Nolan (2016) and Slack and Ulph (2018) find different optimal taxes in response to stronger income comparison according to specific income distributions and welfare functions, e.g., maxi-min and utilitarian. Different types of agents usually have different marginal utilities of consumption. This means that existing policy recommendations, based on only one or two types, could be expected to exhibit significant limitations. We show that an optimal tax rate should always be higher than the externality of income comparison. Needless to say, its precise value depends on income distributions and social welfare functions as well as the strength of comparison, and so is difficult to find. The existing policy recommendations are based on a measurable level of relative income concern and other unobservable variables. As pointed out by Boskin and Sheshinski (1978), an optimal tax is very sensitive to such concern, which is hard to measure. A practical and robust policy response cannot really rely on such knowledge, or on simulation results with specific assumptions. The challenge is to translate qualitative insights into a practical tax policy. It should be applicable to a general income distribution and flexible objectives, independent of relative income comparison and other unobservable variables. In this paper, we develop a simple model with a general income distribution and unemployment to examine KUJ on both intensive and extensive margins and evaluate the impact of comparison on inequality as well as inefficiency. Following the literature, e.g., Ljungqvist and Uhlig (2000), we assume that tax revenue funds a demogrant or universal basic income (UBI). We first show that, in the absence of a tax response, stronger comparison will not only hurt everyone, but also hurt the lower income earners more, and hence increase inequality. Thus, an optimal tax policy should aim to reduce inequality as well as inefficiency. We then consider the optimal tax first under maxi-min and later under a general welfare function with non-increasing weight assigned to higher income earners. We find that an optimal tax rate is always higher than the negative externality from comparison, instead of being equal as in the previous literature assuming a representative agent. This tax must be sensitive to the income distribution and objective function as well as the strength of comparison. Instead of a complex tax solution based on unrealistic information we obtain three surprising and practical results: (i) the optimal tax should maintain a fixed employment independent of the strength of comparison, i.e., it should eliminate the KUJ effect on extensive margins; (ii) the optimal tax actually reverses the KUJ effect on intensive margins – individual labour supply declines; and (iii) the lower earners will suffer less and inequality declines. A major novelty here is that our optimal tax should be set to maintain the same level of employment in response to stronger comparison, independent of income distributions and social objectives. Although real-world taxes are rarely optimal, policy makers might reach the best feasible solution after an extended period of trial and error. Thus, it may not be entirely unrealistic to assume that the tax was optimal under the policy maker’s objective before comparison rises. Then, the tax response to stronger comparison should counter its effect by maintaining the same level of employment. It does not require derivation of the optimal tax based on complete knowledge of the economy, including the strength of comparison. The optimal tax will reduce labour supply on intensive margins, i.e., reverse KUJ even though it does not affect employment at extensive margins. Consequently, lower earners suffer less and higher earners more when comparison increases, while the opposite would occur in the absence of a tax response. Therefore, with the tax response inequality will decrease instead of increase when concerns for relative income rise. These policy recommendations seem to be new in terms of less restrictive assumptions and closer to practical implementation. They may contribute to solving or alleviating the KUJ problem. The model is set out in Sect. 2 below, followed by analysis of the impact of comparison in Sect. 3. The optimal tax responses and policies are obtained in Sect. 4 and conclusions are summarised in Sect. 5.",

This means that these firms’ payoffs are dependent on each other. Hence, they may deviate from profit-maximizing behavior. In addition, several firms in the same industry hold minor shares in each other (cross-shareholding).Footnote 2 This common, or overlapping, ownership among competing firms may affect their behavior and yield anti-competitive outcomes. Common ownership has become a central issue in recent debates on antitrust policies, and some empirical studies show that it has a substantial effect on the strategic behavior of firms held by institutional stockholders.Footnote 3 Azar et al. (2018) study common ownership in the US airline industry and find that ticket prices are higher under common ownership. Azar et al. (2019) provide evidence that common ownership and cross-ownership increase monopsony power in the banking industry. On one hand, common ownership restricts competition in product or service markets and raises prices. On the other hand, partial ownership by common owners in the same industries may internalize industry-wide externalities and improve welfare. López and Vives (2019) point out that common ownership internalizes the spillover effect of R &D and may accelerate welfare-improving R &D. Sato and Matsumura (2020) show that common ownership internalizes the business-stealing effect in free-entry markets and moderate common ownership may improve welfare.Footnote 4 In this study, we discuss how common ownership affects firms’ locations and welfare. We introduce common ownership in the standard two-stage delivered pricing model formulated by Hurter and Lederer (1985).Footnote 5 In the model, two firms choose their locations on the Hotelling line (Hotelling 1929) and then compete in prices. The firms deliver their products from their locations to consumers and determine delivered prices at each market point. A continuum of consumers is uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 1] and each of them purchases one unit of goods from the firm offering a lower price. As expected, common ownership restricts competition and directly raises prices, given the locations. However, under our assumption of inelastic total demand (each consumer purchases one unit of the product), the high prices do not yield a welfare loss. Nevertheless, we show that common ownership harms welfare because it distorts the locations. Although how common ownership affects the location choice of each firm depends on the degree of common ownership and asymmetry in transport costs between the two firms, an increase in the degree of common ownership always induces excessive dispersion of firms’ locations, which harms welfare. In other words, we show another unknown channel for welfare loss due to common ownership. We then endogenize transport costs in the delivered pricing model. Firms engage in transport cost-reducing investments and then play a location-price game. We show that equilibrium investments are excessive for welfare, and common ownership promotes investments. In other words, common ownership accelerates welfare loss because of excessive investments. This also creates an unknown channel for welfare loss caused by common ownership. In a spatial price discrimination model, we can interpret ""space"" as product varieties and each firm’s location as its most efficient sector. We can also interpret distant locations as a firm’s inefficient sectors. For example, in the automobile industry, ""space"" represents car size, for instance, and a firm’s location indicates that the firm produces small cars efficiently but large cars inefficiently.Footnote 6 Following this interpretation, our result suggests that common ownership may yield excessive technology differentiation among firms.Footnote 7 This interpretation of space is similar to that of Anderson and de Palma (1988), Eaton and Schmitt (1994), and Norman and Thisse (1999). To explain flexible manufacturing systems (FMSs), they use spatial price discrimination models. They interpret that the location of a firm corresponds to their ""base product,"" each of the other points corresponds to a ""customized product"", and the transport cost corresponds to the cost of customization. Following this interpretation, our result suggests that common ownership may yield excessive differentiation of basic products among firms, and accelerates excessive flexibility in FMS when the degree of common ownership is large. We believe that our analysis is also applicable to nonspatial contexts. Our analysis also relates to a string of literature on cooperation. Cyert and DeGroot (1973) discussed the possibility of firms maximizing a linear combination of their profits and those of their rivals by introducing the concept of coefficient of cooperation. In their model, learning behaviors make this collaboration possible. Escrihuela-Villar (2015) showed the same result can be achieved by the conjectural variation approach. In addition to learning behavior and conjectural variation approach, common ownership can be considered as another way to rationalize why firms take into account the profits of their rivals when maximizing profits. Moreover, another group of studies is about cross-ownership between public and private firms. Jain and Pal (2012), Cai and Karasawa-Ohtashiro (2015). These papers are focused on mixed oligopoly and analyze the impact of the presence of cross-ownership on privatization policies. The most recent work, Heywood and Wang (2020), also discussed the possibility of cooperation on transport costs between firms that have a competitive relationship. They demonstrate that firms may collude to increase transport costs under repeated games. Whereas in our study, even without repeated games, the presence of common ownership distorts the equilibrium locations and leads to excessive investment in reducing transport costs. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates a model. Section 3 presents an analysis of equilibrium prices and locations. Section 4 discusses welfare implications. Section 5 endogenizes transport costs and presents another distortion of common ownership. Section 6 concludes. All proofs of propositions are relegated to the Appendix.",

As part of the sustainable development agenda, governments are concerned with the conduct of a company’s administration with respect to its stakeholders and society as a whole. Governments also support social behavior in NGOs that seek to promote actions for the welfare of others, and design policies to incentivize the philanthropic behavior of individuals who donate to charities or volunteer. The effectiveness of material incentives as a device to induce prosocial behavior has been questioned on several grounds (see Gneezy et al 2011). This paper deals with the effects of incentives on social activities in a dynamic environment where agents are concerned with reputation. Our main finding is that, if reputation exhibits some degree of persistence and there exist policy lags, establishing incentives to encourage social behavior may prove ineffective. The formal framework depicted here is especially suited for (but not restricted to) the analysis of companies’ Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR hereinafter). For the sake of exposition, we will conduct our analysis through this particular example throughout the paper, and hence the agents to be incentivized will be named as firms and the prosocial actions will be referred to as CSR activities. The nature of CSR activities as privately provided public goods might justify governmental intervention to mitigate the free-rider problem (the public good aspects of CSR are analyzed in Bagnoli and Watts (2003), Besley and Ghatak (2007), and Kotchen (2006)). However, the role of public policy with regard to CSR is still far from having reached a clear path of action. Governments and public institutions in many countries are firmly committed to create a favorable environment for national companies to engage in CSR activities. For instance, the British Government uses tax incentives to ensure the socially responsible investment of public pension funds, and also disburses funds for CSR projects and organizations. The Brazilian National Economic Development Bank provides funds for entities that comply with national ethical labor codes. In the same fashion, the Ministry of Economics in Mexico created in 2004 the “Support Fund for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises”, one of whose goals is to implement CSR programs in small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The Swedish Business Development Agency has also disbursed funds to SMEs to encourage CSR activities. The Dutch Government conditions the disbursement of funds to companies being familiar with the OECD guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. These are just a few examples of ongoing policy actions that leave little doubt about the interest of governments to encourage CSR activities. But, on which theoretical grounds are based such public policies? We claim here that, in a dynamic environment with reputation persistence and policy lags, the strategic response that subsidies trigger on firms may reduce companies’ aggregate engagement in CSR. Companies implement CSR policies, motu proprio, to show a positive attitude toward society and the environment. To the extent that social activities improve the image of the company and its reputation, CSR is an instrument to attract and retain consumers. In fact, a two decades survey for American consumers reveals that CSR has a positive impact on brand reputation, loyalty and affinity (see http://www.conecomm.com/2017-CSR-Study). In 2017, respondents of this survey “have a more positive image (92%), are more likely to trust (87%) and are more loyal (88%) to companies that support social and environmental issues”. Consumers are willing to pay a premium for the provision of credence attributes, and, as pointed out in Baron (2011), firms have an incentive to form an organization to assure that credence attributes of goods are being supplied. A substantial strand of the literature on CSR has been devoted to answer the question of why do firms engage in socially responsible behavior (see Kitzmueller and Shimshack (2012) for a synthesis of the role of preferences and economic justification of CSR). Here we adopt the view that firms engage in “profit maximizing” CSR, as they use their pro-social actions instrumentally as a means to maximize profits. Consumers do not know firms’ degree of altruism (types), and firms undertake CSR activities to send a credible signal of their types. Investing in CSR is worthwhile as long as this investment increases the company’s profits in the future. For instance, “green” consumers prefer to buy “environmentally friendly” goods, provided by socially responsible companies (Arora and Gangopadhyay 1995). In a similar vein, McWilliams and Siegel (2011) argue that CSR contributes to firms’ sustainable comparative advantage. Thus, firms’ reputation can be viewed as an asset whose returns persist over time. In this respect, Roberts and Dowling (2002) find a positive impact of reputation on the path of future financial performance. Studies by Ang and Wight (2009) and Schultz et al (2001) show that reputation is “sticky”, meaning that it is “durable and tends to reproduce itself over time”. Based on the evidence provided in the mentioned articles, we assume that reputation exhibits some degree of persistence over time. A standard assumption in the literature of CSR is that investments in social activities are valuable to stakeholders, who might reward this pro-social behavior with a preference for firms that engage in these activities, therefore having a positive impact on firms’ profits (for a survey of the most relevant approaches on this issue, see Bénabou and Tirole (2010), for instance). We adopt a slightly different view. In particular, we assume that consumers are concerned about the estimated degree of altruism of the firms they interact with rather than with the CSR actions themselves. Many experiments in social psychology (see Berg et al 1995) show that agents tend to reciprocate with each other. Consumers value positively those companies that are seen as altruistic and hence are more prone to buy from them. In this line, a study by Sen and Bhattacharya (2001) analyzes consumers’ reactions to companies’ behavior related to CSR. Firms are aware of the effect that CSR actions cause on consumers’ decisions and then use these actions as signals to inform stakeholders about the degree of altruism of the company. We abstract here from any other strategic or market consideration to isolate this effect and focus on its implications. The effectiveness of material incentives to stimulate pro-social behavior has been questioned in a number of papers dealing with the so-called Motivation Crowding-Out Effect. In a prominent contribution, Bénabou and Tirole (2006) (B & T henceforth) consider a multidimensional signaling model to analyze the agents’ response to material incentives on pro-social activities. They show that, under a certain range of parameters, and assuming that types are normally distributed, rewards on the social activity reduce its supply. The mechanism that operates in our paper is very different to the one considered in B & T. In B & T there is a trade-off between the direct effect of rewards and their indirect effects on the perception of the agent’s intrinsic motivation and his/her reputation. Therefore, crowding out occurs in B & T because the reputation loss associated to rewards is higher than the direct utility gained from receiving these rewards. In contrast, in our setting, incentives affect the supply of CSR activities in the standard way. There is no crowding out of intrinsic motivation, and the subsidy does not introduce noise in the signal extraction problem. A subsidy attracts companies to CSR activities, as expected. However, firms who are already undertaking CSR activities anticipate a future decline in the reputation attached to social activities and may react by curtailing their current involvement in CSR. The key to the decline in social activities comes from the dynamic nature of the model, not from the structure of multidimensional uncertainty considered in B & T. In a similar fashion, Seabright (2009) puts forward a screening game where the public authority announces a price p that will be paid to all agents who choose to participate in a pro-social activity. Social image is very important for truly altruistic individuals because it leads to future profitable relationships with other altruistic agents. Seabright shows that truly altruistic individuals are more likely to choose a civic activity when there is no reward for this activity than when the activity is rewarded. The reason is that the reward spoils the signaling power of the civic activity. In our model, instead, rewards induce a reallocation of companies’ involvement in social activities across periods. Some companies will embark on CSR activities attracted by rewards, while others abandon their current engagement in CSR in view of future reputation losses. We present a two-period signaling model that takes into account explicitly the interplay between material incentives and reputation persistence. The model incorporates policy lags, meaning that it takes some time for announced incentives to be effectively implemented. Firms are heterogeneous in their degree of social concern (their type), and the more socially concerned a firm is, the lower the subjective cost it faces when undertaking a social activity. Each firm has only two actions available in each period: action 1 (the costly social activity), and action 0 (doing nothing). The reputation earned by a company is the posterior expectation on its type after the company has chosen an action. A separating equilibrium occurs when different types of firms choose different actions. We characterize a semi-separating equilibrium as a partition of the set of agents’ types: The subset including the most cooperative firms choose the social activity and the rest of the firms choose action 0. In a first step, we characterize the companies’ equilibrium choices without the presence of external incentives. After that, we analyze how this equilibrium is modified by incentives in a context of reputation persistence and policy lags. The major finding of this paper is that a subsidy can lower the aggregate level of CSR. Because of policy lags, a subsidy announced today (first period) becomes effective tomorrow (second period). The choices made by firms in the first period, under the assumption of reputation persistence, affect the range of values for reputation (expected type) available in the second period, and firms are aware of this effect. If a subsidy is established in the second period, there will be more firms willing to carry out the social decision in that period. This will lead to a decrease in reputation of the most altruistic companies. As this reputation loss is discounted back, the benefits of behaving as an altruist in the first period fall because the subsidy lowers second period reputation. This causes some firms (those that were altruist, but not too much) not to embark in CSR activities in the first period. Reputation persistence plays a crucial role here because it is the link that connects the decisions intertemporally. In the new equilibrium, the level of CSR activities prior to the subsidy (first period) decreases, whereas the level of CSR activities after the subsidy (second period) increases. If a specific condition holds, the former effect is larger than the latter, leading in this case to a global decrease in the level of companies’ CSR. It is worth mentioning that this result is not driven by a displacement of intrinsic motivation on the part of the companies’ managers, caused by material incentives. Although corporate philanthropy may be the reason behind firms’ differential costs of undertaking pro-social activities, CSR activities here are used instrumentally to signal the degree of altruism and ethical behavior of the firm. Our approach corresponds to the vision “doing well by doing good” whereby a socially responsible behavior is likely to make the firm more profitable (Orlitzky et al (2003) provide substantial evidence for this claim). Each firm trades-off the cost of sending the signal against the reputation benefits the signal entails and finds an optimal compromise between these two opposing forces. The novelty of the paper is to consider the introduction of material incentives in a dynamic setting where the stickiness of reputation plays a crucial role. A newly established subsidy provides incentives for companies’ engagement in CSR, but also reduces the benefits that some formerly cooperative companies enjoyed from reputation persistence, to the extent that the subsidy may lead to a global decrease in the supply of CSR. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we introduce the model. In Sect. 3 we analyze the effects of setting up a subsidy on the social activity for the static case. In Sect. 4 we perform the same exercise for the two-period game. Section 5 concludes. All proofs are in the Appendix.",
139.0,3.0,Journal of Economics,18 April 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00712-023-00827-w,"Resource allocations in the best-of-k (\(k=2,3\)) contests",August 2023,Aner Sela,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The common opinion in the literature on contest theory is that in multi-stage contests players strategically allocate their resources.Footnote 1 However, there is disagreement about how they are allocated over the stages. One view is that players exert higher resources in the early stages. Amegashie et al. (2007), for example, showed that if players have fixed equal resources, they spend more resources in the initial rounds than in the following ones. Likewise, Sela and Erez (2013) showed that in an n-stage contest each player allocates a resource that is weakly decreasing over the stages. Another view as expressed by Ryvkin (2011) is that players exert higher resources in the last stages. One further opinion is that the timing of resource allocation depends on the player’s type. For instance, Harbaugh and Klumpp (2005) demonstrated that in a two-stage elimination tournament, weak players exert more resources in the first stage whereas strong players save more resources in the second one. Thus, how the resources are allocated obviously depends on the form of the contest, but there are intuitive explanations for some of these findings as well. One, in particular, is that a player allocates higher resources in the early stages since by winning in the first stage he guarantees higher continuation values than his opponents. Therefore, his opponents decrease their resource allocations in the next stages and may even drop out of the contest. On the other hand, a player may allocate higher resources in the late stages since the winner is determined there. In this paper, we show that players strategically allocate their resources along the stages by implementing one of the most common forms of multi-stage contests, namely, the best-of-k contest, which consists of a sequence of k battles where the player who is first to win the majority of the battles (\(\frac{k+1}{2}\)battles if k is an odd integer, and \(\frac{k}{2}+1\) battles if k is an even integer) wins the overall contest. Such contests can be especially found in sports (see Szymanski 2003; Malueg and Yates 2010), but may also be observed in political races (see Klumpp and Polborn 2006) and also in the context of R &D (see Fudenberg et al. 1983 and Harris and Vickers 1985, 1987). We focus on best-of-two and best-of-three contests with two players because they are the shortest multi-stage contests, both requiring only two battle wins to win the contest. However, they differ in the way that a tie situation in which each player has one win is solved. In the best-of-three contest, this is done by an additional battle, while in the best-of-two contest, it is solved by a different tie-breaking rule which is either symmetric or asymmetric. We compare their total resource allocations and find the conditions under which each of these contest forms has an advantage over the other for a designer who wishes to maximize (minimize) the players’ total resource allocation. In the best-of-three as well as in the best-of-two contest, in each battle the players compete in a generalized Tullock contest (see Tullock 1980). In the best-of-three contest, the first player to win two battles out of three wins the contest, and in the best-of-two contest, the player to win the two battles wins. Should each player win one battle, then the player who won the first battle wins the contest with a probability of \(0<\delta <1\) and his opponent wins with a probability of \(1-\delta\). Such an asymmetric tie-breaking rule is one of many possible tie-breaking rules in real-world best-of-two contests. For example, consider two firms competing to produce the same product in two different markets. If a firm wins in both markets it becomes the only firm to sell the product, but if each of the firms wins the contest in one market only, the location of each market may affect which firm will be the dominant one. In many developing countries, government officials treat firms differently in government procurement (Lien 1990). In boxing, if a boxer defending his or her title gets a draw in their title defense, then he retains the title. A champion boxer must be defeated for a challenger to take the title from him. Likewise, when a tie occurs between weightlifters, it is resolved in favor of the lighter athlete (Szech 2015). In addition, in most football knockout tournaments, in each stage the teams compete in a best-of-two contest, and in the case of a tie, the winner is decided by penalties which are a kind of asymmetric tie-breaking rule because they are done sequentially and not in a neutral place (see Apesteguia and Palacios-Huerta 2010). In both our contest forms, each player has a resource (effort) budget of which part of the resource allocation in the previous stage is diminished while part is recycled. In other words, the players have heterogeneous resource budgets that decrease within the stages proportionally to the resource allocated in the previous stages such that for each resource unit that a player allocates in the first stage of both contests, he loses \(0<\alpha \le 1\) units of resource from his budget, and for each resource unit that a player allocates in the second stage of the best-of-three contest he loses \(0<\beta \le 1\) units. This occurs in many real-life sequential contests especially those in which the resource coincides with effort. For example, a tennis player whose budget of effort decreases over the sets (battles) of the best-of-three contest, only has a short time between the sets in which to recovery and therefore actually recycles some of his effort from the previous sets. Another example is a multi-stage R &D research contest where some of the effort and other resources in each stage yields efficient results for further research to be done in the next stages, while some of the effort and other resources are diminished. A last example is that in sequential military confrontations, soldiers become fatigued and weapon resources are reduced. This requires that some of the soldiers be replaced and the weapons be renewed. For the best-of-two contest, we analyze the subgame-perfect equilibrium and show that each player allocates his entire resource budget in the first stage iff the fatigue parameter of the first stage \(\alpha\) is smaller than or equal to \(\delta\) (the probability of the winner of the first battle to win in the case of a tie). Each player’s resource allocation in the first stage is not necessarily larger than that of the second one, but if \(\delta \ge 0.5\), the resource allocation in the first stage will be larger. The intuition here is quite clear, since when \(\delta \ge 0.5\), winning the first battle is more important than winning the second one, the resource allocation in the first battle is larger than that of the second one. For the best-of-three contest, we also analyze the subgame-perfect equilibrium and show that each player allocates his entire resource budget in the first stage iff the fatigue parameter of the first stage \(\alpha\) is smaller than or equal to one-third, and in the second stage, each player allocates his entire resource budget iff the fatigue parameter of the second stage \(\beta\) is smaller than or equal to one-half. Furthermore, independent of the value of the fatigue parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), each player’s smallest resource allocation is done in the third stage. In addition, if the fatigue parameter of the first stage \(\alpha\) is smaller than or equal to the fatigue parameter of the second stage \(\beta\), each player’s resource allocation of the first stage is larger than that of the second one. Otherwise, the highest resource allocation might be in the second stage. According to the above results, independent of the value of the fatigue parameter in the best-of-two contest, if the tie-breaking rule is symmetric or in favor of the winner in the first stage, then the players’ resource allocations in the first stage will be larger than in the second one. However, in the best-of-three contest, for certain values of the fatigue parameters, the players’ allocations in the first stage will be smaller than in the second one. This occurs only if the fatigue parameter of the second stage is smaller than that of the first one. Since it is more intuitive that the fatigue parameter increases over the stages, we find that also in the best-of-three contests the resource allocations decrease over the stages. The difference between our finding that the resource allocation decreases over the stages and other findings in the literature that it increases can be explained by our assumption that some of the resource allocations are recycled. When the fatigue parameter \(\alpha\) is sufficiently small this assumption encourages the players to allocate a great amount of their resource budget in the first stages since they know that they will get most of this resource back during the next stages. However, although the players in our model strategically allocate their resources, if their fatigue parameters in both stages of the best-of-three contest are sufficiently large (approaches 1), the players use almost all of their resource budgets in the first two stages such that they have no resources left for the third stage in which the winner is decided. Given our analysis of the resource allocations in the best-of-k (\(k=2,3\)), it seems natural to compare the total resource allocations of these contests when they both have the same resource budget and the same fatigue parameter in each of the stages \(\alpha\). While there are more battles in the best-of-three contest, there are values of the fatigue parameter for which players allocate all of their resource budget in the best-of-two contest while in the best-of-three contest they allocate only part of it. Indeed, we show that with a symmetric tie-breaking rule, the total resource allocation in the best-of-three contest is always larger than in the best-of-two contest. This result is not surprising since the overall resource budget, namely, the budget resource plus the recycled resources over the stages is larger in the best-of-three contest. However, we also show that when there is an asymmetric tie-breaking rule, if the fatigue parameter \(\alpha\) is sufficiently high, the total resource allocation in the best-of-two contest with the optimal asymmetric tie-breaking rule is larger than in the best-of-three contest. Then, in order to maximize the players’ total resource allocation the designer should set a value of \(\delta\) (the probability of the winner of the first stage only to win the best-of-two contest) that is larger than or equal to \(\alpha\). Our assumption that the parameter \(\delta\) is endogenous is realistic in many situations. For example, in sequential military confrontations the designer can decide the order of the battles so as to decide about the weight of winning in the first stage for the overall win. Likewise, in R &D contests, the designer can divide the tasks between the stages such that the allocation of the tasks determine the importance of winning in each stage of the contest. In the present paper, by setting the value of \(\delta\), the designer can encourage the players to allocate all of their budget resources in the first stage, while in the best-of-three contest the designer has no control over the players’ resource allocations which are determined by the value of the fatigue parameter \(\alpha\) only. In other words, in the best-of-two contest the asymmetric tie-breaking rule is determined according to the value of the fatigue parameter \(\alpha\). When \(\alpha\) is small, the designer has no reason to change the players’ resource allocations since the small value of \(\alpha\) already encourages both players to allocate large resources in the first stage. On the other hand, when the fatigue parameter \(\alpha\) is large, the designer has an incentive to increase the value of \(\delta\) to be equal to \(\alpha\) in order to encourage the players to increase their resource allocations in the first stage. We also show that by increasing the value of \(\delta\) above the value of \(\alpha\) the players’ total resource allocation does not change. As such, the resource allocation in the best-of-two contest increases by controlling the value of \(\delta\) such that it might be larger than in the best-of-three contest although the recycled resources over the stages in the best-of-two contest is smaller than in the best-of three contest. In other words, a larger number of stages is not necessarily an advantage if the goal is to maximize the resource allocations in multi-stage contests. Several works have analyzed best-of-k contests in which each battle is modeled as either an all-pay auction (Konrad and Kovenock 2009; Sela 2011; Krumer 2013, 2015 and Sela and Tsachi 2020), a Tullock contest (Klumpp and Polborn 2006; Malueg and Yates 2006), or a rank-order tournament (Ferall and Smith 1999), all of which assumed that players strategically allocate their resources. However, in contrast to our model, the players do not have resource budgets, but instead the resources (efforts) have a cost that limits the amount of resource that players can allocate. Likewise, several experimental studies examine the behavior of best-of-k contests. Mago et al. (2013), for example, studied a best-of-three contest between two contestants and found that the leader exerts more effort than the follower. Zizzo (2002) also studied a best-of-k contest and found a positive correlation between investment and progress. One work that is particularly related to ours is Ryvkin (2011) who also studied a best-of-k contest under the presence of fatigue, but assumed only two possible levels of resource allocation. In addition, while we model fatigue as a reduction in the players’ resource budgets resulting from previous resources, he modeled fatigue as a reduction in a player’s probability of winning resulting from previous resources. He found that agents are more likely to allocate higher resources in the later stages of the competition, while we find this occurs in the early stages when the fatigue parameter is sufficiently small. The reason for this difference is that in our model some of the resource budget is recycled while in Ryvkin’s model it is not. In other words, recycling motivates the allocation of more resource in the first stage since it increases the probability to win in that stage and does not drastically decrease the probability to win in the next stages. Other papers dealing with resource allocations in dynamic contests include (Kovenock and Roberson 2009) who studied a two-stage campaign resource allocation game in which the players’ different expenditures in the first stage serve as a head-start advantage to the contestants in the second stage and Sela (2017) who studied a two-stage all-pay contest in which the contestants’ efforts in the first stage affect their values of winning in a later stage.Footnote 2 Our paper is also related to Sela and Erez (2013) who studied a dynamic model in which a player allocates a resource that is weakly decreasing over the stages as in our model. However, their model is completely different as it contains n battles over n stages, where there is a prize for winning in each stage that is equal over the stages. They found that while a player allocates a resource that is weakly decreasing over the stages if the value of the fatigue parameter (\(\alpha\)) is sufficiently high, he allocates the same level of resource in the first stages and then decreases the resource allocation over the stages. The most well-known model of resource allocation is the Colonel Blotto model in which two players compete against each other in n different contests. Each player distributes a fixed amount of resource over the contests without knowing his opponent’s distribution. In each contest, the player who allocates the higher level of resource wins, and each player’s payoff is a function of the sum of the wins across the individual contests [see, for example, Snyder (1989), Roberson (2006), Kvasov (2007), Hart (2008), and Kovenock and Roberson (2021)]. The most prominent difference between the Colonel Blotto model and ours is that in our model the order of the contests plays a key role. Klumpp et al. (2019) also studied Colonel Blotto games but with sequential battles in which the order of the contests is important. As such their work is the one most related to our model. They demonstrate that for a large class of contest success functions, in every stage, each player allocates the same amount of resources independent of the numbers of wins in the previous stages. However, they assume that each player’s resource allocation in the previous stage is completely diminished and that there is no recycling. There are several findings in the literature concerning the policy in a case of a tie or a draw. In the case of a tie in one-dimensional contests a designer can decide to allocate the prize with the same probability to each of the players with the highest efforts, or not to allocate a prize at all, or to allocate the prize with a positive probability smaller than 1. Cohen and Sela (2007), for example, showed that awarding the prize with a probability of 1/3 or less to each of the two players in the case of a tie is optimal for a designer who maximizes the total effort in an all-pay auction under complete information where the strategy sets of the players are finite. Similarly, in multi-stage contests, in the case of a draw, the designer should not necessarily allocate the prize. We show that in the best-of-two contest the designer should allocate the prize in the case of a draw, but then the probability to win the overall contest depends on the stage in which a player wins. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In Sects. 2 and 3, we analyze the players’ resource allocations over the stages in the best-of-two and the best-of-three contests. In Sect. 3, we compare the total resource allocations and the players’ expected payoffs in both of these contests. Section 4 concludes. Some of the proofs appear in the Appendix.",

Bringing together the forces of private and public activities has a special appeal, particularly when a private firm or a public organisation engages in risky innovative projects that involve a considerable amount of research activity and where cost can overrun the potential gains. Whilst there is considerable research exploring the motivations behind the collaboration between a private firm and a public organization (e.g., Freitas et al. 2013; Stenbacka and Tombak 2020; O’Dwyer et al. 2022), assessing the impact of the researchers’ contracts on the likelihood of pursuing research activities involving private and public institutions remains limited. Our primary focus is on research activities where the private firm partially or fully supports research performed in public universities and research institutions. An example is the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC) in the area of medicine (see e.g. Bountra et al. 2017).Footnote 1 An alternative example is the mining and minerals sector in South Africa (Mitra and Genc 2019).Footnote 2 For our analysis, we develop a model of research where the researchers perform repeated trials, modelled as trials with a given success probability. The trials can be carried out by a single researcher or by several researchers working in a team. The cost of each trial is a formal representation of the effort the individual researcher engages in whilst performing the trial, and if the researcher is hired by a firm, it may be avoided by skipping the trial. It is assumed that the action of carrying out the trial is observable only to the individual researcher, giving rise to an information problem in the case where the researcher is hired by a firm or a public organization. To deal with the incentive problem arising from the asymmetry of information, we analyse different contractual schemes available to the private and the public institution. In the context of a private firm conducting research using hired employees, we consider first a wage-plus-bonus scheme, where wages are supplemented by a bonus paid to the researcher obtaining the first successful trial outcome; and secondly, a wage-only system where the researchers are subject to random monitoring, and where researchers observed not to be carrying out the trial as expected will incur the payment of a fine. Each of these alternatives may be preferred; by researchers, by the firm or by both, depending on parameter values which in their turn influence the length of the trial and the effective success probability, taking into account that shirking may occur. The public research organization may use the same wage-only contract as the private firm, or a salary contract with long-term employment, where the employed researchers receive a fixed payment for participating in the entire research project, but with deduction of a penalty of considerable size in the case of not performing as agreed; that is if caught in shirking at any trial round during the project. If the penalty is large enough, and the researchers are risk averse, then the equilibrium level of shirking may turn out to be much lower under the salary contract than it would be in the case of the wage-only contract. The consequence will be a higher effective success probability in each trial, and this, in its turn, may lower the cost of research conducted in the public organization. Altogether, if only the wage-plus-bonus and wage-only contract schemes are available to the private firm, then we show that, under suitable assumptions, the firm prefers not to subcontract with the public organization, but to do the research itself. However, if the private firm can subcontract with a public organization under a contract where it covers the cost of the public organization and the public organization uses the salary scheme, then it may be advantageous for the private firm to outsource its research to a public organization. We also show that if outsourcing of research to a public organization is based on the provision that the results can be used by everyone, then the private firm may lose additional earning opportunities otherwise available and consequently, the public alternative may be unattractive even when it is cost-saving. In turns out that even in cases where public research is preferable from a societal point of view, it may be necessary to support its use by private firms by reductions in the cost reimbursement. The present paper relates to different strands of literature. The interactions between a university or public organization and the private sector and in particular, the incentives and gains from those interactions have been studied by e.g. Bercovitz and Feldman (2007), Bishop et al. (2011), and Audretsch et al. (2012). A specific form of cooperation between private and public institutions, namely public-private partnerships,Footnote 3 has been treated at length, cf. e.g. Hart (2003), Bennett and Iossa (2006), and Iossa and Martimort (2015). Several authors study the advantages for firms having universities as research partners, such as access to highly qualified researchers (e.g. Belderbos et al. 2004; Veugelers and Cassiman 2005). Other papers such as Aghion et al. (2008) and Lacetera (2009) argue that researchers in academia prefer to control their own research strategy and therefore, they will demand a wage premium to give up their freedom. Earlier work on the development of an uncertain research project includes a study by Scherer (1966). Here, it is shown that there is a trade-off between expected time to complete a project and project cost. An extension of the model to Cournot competition is given in Scherer (1967). We have chosen to formulate the research problem as one consisting of repeated trials. There is a considerable literature dealing with series of trials, usually featured as a bandit problem, and dynamic noisy learning. The study of strategic experimentation was introduced by Bolton and Harris (1999) (see also Keller et al. 2005; Keller and Rady 2010; Marlats and Ménager 2021). Bergemann and Hege (1998, 2005) and Hörner and Samuelson (2013) study the effect on experimentation when learning is subject to moral hazard, and Halac et al. (2016) show how asymmetric information affects the bonus to be paid to induce effort.Footnote 4 The literature focused on free-riding in groups can be traced back to Olson (1965), Alchian and Demsetz (1972), and Holmström (1982). Bonatti and Hörner (2011) study dynamic moral hazard in a team developing a risky public good and how free-riding influences effort exerted by the agents. Bonatti and Hörner (2017) analyse the effect of receiving bad news during the experimentation. In this setup, they show that information and monitoring can increase optimism and lead to stronger experimentation incentives. The present paper contributes to the above mentioned strands of literature. Our starting point is a framework similar to a bandit problem, where the risky action in our case is the aim of developing a risky innovation with a small probability of success. This resembles the setup discussed in Bonatti and Hörner (2011, 2017), but we have added a public organization with goals different from those of the private firm, though with the same technology. In particular, a researcher in a public organization is no better and no worse than a researcher in a private firm. We use contract theory to study how to provide incentives for researchers to provide effort, cf. Aghion et al. (2008), and make it advantageous for the private firm to interact with a public organization. The paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we introduce the basic model of research and then consider the case where a private firm or enterprise is in charge of the research process, employing a team of researchers. The firm maximizes expected profit subject to overall cost of setting up research and the payments to the researchers, and we compare two different types of contract, namely the wage-and-bonus and the wage-only contracts. In the following section, we consider the public research organization, which takes on a research task on behalf of and financed by an outside private firm. We again consider two types of contract, one of them being the wage-only contract whilst the other is a salary contract. In Sect. 4, we investigate conditions under which it may be advantageous for the private firm to let the public organization do the research. In Sect. 5, we consider the question of openness of research and show how this may influence the comparisons made in previous sections. Section 6 contains some concluding comments. There are two appendices at the end of the paper. Appendix 1 contains proofs of the propositions stated in the text. In Appendix 2, we discuss how the results are modified if future gains and costs are discounted at a nonzero rate.",
