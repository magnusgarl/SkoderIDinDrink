It gave legitimacy to the revival of traditional products (Bromberger et al. 2004) within a legal framework and a modern economy (Bérard and Marchenay 2004). However, this movement had begun in the interwar period with the growth of tourism (Laferté 2002), with products such as chestnut flour (Dupré 2004), Mortagne black pudding (Gilbert 1994), Noirmoutier salt (Potterie 1994), Morteau sausage and Morbier cheese being used as elements of regional identity (Menant et al. 1996). The task of the Patrimoine Ethnologique (French Ethnological Heritage, working under the Ministry for Culture) was to analyse motivations (Bromberger et al. 2004; Chevallier 1991). The dual nature of households’ consumption has been qualified as paradoxical (Warnier 1994) because “merchandise” signifies goods that are tradable, usually for money, with a “value for use”. Thus, through monetary means, all merchandise can be compared. Authenticity, on the contrary, is a particularity that cannot, ostensibly, be commodified, but one that has nevertheless become the driver of an economy (Esquerre and Boltanski 2017) that some have called “terroir-caisse” (local-tradition cash cow) (Bessière 2012), hence the observation of a paradox, namely the growth of market demand for identifier goods in reference to inalienable historical or geographical roots. To resolve this paradox, eater consumers mobilise three types of identifying authorities and procedures (Warnier 1994). (1) Sourcing their supplies from a known producer, artisan or seller whose products are respected, well-priced, tasty or healthy, whose production mode is considered sustainable and good for the environment, or to support local employment. Warnier calls this la marchandisation singularisante in reference to Kopytoff’s “resingulariz[ation of] what has been commoditized” (1986). (2) In more anonymous premises for provisioning, certifying authorities guarantees a product’s origin and production mode when the consumer does not personally know its source. This is the primary role of brands, which guarantee the stable taste and value for money upon which consumer confidence is built. Protected Origin (AOC, AOP) and organic farming certification (e.g. AB, Ecocert, Bio Europe and Bio Cohérence in France) rely on specific terms of reference, compliance with which is monitored regularly. (3) Lastly, if we make this analysis by examining practices, we should also take into account the way in which an industrially manufactured product is appropriated by its recurrent use, entering into a family’s gustatory history by reminding young adults of their childhood, for example. This may be a particular brand of spaghetti or a specific chocolate spread. These foods, obtained in a supermarket, will be domesticated through repeated or even daily use, contributing to the construction of a family or age-group food history. We can call this “domestication” (Warnier 1994). These three authentication modes can be found in the articles, presented from a contemporary perspective. We put forward the hypothesis that the food and health scandals of the last 30 years have strengthened consumers’ demand for traceability to help them authenticate the foods they buy and to manage the risks (Lamine 2008, 2015; Raude 2008). Although eaters do not all patronise the same suppliers for financial, social, cultural or political reasons, the multiplication of types of provisioning and the authentication modes described by this issue’s authors converge with those illustrated by Warnier in the 1990s. However, the aim of contemporary forms of authentication is no longer only to give meaning to mass consumption by means of “singularised” and identified products but to inform the consumer of the economic, social and political conditions of the goods’ production and distribution. These authentication processes are particularly significant if observed from the perspective of households’ provisioning practices. In 2011, 72% of food purchases were made in supermarkets (Kranklader 2014), and this figure has remained stable since 2011. However, the diversification of provisioning in the remaining 28% has evolved because of the diversification of production and therefore of supply (organic shops, AMAPs, producer cooperatives, internet access, local markets, etc.). As for the differences in economic or social restrictions that exist among consumers, Ferrant and Plessz (2015) note that “the proportion [of income spent on food] has become less divisive in the sense that working class expenditure has been catching up with that of middle class consumers (Bigot and Langlois 2011; Larochette and Sanchez-Gonzalez 2015)” with a variation of 5% from one category to the other for food’s share in households’ consumption expenditure. This can be explained by the fact that in the second half of the twentieth century, the middle class expanded in France (Insee 2014), although categorisations other than income, such as age, gender or domestic situation (couples, divorce with joint custody of children, etc.) make it possible to introduce differences in consumption. Furthermore, in order to understand this provisioning from suppliers other than supermarkets, it is important to take into consideration place of residence, age and household composition. More qualitative studies, such as those by Dubuisson-Quellier (2013); Jung et al. (2014); or Adamiec (2016), have examined the counterculture that these modes of provisioning champion, although they often remain combined with provisioning from supermarkets, as described by Lamine (2008) who studied “occasional organic shoppers”. The interest in understanding this multimodality is not new. In 1991, surveys of the multiplicity of provisioning were already being conducted. For example, the INSEE “consumption and places of food purchase” survey showed that, on average, 35% of French households (39% in the south west of the country: Aquitaine, Midi-Pyrénées, Limousin) tended a vegetable garden, almost 17% kept poultry and 10% raised rabbits (Dubeau 1994), although this represented only 5% of food consumed. Nevertheless, the motivations for this home production were not identical depending on the consumer: Some were motivated by the low cost of production while others saw it as a way of singularising their consumption. However, the non-negligible presence of home production encourages us to consider the question of the decision-making operated by actors between different forms of provisioning. In this respect, with regard to the consumption of vegetables, Caillavet and Nichele (1999) also demonstrated the interdependence of commercial provisioning and home production practices. The research presented in this special issue expands on these studies by shedding light on the dual aspect of contemporary food consumption. On the one hand, eaters benefit from the globalisation of the food trade on a macroeconomic scale, which allows them either diversified provisions whatever the season, or low prices, which, in the current political, moral and health/food hygiene climate, raises questions of traceability and ethics. On the other hand, they continue to make local integration a greater or lesser part of their consumption in order to have power over its authentication. To understand the articulation of consumers’ approaches as complementary (Lallement 2010), the authors of this special issue describe the logics of action articulating eaters’ social, economic, moral and political restrictions and means and leading them to this multimodality of provisioning practices. While food makes it possible to address the question of (economic, social and cultural) choices and restrictions, how, during these provisionings, are shopping baskets filled? How are notions of balance, health and diet articulated with the economic dimension, social engagement and consideration for different family members’ tastes? How are these unstable elements put forward as motives for decisions depending on the situation? The authors of this issue’s articles have used various methods to shed light on these logics of action.",
99,1,"Review of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Studies",29 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41130-017-0046-5,“Making people buy and eat differently”: lessons from the modernisation of small independent grocery stores in the early twentieth century,June 2018,Franck Cochoy,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this section, I will briefly introduce the theoretical framework my paper rests upon, present the data and method I rely on and define the narrative that I will develop to show how grocery people and technologies reshaped food consumption. This paper shares the agenda and perspectives of a larger research stream now known as “market studies” (Araujo et al. 2011). Having strong intellectual roots in science and technology studies (STS), market studies promote a view urging social sciences to account not only for everyone but also for every thing that matters in market environments. Of course, human actors, culture, meanings, sentiments, strategies, talks and representations still play a prominent role in social conduct and often take the lead. However, objects, artefacts, living beings and more generally all non-human agencies cannot be considered as mere material resources, as elements of a passive context or as the product of social conducts (McFall 2009). Instead, these entities often fully participate in the unfolding of various undertakings (Callon 1986); in other words, they too have “agency”, i.e. the capacity to act, even when they are not “alive” by virtue of their physical characteristics. For instance, a hermetic tin preserves the food it contains, and a printed paper label describes and qualifies the product it presents. As a consequence, market situations may be described as various “agencements”, where the “agency” of market professionals (Cochoy and Dubuisson-Quellier 2013) and market devices (Callon et al. 2007) combine their efforts and transformative force to achieve a given organisation of commerce—an agencement (Callon 2016). In some respects, one may consider that human actors, given their distinctive rational and intentional abilities, try to frame and direct this combination in a dynamic effort aimed at “agencing markets” (Cochoy et al. 2016). However, a symmetrical account of how market professionals and market devices jointly shape market exchange helps understand that all the elements involved in such “market agencements” are not in full control. In particular, technologies often produce some specific and unexpected effects. As such, market devices (although the same is true for market professionals) cannot be considered as faithful intermediaries that merely act as neutral “connectors” between the two sides of supply and demand. Thanks to Antoine Hennion (2015) and Bruno Latour (1988), we have long known the extent to which intermediaries, given their often autonomous and unpredictable agency, often mutate into mediators, i.e. into entities that, rather than working as faithful messengers, modify not only the elements they are meant to convey (e.g. food) but also their origin and destination (e.g. the food industry and consumers). In this paper, I propose to examine how the transformation of the grocery business and related techniques made them act as strong mediators in the circulation of foods on the American market: as I will show, they contributed to reshaping the food industry’s strategies, the content of foods and the identity of eaters. Market devices bring some new features that often produce effects that “overflow” from the frame fixed for their implementation. Market professionals ceaselessly attempt to reframe these overflows according to their initial preferences and goals (Callon 1998), but I aim to show that they also use them as foundations for a continuous “re-agencement” of their activity. As we will see, in the early twentieth century, innovative retail technologies favoured the promotion of a new art of “making people buy and eat”: the purpose was still to make people buy and eat, but to make them buy and eat differently. This idea of “making (someone) do (something)” is borrowed from Latour (1999). It helps move away from the false alternative between “sociologism” (i.e. the view according to which “doing” is the privilege of social actors who are supposed to be the only origin of action: “we do”) and “technologism” (i.e. the opposite view, according to which we are not really doing anything, but instead passively driven by technological frames and forces: we are “done”). Neither sociologism nor technologism is satisfactory. If we do not fully control our action, we still assume a very large part of it. However, during the course of our action, material devices often lend us their own agency; they thus “make us do” the things we aim for, but given their contribution, we tend to do these things slightly differently from what we would have done alone. My study of how retailers and retail technologies made consumers buy their foods differently (and also buy different foods) is based on the systematic reading of the professional journal Progressive Grocer over the period 1922–1959. This magazine was aimed at small independent grocers to help them resist the competition of new forms of distribution such as chain stores and supermarkets by modernising their techniques and practices (Cochoy 2016). I reviewed each issue of the magazine, page by page, from 1922 to 1959. I photographed every page with content directly or indirectly linked to the presentation of retailing techniques, in both the managerial and material senses (articles and advertisements). The resulting archive containing about 5000 magazine pages was classified and analysed along various thematic lines. The method used combines the “archaeology of present time” (Cochoy 2009) with historical methods. Like an archaeologist, I base my analysis on the material forms taken by food-selling techniques (new furniture, packaging techniques, service methods and so on). This focus on the visual and material aspects of what can be seen in pictures helps gain insights that are often lacking in texts and testimonies. I combine this archaeological approach with traditional historical analysis of written documents in the form of magazine articles. Even if systematic, this method is, at first glance, debatable, given its “single source” nature. Does not careful historical inquiry require the use of several types of sources and their subsequent triangulation? Yes, in most cases, but several arguments may nevertheless justify the single source approach as far as Progressive Grocer is concerned. Firstly, this journal is less a “source” than an historical “ocean”! Indeed, it is not a specific and tiny flow that irrigates retail history from upstream; it is rather a large and central reservoir—the leading trade magazine of its sector, with a readership of 50,000 grocers in the 1930s, i.e. 20% of professionals at the time—that receives (downstream!) the input of various flows: contributions of journalists specialised in retailing policies and techniques, information about government regulation, facts about competition (in particular chain stores and supermarkets), advertisements from suppliers who promote various retailing devices, experiences of varied retailers and even information about consumers, be it through professional testimonies or surveys. Secondly and consequently, the wide scope and heterogeneity of Progressive Grocer allows the information to be triangulated within itself. While many papers and advertisements are aimed at promoting particular techniques and equipment and should thus be taken with precaution as far as their real use and business potential is concerned, looking at one topic in a paper or advertisement that focuses on a different subject is a powerful means to get a better and more neutral view of the first. The third argument is the advantages of continuously following a single source rather than intermittently covering multiple archives when trying to account for developments over a long period. Reading Progressive Grocer provides a more systematic view of the array and timing of innovations and a better chance of not missing small but nevertheless significant developments. That said, my approach is not strictly monomaniac: I have crossed my primary data with several secondary sources and supplemented it with knowledge obtained from major works on the same topic (Bowlby 2001; Deutsch 2001; Grandclément 2008; Spellman 2016; Strasser 1989; Tedlow 1990). My focus is on the modernisation of food businesses and food-buying and consumption practices in the early twentieth century. This focus is given by the name of the magazine itself: Progressive Grocer, as the title suggests, is about helping US independent grocers to move forward according to the argument that these professionals, if they want to survive, have no choice but to follow the general advances of the times. American society and economy had experienced an incredible array of changes since the beginning of the so-called “Progressive Era” in the late nineteenth century (Buenker and Kantowicz 1988), a movement the magazine’s title clearly refers to. However, talking of progress is one thing, explaining what it is or should be is another, and historians should be very careful in this respect. In particular, they should be wary of presenting the new solutions that emerged as “progressive” or “modern” and discarding other features and practices that disappeared as “regressive” or “old-fashioned”. The delivery of customer service is the best example one can give for the need for such caution. Should service be considered as an outmoded feature of an archaic state of the grocery world, which could not avoid being replaced by new “modern” or “progressive” arrangements such as self-service and cash and carry methods? Most people looking at history from our contemporary context would answer positively, but early twentieth century grocers had excellent reasons to look at the issue in other terms: does service not benefit consumers and build customer loyalty for the grocer? Would abandoning it not mean regression rather than progress in this respect? These questions help define progress according to the actors’ perspective, rather than a rigid, normative and, moreover, anachronistic view. More importantly, they help identify two versions of modernisation proposed by the actors themselves. As we will see, the first version is that of “betterment”: making progress is not necessarily about abandoning existing methods for new ones, but could be about improving the first. The second version is that of “replacement”: instead of improving available techniques, one may also replace them with fully innovative ideas, methods and devices.",3

For Marcel Mauss, this is the model of a society governed by a system of reciprocal giving, a “system of total services” système de prestations totales (1950), the institutionalised flow of food exchanges, both voluntary and obligatory, connecting humans to each other and to the gods. Economic commercialisation does not preclude the persistence of those relationships, which maintain a network of exchanges outside the monetary economy, and so European colonisation and then the recent trend of globalisation have been accompanied by a counter-trend of localisation which asserts a strong sense of identity, especially in relation to food. How have historical and political factors, with their consequences in terms of choice and availability of foodstuffs, influenced contemporary Polynesian food provision practices? This article presents a comparative and diachronic analysis of food provision and consumption patterns in French Polynesia and of the social factors and dynamics driving these patterns. Two island territories, the island of Tahiti,Footnote 1 the location of the capital city and the most urbanised island in the French overseas territorial unit, and the island of Rapa,Footnote 2 the most isolated of these islands, located 1250 km from the former, constitute the comparative research areas used to illustrate the arguments presented here. An outline of how Polynesians’ methods of food provision and consumption have evolved is followed by an analysis of the three component elements of Polynesian food resources: monetary resources, public finance, and subsistence consumption (comprising subsistence production plus gifts and exchanges), all of which still operate in varying degrees depending on the location. Lastly, this article shows how the negative impacts of the current mode of food production and consumption favour the emergence of a determination to regain control of these resources, through the example of Rapa where food and food practices have been given renewed meaning by re-embedding the economic within its social and cultural substrate (Polanyi 1957). The key phases in the evolution of the food system in French Polynesia are Christianisation and monetisation, followed by colonisation in the nineteenth century, and then by massive financial inflows during the French nuclear era from the 1960s onwards. These phases are characterised by the imposition of external values and by the interpretation of a formal, European framework via local categories (Serra Mallol 2013). The socio-economic practices of the ancient Polynesians are well known to us, especially those of the Tahitians (Oliver 1974; Robineau 1985; Baré 1987), as are the food distribution and supply patterns of the pre-European era (Pollock 1992; Serra Mallol 2010). The ancient Polynesians derived their food supply from the exploitation of introduced local land-based resources and marine resources. Their knowledge of these various resources was highly sophisticated, encompassing multiple varieties of a relatively limited number of plant and marine species and the use of specially adapted fishing, agricultural, and horticultural techniques appropriate to a humid tropical climate, plus hunting, gathering, and semi-domestic livestock rearing. In ancient Polynesian society, the extended family home was the basic unit where daily food production was organised and the focal point around which was structured a network of exchanges with other households and the rest of the community. This cooperative group, called ‘opu or ‘ati (Robineau 1985) comprised successive generations of a common lineage living in a single household, organised around a common ancestor and a shared plot of land, the fenua, a key component of Polynesian identity (Baré 1987). This group was responsible for the day-to-day management of the land and of marine resources, owning most of the tools of collective production (large fishing nets, canoes, etc.). These family groups were connected at a higher level by an integrated community-based system for managing land and sea, the mata’eina’a: a community led by an ari’i (or ariki in Rapa)—the hereditary chief (following the rule of primogeniture) and custodian of the land. Polynesian societies, then, were highly structured and hierarchical, organised around the concept of mana, their dominant values being the prestige and honour of the chief and his community, and reciprocity. An individual’s status, gender, and age were the criteria used to differentiate and categorise, determining which foods they were permitted to eat and the way these foods were produced and consumed. Status was determined by genealogical proximity to the relevant deified ancestor, the quality of mana being to some extent its symbolic expression, inherited in greater amounts by those closest to the rank of chief: the most prestigious foods (red-meat animals, pelagic fish, the most highly prized plant foods), and their production and preparation, were ritually dedicated to the most sacred, ra’a, individuals. Conversely, the range of foodstuffs became more limited in quantity and quality as the degree of genealogical separation increased: the least sacred families and individuals were subjected to the largest number of segregations and prohibitions. Across Polynesia, we see clear gender-based segregation, extending from the selection of permitted foods through to their modes of production and storage, distribution, and consumption (Serra Mallol 2010). Yet, this criterion was secondary to leader status, in the Society Islands at least, while status and gender were more strongly linked in Rapa, to the benefit of the male sex (Moerenhout 1959). At all levels, food itself was regarded a tapu, sacred, and therefore a source of distinction and segregation. The ancient Polynesians’ daily diet was therefore located within a prescribed order, defined in terms of the basic foodstuffs, in which every individual, according to his or her status, could access specified food resources at a given place and time: certain varieties of breadfruit, ‘uru, and taro in Tahiti (the peninsula), taro in Rapa, other plant foods (yam, sweet potato, ancient cassava, etc.), coconut milk as a distinctive feature of the Tahitian diet (coconut, banana, plantain, and breadfruit do not grow in Rapa), accompanied by fish and a sea water sauce. A rahui, a periodic prohibition or restriction decreed by the chief for one or more primary foodstuffs or for a given maritime area, and covering production, trading, and consumption, could be issued at any time. Eaters were clearly segregated—physically as well as by permitted foods—and the most highly valued foodstuffs were reserved for gifts to chiefs and the gods, and for the many festive and ritual occasions that structured daily life, bringing family leaders together. The redistribution specific to the role of chief—in the form of regular gigantic feasts, lasting several days—represented a form of reciprocity between the chief and his community, which regularly paid him tributes, mainly of food. The prestige of the abundance on offer at these occasions reflected on the whole community; leftovers were distributed equitably among all the guests to be taken home afterwards. In Polynesia, in the absence of money and of markets as physical trading places, four forms of food provision could co-exist (Oliver 1974): the pooling of resources and of production and storage capacities for mutual assistance (tauturu); regular exchanges between households (tarahu and ho’o) and other spatial and temporal forms of sharing; individual hospitality (aro’a) or collective hospitality (‘utu) in the form of offering one’s own resources for a visit by an honoured guest or a community event; and providing accommodation for a relative (fa’a’amu’a) in the home—in addition to the tributes, including food tributes, paid periodically to chiefs. All these types of distribution—except the last one—are still found in the same forms today (Serra Mallol 2010). According to the generally accepted principle of reciprocity, the food used for gifts, exchanger, or barter for a specialist service had a value beyond the mere use or exchange values: a bonding value (Godbout 1992). These phenomena of gifts, exchange, and sharing therefore provide a base reference point for understanding the society as a whole: “the entire ma’ohi social world can be seen as expressing itself via food practices and food production” (Baré 1987). Polynesian societies were based on the economic driving force of gifts and exchanges, reciprocity, and redistribution, via social relationships that bound individuals closely to one another and to their community, and the economic dimension was embedded in social and cultural relationships—these being crystallised, in one particular form, in their food practices. These societies were highly integrative, defining precise status classifications for individuals and situations, as evidenced by the number and degree of food prohibitions and restrictions. But they were also highly segregated and hierarchical in the differentiated access to food they offered to their members. There is little evidence of foreign foods being successfully introduced—and accepted by Polynesians—during the first years after contact was made with Europeans in the last quarter of the eighteenth century for Tahiti and the first quarter of the following century for Rapa. Initially, European foods were reputed to be bad or ineffective and their distribution was limited—confined for an initial period to the exchange networks between chiefs and their allies. Then, contacts increased with ships trading in whale oil and tropical hardwoods, and with trading vessels that were passing through, and the chiefs became incorporated in these transoceanic trade networks, diverting a portion of the traditional flows of gift and exchange accordingly, which effectively withdrew them from the traditional redistribution cycle. During the nineteenth century, Christianity became the dominant religion in a number of Polynesian socio-political groupings—including the Society Islands and Rapa (in the Austral Islands) from the 1820s–1930s onwards. It is only at this point that we see the Society Islands and Rapa join the market economy, mainly through the trade in salt pork and coconut oil established by chiefs and missionaries in Tahiti and the trade in pearls and mother-of-pearl in Rapa (Caillot 1932). The transition from a gift and exchange economy to a monetary economy occurred as a result of the voluntaristic action of missionaries, who needed to participate in existing trade networks in order to procure consumer goods for their own use (flour, salt beef, cloth, etc.) from the European mainland, and sought to involve their new converts in these networks, too. The challenge was to “increase their wants, or to make some of the comforts and decencies of society as desirable as the bare necessities of life” as Ellis (1829) wrote. Despite the introduction of bread and wine by the Christian missionaries, and of a few other new foodstuffs (mainly pulses), in both Tahiti and Rapa from the 1830s onwards, the everyday diet of Polynesian families remained very largely unchanged, exclusively self-sufficient and based on traditional resources. Yet, the symbolic and temporal aspect of the new, normative Christian order disrupted the structure and meaning of their day-to-day arrangements and even the status of the eater (Serra Mallol 2010). The ancient practices of food segregation gave way to a syncretic Christian model which became the new “food tradition”. Religion also wielded its influence through domestic education lessons in housekeeping and food responsibilities—including new methods for preparing and presenting the recently introduced foods (cooking by boiling in a recipient, use of cutlery, setting a table, etc.)—provided for native girls by the pastors’ wives and Catholic nuns across the Pacific islands (Pollock 1992). The Tahitian society was structured around the basic unit of the family, the household, which gave missionaries the illusion of recreating a perfectly Christian world—an endeavour simultaneously replicated by British ministers in Rapa. The internalisation of these new behaviour norms initially distanced the practices of the group of chiefs from the rest of the population, with the utensils accompanying these norms (cutlery, plates, glasses—but also tables and table etiquette) subsequently becoming widespread among the population as a whole via gifts and exchanges following the constellations of family alliances. The first radical change to the Polynesian food model therefore occurred with its progressive conversion to the European and Christian model, locating it within a more open understanding of the world of food and desacralising ancient prohibitions, in a mercantile context. The arrival of the French,Footnote 3 combined with a voluntaristic agricultural policy from the second half of the nineteenth century onwards, led to the introduction of speculative agriculture driven by global prices for tropical products: coconut oil (from the copra or kernel), cotton and vanilla in Tahiti, sugar cane and oranges in Tahiti and Rapa, and coffee in Rapa—which became the leading Polynesian coffee producer. The production of these export commodities required a substantial and cheap labour force made up of local people, who worked as and when they needed money, but also including islanders from elsewhere in the Pacific and, from 1865 onwards, Chinese workers some of whom decided to remain. The growing population from the French mainland required dedicated provisioning with European-style foods, hence the creation of Papeete’s communal market in 1850, supplied on a daily basis by Chinese market gardeners and by native farmers and fishers. As Chinese migrants were not permitted to acquire land or work in the civil service, from 1900 onwards, they gradually took control of most of the retail sector and a large portion of the wholesale sector, supplying Papeete with fresh produce via intensive market gardening operations on tenanted land. They became the Tahitians’ intermediaries with the monetary economy, mainly via the provision of credit facilities. At this point, there were two economies operating simultaneously: a monetary economy in Tahiti and the nearby settlements where the Europeans lived, the new centre of the French establishments in Oceania, and a subsistence economy in rural Polynesia—the districts and islands distant from Tahiti—with the Chinese trading community providing an economic point of contact between the two. Except in Papeete, the centre of the colonial trading-post economy, Polynesians still lived in village communities made up of extended families deriving their food resources primarily from subsistence consumption. Under the leadership of their traditional chiefs—some of whom were now district chiefs, while others had become pastors (or priests)—they continued the tradition of great reciprocal festivities, which had a triple significance: expressing cooperation within the community, competition between communities, and redistribution between chiefs and the people (Robineau 1985). Their surplus production was either bartered within the wider network of family relationships connecting the households or sold at Papeete market. From 1902 onwards, Rapa was in regular communication with Tahiti—a dozen times a year—and between 1903 and 1914, there was some discussion, during construction of the Panama Canal, of making Rapa the major French port in the Pacific. This project was abandoned, however. The port and naval base were finally built in Tahiti, and Rapa fell back into neglect: from the 1930s to the 1950s, the island was visited by just one ship per year, a trading schooner sent from Tahiti to exchange merchandise for coffee. In the 1960s, food production and preparation activities still represented a major component of daily life for Rapa’s inhabitants, retaining a strong symbolic significance (Hanson 1970). In the twentieth century, the changes introduced by the first Europeans and missionaries could be seen in the new basic foodstuffs—flour, sugar, dried vegetables, rice, tinned foods, etc.—available in neighbourhood stores in Tahiti, and in the orange and coffee now produced in Rapa alongside local foods. Food crop production supported virtually the whole population up until 1940, except in Papeete and the surrounding conurbation—a situation that even continued through to the 1970s in Rapa where fish and taro remained the main subsistence foods. The monetisation of trade accelerated when jobs were created by the phosphate mine in Makatea—jobs which gradually brought basic household goods into all Polynesian homes between its establishment in 1911 and the exhaustion of its deposits in the 1950s. By this time, the Polynesian food model had practically disappeared in Papeete and the monetary component of the food system was expanding even in the remote islands. Polynesian society became more widely integrated within the monetary economy with the creation of infrastructures for French nuclear tests between 1966 and 1996. This brought a move from a combined economy—subsistence production on the islands, export, and monetary economy in Tahiti—to an economy based on massive transfers of public funds and import-dependent over-consumption: since the 1960s, state funding has accounted for more than a quarter of Polynesian gross domestic product (Délégation aux Etats Généraux 2009). The Papeete conurbation grew substantially, its population more or less doubling between 1962 and 1971, mainly driven by inter-island migration. Total expenditure by the French army grew from 5% of the French Polynesia’s gross domestic product in 1962 to a high point of 76% in 1966, the year of the first nuclear test, steadily decreasing in subsequent years and stabilising at around 20% in the 1980s. At the same time, payment of civil servant salaries increased the influx of cash: the public sector’s share of the working population increased from 9% in 1956 to 35% in the 1980s. Since then, the burden of the territory’s civil service in its budget partly explains the high level of taxation, collected by its political institutions via a fiscal regime based on high indirect taxes (customs duties, VAT, etc.) levied on imported consumer goods. The massive increase of the public sector, pay hikes for national civil servants in the early 1960s (+ 84 to 108%, excluding allowances), and corresponding increases for local civil servants drove rapid growth in consumption and imports while traditional exports (copra, mother-of-pearl, vanilla, coffee) collapsed. The export/import coverage ratio decreased from 80% in the early 1960s to around 25% in the 1980, stagnating at around 10% in the 2000s–2010s. Since the early 1990s, on average, more than 80% of the food products consumed in French Polynesia have been imported. In the 1980s, per capita wealth became the highest of all the French overseas territories, comparable then to that of New Zealand. Yet, the “rentier economy” owing to the nuclear programme caused wage inflation and high prices, exacerbating economic inequalities, while an inflated growth in the tertiary sector was accompanied by a collapsing primary sector—decreasing in the official statistics from 40% of the labour force in the early 1960s to 4% from the 1980s onwards. Tahiti’s growing urbanisation and the rapid monetisation of Tahitian society radically altered local food habits: Tahitians turned to imported food products, which increasingly supplanted local products. Less expensive to buy than local products due to being mass produced, their constant availability in supermarkets and hypermarkets from the 1980s onwards ensured an abundant food supply, but one that had knock-on impacts in terms of the Tahitians’ economic dependency on the outside world (which steadily increased as the money economy grew), and food practices whose connections with health problems (obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease) are well documented. This process was much slower in Rapa: after the establishment of the first school and the weather station in the 1950s, the presence of army-related personnel lasted only from 1964 to 1972, although it did comprise up to a quarter of the island’s total population in this period. Regular contacts with the outside world brought supplies—leading to the dissemination of external goods and significant monetary circulation. The island created new infrastructures (construction of a whaling jetty in 1965 and a large ship wharf in 1970, which was enlarged in 2006); a shop opened to meet the needs of military personnel, supplied via maritime contacts with Tahiti; and a twice-yearly sea link was established to transport secondary school students. Yet even today, the majority of the local population still lives from subsistence production based on taro cultivation and fishing. In Tahiti, with the commercialisation of the economy, the use of subsistence production is a less common phenomenon today among the households surveyed, despite the presence of fruit trees and vegetable patches in the gardens of the people’s homes and proximity to the sea in all locations. The food of the past is perceived as having been freely available, but this way of providing for one’s needs (‘ohipa fa’apu) is generally devalued in comparison to waged work (‘ohipa moni). For many Polynesian men, subsistence production signified their ability to feed their family properly and offer gifts beyond the immediate household. It was the pillar of a self-esteem that no longer exists in the same form today. In consequence, a head of household lacking permanent employment and no longer having access to this kind of food supply—due to a lack of land or loss of interest—can feel redundant, purposeless, and confronted with a feeling of social shame, ha’a’ama, that plays an especially significant role in the Tahitian value system (Levy 1973). And the men view the growing of foods regarded as European (green beans, aubergines, tomatoes, etc.) in a different light to the cultivation of local “traditional” products: in general, it is the women who handle this kind of local, utilitarian production. The monetisation of Tahiti’s economy also led to a loosening of family ties, giving greater autonomy to the nuclear family unit (parents + children). Relations between descendants of the same parents are sometimes minimal in some families, either for personal reasons (wanting to spend time with the children in the evenings and at weekends) or due to the geographic distance between related households. The individualism of the urban consumer is increasingly replacing the multiple relationships of an eater embedded in wider family circles, and the sharing of resources is limited to exchanging prepared dishes and storing foods collectively in a community freezer. Official statistics for Tahiti from the 1980s onwards show a growing proportion of food purchases being made in supermarkets and independent neighbourhood stores. The levels vary in accordance with the distance from Papeete: subsistence consumption becomes more important further from the capital city. Monetary income level is another key variable here: low-income households within the urban conurbation and in semi-rural areas operate in multiple areas simultaneously (farming/fishing/craft production) and consume part of their production, while households without work, or with precarious work or a basic pension, often people originally from the remote islands, supplement gifts they receive, or their ownership of a garden and a few animals, with state aid and a basic provisioning of subsidised essentials: sugar and coffee, oil and flour, rice, corned beef and cans of processed meat, fish, etc. Rapa, meanwhile, has four food stores, each with a sales area of less than 50 m2, one of them a plywood kiosk. Only a very small number of people—all of them civil servants—have personal accounts here and pay at the end of the month; other purchasers pay cash, never for sums in excess of around 15 €. These shops exclusively stock the few products from outside the island that arrive on a combined passenger-cargo ship every two to three months. The only fresh produce on offer during the author’s stay was potatoes, carrots, and onions, plus a few oranges and apples; the stores ran out of carrots after a fortnight, the onions and potatoes sold out after three weeks, and the sugar after a month, while the small amount of fruit sold out on the same day. The shops on Rapa sell very little local produce, occasional lettuces, cabbages, or tomatoes, and once a month there are eggs from the only small-scale producer on the island; alcohol sales are banned on the island, while taro and the products of hunting, fishing, and gathering are not sold for money. Fuel supplies are vital to run the two large communal power generators that provide electricity to the hundred or so households on Rapa, purchased via prepaid cards sold at the town hall. Some individual consignments of sacks of flour, a barrel of fuel (“Thirty thousand [francs cfp] for a barrel, it’s expensive!”—equivalent to around 250 €) or crates of 12 l of beer are received with feverish excitement when the cargo ship arrives. The food resources available in French Polynesia today come from three different channels: monetary acquisition; state aid and transfers of public funds—as in subsidised products and food assistance for individuals and families; and finally, subsistence consumption. Their relative proportions vary according to the household’s socio-economic profile and its distance from the Tahiti urban area. Thus, monetary income accounts for the major portion of the food supply for Tahitian families, while subsistence consumption covers the greater part of the food supply for households on the island of Rapa (Serra Mallol 2013). Monetary incomes in French Polynesia are unequal and artificial: the result of over-remuneration in the public sector combined with a minimum wage that is lower than the minimum in the French mainland and lower levels of social protection—this inequality becoming increasingly pronounced closer to the urbanised areas (Herrera and Merceron 2010). This overseas territory remains the only French territory with no income tax for physical persons and with no minimum welfare, income, or unemployment benefits—a situation that exacerbates social and economic inequalities. Prices are high, estimated at between 40 and 80% above average French mainland prices for food, a differential that has been increasing since 2010 (ISPF 2016). Food expenditure remained high in 2016, representing 24.7% of the total budget of a Polynesian household, as compared with 14.3% on average on the French mainland; food costs remain the primary driver of local price inflation. The Austral archipelago has the lowest average household income in the whole of French Polynesia: in 2000, average monthly monetary income per household, including social benefits and income from capital, barely reached 1400 €—as compared with 3100 € for the territory as a whole and 3800 € for the Tahiti conurbation alone. Given the substantial size of households in the Austral Islands, if we look at average income per consumption unit this differential becomes greater still. In Rapa, these figures are even lower: average household income was around 1220 € in 2010 during our research field, while 33% of the households reported average monthly income lower than 670 €. On average, during the research period, 30% of the working-age residents were in waged employment, 29% of these in the public sector (the local administration is the island’s largest employer), 22% were in subsidised employment, while 48% were self-employed, 44% of these being farmers, fishers, and/or craft workers. Nearly half of the working-age people in employment in Rapa, therefore, described themselves as self-employed in that year, as compared with 20% in Tahiti and just 10% in mainland France (Délégation aux Etats Généraux 2009). One registered unemployed person in two is a high school pupil or a student, and the official unemployment rate (around 14%) is lower than across the Austral archipelago as a whole (around 23%), with an unemployment rate for men that is the lowest in the whole of French Polynesia. In Tahiti, the least wealthy families set a budget for their supermarket shop and the women keep track of their purchases as they go so as to control their expenditure. The total shop can cost between 150 € and 250 €, the shopping trolleys overflowing with crates containing several kilos of frozen meat or poultry, large bags of rice, frozen vegetables, and catering-sized packs of butter, oil, sugar, and mayonnaise. This big monthly supermarket shop is supplemented by more or less daily purchases in the small neighbourhood stores, mainly fulfilling immediate consumption needs: specific items needed for that day’s meal (a sauce, canned foods, instant coffee, a packet of rice) and snack foods (sweets, cakes and pastries, drinks). Expenditures are lower here than in the supermarket, always less than around 40 €, often below 20 €. Despite being less well stocked and often having higher prices, the small stores have the advantage not just of proximity but also of offering monthly credit facilities. Looking beyond the practical aspect and the range of foods available, food buying is always regarded as an indicator of status in Tahiti: an act that demonstrates possession of monetary resources, a sign of belonging to “modern” society—as distinct from the “old times” when people had to work the land and be content with eating the produce of land and sea (Serra Mallol 2010). These days, monetary dependency is regarded as more gratifying than dependence on working the land. Directly or indirectly, Polynesian households benefit from the cumulative impact of public fund transfers delivered via a range of different schemes and channels: European Union funding schemes for peripheral regions, state funding via planning agreements and the post-nuclear support programme, regional funding as the overseas territorial administration has its own funding capacity and its own administrative subdivisions, and finally, local schemes—either equalisation schemes of a classic nature or specific local arrangements (subsidised employment contracts, urgent medical and food assistance, social housing, etc.). In terms of healthcare provision, French Polynesia has a generous level of protection and cover following the 1995 introduction of Protection Sociale Généralisée (universal social protection): in 2007, 99% of the population were covered by this system (Délégation aux Etats Généraux 2009). As with social housing, the system is co-funded by the French state and the territorial authority, which has the administrative autonomy to offer the population a relatively large number of different kinds of support, even if these still remain inadequate: subsidised temporary work contracts, free provision of construction materials, subsidised inter-island transport, etc. These public funding flows represent a substantial addition to the households’ monetary incomes, but can also lead to political clientelism, as the funding sometimes circulates within well-established redistribution channels. With regard to food, there are very few social programmes in place, the sole exceptions being the tax exemption, since 1983, for certain products deemed “basic necessities”, many of them foodstuffs (the list, drawn up by the local council of ministers, is subject to some dispute and varies accordingly), as well as assistance in the form of food vouchers for the most disadvantaged households. This import- and consumption-focused policy favours the inflow of external products to the detriment of developing local production, which nonetheless clearly remains important in informal channels (gifts and exchanges, roadside vending). Some local administrations subsidise the provision of school meals, as in the Papeete conurbation and in Rapa; these subsidies are often supplemented by donations from local voluntary and community initiatives. As Rapa has no construction or civil engineering companies on the island, the administration uses subsidised territorial contracts for its various projects, mainly covering a one-month period, although they can last up to twelve months. The municipal council ensures that as many people as possible benefit from these contracts (of which 20 or so are granted each year) by rotating the families involved. Public funding in the form of subsidised contracts, the provision of low-cost social housing and subsidised construction, therefore represent an ongoing resource contribution for the majority of the Rapa population. The Polynesian society therefore remains highly unequal and dependent on the outside world, mainland France in particular, due to food acquisition habits that are largely monetised and consumption habits favouring imports: only one quarter of Polynesian agricultural land is properly cultivated today, and the food self-sufficiency level is barely 20%. The massive development that has taken place during the past half century has helped to create an economy of over-consumption and an inflated public sector, absent, in its extreme forms, in Rapa. Two very different approaches to food have been encountered, based on access to resources in each case. In Tahiti, food is experienced as a constraint, because it is monetised, with attention focused on price and quantity. In Rapa, by contrast, food is perceived as a source and guarantor of a form of autonomy—but also of the social bond, freedom, and at the same time a strong attachment to a land whose resources are shared. Tahiti’s food world has expanded substantially over the last forty years or so with the organisation and modernisation of its retail distribution system, which has opened up even further to imported products—imported mainly from within the Windward Islands. Yet, the convenience offered by these new products has led to the progressive neglect and the decline in the daily diet—chiefly in favour of rice—of plant foods which require a large input of labour either to grow them (taro, tubers) or to prepare them (‘uru and tubers). The same shift is observed in school canteens which socialise children around the dishes and produce they provide—which have been mainly European in type for the past 30 years or so (Serra Mallol 2010). It is increasingly difficult to obtain supplies of local products in Tahiti, due to their lack of availability in supermarket outlets. Yet, food provision, which can account for up to 50% of the available budget in the least wealthy households, is still supplemented by significant subsistence consumption—significant both in volume and in the variety of products it covers. This is true not just of producers themselves—a small group—but extends to include a much larger group of households via family ties: in today’s Tahiti, subsistence consumption is based on gifts and exchanges rather than on subsistence production, and the decision to consume traditional local products depends on the possibility of accessing their sources of production, either directly or via the intermediate family network. Adding together food expenditure and subsistence consumption, we estimate that around 30% of the average annual value of food consumed at home in the Society Islands is derived from subsistence consumption; this level is lower (22%) in the urban part of Tahiti, compared with 40% for the rest of the Society Islands. This kind of calculation of course has its limitations—but these levels of subsistence consumption are nonetheless much higher than those in mainland France, where the proportion is currently estimated at around 5%. Subsistence consumption therefore still represents an important source of food for around half of the Polynesian population—i.e. specifically for the indigenous Ma’ohi. This level of subsistence consumption increases as we move away from the Papeete conurbation—it stands at 85% in Rapa—but remains significant even within this urban area, testifying to its enduring importance in Tahitians’ diet and to the persistence of an inter-household exchange network which often extends beyond any specific neighbourhood, reaching out to other islands. When raw, unprocessed food products are sent from remote islands, for example, these are then distributed to siblings and friends. The receipt of this kind of gift, from the recipient’s island of origin, is freighted with a strong emotional significance which is not in any way commensurate with its strictly economic value: these foods are reputed to have a taste and a flavour different from those of the same foods purchased in shops. Gifts made for shared use in the family home “in the islands” (far from Tahiti) sometimes seem to have a strategic aspect to them, too: a kind of manoeuvre designed to secure sympathy from the rest of the family based there, staking a claim in the complex web of family land ownership claims. Claude Robineau (1985) highlighted the various forms of mutual assistance available within Tahitian village communities: arofa, tauturu, and prestige. This author also found these characteristic relationship modes still in evidence in relation to food (Serra Mallol 2010). The first, arofa, is mutual assistance based on a feeling of love or compassion, via the provision of foods or a daily meal for close relations. Providing accommodation—equated in Tahiti with the fact of feeding someone (fa’a’amu’a), often a member of the wider family—is also part of this feeling of arofa: hospitality, “nourishment”, is not refused even to distant family members, at least for a time. If the person taken in is regarded as adult dependent, a minor, a student, or vulnerable, they are fed and housed and become part of the family. Tauturu is material assistance through the provision of goods and services, by making a plot of land available for cultivation, for example, or giving one’s own time for an activity or project (‘ohipa tauturu, work assistance); or by giving money, especially to the parish (moni tauturu, financial assistance). The relation of prestige was more evident in the past, as when the owner of a large fishing net traditionally asked the population to contribute to preparations for a joint fishing expedition; making fruit-growing land available to local canteens can be included in this category, as can the gift of land to a penniless young household. Economic factors may underpin relationships in the Society archipelago today, but this does not prevent the existence of relationships based on family ties, and thus involving attachment to a particular land, and on community, which can be seen in the level and intensity of non-monetary food provision. Subsistence food consumption remains important today—even in the most urbanised areas of French Polynesia. The key point of difference between the Tahitian society and the Rapan society is that the latter has decreed food resources—of both land and sea—to be collective property. In the nineteenth century, the land was managed collectively: at the level of the family group by a chief and at island level by the To’ohitu or “council of seven”, a traditional council formed of representatives from each of the seven major ancestral groups on the island (Stokes 1930). This council is believed to have been established following the land redistribution undertaken in 1887, the year when French Civil Code provisions on land tenure were applied to the rest of Polynesia. In 1912, Caillot (1932) noted that “all the natives are currently sole owners of all the lands on the island”: today, Rapa remains a settlement within French Polynesia where the administration has not implemented a system of land registration. For the people of Rapa, land has no material value in itself: only its amenities and developments have material value, in particular, those undertaken for the subsistence cultivation of taro. Even back in 1960s, Hanson (1970) reported that Rapa’s co-owners were relatively unconcerned about land on its own count, considering that “the land belongs to everyone”. In the end, the Rapans institutionalised this situation with an administrative act that re-established the To’ohitu in 1984, making the land of Rapa collective property, owned by all the Rapa people. All those of Rapan descent are therefore guaranteed access to land on the island where they can build a house, grow taro and other vegetables and fish, in order to feed their family. The To’ohitu is composed of ti’a’au, “custodians of the land”, appointed for life by the members of the major family groups on the island (groups which are less clearly distinct today); today, the holders of this title, who can be male or female, sit on a council whose membership is renewed every five years.Footnote 4 This council has established collective ownership of the land and its aim is to “ensure that no registry of land is undertaken, that no person can hold title to property, that no rental of land can be undertaken, that no reservation of land can be undertaken and that no sale transaction is accepted” (internal regulations 2002 p. 2). Recognised by the French administration simply as a “citizens’ association”, the To’ohitu has the power not of physical enforcement but of a moral injunction. Anyone who contravenes the established rules will therefore “be sanctioned by the council of elders. If they do not respect the sanction they will be judged by the population” (articles 24 and 25) and therefore exposed to public disgrace, ha’a’ama, a powerful feeling but not always sufficient to deter some behaviours contrary to the collective interest—such as night fishing in the prohibited area or the appropriation of a taro plantation recently neglected by its designated “manager”. The management of the sea area within Rapa’s territorial waters is overseen by a dedicated rahui committee comprised of fishers elected annually by their peers. This committee supervises the observance of the general ban on net fishing, creel fishing, night fishing, and the use of a toxic plant-based substance (hora), along with observance of the rahui (a ban sanctified by the pastor) imposed across the whole eastern side of the island for two nautical miles out to sea. All fishing in this area—by night or by day—is prohibited all year round except for two days when the rahui is publicly and ritually lifted by decision of the committee: one in October, solely for catching lobster (for use as bait in the traditional method of stone fishing and as a special dish to honour distinguished visitors today), plus a second day for general fishing in mid-December when children attending school away from the island have returned home, in order to prepare family and community festive meals for the holiday season. On ordinary days, the main meal is the midday meal of taro (sometimes replaced by rice) and fish, after the work in the fields is done; as in the rest of Polynesia (Serra Mallol 2010), the evening meal is just a snack—hot coffee and bread or taro (which plays the role of bread in Rapan meals). The food’s festive aspect comes to the fore in the family, religious, and community events that punctuate daily life in the two villages, actively involving all community members in preparations for the meal. The preparations are organised in advance, with everyone undertaking one or more tasks according to community’s needs, and food production activities are always segregated by gender: the women make bread, prepare the popoi (a paste made from taro) and cook; the men fish and bring the beef and goat meat. The community meals—at which festive dress is worn—are preceded by speeches and prayers. Rapa has undergone significant changes, modifying the structure and organisation of its ancient society. Yet nonetheless, there is still a strong feeling of identity and unity, preserved both by the island’s physical isolation and by the desire for a lifestyle that remains largely self-sufficient and community-based, in its daily routines and above all in its festivities. Rapa represents for Tahiti what Tahiti represents for the West: a myth of paradise and abundance. In Rapa, subsistence consumption activities allow a degree of control over the food supply. The circular nature of subsistence consumption fosters the creation and maintenance of social bonds, while the active aspect of providing for one’s own needs restores meaning to food and the whole of the food system. Economic and social inequalities are on the rise in French Polynesia, and the fiscal and social system put in place is proving inadequate, indeed even detrimental to the least wealthy, the population living as ma’ohi. In contrast to the feeling of impotence and injustice now experienced by Tahitians, and the many disputes arising from joint ownership of land, the people of Rapa feel relative control over their access to natural resources and the satisfaction of being an exception in a globalised world they know today through television. If Tahiti symbolises an earthly paradise for Westerners, the same is all the more true of Rapa: in Tahiti, Rapa is seen as the archetype of the Polynesian island, living in community conditions which remain traditional, symbolising the food independence closest to the ideological ideal of the ma’ohi discourse. This “paradise” discourse was picked up by some missionaries and perpetuated all through the nineteenth century (Fer and Malogne-Fer 2000), portraying the Rapans as custodians of a lost, remote land chosen by God, earthly cherubs of a doomed culture that must be defended at all costs. Defended from the outside world and its harmful influences, hence, the To’ohitu’s refusal to release land to build an airport on the island in 1996—despite some support for the idea in a popular consultation or the fears expressed about plans to set up an inter-island shuttle service to transport goods and travellers within the Austral archipelago. Defended from strangers, non-Rapans, because moving to the island depends on one vital, decisive pre-condition: having Rapan ancestry. Defended, too, from what is experienced as acculturation, the intrusion of an external lifestyle with the potential to supplant local customs and habits, hence the return of the Rapan language for public meetings and municipal information purposes rather than the reo ma’ohi language that missionaries used to spread the Bible message. Defended, finally, in its very substance, on land and sea, by the use of prohibitions, rahui, and the refusal to deploy products regarded as dangerous in their use of these resources: weed killers, insecticides and chemical fertilisers for agriculture, non-sustainable techniques in fishing. Whenever the Rapa say “here is paradise”, it is by comparison with Tahiti and the reference is always to the latter’s disadvantage, just as the present is inferior to the mythicised past in local discourse. Rapans point to the low level of monetisation in the local economy, the mutual support, and the fact that unemployment cannot happen here. While this way of seeing things may reflect the internalisation of an Edenic discourse, it is important not to underestimate the sheer hard work involved in subsistence production. Making a batch of bread takes five to six hours, from getting the wood and tending the fire until the embers are hot enough, while simultaneously preparing the dough, through to baking the bread, sometimes in very smoky conditions. Working in the taro plantations is physically demanding, with sticky mud up to calf level and a backbreaking stooping posture—like work in the rice fields. And fishing trips in the heavy swell can cause seasickness even among experienced sailors who must nevertheless go on with their task. The work of providing food is undertaken collectively, bringing together members of different families to undertake the same tasks described by Hanson (1970): planting mikaka taro, harvesting coffee, and gathering wood, as well as fishing, hunting, and food gathering. The fruits of this labour are then shared among the various members of the families who were involved or represented in the tasks. Subsistence production provides the guarantee of a daily livelihood that is mainly achieved through monetary resources on the other islands. This gives the Rapans a feeling of collectively controlling their own lives and of pride in this—“we don’t need money to live here” is a comment heard on a regular basis. This observable propensity to well-being among the Rapan people is largely derived from the way they analyse and interpret their daily experiences, especially the experience of subsistence production and exchange within the context of expanded domestic production. This commitment to shared management and to collective and integrative, circular values over individualistic, differentiating values, can also be seen at communal level, in the political sphere. For the last 30 years, for example, it has been the custom for the mayor to organise twice-yearly public meetings, held on 14 July and 1 January on the square in front of the town hall—a kind of Polynesian agora which gathers together all Rapans present on the island on the day of the meeting. Non-Rapans are also invited to attend as observers. Everyone’s opinion is respected, at least in its expression: everyone who talks is allowed to say their piece without interruption, even if their speech is a long one. Replies are made not directly to the person who just spoke but to the members of the administration and the To’ohitu opposite, or to the whole gathering, and humour is welcomed—indeed arguably indispensable. These meetings, held in the Rapan language, are an opportunity for the mayor to present and gain approval for his projects and to gather the views of the population on issues that need to be decided by the municipal council. For the people, they represent an opportunity to keep abreast of the various projects and to show their involvement by participating in the uninterrupted debate on community business, while also settling any differences they may have in the public arena. In the 1960s, Hanson wrote that, while the Rapans had an abundant food supply, “Most of their economic activities by far [were] devoted to the food quest” given the time it took to get to the taro plantations and to the fishing areas out at sea. Today, the availability of motorised vehicles (cars, motor boats)—even though the island’s various taro plantations are located where motorised access is difficult or even impossible—and above all the more or less general ownership of domestic freezers, means that food provisioning tasks are less frequent than fifty years ago. Food, though, remains a subject of constant concern and discussion and still possesses the same “symbolic content. Food is their measure of happiness and security, of friendship and hospitality” (Hanson 1970). This contentment derives, firstly, from being able to access food in abundance (“here, everyone can feed their family, they only have to bend down”) and always being able to serve excessive amounts to their guests. Among the questions people ask each other when they meet on Rapa is “What have you eaten?”or “What are you going to eat?” It is the contentment, above all, of getting together and eating in groups (Serra Mallol 2010), opportunities to do so being frequent on Rapa, as reported by Hanson (1970), Rapans claim that “food tastes better when many people eat together.” Then, there is the contentment that comes from security: there is never any need to go without food, and all the freezers in Rapan households are filled with fish, beef, and goat meat, so much so that the Rapans have taken to using the communal cold storage facility to store their surplus food, for giving or exchanging with family and friends beyond Rapa via cargo shipments (Serra Mallol 2013). And while the risks of food insecurity are not entirely unavoidable—a notable example being ciguatera fish poisoning, affecting some of the fish Rapans most like to eat on a daily basis, which has made dozens of people ill since 2009—overall food security, in terms of both quantity and quality, is ensured and comes with a strong social and cultural component, too. Friendship and hospitality, because the contentment of eating is not only just about the food itself—the fish, the succulent meat, as much taro as they can eat—but also and above all about eating it in the company of family or friends. Rapa is the only island in French Polynesia where the author has heard the traditional greeting Haere mai e tama’a (“Welcome to eat”) genuinely offered to a passer-by from a nearby house: the invitation to eat is a constant here, whenever you are in the presence of someone eating or about to eat, and the person greeted in this manner sometimes accepts the invitation, for the pleasure of sharing. Food provision activities are not regarded as work by the Rapans themselves, but as necessary and engaging social activities, operating not within “time that is abstract, void of content and measured with increasing stringency” but within “time that is experienced, that of daily life, non-uniform, variable and concrete” (Thoemmes 2008). These activities bring rules into play calling for specific expertise or technical skills that are constantly evolving through experience, empowering the individual with a feeling of potential control. They demand a certain amount of effort to achieve a goal that is fixed but attainable and facilitate concentration and involvement in the activity itself. The objectives pursued on a day-to-day basis do not depend on normative temporal models imposed from outside but are developed by each individual within the activity: time becomes what the activity produces in the act of production itself (Bourdieu 1994). Achieving these objectives depends solely on the individual (“little by little”), on the weather conditions or on the will of the gods. Working the land or fishing, or making popoi, for example, are engaging activities with a subjective time experience very different from the dominant Tahitian experience of time. They enable the people undertaking them to have a global vision of the activity, its preparation and its end product, even if the latter is time delayed (as in harvesting taro), because the activity itself—clearing the ground, turning over the soil, creating the irrigation system, planting cuttings, weeding, etc.—is purposeful in its own right and therefore returns an immediate sense of accomplishment. They give meaning to existence, enabling the Rapans to feed themselves, feed their family, and offer gifts to others, while being part of a community network of gifts and exchanges with its own specific social timescales; and they give a sense of continuity, connecting present-day Rapans with their predecessors who undertook the same kind of activity in the past. They provide a certain satisfaction to those who undertake them, immersed in the activity without any awareness of time passing, forgetting themselves and the fatigue of physical work in the collective rhythm of the activity, which is sometimes accompanied by singing or laughter. In this respect, they are the opposite of activities such as office work or a position as a labourer in a Tahitian business: they are neither alienating nor a source of frustration and the process of accomplishing them is reassuring in its familiarity. Unlike consumption, that is a source of anxiety and inequality, the voluntary activity of subsistence food consumption restores meaning not just to food itself but also to the food system and the social context as a whole. It provides the community with food that they choose, share, produce, and process together, following re-appropriated timescales and production methods, food that is freely exchanged within a community with a shared sense of purpose and direction, and which aims to preserve this capability for future generations.",4

The notion of what is natural is used as an entry point to question eaters’ views about food production processes and their marketing and distribution channels as well as the choices they make when buying food supplies for the home. Research focusing on food consumption as part of special dietary regimens has shown the close link made by eaters between the idea of naturalness and their eating practices (Ossipow 1997; Ouedraogo 1998; César 1999). It demonstrates how their choices between different retail outlets are based on the guarantees of naturalness offered by alternative and specialized food producers, while the appreciation of naturalness may vary according to a whole set of criteria based on the size of the production/marketing channels, farming methods and conditions of production, or a respect for seasonality. For consumers who do not subscribe to these particular food requirements, the question of naturalness in food has become increasingly important over the past two decades. This can be measured by the dietary guidelines and marketing discourse addressed to them (Lepiller 2012a) as well as by their eating patterns, which involve greater reflexivity about the ways food is produced, in a concern to respect its naturalness (Wier et al. 2003; Lamine 2007; Roininen et al. 2006). No specific study has yet been made which would cast light on the concept of what is natural from the viewpoint of these eaters—the way they envisage naturalness and adapt their shopping accordingly—and this is the focus of our research. In studying this relationship, I shall show how decisions about food are made by French and Israeli consumers, based on not only what for them constitutes naturalness in food but also what is the opposite of it. The population studied is made up of those I shall here refer to as “ordinary eaters.” Far from being a homogenous category, it brings together all those who do not claim to have “personal dietary requirements” (Fischler 2015). These eaters come from a variety of social backgrounds and their food-shopping habits do not tend towards exclusivity in their choice of producers—the buying processes may be eclectic among individuals, who opt as much for conventional as for alternative producers. Although their everyday diet does not involve practices of “ethical consumerism” (Dubuisson-Quellier 2013), taking precautions of a dietary, health, ethical, or environmental nature is not absent from the choices they enact and the judgments they make. Their attitudes towards consumption are obviously part of the tendency to moralize food that is currently being experienced in Western societies—the practices espoused by this trend being prone to intensify discourses relating to self-governance (Coveney 2006). The fieldwork was based on data gathered as part of an international comparison between France and IsraelFootnote 1—the advantage of this comparison being that the two countries presented both similarities and differences which were instructive for research into food consumption. What they had in common was their agro-industrial type of production systems, their level of economic development, and, last but not least, shared features in their food models (structuring of daily meal times, table behavior, and a shared repertory of certain commonly eaten products). The differences opposing the two countries were their very distinct climates and production environments, which in practice resulted in different relationships between humans and their natural environment. The size of the territories, as well as their economic and political relationships with neighboring countries, also presented marked differences. Finally, the strong and omnipresent influence of religion in Israel, both in the food on offer and in the organization of certain modes of consumption, distinguished it from France, where religious influence is weak and more present in terms of cultural heritage. These similarities and differences will be dealt with throughout this article and, in some cases, analyzed to show how the association between naturalness and food shows a certain number of constants among the people studied; while at the same time, variations can be seen in the processes by which they categorize natural food and the relationship this has to methods of food buying—processes which are socially, culturally, and geographically embedded. The research is based on a qualitative type of survey conducted through semi-structured interviews with “ordinary eaters.” The first phase of the survey was conducted in France in 2014 (N = 26) and the second in Israel in 2015 (N = 15). Since Israel was previously a little-known country, an immersion period of 2 months was added to enable me to understand its food model. The population studied was made up solely of Israeli Jews residing in urban areas, and most of my interlocutors described themselves as hilonim, or secular Jews. The remainder of my respondents called themselves massortim (practicing Jews who observed tradition and Jewish law but whose commitment was not as great as that of the orthodox and ultra-orthodox). A homogenous population was chosen in Israel, with a view to gaining the best possible knowledge of a particular type of population in the time allowed for the survey, and also to avoid dealing with multiple, disparate data; this would have been interesting from a monographic point of view but would make comparison with France difficult. Detailed research methodology French territory Israeli territory The qualitative survey in France was conducted over three types of areas so as to bring out the contrasts between urban and rural environments. Three geographical areas were chosen for the French study: a metropolis represented by the national capital (Paris), a large city with a departmental prefecture (Nancy in Lorraine), and rural communes (in Lorraine) of under 2000 inhabitants, situated beyond a town’s sphere of influence (cf: INSEE nomenclature). Nine interviews were in Paris, eight in Nancy, and nine in rural areas. The proportion of women to men was equal and the respondents were uniformly divided between three types of social background (working, middle, and privileged classes) so that it would be a meaningful criterion when analyzed. To avoid increasing the points of comparison, the qualitative survey in Israel was limited to urban environments. Two types of areas were singled out: metropolitan areas that were important economic and cultural centers (Tel Aviv and Jerusalem) and mid-sized urban areas comprising three towns with populations of between 80,000 and 200,000 inhabitants (Rehovot, Herzliya, and Ashdod). Nine interviews were conducted in the metropolitan areas and six in the mid-sized urban areas. The proportion of women to men was equal and the respondents were from the middle or privileged classes of the population. This last factor was taken into account when analyzing the data. Following a brief review of the existing social science research dealing with the subject of natural foods, this article aims to question the general views of eaters on what is natural and to understand the logic by which “ordinary eaters” class a food as natural. This will be based on the following questions: what types of foods are associated with naturalness? What elements are perceived as strong indicators of naturalness? Are these more related to the result of human intervention or to pre-existing food categories? In both cases, how are the values accorded to foods graded so that some are closer to the “natural” end of the spectrum and others further away or even at the opposite end? These perceptions will be looked at with respect to the eaters’ shopping practices but also, more broadly, examined with respect to their relationship with the different food-sourcing possibilities.",2

Here, we use a practice theory-based approach and look at different levels of food practices (meanings, material, and skills) to understand how they facilitate or impede the development of more sustainable eating. The different configurations of these three levels observed in a qualitative study allow us to identify four patterns of food practices, relying notably on shopping and cooking. From those patterns emerge a variety of routes to sustainability, corresponding to different ways of thinking about sustainable food (considering aspects such as eating local, organic or seasonal products, and avoiding food waste). We also highlight the importance of household characteristics in their adoption of particular patterns and show the impact of social or biographical context on the switch from one pattern to another.",14

According to the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children’s Fund (2017), 844 million people still lack a basic drinking water service, including 159 million people who rely on surface water to meet their daily drinking-water needs. A way to enable individuals to cope with the poor water quality is the use of various avoidance methods. The most promising and accessible avoidance methods are filtration with ceramic filters, chlorination and solar disinfection by the combined action of UV rays and heat (World Health Organization 2012). Generally, several avoidance methods may be combined; for instance, when water is turbid (not clear or contains visible particles), it must first be clarified before being disinfected (chemical disinfection, solar disinfection, boiling) (Cotruvo and Sobsey 2006). Many studies have found that point-of-use water treatment (that is, water purification at the point of consumption) has a significant effect on both water quality and the reduction in the occurrence of waterborne diseases. The systematic reviews of Speich et al. (2016) and Wolf et al. (2014) support these results. Zin et al. (2013) concluded in their review that promoting household water treatment is most essential in preventing diarrhoea and in reducing the number of deaths caused by it among patients. Moreover, studies suggest that home treatment as compared to source or storage improvements provides the most effective method of ensuring the consumption of clean drinking water (Brick et al. 2004; Fewtrell et al. 2005). Despite the effectiveness of home water treatment methods, this practice is not yet widespread in Cameroon. According to the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) and ICF International (2012), about 87% of the population do not have the habit of treating water at home. This rate is 76% in Douala and Yaoundé, the two biggest cities of the country that face serious problems of water quality and supply. The consequence of this low water treatment is that, although 71% of households in Cameroon (91% of urban households and 98.6% of households in Douala and Yaoundé) consume water from an improved source (NIS and ICF International 2012), the country regularly faces outbreaks of waterborne diseases, such as the cholera outbreak of 2004 which started from an unprotected well at the Bépanda neighbourhood in Douala and affected more than 7000 individuals causing 130 deaths (Assako Assako et al. 2005). Also, there was another cholera outbreak in May 2010 which affected all the regions of the country and caused several hundreds of deaths. These cholera outbreaks reflect the poor quality of water that people drink. For instance, a research conducted in the neighbourhood of Mvog Betsi in Yaoundé by Nnanga et al. (2014) shows that most of the inhabitants drink water from wells, boreholes or springs and almost all these sources are polluted with Escherichia coli. Another study by Djuikom et al. (2009) conducted in Douala on a water sample from wells shows that the water contains numerous pathogenic bacteria, faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci. Looking at the huge investments needed to provide safe drinking water to all, it is clear that a large proportion of the world’s population will still have to go for a long time with no access to improved water supply, hence the need for averting actions to cope with poor water quality. It is therefore imperative to understand the factors that may explain household averting behaviours. The objective of this study is to analyse the determinants of households’ avoidance behaviour to cope with unsafe drinking water in the cities of Douala and Yaoundé in Cameroon. The literature on the determinants of households’ avoidance behaviour is quite extensive. However, no research has addressed the influence of households’ opinion on the effectiveness of avoidance methods in terms of water quality improvement. Indeed, in most existing studies, only the characteristics of individuals/households are often handled, while the characteristics of the avoidance methods are omitted. The main contribution of this study is to test the effects of perceived efficiency of avoidance methods on water averting behaviours. Our findings suggest that the probability of adopting a given avoidance method significantly increases with its efficiency and decreases with its cost of adoption. The findings also suggest the significant effects of wealth, education, gender and the presence of children on avoidance behaviours. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 presents the literature review, Sect. 3 covers the methodology, Sect. 4 presents the results of the empirical analysis discussed in Sect. 5, and Sect. 6 is the conclusion.",5

At the same time, there is emerging evidence that local communities are already grappling with the adverse effects of climate change and variability. Research on adaptation by local communities is increasingly becoming critical, yet it remains insufficient and fragmented. As such, this paper specifically outlines farmers concerns regarding changes in climate variability, describes their adaptive strategies and analyses the structures, processes and conditions underlining these. Theoretically, the paper is underpinned by the sociological theory of Margaret Archer. The idea is to develop and extend an analysis of climate variability, and the processes underpinning adaptation. This is done from a backdrop of an almost non-existent sociology of climate change generally in Zimbabwe. Methodologically, this article derives from a broader empirical research on adaptation to climate variability conducted in Mutoko District in the eastern part of Zimbabwe. The research work was premised on the historical timeline 1992–2014; the temporal dimension was important specifically because livelihood decisions occur within specific historical and agro-ecological conditions. Empirically, the research used an exploratory case study approach and qualitative methods to collect data from smallholder farmers. Regarding data collection, the life history interview was used as the primary data collection method because it privileges the narration of personal biographies by research participants. The whole idea was to undertake research that articulated nuances on contextualised farmers’ experiences of changes in climate, and narratives on responding to that particular change. Therefore, a qualitative approach certainly provided a different window on the study of processes of climatic and livelihood change by drawing attention to local farmers’ interpretations and understandings. Based on such, a small survey was conducted with 60 farmers paying attention to the timeframe of the study. The survey primarily provided an entry point for selecting households for qualitative, detailed life history interviews. The analysis of adaptation processes in this article is confined to the morphogenetic theory on structure and agency formulated by the critical realist Margaret Archer. Her sociological theory has hardly been used in climate change adaptation research (Davidson 2012) despite its sociological significance and appeal. The theory is applicable when attempting to understand how risks from climate change and variability are construed, negotiated and managed in highly dynamic contexts. What is more appealing is Archer’s notion of reflexivity, if one wants to unpack how people (such as farmers) understand climatic changes and formulate responses to them. As defined by Archer (2007:5), reflexivity is ‘the means by which people consciously develop and implement personal projects according to their individually-defined values and concerns, given their situation’. Her philosophy is that without reflexivity, there is no society. We therefore see that divergences in people’s trajectories through life derive from human reflexivity, a faculty which is accomplished through internal conversations (Archer 2010). This way people ceaselessly contemplate their situations and redefine their interests and life projects. This brings attention to the deepening of contextual discontinuities in the contemporary world. Archer (1982) emphasises rupture and transformation (morphogenesis instead of a morphostatic condition marked by stability and continuity). These discontinuities pertain to the presence of ‘excess’. This simply means that there is no longer an abiding and lasting fit between habitual and routinised activities and social conditions and context (in the sense articulated by Pierre Bourdieu). This promotes greater prospects for human reflexivity irreducible to what exists. In a world characterised by complex risks, these cannot be negotiated through the realms of embodied knowledge and conventional practices alone. We therefore find new reflections, framings and practices, as peoples map a way in this world through innovative and adaptive forms of agency irreducible to the past or the present status quo (Chalari 2012). Compared to the scope and innovativeness of Archer’s structure-agency (morphogenetic) theory, its scant application in climate change adaptation research is striking. Thus, the strength of Archer’s theory is clear in that ‘she has positioned herself critically vis-a-vis substantive theories that reduce social structures to the aggregate effects of individuals, reduce individuals to the position of bearers of structural relations, and collapse the distinction between social structures and agents’ (Lopez 2009:173). Her theory is therefore one which is capable of linking structure, culture and agency in a nuanced and non-reductionist manner. More so, Archer’s approach privileges narrative history as the paradigmatic form of explanation with a focus on the specificities of both time and place (Porpora 2013). As such, the analysis of adaptation to climate variability by subsistence farmers in Zimbabwe cannot be frozen in time. And, the particularities of the spatial location and processes within which the research site is embedded also become crucial. In this light, Archer’s theory allows for a cross-scale analysis of adaptation. Confronted by nascent morphogenesis (increasing climatic variability), small-holder farmers deploy agential reflexivity. They are able to reflexively make sense of and evaluate their circumstances and create adaptive strategies in view of what matters to them most (Bhatasara 2017). Specifically, Archer’s notion of the internal conversation strongly establishes and gives personal powers to the agential or individual subject (farmers in Mutoko) in relation to their aims and aspirations (ibid).Through their internal conversations, and alongside their personal circumstances and goals, farmers deliberate and then, using reason, intentionally commit themselves to particular courses of action that they deem worthwhile (Bhatasara 2017). In some way then, adaptation to climate variability is about de-routinisation as an essential condition of existence in which subjects typically re-evaluate modus vivendi and prevailing social arrangements (Archer 2010). Having said the above, the next section briefly outlines the broader trends on climate change, and its impacts particularly on agriculture in Zimbabwe. This is followed by a localised discussion on how climate variability is manifesting in rural, marginal ecological regions in the country. The discussion puts emphasis on rainfall which is increasingly becoming more variable. The questions which are driving this article (how are farmers adapting and what structures, processes and condition underpin adaptation as a complex process?) are answered in the last two sections. The sociological theory of Margaret Archer is used to develop various arguments.",10

In the Falklands, unsolved political issues and slowdowns in oil and gas developments after the 2010–2012 exploration boost further complicate the situation, with plans being put on hold following oil price drops in 2014–2015. Fisheries represent by far the most relevant source of local government revenues. In 2011, world market shares for Loligo squid and toothfish from the Falkland Islands amounted to nearly 13 and 8%, respectively. This is a substantial achievement, in view of the size of the Islands’ economy, with a small number of economic activities (besides fishing and hydrocarbons, mainly sheep farming and tourism) and a population of less than 3000 residents excluding military personnel (Policy Unit (PU) 2015). As for fishing activities other than Loligo, finfish catches, particularly of southern hake and rockcod, have had a relevant role in fish exports and are regarded to have a scope for further expansion also in view of climate changes. Based on climate change simulations of marine ecosystem-based models, by 2030, the productivity of capture fish production from some seas around high-latitude regions (Greenland, Iceland) and/or at the confluence of cold and warm oceanic streams (Falklands) will increase by 9%, relative to baseline scenario projections (World Bank 2013). Besides supply side determinants, fish price dynamics is likely to benefit from increasing demand, fostered by economic and demographic changes such as urbanisation, particularly in Asia (Kobayashi et al. 2015). However, except for Illex squid (Appendix 1), fish exports from the Falklands almost exclusively target Spanish ports. Spain is the largest importer of fish and fishery products in Europe, and the fourth largest in the world, behind the USA, Japan and China. Moreover, it is the main European consumer market and port-of-entry for—fresh and frozen—hake and seafood as a whole (Fraser 2015; Nielsen et al. 2009). Seasonality and economic shocks can affect the magnitude and levels of substitutability among fishery products, such as demand shifts from high- to lower-value species. Demand- and supply-related factors are especially relevant for fish sales such as hake, given their role in signalling price changes for other species (Johnston 2007; Floros and Failler 2004). An analysis of the above factors can help better understand developments and viability of a fishery and the possible impact of changing fishing efficiency on export price determination for a small open economy. In the Falkland Islands, in 2005, a new legislation was laid out (effective since 2009–2010), with allocations of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) over an initial 25-year period—until 2031. Regulations on transferable rights concern total allowable catch (TAC, for toothfish) and total allowable effort (TAE, for finfish and squid species, except for jig-caught Illex—exempted so far due to wide shifts in annual stock levels, although consultations are currently underway). The new regime has striven to promote greater competitiveness, efficiency and diversification in the sector. A relevant policy issue for the Falklands—and indirectly for other fishery-dependent economies with small domestic markets—is to assess to what extent this enhanced regulatory environment for fishery sustainability has improved fishing efficiency across the vessels and companies involved. Moreover, a related question concerns whether the thus envisaged increased efficiency, by allowing better focus on fish quality and standards (as argued in support of ITQs: Sanchirico and Newell 2003), has influenced the price performance of Falkland fish exports. A major objective of the new regime is to strengthen the capacity of local fishing companies and their ability to benefit from vertically integrated operations of joint-venture associates, with a progressive development of more value-added activities, including processing, transhipment and marketing (Harte and Barton 2007). This analysis is a first study of its kind for the Falkland Islands, and for the reasons explained above, it focuses on finfish fisheries, especially hake and rockcod. The study starts by estimating inefficiencies of finfish fishing vessels operating in the Islands, based on 2008–2016 panel data of southern hake catches. Subsequently, along with prices and sales of other Falkland finfish and major South Atlantic hake suppliers, average vessel technical inefficiency estimates serve as a partial proxy of ‘residual’ factors in regressions of hake prices for Falkland finfish sold at Spanish ports. Relative to demand-side factors, the last part—and third aim—of the analysis examines the hake value chain in the Spanish market. Even though these issues are analysed often separately, greater flexibility and efficiency in the production process can pave the way to improved storage, distribution and marketing of fish products, particularly in the presence of increasingly integrated global markets and more diversified value chains (Felix 2012; van Anrooy 2003). The remainder of the paper develops as follows. Section 2 highlights evidence on finfish and similar product markets in other countries, relative to vertical, horizontal and indirect price transmission and puts forward hypotheses for the Falklands.Footnote 1 Section 3 introduces a stochastic production frontier model accounting for fishing skipper skills and its interactions with input use, followed by an operational framework for testing long-run equilibrium in main import and consumer markets (from the viewpoint of a small fishery-dependent economy) and threshold autoregressive (TAR) models geared to test for asymmetric price transmission (APT). Section 4 presents and discusses data and econometric estimates for the goals of the study, and Sect. 5 draws concluding remarks.",

Based on this observation of households’ contribution to GGE, a number of associations and public organisations (Kim & Neff, op. cit.; Rousseaux 2010; Granchamp and Rudolf 2009; Szuba 2009) have developed measuring devices that allow individuals and households to picture more or less precisely the effects of their consumption on the climate. The central idea of these “carbon calculators” is that a better understanding of the impact of food practices on the climate would facilitate the adoption of new habits and practices. This idea of measuring has seduced local authorities who see it as a way for households to appropriate the objectives to reduce GGE defined on both a national level and within the framework of international agreements. They also seduce “concerned” individuals seeking the means to grasp this global issue personally (Granchamp 2015, 2016). Later in this paper, we examine the issue from the perspective of households who use this type of calculator, and analyse how they perceive and react to its prescriptions with regard to food. Among the various aspects of everyday life in which public policy and households seek to reduce their GGE, food is unique in that it is an unavoidable form of consumption, marked by huge variability, and because it is not cancelled out by long-term investments (unlike energy or even transport, at least on a scale for consumers), this lends it greater malleability. However, the perspective of households is never taken into consideration in studies of the different types of calculator (Shirley et al. 2012; Kim and Neff 2009; Druckman and Jackson 2009; Gill and Moeller 2018), whether this involves calculating carbon footprints or more specifically, the food footprint (Kim & Neff, op. cit.; Baysse-Lainé 2017)Footnote 1; we thus considered it necessary to assess their reception and utility in promoting the “ecologisation” or greening of practices (Spaargaren et al., 2012). We based our study on the results of a qualitative survey conducted as part of an experiment carried out between 2010 and 2011 by a local French authority, the Northern Vosges Regional Natural Park. It asked households living in its area to carry out a series of consumption measurements using a Carbon Footprint Calculation.Footnote 2 A few months after the experiment ended, we met some of the participating households (16 out of 32) and recorded their point of view about the approach and the changes of practices it had led to. We focus on the food section, and observe the extent to which they adhere, take into account or, on the contrary, reject the three main prescriptions—eating less meat and eating local and in-season produce—suggested to them through the intermediary of the Carbon Footprint Calculator and the organisations promoting it. In this sense, comparing 21 calculators that take diets into consideration (Kim and Neff 2009Footnote 3) reveals that eating meat, especially red meat, is the climate-affecting factor most often taken into account and the most differentiating. Organic, local and in-season products are only considered by the more sophisticated calculators. In other words, calculators are not completely “neutral” documenting tools (Granchamp 2016); they implicitly rank practices according to the impact on the climate and operate as indirect prescribers of behaviours since the final result will vary greatly depending on the positive weighting given to certain types of consumption: it will be higher (indicating a stronger impact on the climate) in the event of eating red meat, slightly less for eating white meat and reduced for vegetarianism.Footnote 4 This ranking is reinforced by the line taken by associations and public institutions that promote these calculators.Footnote 5 For this reason, they are known as “prescriptions”, in reference to Plessz et al. (2016). Prescriptions are recommendations or advice devised by experts that aim to guide behaviours; they rely on reducing reality with a measuring device by which behaviours are gauged: calories to regulate food behaviours from a dietary and medical point of view (Ascher 2005), and in our case, the quantity of GGE, to guide them from the point of view of their presumed effects on the climate. However, contrary to the conception implicit in calculators that individuals are rational and free to adapt their practices according to the information and knowledge they possess, we suggest an analytic framework that takes into consideration the way in which food is embedded in everyday social relationships (Halkier and Jensen 2011; Dubuisson-Quellier and Plessz 2013) and infused with multiple constraints and contradictory restrictions. Using a dual theoretical perspective, we propose to analyse these micro-conflicts and the adjustments made by households to adapt their food practices to climate prescriptions. On the one hand, the theory of practice enables us to focus on the practices themselves rather than individuals and their specific qualities (Reckwitz 2002; Halkier 2009; Dubuisson-Quellier and Plessz 2013). We examine more specifically the connections between prescriptions and practices, an aspect that studies of the theory of practice have not often considered (Plessz et al. 2016). Plessz et al. write, “If sayings are considered a component of a practice, and if a practice may be considered socially constructed, then the link between practice and prescription may be considered a social fact. This approach leaves room for the existence of a complex and potentially conflicting relationship between spaces of practices and related prescriptions” (Plessz et al. 2016, p. 103, my italics). It is these conflicting relationships between “climate-compatible” food prescriptions and households’ actual practices that we analyse below. However, this does not simply involve considering prescriptions as practices to which individuals and households adhere or do not, but also understanding how they assess the context globally, or even subvert the logic of the calculator and its prescriptions to justify other practices they consider important and adapted, in this case, vegetable gardening and home production. We also consider it useful, on the other hand, to mobilise another theoretical perspective—pragmatism. From this perspective, adjustments can be perceived as “experimental procedures” that individuals implement to provide a practical solution to problematic situations (Ogien 2014), and at the same time, the notion of valuation (Dewey 2010) enables people give value to “what one holds dear” (Hache 2011), in this specific case, vegetable gardens and various forms of home production. The aim of this paper is, then, to analyse the ways in which individuals, caught in a network of social relations and norms stabilised in routines, can nonetheless call upon their creativity to adjust their practices, and the role that the calculator can play in this respect. Our hypothesis is that discrepancies exist between the values adhered to by individuals and their practices, but that they strive to implement “situated” adjustments, in other words, adjustments that take into account the various contexts and the conditions of their lives. In the following section, we present elements of the surveyed population’s contextualisation and of the survey itself before developing the main lines of this dual theoretical input enabling us to shed light on the attitudes and positioning of the interviewees when they examine their food practices in light of climate issues, by distinguishing attitudes towards prescriptions (eating less meat, eating locally and in-season) and the adjustment strategies (eating local, organic and home-grown produce), as we explain in our findings. In the “Discussion” section, we return to the relationships between prescriptions and adjustments, and the role that tools such as calculators can play in contributing to the “ecologisation” or greening of food consumption practices.",

Evidence from the Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition model,December 2019,Uzoamaka Joe-Nkamuke,Kehinde Oluseyi Olagunju,Kai Mausch,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Low productivity characterises the agricultural sector in sub-Saharan African (SSA) which informs major agricultural intervention programmes in this region focusing on changing the prevailing circumstance. The barriers female farm managers' face resulting in their reduced productivity compared to their male counterparts can be said to be a major contributor to low productivity in the region. Despite high-priority roles that women play in SSA agriculture, accounting for approximately 50% of the agricultural labour force involved in all levels and types of agricultural activities, several empirical studies have identified that female farmers are disadvantaged in production process and have lower yields than their male counterparts, thereby creating a productivity gap that ranges from 20 to 30% and, as such, further mitigating agricultural productivity potential in SSA.Footnote 1 According to the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization in 2011 and the World Bank in 2014, productivity potentials of African women in agriculture are constrained in several ways. First, from a political and socio-cultural point of view, women perhaps have unequal access to farmland compared with men, and in case they do, they are weakened by land tenure security (Arturo et al. 2015). Another reason is that female farmers have limited channels through which they can access productive inputs; for instance, their access to improved varieties and agricultural extension services are less compared with that of their male counterparts subjecting them to inadequate use of fertilisers, labour, seeds and other inputs needed for optimal production. Also, women membership in farmers’ organisation, such as labour-saving cooperatives, producers’ organisation and marketing group, is limited, thereby curtailing their access to product markets and more importantly, resource allocation potential. Finally, the gender gap in productivity, at the disadvantage of women, may also be adduced to women’s dual commitments as farm managers and household managers constraining their allocative efficiency which becomes more severe with low levels of their education, when compared with their male counterparts. A reasonably genuine attempt to raise agricultural productivity in SSA is therefore contingent upon effectively reducing and or eliminating the productivity gap which exists between male and female farmers. Food and Agricultural Organization asserts in their report in 2011 that developing countries of the world have the potential of increasing their aggregate agricultural output by 2.5–4.0% provided that they are able to reduce productivity gap between male and female farmers to its least minimum. Studies on the factors explaining productivity differences between male and female farmers across SSA are well established in the literature. For example, Kilic et al. (2015) find that female plot managers in Malawi devote less time to productive activities, as a result of high child dependency ratio, resulting to being about 25% less productive compared with their male counterparts. A similar investigation was carried out by Gbemisola et al. (2015) who further empirically establish the gender productivity gap in Nigeria by region. In the Northern region of Nigeria, women are 28% less productive with a large proportion of the gap attributed to structural/unexplained effect, while no significant gender productivity differences in the Southern part of the country. Notably from the findings of Gbemisola et al. (2015), the gender gap in productivity within a country may differ across different regions in the country. In another empirical study conducted by Ali et al. (2016), the difference in the yield between male and female cultivated plots was estimated to be 17.5%, also to the disadvantage of female managers in Uganda largely attributed to difficulty in accessing productive inputs, negligible households endowments, ‘double-edged’ childcare and farming responsibilities, and difficulty in accessing output markets. Nonetheless, all these early empirical studies are limited by the methodological approach, geographical data coverage and little attention given to the specificity of different farming enterprises. Gender gap estimates differ with different geographical locations and farming enterprises, perhaps because of different socio-economic needs and agro-economic and environmental challenges, amongst other factors (Gbemisola et al. 2015). Therefore, generalising gender gap of productivity differences may not be appropriate for informed and effective sub-sectoral agricultural and gender policies. To our knowledge, only Gbemisola et al. (2015) have been able to empirically validate the gender gap in agricultural productivity by region in Nigeria; however, the study did not extend its investigation to different farming enterprises; therefore, recommendations from this study may only be applicable to regional productivity and gender policies but not sub-sectoral policies. Our article contributes to the existing debate on the gender gap in productivity by providing evidence for productivity gap not only at the national level but also for farmers that produce two major crop legumes in Malawi, thereby proffering a better understanding of gender gap by farming enterprise. Also, we take advantage of our household panel dataset to explore the most appropriate unit of analysis for this present study—the individual plot—while also controlling for other characteristics of the plot manager with other explanatory variables. According to Doss (2001), the use of sex of household head as gender indicator is problematic as it does not reflect the actual economic unit that makes decisions in respect to what to cultivate, with an unclear assumption that production decision within the household is solely taken by the household head. Our study differs from this unclear assumption as we base our definition of gender indicator on the notion that production decisions are mainly taken by the plot manager; therefore, we employ gender of plot managers, instead of the gender of the household head, as the gender indicator. The use of gender of plot manager was adopted by Gbemisola et al. (2015), Kilic et al. (2015) and Arturo et al. (2015). Regarding the analytical approach, we go beyond providing insight on the factors that explain productivity differences between male and female, conventional practice in existing studies, but also provide estimates of the relative contribution of these factors to productivity gaps between male and female-managed plots using the Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition model. The use of the model allows us to partition the mean difference in yield between male-managed plot and female-managed plot into two parts. The first part constitutes the portion that is driven by gender differences in levels of observable attributes (i.e. the endowment effect), and the second part constitutes the portion that is motivated by gender differences in return to the same set of observables (i.e. the structure effect) (Jann 2008). By doing this, we have been able to provide estimates of the relative contribution of the different drivers of productivity differences between male and female groundnut and pigeonpea plot managers in Malawi. We are not aware of any previous study that applied this method to analyse the gender gap in the production of crop legumes in agriculture. Finally, this study is of importance to Malawian agricultural and gender policies considering the statistical joint report of the UNEP and the World Bank (2015) which reveals that women farmers in Malawi are older by over 5 years on average and also have lower levels of education as compared with male farmers, suggesting that Malawian women are approaching less economic active years with low social and human capital than men. With legumes being considered ‘women’s crops’ by many researchers (Doss 2001; Nakazi et al. 2017; Njuki et al. 2011), we explore two major leguminous crops in Malawi, namely, groundnuts and pigeonpea, and by doing this, we have been able to provide a better understanding of gender gap in productivity analyses with respect to crop specificity and farm decision-making. The presentation of the remaining sections of the papers is as follows. The “Production of legumes and gender issues in Malawi” section provides background on the production of legumes and gender issues in Malawi, while the “Data and descriptive statistics” section details the data utilised and the summary statistics of the variables used in the empirical estimation. The “Methodology” section explains the methodology used. The estimated results are reported and discussed in the “Empirical results” section. We conclude in the “Conclusion” section.",8

Both the animal-raising farms and the slaughterhouse sector have shown a low level of profitability. Studies at the start of this century showed that poverty was widely present among family farms in Belgium, and many did not earn more than a minimum wage (Van Hecke 2001). This situation has not improved in recent years, particularly for farms specialising in animal products. Official reports have been commissioned to review average farm profitability (Deuninck et al. 2009). Farms specialising in piglet breeding had negative income from 2006 to 2008 (FOD Economie 2010). In 2007 and 2008, negative income was present even before subtracting the annual farm’s household income. Farms specialising in pig fattening presented slightly better profitability and showed a small positive benefit during this period. However, profits remained under pressure from increasing fodder prices and decreasing prices for live pigs. A follow-up report showed that this situation again deteriorated during 2010–2012 (Vrints and Deuninck 2013). Authorities are concerned that price transmission in the meat column in Belgium is not fully competitive. The National Price Observatory was asked to conduct several studies on the price and cost structure of the beef and pork production column (FOD Economie 2009, 2010). These studies were motivated by the difficult situation of the animal husbandry sectors. The reports highlighted the problems of price formation, showing that the obtained prices could not cover the production costs for several actors in the supply chain. The situation also led to frequent consultations between farmers’ syndicates and representatives from both the slaughterhouse and retail meat sectors. In addition, policy-supported initiatives developed roadmaps and action plans towards a transparent, differentiated and collaborating pig value chain. Starting from this evidence, this paper examines the interesting and long-standing issue of analysing the market power exerted in a supply chain using multiple stages of the chain itself. The slaughterhouses are central players in this supply chain as they are the primary purchasers of live animals from farmers, as well as the main suppliers of carcasses to the Belgian retail sector and the food industry. The oligopsonic threat in this sector is a potential issue due to agricultural production that may involve a lack of coordinated production control among pig farmers (the supply side) and a highly concentrated market of pig slaughterhouses due to significant scale economies (the demand side). Belgium is a small country with a large and highly specialised meat industry, resulting in a high regional concentration of livestock and a large, diverse slaughterhouse sector. However, this type of analysis can be equally informative for several European regions. Similar situations exist in other European regions, such as in Germany (Bayern, Niedersachsen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Schleswig-Holstein), Denmark, Ireland, eastern Spain, France (Normandy, Bretagne), the west and south of the Netherlands, and the central region of Poland. Belgium’s particular advantage is its limited size, which makes it possible to complement regional data with data that is available on a national level, thus leading to more detailed results. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. “Overview of the pig market sector in Belgium” highlights the background of the pork sector in Belgium by looking at some market structural variables. This section indicates the role of the different actors in the value chain and the specific characteristics of the markets between them: the market for live pigs and the market for pig carcasses. Based on this empirical overview of structural characteristics, we derived some initial assumptions that we embody in our market model. “Model approach” describes the construction of the model that reflects the specific market characteristics for live animals and meat products in Belgium. We build a market power model that estimates output and input market frictions without the need to estimate marginal costs. We also consider the extent to which our estimates are sensitive to different model specifications. “Data” provides results and an interpretation of the variables. “Results” concludes.",2

Berry: A Primer for Teaching Environmental History, Ten Design Principles",December 2019,Renaud Bécot,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The first section of the book suggests figuring out the possibilities of introducing natural phenomena into teaching, starting with the social facts of the students’ daily lives. The four chapters in this section are each based on a specific non-human element (from a llama to imported fruit), for which the authors offer a dual reading. The first reading is thus literal, historicising, for example, the history of domesticating certain animals. The second reading aims to be more metaphorical: the chapter “The Seeds”, for example, suggests envisaging the aims of teaching as seeds that make it possible to give more room to environmental issues in history lessons. The study of these objects is presented as an educational strategy to give students a better grasp of the ecological foundations of our societies. Firstly, studying ordinary, non-human elements provides an opening to examine the relations forged between human societies and their ecosystems, for example, the study of the imaginary surrounding certain animals. Studying the cultural productions involving animals that are both “social network stars” and political symbols (pandas, grizzly bears, etc.) can thus become an opportunity to study the social construction of non-human elements, and more broadly, of nature (pp. 54–65). Analysing these representations can constitute a first step in understanding the genesis of policies to protect certain species while other species remain beyond human preoccupations. The authors also suggest taking the investigation into the students’ lunchboxes (pp. 13–25) to scrutinise the economic and infrastructure conditions of how the fruit they consume is marketed. Starting with a particular food, the students are asked to examine the environmental production conditions of these resources: the case of the banana, for example, sheds light on the socio-ecological effects of monocultures in certain regions. Adopting a starting point rooted in the present should encourage students to examine the origins of our interactions with ecosystems. For this to happen, the authors underline the need to mobilise historical sources that make it possible to reconstitute the diversity of social representations of the environment and even the conflictual uses of resources or areas. To cite just one example from the propositions formulated in the book, the authors suggest gathering numerous historical texts about the same area (travellers’ accounts, inhabitants’ descriptions, etc.) to guide students towards considering the implications of these different perspectives and grasping the origins of the conflicts of use issues in these areas.",

While around 650 million people in the world are classed as obese, around 820 million people in the world remain hungry (FAO 2019). Moreover, the food production system involves a number of pollutants related to pesticide application, the use of plastics and packaging from the farm to the refrigerator, the presence of residual ammoniac or nitrates that spread through soil and water, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions within the food chain, which represent 21% to 37% of emissions throughout the world (IPCC 2019). These pollutants also impact human health and biodiversity (Lock et al. 2010). All of these issues underscore the immense challenges that need to be overcome in achieving a sustainable food system, guaranteeing the availability of food for everybody with sound nutritional and environmental qualities, all of which encompass a wide range of characteristics (Ranganathan et al. 2016). This situation has generated numerous public agendas for sustainable development, clean agriculture, and/or a zero-hunger target by 2040 or 2050. These agendas are based on foresight studies with legitimate objectives, but they are often also based on debatable assumptions regarding economic development (FAO 2019). In this context, the scientific knowledge regarding diets appears to be a keystone in predicting the future of food security, which has led to the emergence of many dietary models (Poore and Nemecek 2018). Several works studying diets have highlighted the substantial benefits that could arise from significant, but still hypothetical, changes in diet (Lock et al. 2010).Footnote 1 For example, according to Vieux et al. (2018), adopting diets that are healthy and that reduce GHG emissions by 30% would require more than 50% of our current food intake to be replaced by other food products. This study, along with many others (such as Tilman and Clark 2014), is based on dietary models in which price and market adjustments are completely overlooked. Dietary models provide insights on ‘desirable’ targets regarding numerous characteristics related to nutrition and environment, but remain silent on the economic conditions that should (broadly) prevail to have any chance of reaching them. For example, food habits make dietary changes difficult and generally slow in uptake. Moreover, consumers cannot take into account all of the criteria and trade-offs linked to sustainability, which limits their ability to influence the market in providing incentives towards sustainable foods (Lusk 2014). Additionally, supply chains are not always organised to promote new and sustainable practices. Regulation is certainly necessary, but the numerous dimensions related to sustainability make this regulation extremely difficult and potentially set up to fail (Roosen and Marette 2011). Even if reaching sustainability remains challenging, we argue that economic analysis can contribute to the key issues underpinning dietary models by providing information on consumers’ behaviour, price adjustments and regulation. Although economic models are imperfect, these models are useful for understanding the impacts of regulatory tools on market adjustments and agents’ surpluses, taking into account agents’ behaviours. As changes suggested by dietary models are ambitious (Afshin et al. 2019), economic models are important for quantifying the various losses and gains involved and for guiding the regulatory debates that should combine efficiency and social considerations in making dietary reforms acceptable. If economic analyses are sufficiently precise, they can contribute to our understanding of who the winners and losers coming from drastic changes could be, and how to move towards a sustainable transition in the food production system. In other words, foresight studies based on dietary models need to be more accurate regarding market adjustments and economic gains in providing political credibility that lead to real change. In introducing this special issue on the Economics and Sociology of the Food-Health-Environment Nexus, this article aims to underline the main challenges addressed by dietary models in economics. Specifically, this article focuses on these important scientific contributions and their consequences for economics, since the Food-Health-Environment Nexus raises many social questions. We mainly restrict our analysis to health and environmental criteria, knowing that criteria such as fair trade, inclusive development and rural/urban equilibrium also matter. We also abstract from the important issues specifically related to developing countries, such as poverty, starvation or the fragility of small-scale farmers (NBER 2019). We also voluntary restrict our attention to the specific field of economics; however, the reader should remain aware that these challenges also question other social sciences, such as sociology, anthropology and/or political sciences. The first part of this brief article presents the essence of dietary models by summarising a few recent contributions. The second part introduces the possible contributions of economic modelling to complement these dietary models, despite the limits of economic approaches. The third part suggests new research proposals by underlining overlooked questions that deserve further scrutiny. It should be noted that we have not written a survey covering an exhaustive review of previous contributions.

However, several developed countries recently experienced a sluggish or declining trend in the consumption per head of these products. Even though such decline seems moderate for the time being, there is a growing discrepancy between the global outlook of meat consumption worldwide and the more “local” perception of the need to modify our food systems to address climate change, health and biodiversity issues. In the scientific literature, there is an ongoing lively debate on the expected benefits of a reduction in the share of animal-sourced food in consumer diets (see, e.g. Willett et al. 2019; Springmann et al. 2016; Pérignon et al. 2017; Godfray et al. 2018). Such benefits are likely on health and the environment, and they extend to a limited pressure on natural resources as well as gains in animal welfare. An associated issue is the sustainability of a generalized “western” diet worldwide, characterized by a high meat content (Tilman and Clark 2014; Willett et al. 2019). The debate is often presented in global terms (world food security), but there are also local or national motivations for reduced bovine meat consumption and production, while heterogeneity in production practices and diets across countries and population categories is seldom accounted for. In addition, even though there is a general agreement on the need for a transition in present food systems, to cover the food requirements of a growing population while satisfying sustainability objectives, the description of the transition towards modified food systems along these lines remains lacking. Transition in food systems towards less animal-sourced foods may be initiated by changing trends in consumer demand, to which producers have to adapt with possible public policies accompanying transitions in production practices. Indeed, there is some evidence that adaptation of existing production systems will not be enough to cope with impact of climate change and that a drastic change in consumer choices and diets is required (more or less urgently and more or less stringently) (Springmann et al. 2018; Poore and Nemecek 2018). Several options are then available, if one has a view of an” optimal” meat consumption level that is lower than the existing one. The first one is to accompany consumers towards more sustainable diets with dedicated demand-side policy instruments, like environmental labelling or taxes. The second one is to implement policy instruments on the supply-side to help producers react to decreased demand for meat (production quality innovation, market diversification, productivity gains…). One possible scenario, where changes in consumer preferences towards more quality beef in diets are accompanied by a transition in livestock production systems, may correspond to a new equilibrium in the quality of beef. Such an equilibrium would be characterized by a lower beef consumption per head, but of higher quality, as well as a lower environmental impact. Is this equilibrium better (or at least neutral) for consumers in terms of welfare gain and for the producers’ profit? Given the costs and benefits for producers and consumers, and given the public health and environmental impact, is this scenario social welfare improving? The main objective of the paper is to deal with this scenario of quality/quantity substitution in beef production and consumption and to determine to what extent it can lead to a “win–win” equilibrium in which (i) both consumer surplus and producer profit are at least equal to, or greater than, the situation before the decrease in red meat consumption, and (ii) the environmental impact of red meat production has been significantly decreased.Footnote 1 The paper is organized as follows. In “Demand-side considerations”, we focus on the demand side and the drivers of beef meat consumption changes. On the basis of available scientific literature, we discuss the extent to which a reduction in bovine meat consumption for a European country such as France may occur in the near future, and we identify the main consumers’ trade-offs that are necessary to take into account. “Supply-side considerations” is dedicated to the reaction of the supply side in a single country, i.e. on the domestic market, following a decrease in beef demand. We explore different supply strategies, including improved competitiveness and development of international markets, innovation in quality and public policies for accompanying the transition of agricultural systems. In “A simulation experiment”, we present a simple model to illustrate some economic mechanisms that must be taken into account to analyse the effects of a decrease in red meat demand, and we determine under which conditions a win–win scenario could happen. “Concluding remarks” concludes with a discussion on conditions underlying a successful transition towards a win–win scenario and with recommendations for future research.",2

Consumption patterns of organic, label rouge, and geographical indications in French scanner data",October 2020,Mathieu Lambotte,Stephane De Cara,Valentin Bellassen,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Over the last few years, the consumption of organic food has experienced a rapid and steady growth. In France, its value rose from € 5.9 billion in 2015 to € 9.7 billion—i.e., 5% of food expenditures—in 2018 (Agence Bio 2019b). In a recent French survey, about one in eight respondents declares eating at least one organic product a day (Agence Bio 2019a). Other quality labels—such as Protected Designation of Origin (PDO), Protected Geographical Indication (PGI), or label rouge—also represent a substantial and increasing share in food consumption. For some products, these labels dominate organic ones as a quality sign. This is notably the case for cheese, for which geographical indications represent 11% of the French market, a much higher share than that of organic cheese (2%). The rising demand for quality-food products—defined here as products certified as organic, PDO, PGI, or label rouge—impacts farming practices, land use, and value chains. As an illustration, the area devoted to organic agriculture in France has increased by 48.3% from 2015 to 2018, reaching 7.5% of the total agricultural area. As for other quality signs, between 2015 and 2019, the volume of meat and dairy products, fish, and eggs produced under these labels has increased from 602 to 665 thousand tons, reaching 1.5% to 1.8% of market share in these categories (INAO 2019). Providing consumers with healthier and higher-quality food while leveraging the potential health and environmental benefits from less intensive agricultural practices without affecting too negatively farmers’ income has attracted renewed interest from policy makers. The development of the production and consumption of quality-food products (organic food, but also other quality signs) has become a central objective in agricultural and food policies. EGalim, a French law on food and agriculture passed in 2018, provides a good illustration of this trend in public policies. An adequate understanding of the demand-side determinants of quality-food consumption is thus critical to assess the potential impacts of such policies. In particular, it is important to determine whether the demand for these products comes primarily from a large base of occasional consumers or a small base of “regular” ones. The recent increase in quality-food consumption is consistent with both a larger consumer base and an increasing share of quality-food in individual purchases. Which explanation dominates remains however an open question. This raises further questions regarding consumers’ behavior with respect to quality-food products. Do consumers tend to routinely and systematically purchase a product under the same label? If so, is this behavior restricted to some products or consistent across the food basket? The answers to these questions may have strong implications for the design and targeting of the policies aiming to develop quality-food consumption. In this article, we define a “regular” consumer—as opposed to an “occasional” one—as a consumer who predominantly buys a given product with a consistent quality. Regularity in quality-food consumption is thus related to how consumers perceive and value quality labels. In this regard, previous research has shown that credence attributes—i.e., attributes that the consumer cannot identify through search nor experience—play a major role in the decision to buy quality-food products (Massey et al. 2018; Padilla Bravo et al. 2013; Rana and Paul 2017). If the demand for quality-food products is primarily driven by credence attributes, one may expect that regularity should be the rule rather than the exception. Yet, this intuition is at odds with recent evidence. In a study of organic food purchasing behaviors in France, Boizot-Szantai et al. (2017) find that organic food represents only 8.1% of total food expenditures of the consumers whose organic budget share is above the top quintile. This suggests that, even for the consumers who value organic food the most, a large share of their purchases goes to non-organic products. That is not to say, however, that regularity is necessarily absent from consumers’ behavior. A consumer may well always choose to buy the organic version of some products and systematically prefer the conventional version (or another quality label) of other products. The aggregation of all food expenditures at the food-basket level therefore may thus mask regularity patterns that occur at the product level. Our main objective is to identify and document regularity patterns in food purchasing behaviors at various levels of aggregation and for various quality labels, and to study the interplay with other drivers of quality-food consumption such as price, availability, and socio-demographic characteristics of quality-food consumers. Our study thus contributes to the large body of literature—in economics, but also in sociology and marketing science—that has examined consumers’ behavior and attitude towards quality-food products. The vast majority of this literature is focused on organic consumption, which covers a wider range of food products than other quality signs. This literature has investigated the effects of price, income, and socio-demographic variables on organic food consumption, as well as the role of the relative preferences for product objective characteristics (taste, color, etc.) and considerations regarding health, the environment, ethics, or animal welfare. Quantitative studies in this literature are based on two broad types of approaches. First, a number of studies use surveys or controlled experiments. These studies rely on stated preferences to elicit consumers’ preferences or willingness to pay for various goods with different characteristics or attributes. The experimental design makes it possible to disentangle potential confounding factors. However, they often rely on small sample sizes and/or may be subject to sampling biases. Furthermore, stated intentions to buy quality food may overestimate actual purchases (Sun and Morwitz 2010). Studies in the second category are based on observational data. Those relying on scanner data are particularly relevant for the present study. By using detailed records of actual and repeated purchases by a large and representative sample of consumers, such studies allow to overcome some of the limitations faced by survey-based and experimental approaches. Observed purchases do not, however, directly inform on consumers’ preferences. In addition, such data mostly pertain to purchases for food-at-home consumption at the household level, which may differ from actual consumption at the individual level. This literature has shed interesting light on the socio-demographic profile of quality-food consumers, as well as on the influence of product attributes on consumption behavior. For example, findings suggest that organic food consumers tend to be more educated and have higher income than conventional food consumers. They are more likely to be female and to have children, especially newborns (Gracia and de Magistris 2008; Hughner et al. 2007). They also spend more on food and have a healthier diet (Boizot-Szantai et al. 2017). Several studies underline the key importance of credence attributes in attitudes towards organic food. Consumers tend to place more value on credence attributes of organic products than on their search and experience attributes (Massey et al. 2018; Rana and Paul 2017). The influence of credence attributes on the probability of purchasing organic products has been found to be larger than that of education, marital status, and income (Padilla Bravo et al. 2013). The review by Rödiger and Hamm (2015) shows inconclusive evidence with respect to the effect of price on organic consumption. Results from observational studies indicate that the effect of economic determinants of organic consumption, most notably price and availability, varies across products and types of retail stores (Buder et al. 2014; Dimitri and Dettmann 2012; Padel and Foster 2005). Regularity in organic food consumption has been much less studied than the influence of the socio-demographics variables, price, income, or product attributes. Some survey-based studies have examined the factors influencing the probability that a consumer defines himself or herself as a regular organic consumer (Barrena and Sánchez 2010; Baudry et al. 2019; Kesse-Guyot et al. 2013; Oates et al. 2012; Onyango et al. 2007; Pearson et al. 2013; Treu et al. 2017). However, as these studies are based on stated consumption averaged at the whole food basket level, it is difficult to draw robust conclusions on actual purchases at finer aggregation levels. Observational studies based on scanner data (Boizot-Szantai et al. 2017; Lacour et al. 2018) provide some interesting findings about purchasing patterns, but, the focus in these studies is on the share of organic food in total food expenditures. Considering all food products together may mask regularity patterns at a more disaggregated level. Although expectedly important, the availability of quality-food products has also received less attention than other potential determinants (Dimitri and Dettmann 2012). One reason lies in the difficulty to accurately quantify availability. As a consequence, availability has been overlooked in most survey-based and observational studies of organic consumption. In this paper, we use a large scanner dataset of food purchases in France, provided by Kantar®, which provides detailed records (quantities, price, type of retail store, etc.) of purchases of 237 food products by an unbalanced panel of 12,453 French households between 2011 and 2016, along with socio-demographic information about households (age, income, département of residence, household size, etc.). This dataset enables to decompose household food purchases at a fine level of disaggregation in terms of products. Importantly, it informs about the labels (organic, PDO, PGI, label rouge), if any, attached to each purchased product. In order to identify regularity, we use two complementary approaches. For a given product or category of products, we first examine whether the distribution of purchases under a given label is compatible with a large base of occasional consumers or a small base of quality regulars. In a second step, we then investigate the influence of various determinants of the probability that a consumer is regular for a given product and label. The variables accounted for in this analysis include various characteristics of products (price, retailer’s brand, availability), retail stores, and households (socio-demographic variables, income, city size, etc.). We take advantage of the richness of this information to address four main questions. First, can the consumption of a given (set of) product(s) be characterized as “regular”? In other words, do consumers purchase mostly one version of the product (conventional, organic, PDO, PGI, or label rouge) or do they buy a mix of various versions? Second, is regularity consistent across the food basket? Put differently, are quality regulars for a given product also regular for most of all other products they purchase? Third, how much of the total demand for quality-food products comes from regular consumers? Fourth, how do product attributes and household’s characteristics interplay in the probability that a given household is a quality regular for a given food product? Our contribution is threefold. First, we address these questions for a wide range of products sold under various labels. Contrary to most of the literature, which is predominantly focused on organic products, we extend the scope of the analysis to other quality labels such as PDO, PGI, or label rouge. Products under these labels have several important features in common with organic products. In particular, their production is often based on extensive farming practices with a potential to improve the sustainability of food systems (Arfini and Bellassen 2019) and credence attributes play a major role in consumers’ decision to buy these products. They do however differ from organic products in a number of dimensions, such as the range of products covered by the label, availability, price, perception of environmental and health benefits, organoleptic characteristics, and aspect. We investigate whether different labels can be associated with different purchasing behaviors in terms of regularity. Besides, previous studies were often focused on only one or a few products. The large number of products (237) examined in this article allows us to further study how consumers’ behaviors vary with the type of products (Buder et al. 2014; Chekima et al. 2017; Padel and Foster 2005). Second, we identify regularity patterns in quality-food consumption, but not for all products nor all labels. Such findings would not have been possible with the level of aggregation and coverage used in previous studies (Boizot-Szantai et al. 2017; Lacour et al. 2018). Third, we propose a new indicator of availability of quality-food products. The main difficulty is that, availability of products that are not bought by consumers in the sample cannot be directly observed. We circumvent this difficulty by constructing a novel indicator based on web-scrapping techniques applied to online catalogues of retail stores. This indicator allows us to determine the share of retail stores where any given product can be found within a given region in the total number of stores visited by a given consumer. This indicator is found to be strongly and positively correlated with the probability that a consumer is an organic regular. In sum, after detailing our methodology, we present the results organized in two axes, the first one on the identification of quality-food regular consumption and the second on its determinants, then discuss them and conclude.",5

The other forms of agriculture were relegated to being described as resilient, resistant, even relics, but never full-fledged models in their own right. The desire for universality of the development model of the 1960s and 1970s is an essential dimension of this model’s hegemonic character, according to the meaning given to this latter notion by Gramsci (Piotte 1970). Hegemony gives it the strength to impose itself in the representations of both the dominant and the dominated. The dominated indeed end up thinking of themselves as marginalized, or even as revolutionaries proposing an alternative that could only become a replacement model by imposing itself in turn in a hegemonic manner. It is this centrality of hegemony in explanations of agricultural transformations that has led certain authors to see the emergence of ‘family farming’ movement or discourses of agroecology in Latin America, or of organic farming in Europe, not as models, but as marginalities. It would seem that one cannot conceive of a model without pretension or capacity for hegemony. In such a context, the ‘alternatives’ can even be interpreted as excuses that help make the productivist model more acceptable, which would thus continue to remain hegemonic, or even be strengthened with new discourses such as agribusiness (Vanloqueren and Baret 2009; Hernández and Gras 2009). Furthermore, the proliferation of terms designating alternative modes of agriculture (agroecology, family farming, organic farming, biodynamic farming, permaculture, etc.) contributes to confusion and a loss of focus or power, and thus props up further the idea of a model of hegemonic modernization surrounded by a plethora of ‘alternatives’, none of which is able to supplant it. But what if we questioned this hegemony of a model? What if the strength, even the violence, of an albeit dominant agricultural model was no longer accompanied by its hegemony? It is not an unreasonable assertion within the framework of Gramsci’s theory, which distinguishes hegemony, ‘a form of a rationalized political and moral leadership’ (Giacaglia 2002; 153), from domination, which is unable to impose this leadership and requires greater recourse to coercion. It is this hypothesis that makes it possible to investigate forms of co-presence of development models. In this article, we study it in the context of the Argentinian Pampas, i.e. the overpowering emergence in the 1990s of the discourse of agribusiness, not only for field crops in particular, but also for other productions. This new discourse, despite its strength and often even its brutality, is today struggling to convince society and farmers of its claims to universality. It was very different at the time of the great modernization discourse of the 1960s and 1970s, when it had no difficulty in doing so, because, even if it was often criticized and played the role of a foil for some, it remained a reference for all at the time. We study the new emerging forms of agriculture in an agricultural region known to be one of the world’s richest for its soils and climate, the wet Pampas, and more precisely the central region where cultivation of GMO soya beans is expanding. However, we ensure that we study this movement of differentiation of forms of agriculture in a Pampean region in which family farming has been historically strong: Santa Fe province. Indeed, we want to be able to observe the transformations of forms of agriculture that do not originate from the major agro-exporting estates. For the same reason, despite the growing influence of soya bean cultivation in this region, we have chosen to focus on dairy cattle farming, which is the traditional production in this territory and which is most likely to be practised by different agricultural forms of different sizes and technological characteristics. To identify and characterize the forms of agriculture present in our geographical area of study, we will mobilize the theory of territorial pacts, developed and explained in other studies (Albaladejo 2004, 2009, 2017). This theory makes it possible to differentiate stable forms of practising agriculture, each with an internal logic and its own identity, and capable of being recognized by society, markets, the State and science. The theoretical framework and the method used are explained here before we propose an interpretation based on three co-present territorial pacts that we have identified using this theory in Santa Fe province, which we call new business farming, conventional farming (i.e. capitalized family farming which was the basis of the earlier hegemonic model) and small-scale family farming (so named to distinguish it from the previous model, but which corresponds to the ‘family farming’ movement in Argentina). In the discussion, we focus on the relationships between these models. In the article’s conclusion, we analyse the modalities of these models’ co-presence and the conditions necessary to be fulfilled before they can eventually coexist. It was the context that existed in Argentina of the late 1990s that led us to formulate a hypothesis of co-presence, and a perspective of coexistence, of agricultural development models, in the Pampas in particular. In fact, it was possible at the time to observe among small and medium Pampean farmers a large number of initiatives that could be called ‘discreet innovations’ (Albaladejo 2001), even though these farmers were surrounded by triumphantly expanding business farming and were witnessing a sharp fall in the number of family farms (both small family farms and ‘conventional’ family farms). Indeed, in the Pampas, more than a third of these farms disappeared between the last two censuses available, of 1988 and 2002 (Obschatko 2009). These innovations clearly highlighted original forms of farming, coherent and stable, although largely in the minority and unobtrusive. They were not defined primarily through their confrontation with a dominant capitalist model (Giarracca 1990), but as new modes of life, work and participation. Thus, in their discourses, the adopters and proponents of these innovations did not need to refer to a dominant model to define themselves. These discreet innovations also seemed to be vehicles for far wider territorial projects, and they seemed to be able to serve as a basis for local development and new forms of agriculture. This is the very foundation of the concept of ‘territorial mediations’ (Albaladejo 2009) that allows them to be characterized: the fact that a form of agriculture can be defined through its mode of territorial integration and therefore through the type of territory that it helps produce. The same theoretical viewpoint can also be applied to the dominant forms of agriculture in order to analyse their logics and highlight the type of territory they create, sometimes in spite of themselves. By using a theory that makes it possible to analyse the ways of practising agriculture through types of territorial integration, and therefore of creation of the territory, we arrive at the observation of a co-presence between fundamentally different territorial mediations, at the national level of course, but also within the same agrarian localities (Albaladejo 2004, 2009). The need to characterize a form of agriculture in all its dimensions arose from the observation on the ground of these cases of small-scale farming. A decade later, these very same cases were brought together by the ‘family farming’ movement (Nogueira and Urcola, 2013) (public policies, militant discourses, self-designation by agricultural leaders, etc.) using the same term that had seen success in Brazil and which we will adopt in the rest of this article to designate the ‘small-scale family farming’ model because it corresponds well, as we will see, to this farm type. To draw from the cases observed, but also to overcome their contingency, we must use an inductive approach that constantly links the theoretical to the on-ground reality. This approach is based on a theory of human activity (Arendt 1983) in combination with the theories of local development and territorial transformations of social geography (Raffestin 1987; Di Méo 1998). Social geography is also based on a theory of society (Giddens 1984), which accords a major role to the action of subjects in the contingency of local situations, without reducing the weightage of structural factors. Agricultural activity, once seen as human activity in the sense of H. Arendt, can be analysed according to its three main dimensions: ‘labour’, which is essentially the productive and economic part of the activity; ‘work’, which is the private and personal—or even creative—part, such as the life project for example; and ‘action’, which is fundamentally the political activity of presence in the city and participation in institutions and public debates. We also find therein a framework to define coexistence and differentiate it from co-presence. According to Arendt, action, which is the domain of speech and of citizens, is indeed the activity which makes it possible for all to live together and yet be different. We thus obtain a framework for understanding how it is possible for such antagonistic forms of agriculture as those found in localities in the south of Buenos Aires province to coexist (Tulet et al. 2001; Albaladejo 2009)—or even those that we study here in Santa Fe province. What forms the difference between co-presence and coexistence is the existence in the latter case of a local public space in which ‘action’ is exercised, in other words the political and, more precisely, the discursive activities of the actors from different territorial mediations. Thus, coexistence, unlike co-presence, has a local public space in which the different forms of agriculture that are present confront each other. In contrast, co-presence relies on other forms of relationships: juxtaposition, denial or ignorance, verbal or physical violence, intimidation, domination or exploitation, or even manipulation, as is the case with the folklorization of certain forms of peasant agriculture. The modalities of co-presence are in fact very diverse. This theoretical framework, which has been published several times (Albaladejo, 2004, 2009, 2017), proposes distinguishing three dimensions in agricultural activity which can be represented in the form of three superimposed spheres, partially or completely dissociated, or included one in the other, because it is the relationships between these three dimensions that are key in characterizing the type of territorial mediation. The characteristic of discreet innovations that consolidates them as territorial and development projects—and makes it clear that they cannot simply be described as resistant, remnant or resilient—is the fact that they are linked, even if weakly, to State and science institutions, markets and societal demands and that they are therefore not isolated or marginal initiatives. In the 1990s, in the midst of neoliberal policies in Argentina and therefore of the withdrawal of the State from development, in particular from rural and agricultural development, these discreet innovations represented forms of agriculture linked either to academics from university faculties, mainly of agronomy and the veterinary sciences, to municipal administrations which, for the first time in their histories, undertook actions or even set up services for agricultural development, or, even in some cases, to field stations for small-scale family farming (Albaladejo 2009). Subsequently, in the 2000s with the change of policy at the national level in particular, these discreet innovations succeeded in becoming ‘socially problematized issues’ according to the concept of Oszlak and O’Donnell (1995) 110, namely in being included in the social agenda and even finally in the public agenda, i.e. in the issues taken into consideration by both the State and civil society. From the public agenda, they even finally managed to become part of public policy. This social problematization gives these innovations the status of development models when they are able to add four converging dimensions of change (Albaladejo 2009, 2017): A relationship with a stable and recognized science and technology sector—even a small one—which helps produce knowledge relevant to and compatible with the model; Public policies that recognize and consolidate the agricultural model or at least the preoccupations that appear on the public agenda (Cobb and Elder 1971) and which justify aid and official recognition for this form of agriculture; The construction of a market segment that is receptive to the products of this form of agriculture (specific standards, public markets, labels and certifications, etc.); And last, but not the least, the linking with global and current concerns of a sector of society in order to be identified, even recognized, by this sector. This last dimension is directly linked to dimension no. 2, but is broader in scope, since it concerns in particular the identities, vocabulary, representations, discourses which are convergent between society and the model’s actors. This is what Oszlak and O’Donnell (1995) call social problematization, i.e. inclusion in the social agenda. This theorization of what is an agricultural development model combines with the theory of territorial mediations to constitute a theory of territorial pacts. A territorial pact is thus the combination of a development model and a type of territorial mediation (Albaladejo 2017). Formally, therefore, co-presence takes place not only between development models, but more broadly between territorial pacts. Should one pact have hegemony over others, other forms of agriculture will, in particular, fail to appear on the social agenda. Different agricultural forms thus manage to make the four dimensions of a model converge, although our field data show us, as we will see, that these dimensions are not always as consolidated or clearly demarcated as in the previous model of agricultural modernization. Co-presence is based on the fact that none of the pacts is complete, mainly because none of them has a capacity for hegemony over the others. We thus consider that there is an ‘incomplete territorialization’ of these different agricultural forms (Albaladejo 2009), a lack of completeness that is an essential condition for co-presence. For its part, coexistence is an objective, even an ideal type, because it corresponds to a plural and democratic form of territorialization. The theory directly guides the methodology here, because these four dimensions which define a development model, as well as the three dimensions of territorial mediation, are the seven themes which guided our observations on the ground, our interviews with the actors and, subsequently, our processing and analysis (Table 1). In Argentina, a country with very diverse natural and agricultural environments, the 34 public or private university faculties of agronomy educate their students in the productive characteristics of the regions in which they are located: wine and viticulture in Mendoza, milk production and field crops in Esperanza in Santa Fe province, etc. Two faculties, however, train their students in a more general way, covering all of the country’s productive systems: Buenos Aires and La Plata, perhaps because they are the two that are the most urban. In 2008, the new curriculum adopted at the National University of La Plata for agricultural engineer courses and forest engineer courses includes, at the end of the fifth year, a compulsory knowledge synthesis course of 64 h plus practical work: Taller de Integración Curricular (TIC: ""Integration workshop course""). We proposed content for this course, based on the theory of territorial pacts, content which has been approved and adopted since 2010. In this article, we will focus only on the agricultural sector, and therefore of the work carried out with student agricultural engineers, since the domains of forest production and engineering are very different. The theoretical framework of territorial pacts has made it possible to formulate a hypothesis of the fragmentation of the professional universe of agricultural engineers into as many development models as have emerged over the past 20 years, following three decades of domination by a universalist model. The objective of the course is thus to accompany the students in a reflection on the evolution of their skills and on the conditions and modes of exercising their profession within this new context of coexistence or, failing that, of co-presence. In addition, since 2008, this faculty has been organizing a week-long field work by the hundred or so agricultural engineering students at the end of the course and therefore at the time of its completion. This field work is carried on in the workshop, for which we are responsible. Some fellow teacher-researchers of the faculty and also of the research institutions of the International Agriterris Network are invited to participate. The three field trips organized in Santa Fe province in 2016, 2017 and 2018 are mobilized in our research here. The team of 80 students and six or seven researchers and teachers uses two buses and a van, available for the entire week, to get around. The course and its practical work, carried out before the field work, allow the students to be trained in methods and interview modalities. The students then write mainly descriptive group reports of the situations they encountered and a reflection on the exercise of their profession. The data available from the three trips of 2016, 2017 and 2018, collected in a format compatible with the theoretical framework being used, were the subject, during a second stage, of original interpretations proposed in this article about the coexistence of models. Table 2 shows the agrarian structure of Santa Fe province in 2002, which is the last usable census. All the agricultural interlocutors we spoke to were unanimous in setting the threshold for a ‘viable’ farm at 500 ha. However, it can be seen that 82.8% of farms are smaller in size, and that the weightage of medium-sized farms of 100 to 500 ha in the total cultivated surface area is as much as 42%. Thus, even before considering the diversity of models and types of mediations, we obtain a first idea of the agricultural diversity in this region, on the condition that we reject a normative vision such as that of an ‘economically viable farm’. Table 3 lists all of the agricultural actors we contacted in the province. Most of these actors were contacted three times in a diachronic manner in the context of a deep crisis in Argentina’s dairy sector and the adoption, in November 2015, of policies favourable to the business farming model by a new government, which followed more than a decade of public policies in favour of so-called ‘family’ farming in the country (i.e. small-scale family farming). Figure 1 shows the main locations of the interviews. The choice of interlocutors was based on an assumption of the existence of three main types of development models: large-scale business farming, small-scale family farming, and conventional farming by capitalized family farmers. This last category corresponds to the concept of ‘farmers’ as defined by Archetti and Stölen (1975), or even the historical-institutional category that is called ‘professional agriculture’ in France. This hypothesis thus retains in an initial analysis the two categories which have been predominant in the public debates of these last 15 years (business farming, most notably—but not exclusively—vehicle and beneficiary of the discourse of agribusiness; and small-scale family farming, vehicle and beneficiary of the discourse of agroecology), as well as the social basis of the hegemonic modernization model of the 1960s and 1970s, which, although widely and firmly present in the territory and in institutions, no longer has its own discourse (Albaladejo and Cittadini 2017). The latter, often called ‘conventional farming’ in Argentina because of the type of technical discourse with which it is identified, is also family-based, but is clearly more capitalized than the ‘family farming’ model represented by the militant movement of the same name that has existed since the mid-2000s. In this framework ‘agribusiness’, ‘agroecology’, and ‘conventional agricultural modernization’ are for us discourses (accompanying currents of science, agricultural practices or militancy as noted by Wezel et al. (2009)), but they are not ‘development models’ in themselves, even if certain models rely predominantly on one or other of these discourses. Location of the main actors interviewed in Santa Fe province Through the interviews, we systematically sought to explore the seven dimensions of the theoretical framework, beginning with the four dimensions of the emergence of a development model: (1) becoming attached to a stable and recognized network of the scientific and technical community, (2) accessing a market, (3) finding a place on the public agenda and in public policies, and (4) being recognized by society and linking itself to society’s problems. The three dimensions of territorial mediation (labour, work, action) were systematically discussed in interviews with farmers. Every interview ran for 2 to 3 h and was recorded. The majority of them were repeated three times at yearly intervals, helping us understand the dynamics and influence of the context (Giele and Elder 1998). At the beginning of each interview, a teacher-researcher encouraged the interviewee to tell the story of his or her agricultural activity’s trajectory and to describe his or her current activity. Second, once the story was finished, the students asked questions, which had to encompass all the seven dimensions, or at least those insufficiently covered in the story. Finally, in a third step, the remainder of the interview consisted of a fairly free exchange in conversational mode. The processing carried out for this article consisted of a thematic analysis of the content of the interviews, on the basis of the seven dimensions of a territorial pact, with an aim of identifying the characteristics of the pacts and in particular of development models, as well as their relationships with other models. We chose dairy farms because of their long history in this province and because dairy production is the farming activity most shared across different agricultural models. It is also the one that is undergoing the deepest crisis. This choice also makes sense because the business farming model applied to the cultivation of field crops has already been widely studied in Argentina (Hernández and Gras 2009; Bisang et al. 2008) and is moreover the basis of agribusiness theories. However, this model’s expression in milk production has been very little studied. From amongst the companies we visited, we chose La Ramada SA’s business farming model to study as the main case. This farm was described as exemplary by the majority of the technicians we met in the province. All those who work for this form of agriculture agree that it is an example of what ‘works well’ in Argentina in terms of milk production, in particular of being competitive in supplying outside markets, and that it is a textbook case in terms of ‘incorporating the best available technologies’. It is even treated as a benchmark for the entire dairy sector and not just for the business farming model. For a proper understanding of the case, it was necessary for us to avoid focusing on the technical dimension in order to apprehend the company’s private strategy in its entirety. This was easier said than done, given that we were accompanied by 80 agronomy students, half of whom were fascinated by the technical aspects down to their minutest details, and the other half scandalized by the treatment of animals, the deleterious effects on the environment and the inadequate working conditions. It was also difficult to broach the private dimension of the firm’s activities, because the agricultural students were not prepared by the faculty to take it into account, nor did they dare to ask questions about it. We were, however, able to learn that the firm’s owner did not have any dairy or even agricultural background. He comes from a family with a long history in the boiler construction industry, whose factory is located in the small town of Franck. This local, and indeed rural, industrialist regularly visited many milk processing factories that were his customers, and, in the late 1990s, he decided to invest USD 60 million in a milk powder factory with a capacity of 500,000 l per day. He set up his factory in Franck and began to export the entirety of his production to Algeria. Very soon, this industrialist decided to pursue vertical integration, starting with an attempt at milk self-sufficiency with the purchase of twelve dairy farms close to Franck. These farms added up to a total of 8000 ha of land, of which half was owned by him and the other half rented, home to 3000 dairy cows, for a production of 100,000 l per day, all of it delivered to his factory (one third of the milk processed by the factory) to be exported in the form of milk powder in bulk to Algeria. Other steps towards vertical integration included the purchase of a cattle feed concentrate factory (USD 15 million), also in the same locality of Franck. This factory buys all the grain production (maize and wheat) from the company’s twelve dairy farms and sells between 75 and 80% of its cattle feed production back to these same farms. In 2018, this vertical integration enabled the company to buy milk from its farms at 9.20 pesos per litre, at a time when the market price was 8 pesos on average. An analysis of the technical and productive dimension of the company’s dairy farms reveals that its self-sufficiency strategy also applies to agricultural labour and land. To minimize its dependence on agricultural contractors, the company owns all the cultivation equipment it needs and employs the machines’ operators itself. In addition, in 2008, faced with an increase in land rents, the company decided to concentrate all of its production on the 4000 ha of land it owned and gave up all the rented land. This led to a complete transformation of its technical system: adoption of permanent animal stabling, and thus to an abandonment of pastures, and an intensification of fodder production. The company shut eight farms to concentrate all milk production at just four sites with 850 cows each, plus a heifer breeding farm for animal replacement purposes. Each of these sites produces around 27,000 l of milk per day, which corresponds to the company’s tanker truck’s capacity of 29,000 l. Thus, milk production did not decrease with this reduction in farm land; it was instead the technical system that was completely transformed, going from an intensive grazing system to a permanent and full stabling one, which, in Argentina, is found only in the business farming model. The company therefore has a clear strategy of self-sufficiency and local anchoring, completely contradicting agribusiness precepts (Hernández and Gras, 2009) for field crops, which recommend the specialization of companies, their geographical spread by transforming them into a network of remote farms and rental of all the land necessary. We also observed, from other interviews, that these deviations from the agribusiness recommendations for business farmers are not limited to dairy farming. This business farming strategy completely changes the forms of interaction with other agricultural models by transforming the entrepreneur into a local actor (Franck is a rural locality of 5500 inhabitants), with his property and his business anchored to a particular rural territory. However, what is in complete conformity with the discourse of agribusiness is La Ramada’s constant quest for ‘technical excellence’, as our interlocutors term it, and in particular for ‘precision’ in practices, economies of scale, standardization and even digitization of techniques and knowledge that leads to an interchangeability of operators, and its orientation of producing and exporting standard agricultural raw materials. We thus find the same key operational concepts as for the cultivation of field crops. Taking the case of one of the four La Ramada farms that we visited, we noted that its 813 cows are milked three times a day and produce an average of 33 l each. A few cows producing more than 60 l are milked as many as five times a day. The average interval between gestations is 14 months. At this level of productivity, the productive life of dairy cows does not exceed 2.8 lactations, which entails their rapid replacement. Artificial insemination, always using Dutch breeds, is used and is facilitated by the systematic recourse to a hormone, prostaglandin. The complete confinement of the cattle and the high zootechnical yield result in very high veterinary costs to treat recurring problems of calcium deficiency, acidosis, ketosis, foot disease, pneumonia, omphalitis, lameness, etc. ‘Cows are like top athletes,’ a technician told us. ‘They have to be taken care of accordingly.’ Feed cost is high: the average 27 kg of dry matter consumed per animal per day consists of 50 to 65% of feed concentrates. This consumption is controlled precisely thanks to an investment of USD 2.8 million to equip each cow with an electronic collar. The collars, and the frequent milkings during which readings are taken, also make it possible to quickly detect when the cow is in heat, which, as we were explained, sometimes last as little as 6 h in such an intensive system. The concentration of animals and their sedentary confinement lead to a risk of groundwater and soil contamination. The company has thus invested USD 24 million in a sand litter system. The soiled sand is collected by machines then pumped with water into a large artificial pond lined by plastic sheeting. Eighty percent of the sand is recovered and reused, and solid waste is spread on the land. This system consumes 150,000 l of water per day and 1200 t of sand per month for each of the four farms. We were unable to determine this system’s effects on the soil. It is therefore a fragile and expensive system, with low margins (production costs are equivalent to 31 l of milk per cow out of a production of 33 l), with a high environmental impact and very high consumption of inputs. This is how the verticalization and self-supply strategy (which is what allows the company to survive, according to the technicians) is far from being a strategy of self-sufficiency in the sense assigned, as we will see, to this term in the other models. It is instead a strategy of vertical scaling and of avoidance of markets for inputs, which, however, is in no way accompanied by a reduction in their consumption. Likewise, the ‘local’ aspect of the company’s strategy is based on an economy of proximity rather than on contributing to local development, i.e. the company’s strategy is to use the synergies between companies or branches that are geographically close and not the development of a local population and a given territory. These are two completely different approaches adopted by different agricultural models. It is telling that total investments of USD 100 million in 10 years have led to the creation of a mere 105 jobs. There is no doubt that other forms of agriculture could do better. La Ramada is undoubtedly an important example, but it does not represent the very diverse business farming model as a whole. For instance, it suffices to compare this company to the operations of Raúl, who owns seven dairy farms near the locality of Eusebia (1000 inhabitants, Fig. 1) and farms approximately the same area (3500 ha, 2100 dairy cows). Ninety percent of the land is rented, even though Raúl has the goal of buying 25 ha a year. He does not generate more jobs on his farms than does La Ramada (60 employees plus his family, i.e. a total 65 jobs), but with 1000 fewer cows and a sale of plant products, he has created a mixed pastoral system that puts less pressure on his livestock and on the environment. It is undoubtedly a completely different universe. And yet, Raúl is also at the heart of the business farming model; he is a member of the CREAFootnote 1 movement of professionalized producers, his father and grandfather were farmers and he has all his capital invested in the agricultural sector. This diversity must therefore be taken into account in interactions, in particular with other agricultural forms, because it does not appear simply as a gradient of adoption of the criteria of the business farming model, but reflects instead different variants of the same model. And, indeed, La Ramada and Raúl belong to the same model because they both mobilize the same four dimensions of science, the social agenda, the public agenda and markets. However, they have adopted two different production systems. This diversity is never highlighted or discussed in Argentina: this model, like the others, is presented (by technicians, agricultural leaders, researchers, grassroots actors themselves) in a supposed uniformity which hampers the understanding of its interactions at the local level with other agricultural development models. In order to understand the interactions between different agricultural development models, we must also understand each model’s ability to project itself into a future it assumes is possible, if not probable, or at the very least, to have a perspective that it can believe in and make others believe in. This is obviously a significant role for technical inventions, especially so before they are disseminated or indeed before they are even able to be disseminated. In any case in Argentina, interactions between models require considerable semantic, rhetorical and symbolic efforts. For instance, the case of robotic dairy farming, an experiment carried out jointly since 2015 by INTA Rafaela and the multinational company DeLaval seemed interesting to us because of the rhetorical possibilities it can contribute to the business farming model in the Argentinian context. The robot consists of two milking stations and has a maximum capacity of 65 to 75 cows. Each cow decides to go to be milked when she wants, with a collar limiting the daily number of milkings and regulating the distribution of feed. Information and alarms are sent to the operator’s mobile phone. Each unit, costing USD 150,000 for the robot itself and USD 100,000 for the installation and other necessary accessories, is beyond the reach of other less capitalized agricultural models. We will not discuss here the multiple consequences on labour and production of such innovations, but they are considerable. What seems interesting to mention here is the possibility for large-scale business farming to make decision-makers and society believe that it can decentralize its production, thus reducing its environmental impact, as well as return to an (admittedly intensive) pastoral model, which currently its poster-boy company (La Ramada) no longer envisages. In other words, this model could embellish itself with qualities attributed to other models, at least in its representations. A comparable case is that of weed detection and uprooting robots for field crops. They could well fuel discourses of the readoption of mechanical weed control, which is still the prerogative of peasant systems, and leave the model of conventional farming to bear the brunt of attacks of the militant fight against chemical control. This is the form of agriculture that has been promoted by the ‘family farming’ movement, and it seems important to distinguish it from conventional family farming by adding the ‘small-scale’ qualifier. The term ‘small-scale family farming’ seemed to us to be more suitable than ‘peasant farming’ to designate these small farms in the Pampas whose labour is provided exclusively by the family, but whose members do not live in communities as is the case in other parts of the country. As per the definition of Archetti and Stölen (1975), they cannot be called ‘farmers’, i.e. those owning capitalized medium-sized farms, not only because their capital is low, but above all because—as an analysis of their modes of territorial mediation shows—their logic is not that of production, much less of accumulation, but rather that of the personal and family life project. Isabel (40 years old, 42 cows, 30 ha) and Marcos (30 years old, 14 cows, 14 ha) are both good examples of small-scale family farmers. Both produce milk in San Jerónimo Department, near the small town of Díaz for Isabel (1900 inhabitants) and of San Genaro (9500 inhabitants) for Marcos. Both of them have rented their lands through informal oral contracts. In both cases, the milk produced is sold partly to a local private operator and partly directly to urban residents. Isabel also makes cheeses and milk jam, which Marcos also intends doing. He has been practising dairy farming for only 4 years, while Isabel has been doing so for more than 10 years, ever since her husband, who is over 60 years old at present, became unable to work on the farm due to health problems. Isabel and Marcos each own a secondhand milking machine and a 1000-l refrigerated milk tank. Their cows produce 20 to 24 l of milk per day, which is a good, though not exceptional, level for the region. These two dairy farmers also rear pigs (more than 60 piglets per year for direct sale for Marcos), chickens, geese and ducks for self-consumption and some local sales. To meet these interlocutors, we decided to go through the technicians of an Agricultural Education Centre (CEA), which is one of the continuing education centres for adults in rural areas run by the provincial government. The CEA in Genaro employs nine agronomists and veterinarians and offers training to urban residents and farmers. In general, we always go through technicians to meet producers practising this form of agriculture, especially since it is not possible to just arrive with 40 students in tow at any type of farm. On the ground, we quickly realized that it would have been difficult to do otherwise in any case, because a farm of this type, when it reveals itself, is always under the very close supervision of militant technicians belonging to NGOs or even more commonly to the State, in particular to the National Secretariat for Family Agriculture (SAF), educational institutions such as CEAs or agricultural colleges, or INTA. These producers usually have their own organizations, which, however, are themselves the product of interactions with technicians. This is the case of the Surcando Association of San Jerónimo, created in 2015, of which Isabel is the president. The formalization through Surcando of a network of more than 70 farming families has enabled them to participate in various family farming organizations and meetings, and, in particular, has allowed them to become part of MoPProFe (Provincial Movement of Small Farmers of Santa Fe). Participation in these organizations not only makes it possible to gain access to means of development (product processing facilities, etc.), but also to consolidate discourses and align their positioning. Militant technicians are thus at the heart of this model, while also acting as civil servants of the national government. The first thing that one finds striking in this world of small-scale family farming is the dominance and uniformity of militant discourses, both by technicians and producers. It seems practically impossible to work for any significant length of time in this agricultural universe without adopting its rhetoric, and even its allegiances. ‘Today you are fellow students,’ a field technician said to our students, ‘but tomorrow you will be competing against each other, […] you will have to recognize yourself as being part of the model that you will support, […] and some of you will be responsible for a system that forces people to leave the countryside.’ But we have found that this rhetorical requirement and this discursive uniformity also underpin the other emerging model, that of business farming, even if an organized militant environment is not so visible. In San Jerónimo, this vision that divides the profession of agricultural engineer is complemented by the notion of kinship with parties with similar interests: ‘We speak the same language. In spite of the differences between us, what [small-scale farmers] feel they need, we also need.’ For agricultural engineers, and in particular for the youngest of them, this presentation—both as a divide at the heart of the profession and a coming together with similarly interested parties when dealing with the outside—contributes to a radicalization of positions and to a shift of professional identities and skills towards what, in Argentina, is called ‘militancy’. In fact, the small-scale family farming model is positioned by our interlocutors in San Jerónimo entirely through its opposition to the discourse of another model: the discourse of agribusiness (see Fig. 2). Role of agroecology in the strategy of demarcation of small-scale family farming from other models A structural analysis of the narrative (Demazière and Dubar 1997) of those interviews that were the most complete brought out the themes not of the theoretical model, but of the interviews themselves.Footnote 2 Both the structural analysis and the thematic analysis of the discourses, based on a territorial pact’s seven theoretical dimensions, reveal a strong internal coherence within each and convergences, even alignment, between the visions of the technicians and that of leaders of small-scale family farming in San Jerónimo (Fig. 2). This has equipped us with effective means to understand the discourses of other actors practising the same agricultural model elsewhere in the Pampas. ‘Agroecology’ is a discourse, more precisely a concept, around which, in this case, an agricultural model has been built. This does not mean, however, that all small-scale family farming is agroecological. However, here in San Jerónimo, this concept is constructed entirely around the idea of a direct and spatial opposition to agribusiness. The latter is another concept, which is undoubtedly, as we will see, key in the discourse of the business farming model, but which we discovered also at the heart, through its ‘repelling’ role, of the discourse of the actors of the small-scale family farming model. Indeed, agroecology is defined by the absence of a particular practice: the application of synthetic phytosanitary products. A technician even called it ‘the zero agronomy line’, an expression that speaks volumes about the relationships between agroecology and agronomy in Argentina, relationships which we will explore further in this article’s discussion section. This strong expression originates from the public denunciation of the effects of agribusiness products, often with an emotional, even dramatic element. For example, Isabel is convinced that it was due to her exposure to the ground application of synthetic products by a neighbour that her child was born with a spinal defect, which led to his death soon after birth. The fight for the total ban on the application of these products has found resonance in the urban context and has led to a concrete result in the form of a municipal decree (admittedly controversial, but real) prohibiting the application of these products within a radius of 100 m around urbanized areas (case of the city of Díaz) and even 500 m (case of San Jerónimo). A consequence has been that, according to our interlocutors, ‘the big agribusiness producers’ now describe a significant area of land (625 ha in the case of San Jerónimo) as ‘unproductive’ because they cannot cultivate it without ‘agrochemicals’. We were told that to prevent illegal occupation or squatting on these lands, these owners prefer to rent them to known producers, such as Isabel or Marcos. In this line of thinking, we can thus understand that the efforts by the business farming model to adopt reasoned applications of synthetic products, for example by implementing Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), are systematically rejected by the small-scale farming model. ‘Good practices are not viable, they cannot meet the requirement of a ban on the use of agrochemicals,’ Isabel told us. We thus interpret that in this veritable ocean of fertile agricultural land, a small-scale family farmer who wants a (minimum) extent of land to farm has no other choice than (1) to cling to this principle of ‘zero agronomy’, not only to differentiate himself but above all to obtain land from large farms, and (2) to define agroecology as a ‘struggle’ and, more precisely, a radical opposition to everything that is symbolized by the concept of ‘agribusiness’. We almost find here a type of analogy with the struggle for land reform. We can apprehend this contextual definition of agroecology more as a tactic than as a strategy, because in the longer term, it is not the best position for Pampean agroecology to take in order to discuss its technical criteria in an agricultural space that will be subject to regulation by a local public context. Indeed, it is based not on dialogue, but on a struggle. In the difficult context of Argentina, we can understand the effectiveness of a tactic that allows small-scale family farming to be (co-)present today, because without the zero agronomy line there would be no room for it to even exist. However, one can foresee the difficulties in the long term to build a plausible strategy of coexistence on these bases in an Argentina (no doubt still utopian) which could lead to local debates on these agricultural forms. The struggle for a type of territory is compatible with action in the public space, provided that the objective is not solely the elimination of others, but the construction of a negotiated common space, the objective of territorial development. Zero agronomy spaces as islands or enclaves can be perceived as the systematic search for a division of spaces and a refusal to countenance a division of the territory. In this context of opposing co-presences, no discussion is possible between models in order to build a common space; in other words, coexistence is not possible. In the analysis of the territorial integration of this agricultural model in San Genaro, it is however necessary to consider a key element: the nearby city, which can allow the model to strengthen, or even reverse, its strategy pertaining to coexistence with other agricultural forms. We have already seen that the small city and a few nearby urban allies can make the ‘zero agronomy line’ possible, but, more broadly, this is also what allows the existence of the CEA as well as many other professionals, intellectuals allies, and institutions, such as the municipality which supports this type of agriculture (although not as much as it could). The nearby city is a current and potential market, especially for processed products with high added value. Milk sold there obtains prices two to three times higher for the producer and Marcos realizes that it is direct selling that allows him to survive. It is a living space and service area for these farmers. It can be more than an urban centre surrounded by a small exclusion zone to keep out business farms. Through their desire for local and quality supplies and as areas of influence, small- and medium-sized nearby cities can form a key strategic axis for agroecological agriculture to reclaim a place in rural areas, well beyond the 100- or 500-m exclusion zones, forcing large-scale business farming to coexist throughout the local-supply hinterland. Looking beyond the specific case of San Genaro Department, the logic of the territorial integration of small-scale family farming that we have just highlighted provides us with some analytical insights for other situations elsewhere in Argentina. But as we have shown in the case of the business farming model, we have to take the diversity of situations into account. The case of Leo, a 30-year-old small producer close to the city of Reconquista who has converted his farm to agroecology, is an interesting example to illustrate this diversity. Leo is supported and monitored by Federico, a technician from the Secretariat for Family Agriculture (SAF). The latter is a militant believer in biodynamic farming, which is another discourse—in addition to that of agroecology—available to small-scale family farming. He has had a major influence on Leo’s decision to revert to agroecology. However, this conversion is also based on tragic events: the death of Leo’s father due to cancer shortly before our first visit in 2016, as well as two miscarriages by Leo’s wife, including one at 7 months. Leo believes these tragedies were the consequences of his ‘applications’ of synthetic chemicals on the farm before the reversion to agroecology. In his case, it is not the nearby city and the exclusion zone that is significant, but his farm is located in a United Nations-designated Ramsar Convention wetland conservation site. He has a very diversified production and sells surpluses to the nearby city, but his main production on his 118 ha is that of Braford cattle—weighing more than 500 k—destined for export. What is very similar with the cases seen at San Genaro is this relationship to the past, a specific relationship in Leo’s case since his family has been on this farm for five generations, a claimed and reinvented past, in other words a past turned into a heritage and legacy, and the considerable force of personal projects, i.e. of the private dimension of his territorial mediation. Of all the dairy farms that we visited, Soledad’s is representative in particular of the conventional model insofar as it has been owned by over three generations of family dairy producers and as it is deeply anchored to the agricultural sector as conceived almost four decades ago. This anchoring takes the form most notably of participation in the cooperative system for medium-sized farms. Her family is a member of the mixed-farmers cooperative of Sunchales (for the sale of calves and surplus crops). In addition, Soledad proudly told us that her grandfather helped found SanCor, the large Argentinian dairy cooperative (the country’s fourth largest milk processor by volume). Unfortunately, a year after our first interview, SanCor went bankrupt. When she recounted her family history, she emphasized that no one from her family had ever been a ‘milker’. The milker, literally ‘ordeñador’, is a type of traditional actor still called ‘tambero’ in the region (which means ‘dairy farm’ in Spanish, but which is more correctly translated here as ‘dairy worker’). The milker is an employee, remunerated in the form of a percentage of production, who is responsible for the milking, most often with his family or at least with his spouse. He is an essential figure in the conventional model, at the heart of the organization of dairy farm labour and space. In Soledad’s case, the family farm was transformed in 2013 into a public limited liability company, owned by her and both her parents. It employs all three of them as well as her husband (full-time) and sister (part-time). Soledad’s company has three production sites, of which two are owned, 3 km apart, with 230 cows each. The third site, rented for 5 years, is located between the first two, and has 140 cows. On each of the farms, ‘milker’ families—who are informal employees, analogous to sharecroppers—are responsible for the labour and for milking, in particular. Soledad told us: ‘There are a large number of families in the area who have worked with us for a long time […] There are more than eleven male workers, plus their wives and children, who work on the farms. We are in total more than 50 persons.’ It is therefore undoubtedly a family business, but one that is relatively large, with 1200 ha of land (of which 600 are rented). A total of more than 600 cows, distributed over the three sites, produce more than 12,000 l of milk per day. It is obvious that the sociological nature and the social and emotional bond between the people of this company has nothing in common with that of more formal companies, like those belonging to the business farming model. In other cases we studied, such as of Pablo, a milker uses his savings to buy the farm on which he has worked and becomes a family farmer himself, with the same characteristics as the model followed by Soledad, even if his operations are more modest in size (Pablo farms 146 ha and owns 96 cows, producing more than 1800 l per day). The mode of production can be perceived as specific to this model, once we acknowledge that there are other modes of agricultural and livestock production that are represented neither by the discourse of agribusiness nor by that of agroecology, and which are also not either a sort of vestige of the past or a transition to either of these two antagonistic forms. Soledad’s cows, for example, are not pushed to produce more than 20–22 l of milk per day, and the system is essentially based on grazing and fodder self-sufficiency. But field crops, primarily intended for grain silos and for the in-house manufacture of feed concentrates, receive the same phytosanitary applications and doses and types of fertilizers, as well as the same chemical control of weeds, as in the case of business farming. Furthermore, the effluents are collected in immense natural lagoons that are not lined, therefore probably contaminating the ground water. The lagoons’ liquid contents are pumped and spread on the crops on an ad hoc basis, without this practice being taken into account in the application of conventional fertilizer. Soledad has heard of agroecology, even of permaculture (yet another discourse pertaining to practices, knowledge and militancy). She is also an agricultural engineer from the National University of the Littoral and knows that these are now compulsory subjects of study in certain faculties. But she and her company appear more tied to the complex legacy of more than four decades of agricultural modernization, which results in fact in the sedimentationFootnote 3 of objects, techniques, advice and vocabularies, all of which are much more than resiliences or ‘rugosities’ of the past, to use the concept of Milton Santos (1997), because this model is made up of a complex system of technical objects. In fact, the same faculties of agronomy that have historically been drivers of the creation, fine tuning and dissemination of these techniques over this long period are still at work today, as we saw during our visits to the field stations of the National University of Rosario and the National University of the Littoral, producing technical references for this model that, for example, advocate retaining a solid pastoral base in the dairy farming system, without however giving up the use of chemical inputs for fodder production. In our opinion, however, this scientific and technical environment that is supporting this form of conventional production, and thereby helping to accord it a status of a model, is seriously remiss in not taking the ‘sedimentation’ of techniques and objects into account. We believe that this sedimentation is today intrinsically part of the technological logic of this agricultural model, because, just like the ‘handyman’ (bricoleur) of Claude Lévi-Strauss (1962), this model has to incorporate heterogeneous elements of a past made up of various waves of earlier modernizations. In contrast, the discourses of agribusiness and agroecology, like Claude Lévi-Strauss’s (Op. Cit.) ‘engineer’ (ingénieur), have the luxury of getting upgrades of techniques. Given its links to the past, this may seem paradoxical in the case of agroecology, but the latter is, in fact, most often able to do some sort of engineering of its past, in other words to recast and reevaluate it, because this remote past no longer has the means to impose itself on the present. In the case of agroecology in Argentina, this past can thus be transformed into ‘collective memory’ (Halbwachs 1925), i.e. put at the service of the present. But this is not possible for the conventional model, which is struggling with its many technical rugosities, each capable of imposing its own logic, forged in a past that is not so distant and, in any case, not so different from the present. The conventional model must thus manage legacy farms that have inherited an accumulation of various modifications and additions resulting from four decades of reliance on classical modernization, just like the machines studied by Nicolas Dodier (1995). This is what makes this model of conventional farming both intermediary between agroecology and agribusiness (allowing, for example, the models to borrow from each other, and to transition from one to the other), while still being radically different from each of them. And this is why the university faculties of agronomy working on technologies for the other models find the conventional model interesting: it helps them design hybridized techniques, such as those of intensive pastoral dairy farming. Probably over time, and if they endure, the other models too will face the same challenge of sedimentation of techniques (to which will be added the challenge of borrowing from other models), but this is not yet the case. The conventional agricultural model in Santa Fe remains closely tied to the concept of the sector as shown in Fig. 3. Indeed, Soledad’s company was supplying the entirety of its milk production to SanCor at the time of our first visit, in 2016. After remaining unpaid for more than 4 months of supply, from February to June 2017, Soledad decided to switch from SanCor to Saputo, the large Canadian company, which is today the second largest dairy operator in Argentina and which has a processing plant in Sunchales. She told us, ‘Even though I am glad they accepted us [as a supplier], it was very painful because my grandfather had helped found SanCor, but we had no choice ....’ This change was forced upon on all our interlocutors and one of them told us, ‘SanCor was a national price-setting reference. Without it, it is not the same thing, depending on Saputo is risky ....’ Just like Soledad, this latter interlocutor then thought of selling less milk and processing more of it first, but neither of them were planning to supply the nearby city, which could be a solution, although this could pit them in competition with small-scale family farming. On the other hand, everyone is worried because the national domestic market is controlled by large industrial operators who set prices, specify the types of products, impose technical standards, etc. In Argentina, this model of conventional farming is thus widespread in the territory and far from insignificant on the domestic market, but in the discourses, it does not manage to differentiate itself from business farming. However, at the technical level, it does rely on a very different approach (intensive grazing vs full stabling). The sectoral organization of activity and the cooperative world, which were its major institutions, are threatened, and the model is unable to find alternatives. The actors and the markets of medium-sized cities could be an alternative, for example, but the model’s stakeholders are not interested in them. Furthermore, as we have shown in another article, this model has not succeeded in forging its own discourse (Albaladejo and Cittadini 2017; Albaladejo 2008) after having been the leading discourse—even a veritable ‘hero’—of the agricultural world of the 1960s. The relationships between the three models analysed in Santa Fe in the domains of markets, society, knowledge, identities of agricultural engineers and public policy",3

Developed as an explicit critique of agricultural modernization, this approach defined agroecological practices as those that are anchored in local ecosystem functioning, enhance genetic and species diversity, optimize processes of material and nutrient recycling, and seek to harness synergistic interactions. Such practices aim for high levels of sustainability and drastically reduce the use of external, non-renewable, and environmentally harmful inputs. In subsequent decades, work in this field has increasingly sought to consider the ecological, economic, and social dimensions implicated in agrifood systems, while at the same time, the idea of agroecology has been embraced by an array of social movements, especially peasant movements. By the late 2000s, the term agroecology was being applied to scientific studies, agricultural practices, social movements, and public policies, mostly in North and Latin America (Wezel et al. 2009). Within the past decade, a series of high-profile international reports further elevated agroecology’s status (De Schutter 2011; IAASTD 2009). The concept made its first appearance among the research priorities of the French agricultural research establishment in 2010, independent of uses of the term among a relatively small number of French activists. According to the leadership of this research institute (Institut national de la recherche agronomique-INRA), agroecology was a new scientific field that sought to strengthen the links between agronomy and ecology. This definition represented a departure from the agroecological perspective of the American pioneers in the field, who had explicitly sought to incorporate the social dimensions of agriculture. It also largely disregarded the handful of agroecological approaches (not always in agreement amongst themselves) that had emerged within several INRA departments (Bellon and Ollivier 2018). Stéphane Le Foll, the French minister of agriculture from 2012 to 2017, drew on the techno-scientific approach proposed by the INRA leadership in his appropriation of the term. Organic agriculture had been supported by public policies in France since the 1980s, and in 2012 represented 3.8% of French agricultural land area. Other mechanisms for agricultural ecologization, including both regulations and incentives, had also been developed over the previous two decades (Lamine et al. 2015). A series of economic crises, linked to liberalization at the European level, had likewise impacted the agricultural sector. Departing from the traditional regulatory approach—which he considered to be negatively perceived by many farmers—Le Foll instead promoted the idea of a widespread “ecological modernization” for French agriculture. By adopting the idea of agroecology, up to that point relatively unknown in France but endowed with a certain scientific legitimacy, Le Foll positioned himself above the terminological skirmishes underway in the professional field, where the growth of organic agriculture and an accumulation of environmental regulations had led to the development of multiple labels for agricultural sustainability by France’s farmers’ unions and other agrifood actors (Lamine et al. 2015). Announced in late 2012, Le Foll’s “Agroecological Project for France” (APF) presented agroecology as an overarching concept embracing all types of ecological agriculture, including organic farming but also conservation agriculture and agroforestry. The minister’s many speeches on the idea emphasized the “environmental and economic multi-functionality” of agroecology, its ability to improve both the competitiveness of French agriculture and the autonomy of French farms via the replacement of external inputs with ecosystem services. Le Foll frequently illustrated his argument with the example of livestock farming, a sector that was struggling economically and could thus benefit from shifting to on-farm production of legume-based forages as opposed to purchased protein supplements for animal feeding (Bosc and Arrignon 2020). Finally, he portrayed farmers as the key actors capable of implementing the changes required to create an “ecologically and intellectually intensive” agroecology, a form of agriculture based more firmly on knowledge-production by its practitioners (Thomas 2018). Written into law in late 2014, the APF brought together existing programs for agricultural ecologization while at the same time reorganizing other programs overseen by the Ministry of Agriculture, such as agricultural education, under the agroecology banner. Added to this was a new policy instrument, known as the GIEE (Groupement d'intérêt économique et environnemental, or Economic and Environmental Interest Group), for recognizing groups of farmers engaged in the agroecological transition. Designation as belonging to a GIEE makes farmers eligible for higher levels of public subsidies (Ajates Gonzalez et al. 2018; Bosc and Arrignon 2020). The APF drew criticism on two fronts. On one side, a “Coalition in favor of a peasant agroecology” (Collectif pour une agroécologie paysanne) brought together environmental groups and farmers’ organizations such as the Confédération Paysanne (a French farmers’ union belonging to the Via Campesina network). This group was critical of what it saw as the stripped-down version of agroecology being promoted by the French government, insisting instead that addressing socioeconomic inequality, for example, was “fundamental” to the true definition of agroecology. On the other side, France’s most powerful farmers’ union, the FNSEA (Fédération nationale des syndicats d'exploitants agricoles), joined other agrifood actors in arguing for the need to boost the competitiveness of French agriculture by easing labor and environmental regulations (Bosc and Arrignon 2020). For these actors, the APF reinforced the idea that French agriculture was being pushed toward ecologization, 5 years after the previous government had launched a 10-year program to reduce pesticide use in France by half. This plan had already sent a strong symbolic message, signaling a shift in agricultural policy toward ecologization for all of French agriculture as opposed to an earlier logic based on voluntary programs for motivated farmers (Guichard et al. 2017). Other agricultural organizations, such as the National Federation for Organic Farming (FNAB) and the National CUMA Federation, sought to direct the APF to their own ends (see following section). Finally, increased media attention to the idea of agroecology—from parliamentary debates on the APF to various documentaries and environmental campaigns related to pesticide use—associated a range of other models with the concept, including organic agriculture, permaculture, or the use of digital and robotic technologies in farming (Bellon and Ollivier 2018). The APF was introduced following some 15 years of research on the conditions of agricultural ecologization in Western countries, the results of which pointed to barriers at multiple levels of the agricultural and agrifood sectors and the many changes needed to remove these barriers (Cowan and Gunby 1996; Lamine 2011; Vanloqueren and Baret 2009). Analyses of the APF have noted its almost exclusive focus on farmers, agricultural training programs, and farmer advisory services, with few strategic actions targeting the agrifood sector, for example (Guichard et al. 2017; Zakeossian et al. 2017). Other assessments have remarked on the insufficient level of funding allocated to implement the new policies (Ajates Gonzalez et al. 2018; Bosc and Arrignon 2020). Moreover, some authors have questioned the importance ascribed to farmers and farmers’ knowledge under cover of the idea of participation and the place-based nature of agroecological practices. Such authors interpret this as a strategy of legitimatization for reducing direct intervention by the state and shifting responsibility onto local actors, to the detriment of public investment in structural change (Bosc and Arrignon 2020; Thomas 2018). Finally, some observers have spoken of the failure of the APF, pointing, for example, to the rise in pesticide use in France since 2012Footnote 2 (Guichard et al. 2017) or the fact that the 500 GIEE recognized in 2019 amounted to barely 2% of French farms (Ministère de l'Agriculture 2019). More broadly speaking, the idea of “counting” the number of farmers engaged in agroecological practices has given rise to a variety of discussions and approximations, echoing earlier observations with regard to the absence of relevant data to assess policies for agricultural ecologization, in France and in Europe as a whole. These policies have been in place for 20 years or more; meanwhile, public funding for agricultural statistics services has been cut (Laurent and Landel 2017; Uthes et al. 2020). As a result, many processes of agricultural ecologization suffer from a problem of institutional invisibility which the APF does not address, notwithstanding its stated policy objectives (Altukhova-Nys et al. 2017; Bosc and Arrignon 2020).",7

The FAO projects that food production will need to increase by 70% by 2050 to meet the world’s food needs. Moreover, the FAO projects that Africa will by 2030 lose two-thirds of its arable land if desertisation is not stopped. Low self-sufficiency and hence reliance on imported food for human or animal consumption thus appears to be increasingly risky in the future. Farmland abandonment (FLA), which can be defined as land which ceases to be used for food production, actually poses a problem with the same effect as desertisation and use of farmland for housing or public infrastructure. In a recent EU report, Terres et al. (2013) conclude that profitability in agriculture is one of the main drivers of FLA: “farm income plays a prominent role in the farmer’s strategy regarding land use” (p. 14). Since farmland needs to be maintained regularly in order to be productive, FLA implies immediate reductions of productive capacity and self sufficiency of food. It follows that factors which have a negative impact on agricultural profitability also contribute to FLA, and therefore have a negative impact on food security. It is well established empirically that booming sectors, typically related to the production and exports of oil, have a negative impact on other sectors such as traditional export industry and agriculture. This phenomenon is called Dutch disease (hereafter DD, see Section “Theoretical framework and literature review” for a review of the basic tenets of the DD theory). The research problem in this paper is thus to analyse to what extent the oil sector, due to the DD mechanism, might pose a threat to food security in an oil exporting country, using Norway as the object of study. Food security involves not only quantity but also quality. It follows that less available farmland, whether it is due to FLA, climate change, or any other reason, increases the pressure on the remaining farmland as well as on the livestock to become more efficient and productive. This increases the risk of soil depletion and increased use of medication such as antibiotics. There is already an extensive use of antibiotics in many countries, which in turn leads to the development of antibiotic resistent bacteria. According to the World Health OrganizationFootnote 2 (WHO), antibiotic resistance “is one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today.” An analysis of the issue of food quality is outside the scope of this paper. As background information concerning our object of study as well as to highlight what is at stake, it is however warranted to mention a few facts. Among European countries, Norway has very low use of antibiotics in the agricultural sector, according to the European Medicines AgencyFootnote 3 (EMA). For this reason alone, it is desirable to increase domestic production and self-sufficiency. However, Norway has little cultivated land compared to other countries, where only about 3.1% or 10,000 km2 of the total area is cultivated farmland. There is a reserve of about 12,000 km2, of which the major part can only be used for grass. Less than 2% is suitable for food grains, and only 30% of the cultivated area is suitable for food grains, which is lower than any EU-country.Footnote 4 Since World War 2, about 1200 km2 of farmland have been reallocated, primarily for housing, roads, and railways. Still the total farmland area has increased somewhat, but the best parts suitable for food grains, potatoes, and vegetables have been reduced. Moreover, about 35% of the arable reserve is swamp,Footnote 5 which is subject to restrictions on its cultivation due to the fear of CO2 emissions. All in all, this means that food security (with respect to quantity, not quality) is relatively low in Norway, justifying the need for a stronger focus on FLA and mechanisms that may enhance the reallocation of farmland, such as DD in the agricultural sector. The DD-FLA problem, however, is likely universal and not restricted to Norway only. The research design consists of two separate parts: (i) a theoretical conceptual construct; (ii) an empirical analysis using time series data. In the first part, using classical deductive reasoning, a causal chain linking the oil price to food security via profitability is proposed. The structure is if p then q, where p is the premise and q is the consequent. In the second part, the validity of the premises is assessed, applying time series econometrics (cointegration) and general statistical techniques. Based on economic theory, two relations (premises) stand out as particularly interesting, namely the relations between the oil price and (1) producer prices; (2) the import weighted exchange rate. These relations are considered transmission channels of the DD effect from the oil price to agriculture. To the best of my knowledge, there is no previous research on the quantification of the effect on food imports from the oil exporting sector. We thus add to the literature by identifying another DD effect: the food imports effect. This effect is clearly related to the classical spending effect and is generally described in economic theory as the import propensity, that is how much import increases when income increases. Our estimated long-run equilibrium relations can thus be labelled the oil price elasticity of food imports, measuring the percent change in the quantity of imports per percent change in the oil price. The rest of the article is organised as follows. Section “Theoretical framework and literature review” presents the theoretical basis of DD and reviews selected literature. In this section, the theoretical construct underlying the claimed link between the oil industry and food security is presented. The methodological part in Section “Method” starts with an explicit statement of the research question. Then the econometric method of cointegration is explained. This method is suitable for analysing the long-run equilibrium relations which constitute the essential premises in the theoretical construct. Section “Results” displays the statistical results, and Section “Concluding remarks and suggestions for further research” discusses, concludes, and suggests topics for further research.",1

Fair trade (FT) standards and labels aim to contribute to sustainable development by offering better trading conditions and securing rights for marginalised producers, especially in developing countries. FT labels have become far more than a niche market. They are known and recognised by many consumers, producers and citizens. While there are no state-run FT labels anywhere in the world, there are several private labels, which have been developed and are governed by different organisationsFootnote 1 Although FT labels have different specifications, target products and rules, they are all critical of the current global trade system arguing that small producers in developing countries cannot live decently from what they earn farming. In response to market failures, FT labels are striving to establish key instruments, namely, minimum guaranteed prices, collective premium, long-term contracting, pre-financing and capacity building with technical training for more sustainable agricultural practices. These labels are part of the same paradigm: by participating in FT markets, smallholders are expected to improve their bargaining position, obtain higher prices and increase their net income thereby improving their livelihoods. Fairtrade International claimed that the minimum price has also proven to be “an effective tool to protect producers from the volatility of global commodity markets, improving food security” (FI 2016). Fair prices and higher incomes are assumed to automatically increase food security and reduce vulnerability for certified households. However, some research challenges this idyllic vision (Caswell et al. 2012; Bacon et al. 2014; Bacon et al. 2017). The evidence in the literature on development economics is mixed: better farming incomes are not systematically correlated with improved food security for smallholders (Anderman et al. 2014). In a randomised experiment, Banerjee and Duflo (2012) demonstrated that purchasing food is not necessarily a priority for poor households when they have a new source of income. In addition, food security depends on a variety of factors including the production of subsistence food. For instance, Pellegrini and Tasciotti (2014) found that food crop diversification was positively correlated with the dietary diversity of rural households in eight developing countries. Although the FT movement claims to contribute to achieving sustainable development goals, including food security objectives, the Fairtrade International theory of change (FI 2015) needs to be tested empirically. In the academic literature on FT, the domain of food security remains a blind spot (Schleifer and Sun 2020). Very few studies have focussed on the impact of FT on the food security of certified farmers (Becchetti and Costantino 2008; Chiputwa and Qaim 2016; Meemken et al. 2017). Moreover, the findings of these studies differ and fail to provide conclusive evidence to support the claim that FT is an effective development instrument for promoting food security. This paper contributes to this literature by focusing on FT coffee producers in Peru. We consider to what extent FT certification, which is likely to benefit farmers in terms of higher coffee prices and net income, is sufficient to achieve food security for farming households. We test the hypothesis that, given the complexity of smallholder farming systems, the composition of their income and potential leakage effects, there is no direct link between increased income from certified crops and food security for poor, small and diversified farmers. Following Ruben and Fort (2012), we use cross-sectional data and a propensity score matching (PSM) approach to assess the impact of FT on coffee producers in Peru. This type of data does not account for unobservable factors. We relied on the recommendations made by Lampach and Morawetz (2016) to improve the credibility of PSM. This paper sheds light on a little explored topic in Northern Peru, where food insecurity still prevails among small farmers (MIDIS and DGSYE 2012) despite the success of FT-certified producer organisations (PO). We used both qualitative and quantitative data collected at the household level in the coffee farming communities to test our hypothesis. The article is organised as follows: the “Tackling food insecurity with FT: review of the literature” section provides an overview of literature on FT and food security. The “Empirical study” section introduces the Peruvian study area and data and provides an outline of the preliminary descriptive statistics. The “Method and data collection” section describes the methodological approach used for the impact assessment. The “Results and discussion” section presents and discusses the results. The “Conclusion” section presents the conclusions.",

The involvement of veterinarians in the control of contagious diseases through the application of sanitary policies (isolation, disinfection of the premises and slaughtering of contagious animals), thanks to their clinical knowledge of animal diseases, empowered them in the last quarter of the nineteenth century with the mandate to maintain healthy herds, both for the trade and internal production, on behalf of European states (Fisher 1993; Hubscher 1999; Worboys 1991 and Worboys 1992; Wilkinson 1992; Woods 2004, Woods and Matthews 2010, Woods 2011 and Woods 2013; Waddington 2004 and Waddington 2006; Hardy 2003; Schäffer and Koolmees 2003; Berdah 2018). In France however, this nineteenth-century mandate was defective in the sense that veterinarians were only responsible for the control of contagious animal diseases, mainly at the borders and in some fairs and markets. That meant non-qualified practitioners were still able to perform medicine for animals as long as their diseases were not spreading to others. These practitioners maintained their influence in most parts of the country, all the more given that qualified veterinarians were few in number, and still lacking prestige and reputation, despite famous representatives (Hubscher 1999; Berdah 2012). In some countries such as Germany or the Netherlands, the control of contagion drove veterinarians towards their involvement in the protection of public health, through the careful control of milk and meat in slaughterhouses, engaging themselves forward in the career of civil servants (Koolmees 1988; Mitsuda 2017). French veterinarians followed the same path, with the creation of the status of departmental veterinarians (later veterinary officers) in charge of meat inspection in slaughterhouses, in 1909. However, this professional segment was unappealing to the large majority of practitioners, more prone to private practice, as the working conditions (salary, number of colleagues, number of slaughterhouses to inspect, fairs and markets under their jurisdiction…) varied a lot, depending on local administrative authorities (Conseil Général Vétérinaire 2006). Thus, despite the recognition of their ability to prevent contagion to either humans or animals, veterinarians were still “not quite a professionFootnote 1” in the first quarter of the twentieth century. This paper focuses on the development of the French veterinary profession in the twentieth century and reveals a completely different image of France often depicted as a state-controlling country through a body of civil servants, centralizing decisions and power in Paris. On the contrary, the French government in the 1930s appears reluctant to engage itself financially in the control of animal diseases and more prone to favour local and private initiatives. This article argues that, in that special configuration, contrary to other professions such as physicians or lawyers (Friedson 1988 (1986); Karpik 1995) and to veterinarians in most of the occidental countries, French veterinarians took assistance not only from the State in the development of their profession but also from other social worlds such as private laboratories producing therapeutic substances, as well as farmers. This article will follow the trajectory of the serum against foot-and-mouth disease—a disease disastrous for agricultural production—from the very first researches on viruses and immunization to the production of “immunizing agents” by veterinarians from the veterinary services or by private laboratories. Based on various sources—national archives from the Ministry of Agriculture and its veterinary services; archives from the expert body of contagious animal diseases: the Advisory Committee on Epizootics (Comité Consultatif des Epizooties); archives from private pharmaceutical industries; professional veterinary journals and some interviews of retired veterinarians—this paper will study how this special relationship with farmers and pharmaceutical industries served the development of the French veterinary profession. Building on their success against foot-and-mouth disease, veterinarians demonstrated how the control of contagious diseases was not only a matter of dealing with sick animals but also of preserving the healthy from infection, thanks to their expertise on the making and using of sera. In doing so, veterinarians developed an interaction network between humans (veterinarians, industrialists, farmers) and non-humans (sera and vaccines) essential for the extension of their monopoly from the medicine of contagious animals to the medicine of all animals, where the use of the “syringe” was to be a decisive mediator into the establishment of a confidence relationship between farmers and veterinarians. The paper argues finally that this use of syringes containing sera—and later vaccines—reinforced the medical role of veterinarians who saw both financial benefits in the direct sale of these products and also the core meaning of their work as practitioners of animal medicine.",

Kjæmpenes,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"It is remarkable that Norway, a country with a large fish production sector, has changed its veterinary legislation and allowed two professions to share jurisdiction over fish health. Practitioners of the new profession, aqua medicine biologists,Footnote 1 are juxtaposed to veterinarians and may prescribe veterinary medicine for aquatic animals with the exception of marine mammals. A complex professionalization process with many actors involved at different times led to the sharing of work equally between veterinarians and aqua medicine biologists in fish health. An important event that started this process was the disease outbreaks in fish farms in the mid-1980s. The outbreaks were threatening the whole industry, and the use of antibiotics increased even more rapidly than the production of farmed fish. Scientists from the marine research milieu developed an effective cold-water vibriosis vaccine in 1987. This knowledge breakthrough was a decisive factor for the division of work between the two professions. Since the 1990s, Norway, as the leading salmon producer in the world, has increased its production with almost no use of antibiotic agents. In a global context, this is unique (Grave and Brun 2016, p. 73). To gain more insight into the driving forces that have led to this unique situation in which two professions share jurisdiction over tasks in a new field of work, I apply a sociology of profession approach. The theoretical framework that brings together an actor perspective (Burrage et al. 1990) and a perspective from inter-professional competition (Abbott 1988) enables the systematization of empirical data while at the same time incorporating other theoretical perspectives (Kjæmpenes 2013). In the investigation, I focus on the scientific, professional and institutional controversies arising from the crisis caused by endemic disease outbreaks in the mid-1980s as well as on the debate that followed upon the veterinary legislation. In “The data collection and analytic framework” I present the analytic framework for the analysis and detail how I reassembled data from earlier comparative research and supplied new material for analysis. “The Norwegian veterinary profession and aqua medicine biologists” section consists of a short presentation on the development of the Norwegian aquaculture industry and its role as a user of professional services. In “The aquaculture industry in Norway—a brief introduction to the users of professional services” and “Fish disease outbreaks and knowledge discourse in the 1980s” sections, I examine the scientific, professional and institutional processes that led the state to award shared jurisdiction in fish health to two professions. The focus will be on scientific controversies that arose during the fish health crisis in the mid-1980s, the establishment of fish health education and the legislative debate that followed. In “The reopening of the Veterinary Surgeons Act—veterinarians lose their monopoly in fish health” section, there is a short discussion, which is followed by concluding remarks.",1

Professional expertise and business model of French “industrial” veterinarians,June 2021,Nicolas Fortané,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The problem of antibiotic use in livestock farming is not new. As soon as these molecules were introduced in agriculture in the late 1940s, there was controversy concerning the development of resistant bacteria in animals and food, and the risks of human contamination (Bud 2007). Yet for several decades, this issue has been eclipsed by the belief in a permanent renewal of the therapeutic arsenal, consisting in thinking that the continuous discovery of new antibiotics would compensate for the development of increasingly resistant bacteria (Podolsky 2018). After the Swann report in 1969, a series of measures to control the use of antibiotics as growth promotersFootnote 1 was nevertheless adopted in Europe, progressively separating the molecules used in agriculture and human medicine (Kirchhelle 2018). But 20 years later, during the avoparcin crisisFootnote 2Footnote 3Footnote 4Footnote 5 these measures were considered ineffective (in the sense that they did not prevent the transmission of resistant bacteria between humans and animals) and the use of antibiotics as growth promoters was finally banned in the European Union in 2003Footnote 6 (Kahn 2016). The problem of antibiotic use in livestock farming as we know it today re-emerged in the late 2000s, this time focusing on veterinary uses, i.e. on curative or preventive uses with veterinary prescription (Fortané 2019). Veterinarians were directly accused of being responsible for the overuse and misuse of antibiotics (and therefore for the spread of resistant bacteria) on the basis of a fairly simple argument: their supposed professional “conflict of interest”. Indeed, in France, since the 1975 Act on veterinary pharmaceuticals, vets have had a dual monopoly on the prescription and supply of medicines (Hubscher 1999). Even if, in theory, delivery is shared between three beneficiaries (veterinarians, pharmacists and approved co-operatives), vets capture the vast majority of the curative drug market (of which antibiotics constitute the main category) (Guillemot and Vandaële 2009). The argument that veterinarians over-prescribe antibiotics in order to increase their incomes then became the main framing of the AMR problem. This construction of the problem was in reality carried by a coalition of human health actors (doctors, pharmacists, health administration) whose political agenda was twofold. On the one hand, they defended a measure that crystallized the debates around the years 2009–2013: the “decoupling” of prescription and delivery, which consists in applying the professional and economic model that prevails on the human drug market, i.e. reserving prescriptions to physicians and sales to pharmacists. Decoupling basically means forbidding veterinarians from selling pharmaceuticals, as is the case in countries such as Sweden or Spain (Fortané 2016). On the other hand, this coalition supported the concept of “critically important antibiotics”, the principle of which is to reserve certain molecules, in particular the latest generations of antibiotics, for human medicine. From a political and institutional point of view, this period was extremely interesting because it put the spotlight on definitional and jurisdictional conflicts between different social groups for the control of the legitimate use of antibiotics. It finally ended in a relative victory for veterinarians who succeeded, at the end of an unprecedented mobilization, in reversing the stigma that human health stakeholders assigned to them. Indeed, vets have been able to impose the image of a profession that is not guilty of overusing antibiotics but which is instead accountable for their proper use. The notions of prudent, judicious, rational or responsible use, now widely used in AMR debates, are thus a social construct produced by conflicts between social groups for the definition of the legitimate use of antibiotics (Fortané 2019). This veterinarian victory led to the withdrawal of the two emblematic measures (decoupling of prescription and delivery; ban on critically important antimicrobials) supported by the coalition of human health actors. In return, a stricter framework for the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry was implemented between 2014 and 2016: margins on the sale of antibiotics are now limited and the retail price of antibiotics must be the same for every client,Footnote 7 and antimicrobial susceptibility tests are mandatory for the prescription of critically important antibiotics.Footnote 8 But once again, the most important part of this victory certainly concerns the changes regarding the image of the profession. Indeed, veterinarians not only reversed the stigma and positioned themselves as guardians of antibiotics, they were also able to re-appropriate the problem by highlighting the way they could solve it. Without denying that the economic model of the profession was too financially dependent on antibiotic sales, and that antibiotic use may have been too prevalent in animal care in the past, vets started to defend the development of preventive approaches which would, according to them, be the only way to ensure the transition towards an economic and professional model guaranteeing responsible use of antibiotics. This view was reinforced and supported by farmers and public authorities who also called for the development of such approaches which are usually promoted by national AMR policies (Fig. 1) in France and in other countries (Badau 2016; Piquerez 2019). Promoting preventive approaches to reduce veterinary use of antimicrobials Footnote 9 At the heart of this new prospective narrative for the profession and its role in managing the AMR problem, we can observe the construction of a (supposedly) new conception of animal health, which is not based on a strictly clinical approach to diseases but on a holistic vision of animals and livestock farming (biosecurity, hygiene, nutrition, good husbandry practices, etc.). In the posters above, veterinarians are portrayed as the gatekeepers of such an approach, through their transversal role as “health advisors”. This professional model, based on the knowledge and practices of preventive approaches to animal health, goes hand in hand with an economic model where the incomes of veterinary businesses would be more diversified since these new “health advisors” would be able to monetize a wider range of goods and services (hygiene and nutrition products, bacteriological analyses, livestock audits, etc.) than just pharmaceuticals. Could we look beyond the symbols and images of professional and political discourses and see whether these preventive approaches that might change the way veterinary medicine is practiced, and how antibiotics are used, rely on actual knowledge and practices and, if so, where and since when? The fact is that this model of preventive veterinary medicine seems in reality to be quite typical of a very particular segment of the veterinary profession, the one this article proposes to describe, namely industrial vets. The remainder of the article thus seeks to address the following two questions: is this form of professional expertise really perceptible in the field, and is its development truly linked to the global context of the AMR problem and to recently implemented policy measures, or does it have other origins and raisons d’être that might actually offer new insights into the understanding of the current transformations within the veterinary profession?",8

The sociology of the professions has indeed shown that a professional group does not operate in a vacuum. A profession is likely to reconfigure itself according to the mandates given to it by society and the state (Abbott 1988; Bonnaud and Fortané 2018). At the same time, the sociology of social movements highlights the fact that the “space of social movements” (Mathieu 2012) is in constant interaction with social universes that are external to it and that are far from being limited to the political field, as shown, for example, by works on insider activism (Briscoe and Gupta 2016). With the concept of “configuration”, Norbert Elias (1978) asks us to go beyond the boundaries sometimes implied by the notion of social groups, in order to examine the interdependencies that structure them. The existence of relationships between animal advocates and veterinarians is therefore possible beyond the mere structural difference between a militant group and a professional group. This possibility is even enhanced by the many changes that these social groups have undergone since their creation. Animal advocates in France are part of a social movement with multiple factions and forms of engagement (Traïni 2010, 2019; Carrié 2015b; Poirel 2016). Since the work of Maurice Agulhon (1981), this phenomenon has been widely highlighted by a literature that regularly questions this heterogeneity and which proposes multiple qualifiers to designate the “animal cause” (Traïni 2011, 2015), the “animal rights struggle” (Traïni 2011, 2015), or the “multiple forms of engagement in animal protection” (Traïni 2019), the “ideological nebula of animal advocates” (Carrié 2015b) or “pro-animal” activism (Michalon 2019). In symmetry with the terminology used for other causes, we propose here to use the terms “animal advocacy” and “animal advocates” to refer to all of the different fractions of pro-animal movements and to the activists who are or have been involved in them. This debate has not prevented the emergence of a consensus emphasising the three-way division of ideologies, practices and “emotional registers” (Traïni 2011, 2015) mobilised by animal advocates. We propose here to summarise the debate by distinguishing between “reformer” animal advocates (as from the mid-nineteenth century), “animal sensitivity” advocates (also referred to as “sensitivists”) (as from the end of the nineteenth century) and the third wave of animal advocates, divided into “animal welfare” advocates (also referred to as “welfarists”) and “animal rights” advocates (from the mid-twentieth century onwards). In addition to the apparent unity that their status as a profession confers on them today, veterinarians are characterised by a multitude of specialisms and professions (Hubscher 1999; Fritsch 2011) which makes them a composite professional universe. Over the course of their history, the veterinarians who originally oscillated between an agronomic and a medical approach from the end of the eighteenth century to the mid-nineteenth century underwent a process of medicalization from the late nineteenth century onwards, before becoming prime actors of sanitary action regarding livestock farming in the mid-twentieth century in France. The “Atlas démographique de la profession vétérinaire” (demographic atlas of the veterinary profession) (ONDPV 2020) lists 18,874 veterinarians registered with the Order in France at the end of 2019. Most of them practise one or more of the three main specialisms. The equine specialism on which the veterinary profession was based originally is today practised exclusively or predominantly by only 6% of veterinarians. The rural specialism (equivalent to the large animal specialism or farm animal specialism in Great Britain) concerns domestic livestock (cattle and others) and is mainly practised on farms. Marked by a continuous and long-lasting decline in the number of its practitioners, it is now a majority specialism for just 19% of veterinarians, while the canine specialism (equivalent to the small animal specialism or companion animal specialism in Great Britain) which is more recent, is dedicated to dogs, cats and other new pets and concerns 71% of veterinarians. These specialisms are mainly practised in veterinary surgeries. Veterinarians can also be civil servants, working for the most part in the state’s veterinary departments, which in 2016 employed over 2100 veterinarians. The members of this “evolving corps” (Fritsch 2009) play a role in health inspection, health control and animal protection in slaughterhouses. For both animal advocates and veterinarians, the representations, knowledge, practices and social origins of the members of these social groups differ according to the period, factions and specialisms analysed. This heterogeneity increases the possibility of intersections between the histories of animal advocates and veterinarians. To account for this, we propose here to question the existence and form of relationships between animal activists and veterinarians over time by examining the state of their knowledge and their representations (cognitive convergence or divergence), their simultaneous presence in the same organisations or, conversely, in competing organisations (relational convergence or divergence), their socio-demographic characteristics (social convergence or divergence) and the use of common practices or modes of action (practical convergence or divergence). In the light of these criteria, we then offer an ideal-typical accountFootnote 1 of the existence and nature of their irenic or conflictual relationships.",

Investigating legume-serving, legume-cooking and legume-sourcing through France in 2019",September 2021,Marie-Benoit Magrini,Hugo Fernandez-Inigo,Olivier Pauly,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"One main issue of sustainable diets is to promote eating habits that are good for both human and environmental health (FAO, 2012). This issue represents a great challenge for agrifood systems, and new concepts have been developed such as “nutrition-sensitive agriculture” (Jaenicke & Virchow, 2013), “ecological public health” (Lang & Rayner, 2012) or “environmental nutrition” (Sabaté, 2019). Each one calls for a more integrative conception of food and agricultural systems (Garnett, 2011; Hallström et al., 2015; Meynard et al., 2017). Among the levers for a sustainability transition of agrifood systems, developing legumes presents both environmental and nutritional benefits. Legumes include soya and pulses (crops such as lentils, beans or chickpeas). Firstly, they mean a reduction in nitrogen fertilization through crop rotations, thereby contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions (e.g. Peoples et al., 2019). Secondly, they contribute towards improving nutrient balance particularly in fibres and proteins, especially in regard to issues on reducing animal-based protein consumption (Hallström et al., 2015; Marlow et al., 2015; Vainio et al., 2016). Nevertheless, the re-launching of legumes in Western countries faces lock-ins, in both production and consumption, and particularly in Europe (Magrini et al., 2016, 2018). On the production front, the challenge is to promote sustainable farming systems that include more legumes with more diversity, without an increase in imports which are already high. On the consumption front, compared to major crops such as cereals, legume consumption is very low: 4.7 kg/year/person for pulses and 110 kg/year/person for wheat (Eurostats). Legumes require soaking and longer cooking times, are often associated with digestive problems (flatulence), have an old-fashioned image and are subject to “erroneous and limited mental representations” about how to cook them and associate them with other ingredients to create tasty and healthy dishes (Melendrez-Ruiz et al., 2019). In addition, there is a clear lack of innovative pulse-based foodstuffs (Niva et al., 2017; van der Weele et al., 2019). Finding ways to increase legume consumption is difficult, as it is not easy to change eating habits. This paper investigates a specific sector considered as a great driver for agrifood sustainability transition: food services, also known as cateringFootnote 1. Food services is an expanding sector, influencing eating habits and also impacting agrifood systems through their food supply chain organisations. Traditionally, catering is divided into two categories (Bourlakis & Weightman, 2003; Edwards, 2013): (i) the “profit sector” that comprises profit-orientated establishments such as restaurants, fast-food chain outlets, cafes, takeaways, pubs, leisure and travel catering outlets and (ii) the “cost food services sector”, which typically refers to non-profit catering activities for businesses, education and healthcare, often labelled as “institutional food services” (IFS). The IFS sector is daily frequented by employees, pupils, students, patients and the elderly in workplaces, schools, universities, hospitals or retirement homes. Our study focuses on the IFS sector, being deemed more likely to influence eating habits than the profit-orientated sector (as assumed by French public policies through, for instance, the obligation to introduce at least one vegetarian meal every week in school canteens since the 1st November 2019). Hence, the objective of our study is to describe legume uses in IFS in order to identify brakes and levers for their promotion in IFS, particularly with regard to sustainable practices, such as their use in vegetarian dishes. We focus on France where legume consumption is very low (2 kg/year/person, Graph’Agri, 2019) but which provides the highest number of meals served through the IFS sector in Europe (4 billion per year). We considered the two models dividing the IFS sector (Stahlbrand, 2016 ; Xerfi, 2015): the contracting-out model (40% of the IFS market in France and the largest in Europe) with around 1000 private companies, under contract with institutions or companies that do not directly manage their own catering services, and the self-managing model (60% of the French IFS market), where institutions or companies manage their own catering servicesFootnote 2. Moreover, whilst several studies advance the idea that the IFS sector is a facilitator in promoting sustainable agrifood systems (Edwards, 2013; Graça et al., 2019; Jones et al., 2019; Vainio et al., 2016), only some take into account both environmental and nutritional issues. Most studies deal either with questions of waste reduction (e.g. Derqui et al., 2018; Martin-Rios et al., 2018), food safety (e.g. De Boeck et al., 2019), nutritional and dietary standards in meals (e.g., Vieux et al., 2013, 2018), health (e.g. Decataldo & Fiore, 2018) or local supplying (Orlando et al., 2019; Stahlbrand, 2016). But none of them consider IFS sustainability transition in a more integrative way. To do so, we built a socio-technical analytical framework on three main dimensions: (i) frequency and diversity of legumes served; (ii) cooking methods and alternative dishes (vegetarian/vegan)Footnote 3 with legumes; and (iii) legume-sourcing through supply chain organisations and eco-labels. We used several sources of information (open-ended interviews, literature and reports on the IFS sector) to build a wide survey addressed to IFS kitchens in France between April and August 2019 (i.e. before the experimental obligation to introduce vegetarian meals in school canteens). We selected 383 complete answers to describe kitchens’ practices including legume uses. Through clustering methods, we identified heterogeneous profiles regarding legume uses and commitment to sustainability. This study provides original insights on the levers to develop legumes in a sustainable way, especially to support the development of vegetarian dishes. Section 2 marks out the analytical framework. Section 3 explains the methodology we followed. Section 4 presents and discusses the results. Section 5 concludes.",6

Despite government denials, scientists have once again stated that most of these fires started in deforestation areas and with the objective of clearing land for agricultural and cattle production (Hecht & Rajão, 2020; Rajão et al., 2020). However, what remains unclear is the complexity of the conflicts that hinder the construction of economic alternatives based on the sustainable management of the forest. To shed light on a small piece of this complex social puzzle, this study analyzes nongovernmental organizations’ (NGOs) engagement strategies to attract local actors to a feasible narrative of sustainable development for the Amazon. In the first decade of this century, several public policies, programs, projects, laws, and rules have prioritized the “valorization of the standing forest.” Among the most important initiatives were the Pilot Program for Tropical Forest Protection in Brazil (i.e., PPG7), a multi-stakeholder international initiative coordinated by the Brazilian Ministry of the Environment; the Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon; and the creation, in 2008, of the Amazon Fund, which became the most important financing mechanism for community-based forestry businesses. All these initiatives revealed an important change in the strategies of both the state and the NGOs, from a purely “preservationist” intervention to a narrative that, instead of advocating forest protection from the market, maintain that the conservation of socio-biodiversity depends on the economic valuation of forest assets via new productive practices and fair-trade markets (Abramovay, 2019; Frizo, 2019). A major problem faced by the actors involved in executing these projects has always been how to engage local farmers. In addition to the creation of innovative businesses, the rise of eco-economics also depends on the conversion of environmental-predatory producers into actors of sustainability (Carneiro, 2008). Accordingly, the research question is as follows: What narratives have been produced by the NGOs to engage farmers in their projects for the sustainable development of the Amazon? This question emerges in consideration of two contemporary approaches in the New Economic Sociology regarding the production of collective action. First, it assumes that “institutional entrepreneurs,” skillful actors—operating the political construction of new markets by mobilizing resources to foster cooperation—play a key role (Fligstein & McAdam, 2012). Complementarily, it highlights the importance of narratives of the future—“fictional expectations” (Beckert, 2016)—as a major resource for such actors in these processes. Finally, from the institutionalism and organization studies, it states that strategies to produce engagement are built in face of institutional complexity (Greenwood et al., 2011), since organizations have to deal with and adapt to different norms, rules, and values—i.e., institutional prescriptions—that orients other social actors decisions to engage or not. The study was conducted in Apuí, one of the target municipalities of Brazilian public policies aimed at combating deforestation in the Amazon. The data stem from observations, documental analyses, and interviews conducted in 2017 with farmers, researchers, social leaders, rural extensionists, and policymakers. Because of its relevance in the local context, we focused mainly on the engagement strategies employed by the Amazonian Institute of Conservation and Sustainable Development (IDESAM), a Brazilian organization whose projects—mainly sponsored by philanthropic institutions—focus on structuring sustainable value chains for forestry products. This NGO’s work in the Brazilian Amazon is more focused on reverting deforestation in municipalities that have relatively higher rates of deforested areas. We also analyzed the work developed in Apuí by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). The rest of this article is organized into three sections. The next section presents the theoretical and methodological framework. Subsequently, another section discusses the study’s empirical context. Then, we analyze the projects developed by IDESAM to understand the engagement mechanisms created by this organization. Finally, we conclude that to connect farmers’ projects, this NGO changed its discourses from a preservationist focus that criticized the effects of the marketization of nature to another one that, closer to the economic concerns of local actors, highlights the construction of new markets as a route to sustainability.

A critical review of ‘Seeds of power. Environmental injustice and genetically modified soybeans in Argentina’, (A. Leguizamón) 2020, Duke University Press, 221 p",December 2021,Pierre Delvenne,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Chapter 1 explores the “folktales” of Argentina in order to put the soy model into historical perspective, starting with the mythical guiding fictions that were instrumental in setting the basis of Argentine nation. Leguizamón carefully disentangles the cultural and symbolic dimensions ingrained in the minds of the intellectual and economic elites which governed the country for two centuries, turning a former Spanish colony into an agro-exporting nation. In the first part of the chapter, the cultural roots she explores vary from Sarmiento’s civilization/barbarism dichotomy, to Alberdi’s ‘civilization program’ to populate the desert with European immigrants (and eradicate, or at least tame, indigenous people), to Argentina’s belle époque thinking of itself as the “granary of the world”. In the second part of the chapter, Leguizamón explains the political-economic context in which radical changes (Peron’s Import Substitution Industrialization model, the Green Revolution, the 1976 military coup, the “lost decade” of neoliberal reforms under Carlos Menem’s presidency) but also lasting continuities (the efforts to tame people from the countryside, the structural social and economy inequalities, the deep-rooted tendency to extractivism, the strong reliance on science and technology as engines of modernization and progress) took place, setting the scene for the early adoption, and significant expansion, of GM soybean cultivation. The chapter ends with a central piece in the legitimation of the neoliberal soy model (and the acquiescence of the environmental injustice coming with it) designed in the 1980s: so-called “new extractivism” as a mode of governing, which culminated with the arrival of Nestor and Cristina Kirchner to power at the turn of the millennium, in which the state controls a larger share of the revenues from commodity exports and uses the generated surplus to fund redistribution policies. The chapter closes with a brief description of the massive protest in 2008 (the ‘conflicto del campo’) demonstrations against the Kirchner government, when soy producers hit the street and complained about the President’s decision to increase export taxes on soybeans, which was the only parenthesis of Argentine history where glyphosate found itself in the center of public debates. Chapter 2 begins with the description of the progressive transformation of the farm into a factory (including the rise of contratistas, rural contractors hired by soybean producers to plant, spray and harvest the crops). Leguizamón explains this happens in line with ecological modernization theories: not only are machines expected to relieve workers from hard physical labor, this agro-industry also thrives on the “promise that technological innovation will lead to sustainable development and that GM crops will ‘feed the world’” (p.62). She convincingly argues that new actors join the farming business and operate at a distance, fueling the ‘revolution in the Pampas’, i.e. the new agricultural paradigm, boosted by the adoption of the technological package and in which knowledge is the most important means of agricultural production (p.63). The chapter then focuses more specifically on those actors “in-between the power spectrum” and it revolves around a puzzle that becomes central to the book: while they certainly suffer the harmful effects of the cultivation of transgenic soy (in particular, the spraying of agrochemical herbicide) in their bodies and their environment, the actors she meets (i.e., in soybean farms, or along the villages abandoned after the rural exodus pushed by the industrialization of agriculture) limit themselves to repeating that they “all live off the countryside” and that there are little negative impacts to their model of agriculture. In so doing, she contends, they conceal, minimize or invisibilize the negative impacts of soy cultivation. The reason, according to Leguizamón, is the alliance between corporations, the state and the mass media, which manipulate the perceptions of the community and constantly reassure it by invoking the state of scientific knowledge about the danger of agrochemicals (especially glyphosate), in order to emphasize the potential for development that accompanies the soy boom. From this point on, chapter 3 aims at “delving into the micro-level of social interactions and emotions to show how acquiescence is enacted in everyday life” (p.95). It relies primarily on ethnographic fieldwork conducted in the rural town of Santa María, whose data are laid out to serve a central argument: in public, men and women agree on the immense benefits brought to the countryside by the soy boom (repeating the narrative “we all live off the countryside”) but, in private, women cautiously and hesitantly expose their doubts about the health problems associated with agrochemical fumigation, what the author names “latent grievance”. A limited number of field stories, very well contextualized, are mobilized to “prove how successful and efficient the workings of power have been to create […] consent around GM soybean extractivism” (p.96). According to Leguizamón, this reflects the fact that the emerging concerns raised more or less explicitly by the women “in the safety of kitchens and courtyards” (p.98) ultimately result in silencing, self-policing and denial of health and environmental injustices. In Chapter 4, Leguizamón broadens the spectrum of actors involved in synergies of power and considers the dynamics and collective social mobilizations, as well as their results, of “gendered and racialized subjects” who do not benefit at all from the soy model and who suffer harshly from its health and environmental consequences. Specifically, she draws on two extended fieldworks: one with the Grupo de Madres de Barrio Ituzaingó Anexo, an iconic group of mothers engaged in popular epidemiology activities (joining forces with scientific and professional experts to demonstrate harmful environmental health effects) to protect their communities suffering from leukemia and other cancers; and another with the Asemblea Malvinas Lucha por la Vida, a coalition of neighbors that organized to “say no to Monsanto” in a village of the Córdoba region. The discussion also looks at the impact of these movements (or lack thereof) nationally and internationally, their intersection with other struggles, but also the obstacles they face from corporate and political elites, whose strategies Leguizamón dissects. Throughout the book, the author analyzes the strategies by which state and corporate actors have managed to generate acquiescence and consent to a seemingly unjust and inequitable agricultural model. She argues that “structural inequities of class, gender, and race operate across the macro-, meso-, and micro-level of the Argentine political economy of soybean extractivism” (p.141). Her work encourages environmental sociologists and social scientists to look at those who are ‘in-between’ on the power scale, i.e. who benefit to some extent while bearing the costs to another extent, in order to tease out the power dynamics at play in health and environmental struggles. Seeds of Power will be very useful for social scientists working at the intersection of rural studies, environmental justice and social science. In addition, it is elegantly written, in such a way that no prior academic knowledge is required to appreciate its content. The writing style chosen also allows for regular use of ethnographic vignettes which are very useful in contextualizing and personalizing the story.",

Gray,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The development of effective crop breeding systems was one of the most important achievements of the twentieth century. Agricultural productivity growth over the past 100 years, in part driven by improved crop genetics, has enabled the sector to feed six times the population, with approximately eight times as much grain, at a small fraction of the real prices that existed a century ago (Alston et al., 2009). Public and private plant breeding has contributed significantly to this productivity growth by continually developing improved cultivars which are higher yielding and more pest resistant that previous cultivars. These accomplishments of plant breeders are only reflected in productivity once quality seed from the varieties is made available to farmers (Productivity Commission, 2011). Modern crop breeding has co-evolved with seed value chains, where extensively regulated pedigreed seed growers propagate and multiply small quantities of breeder seed to larger quantities of certified seed (CS) sold to farmers meeting purity and performance standards. These seed value chains also typically support a seed royalty collection from the sale of pedigreed seed, collected and returned to the breeder to fund breeding activity. In most self-pollinating crops such as wheat, barley, peas, and soybeans, high-quality seed can be produced by saving, cleaning, and conditioning the previously harvested crop. This use of farm saved seed (FSS) competes with and can reduce the scope of activities of commercial seed growers that sell certified seed to farmers. As the basis of the international Union for the Protection of Plant Varieties (UPOV) conventions, many of the institutions, regulations, and practices for domestic seed industries have become common international practice (Gray et al., 2017). Despite widespread membership in UPOV conventions, there is considerable variation in the roles the certified seed and farm saved seed play in seed production across crops and across jurisdictions. Where there are hybrid crops, intellectual property rights or regulation prohibiting the sale of farm saved seed, the commercial seed sector provides nearly 100% of seed that farmers use each year. At the other extreme, which includes wheat in Australia, small quantities of breeder seed can be distributed to farmers without a certified seed system. More typically, as agreed to in the UPOV 1961 convention, the right to sell commercial seed variety by name is restricted to only certified seed growers who typically make the final sale to farmers. Once farmers have purchased a new variety, they have the right to save the seed of the new variety for subsequent seed use. In North America, farm saved seed often makes up 80% or more of the seed used each year. Depending on the crop and jurisdiction, the use of FSS may be royalty free or subject to reduced royalty rates. The use of farmer saved seed is a very controversial issue. Opponents to the practice argue farm saved seed is damaging to productivity because of lower seed quality and is damaging to breeding because of reduced royalty collection. Proponents of the practice argue that, given modern crops all came from thousands of years of farmer saved seed, saving seed is a producer’s inalienable right. Other proponents argue that FSS creates competition in seed production and the conditions for faster innovation because it lowers the cost of quality seed and can support funding models within modern crop breeding systems. I hold this latter view. In this article, I have been asked to outline the conditions where farm saved seed enhances agricultural productivity and the rate of innovation. In my brief discussion, I’m going to draw on international experience to show, depending on how crop breeding is funded, FSS can be a useful mechanism to lower the seed cost of production while accelerating innovation. While this discussion is unlikely to end any controversy over farm saved seed, it should help to clarify and contextualize some of these alternative perspectives and identify the conditions where FSS is, and is not, helpful for innovation. In this brief discussion, I’ll focus on open and/or self-pollenating field crops where farm saved seed has been most prevalent and on countries where there is a well-established pedigreed seed industry of certified seed to grain producers (hereafter referred to as farmers).",

West,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"One of the most celebrated motifs of the heritage foods movement is the French language term, terroir. Those who embrace the term generally suggest that products made by traditional methods express the environmental characteristics of the places in which they are made. They may also suggest that these products reflect the local knowledge and broader cultures of those who make them. Product, people, place—this is the terroir triad, and the concept asserts a profound and enduring relationship between these elements. In a world where middle-class supermarket shoppers’ needs are met “just-in-time” by global supply chains, in which multinational restaurant chains boast, for example, that their chicken nuggets are exactly the same no matter their source or where they are eaten, and in which transnational ag-biotech firms push the same genetically-modified staple crop seeds on farmers around the world, the terroir idea reasserts that foods are products of particular people in particular places, and that the best foods—in terms of taste, of livelihood provision, or of environmental sustainability—are ones that accentuate these linkages rather than diminishing them. By suggesting that we recognise and celebrate food as embedded in deeply historical and profoundly ecological contexts, the terroir perspective resonates with a recent turn in the social sciences toward consideration of the “more-than-human” world in which we live—one defined by bio-diverse ecological niches comprising animals, plants and microbes adapted to distinctive places, and by our dependence upon complex natural processes and relationships that shape us as much as we shape them (Whatmore, 2006; Bennett, 2007; Tsing, 2012; West, 2013b, p. 336; Sarmiento, 2017; Beacham, 2018; Elton, 2019). The terroir idea is, however, in tension with other contemporary emphases in the social sciences—ones suggesting that globalisation requires us to move beyond static conceptions of human “cultures” as clearly demarcated groups of people, in geographically discrete places, whose practices manifest deep historical continuity. In this article, I focus on how movement—whether of people, of products or even of food-making techniques and ideas—challenges the terroir concept. Following examination of how the terroir idea has historically linked products and people to particular places, and how this link is called into question in a world shaped by globalisation and movement, I use examples drawn from ethnographic fieldwork with cheesemakers to illustrate the implications of movement for conceptions of terroir.Footnote 1 I begin by showing how movement has in fact long been a part of the environments in which terroir traditions have historically developed and been sustained. I then show how such traditions, and their connections to place, have often been infused by hierarchical relationships between actors on shifting landscapes. The next section contrasts expansive movements by powerful actors such as church and state with the movements of marginalised actors making spaces and productive traditions their own. Subsequent examples show how histories connecting products, people and places may be complicated and “imperfect”, but the effectiveness of narratives about these linkages ultimately depends upon the perspectives and interests of tellers and their audiences. This leads to consideration of cases that reveal terroir as an idea with different meanings to different people—itself a product reflecting the natural and social environments into which it has expanded and in which it is (re)produced. I conclude that, if terroir is to have a place in the future food landscape, it must allow for more fluid, more complex relationships between people, product and place—in other words, terroir products must come to be seen as a movable feast.",2
103,1,"Review of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Studies",09 February 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41130-021-00159-7,"‘Local foods’ as trustworthy food: geographical proximity, social areas and interpersonal relationships",March 2022,Estelle Masson,Sandrine Bubendorff,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In a context where a growing number of consumers are questioning the true origin of what they eat, the growing interest in local foods seems to be part of a process allowing a sort of taking back ownership of food and rebuilding confidence in eating (Fischler & Masson, 2007). For a better understanding of the mechanic of this process, we propose to examine the social representations of local foods consumers (Moscovici, 1976; 2000; Lahlou, 1998, Masson, 2001). More specifically, we will focus here on how bakers and farmer-bakers’ regular customers perceive the organic sourdough bread they usually buy and eat, also on their values and imaginary associated with these local foods. We will see that the consumers interviewed see this local bread as a singular product as described and analysed by Karpik (2007; 2013). We will show that consumers conceive this bread as authentic, belonging to a cultural patrimonial but also that it is indistinguishable from craftsman skills attributed to a singular individual: the baker who is its creator. The patrimonialization, authenticity and personalization of this bread give it a new value and make it part of this economy of enrichment that Boltanski and Esquerre (2017) have described and conceptualised. By adopting a sociogenetic perspective of social representations (Jodelet, 2015; Kalampalikis & Apostolidis, 2019) we’ll show that this bread, which corresponds perfectly to the criteria used by socio-economists, geographers and economists to define local food, is above all conceived by consumers as a product resulting from and creating proximity. Their use of the notion of “proximity” and its polysemic meanings mainly concern the added value of the baker as a known individual anchored in a common socio-geographical space. The trust established by interpersonal relations between consumers and their baker or farmer-baker replaces the need to know and the desire to verify information and help to counter consumer uncertainty about food. In order to understand the appetence for local foods, it seems useful to emphasise the context of consumers’ mistrust of the modern food in rupture of which it is a part. The accelerating industrialisation of food production and processing over recent decades has widened the distance between consumers and what they eat (Dubuisson-Quellier, 2013; Masson, 2011; Rémésy, 2005). In a context of frequent food industry failings exposure in the media, Lévi-Strauss’s (1962) comment that ‘it’s not enough that a food is “good to eat”, it must also “be good to think” (Levi-Strauss, 2016: 90)’ seems particularly relevant. Indeed, the food scares that marked the end of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first centuries (Raude, 2012; Schwartz, 2001) have shaken consumer trust. The 1996 announcement that mad cow disease could be transferred to man was a real breaking point in the contemporary history of the food industry. The ensuing crisis over beef consumption (Setbon et al., 2005) was interpreted by the public authorities and media as a symptom of irrational fear based on a biased perception of contamination risks. However, this crisis could also be interpreted as an expression of outrage (Masson, 2011) that manifested in the form of a boycott of food that was shown in some way to be impure (Douglas, 1969). The perceived threat was more one of identity than health, because, together with the announcement of the contamination risk, the dark side of mass food production had been revealed. What the French public learnt from this was that modern husbandry techniques had turned herbivores into carnivores that cows had become cannibals. A transgression had been committed against the natural order of things (Lévi-Strauss, 2001). The mad cow disease crisis was not only revelatory; it also amplified existing concerns about modern food (Ferrières, 2006; Schwartz, 2001). It created confusion around food and exacerbated consumer wariness about the true origins of their food. Since that time, there have been continued exposures of food scandals by the media and by certain citizens’ associations (e.g. L214 in France), gradually turning mistrust to distrust. The fear of being deceived has led many consumers to feel alienated with regard to modern food and to want to take back ownership of their diet. Taking back ownership of one’s diet means taking control of what we eat. This movement is particularly noticeable in the current increase in ‘special diets’ (Fischler, 2015; Masson et al., 2018). Following a gluten-free, exclusively organic, vegetarian, vegan or locavore diet is akin to a behavioural adjustment. The characteristics specific to each of these new diets reveal on the one hand the multitude of concerns linked to today’s food trade (industrialisation, biochemical content, farming methods and location, etc.) and on the other the many different motivations based on distinct values (selfishness, eco-consciousness, altruism) (Feldmann and Hamm, 2015; Schwartz, 2006). However, in a context perceived as threatening, where the threat is not clearly identified but covers multiple and varied domains such as health, the environment, ethics, politics and economy, it is impossible to effectively verify everything. The kinds of knowledge needed to be able to have confidence in what we eat seem infinite compared with what is available to consumers or what they can reasonably envisage obtaining. Furthermore, having this information would not prepare them for possible misleading or fallacious information from food sector actors (Giddens, 1990). Self-production is sometimes idealised as a means to totally and rigorously control what goes on one’s plate, but it is often impossible to put into action (Masson and Debucquet, 2012). Delegating production to someone who is geographically as close as possible appears to be a satisfactory alternative in several ways. A number of authors who have studied local production (Dubuisson-Quellier and Le Velly, 2010; Lamine, 2005) and/or short food supply chains (Dufour and Lanciano, 2012; Maréchal, 2010; Vincq et al., 2010) have shown the diversity of virtues that consumers attribute to this kind of supply system. Regarding consumers’ reasons for seeking this sort of production, two aspects seem to emerge as particularly crucial for our study, namely the possibility of obtaining information on production processes and the possibility of verifying these empirically (Amemiya et al., 2008; Deverre and Lamine, 2010; Feldmann and Hamm, 2015). Amemiya et al. (2008) emphasised the fusion of proximity and the food’s supposed healthy quality that is brought about by the possibility of going to check in situ. These studies have often examined the concept of ‘local’ from the point of view of the number of intermediaries involved in the food supply chain (from production to sale). In other words, they have looked at concrete and measurable variables, where, for example, the number of kilometres between the raw materials and the finished product eaten by the consumer becomes an agreed element in the definition of ‘local’ (Chiffoleau, 2008; 2019; Pearson et al., 2011). They have tended to show that it is the idea of the objective possibility of tracing a product to its source and producer that reassures the consumer. Rather than focusing on those kinds of objective variables, we will question how the notion of proximity gives sense to local consumption. Taking a sociogenetic approach of social representations (Jodelet, 2015; Moliner & Guimelli, 2015; Kalampalikis & Apostolidis, 2016), we will analyze the significations for eaters of consuming organic bread made of natural sourdough, produced by artisanal or peasant bakers working and living near their homes. We will examine how proximity, understood on the one hand as pertaining to a shared cultural and geographic area and on the other as a reduced interpersonal distance, lessens the subjective distance between consumer and product and contributes to the re-enchantment in the sense of Weber (Weber, 2013) of food (Fischler and Masson, 2010). To do this, we based our work on qualitative information gathered from the clients of bakers and farmer-bakers producing organic sourdough bread. Bread was chosen as the subject of our research because it is not only a cultural food (Goody, 1982) with strong symbolic power but also a common food eaten every day by two-thirds of the French population (CREDOC, 2016). Moreover, as a processed product composed of just a few ingredients (flour, water and salt), it was an interesting food in terms of trying to understand consumer social representations of the local character of a finished product and its ingredients. Here, we will analyze the consumer narratives collected during the interviews as expressions of social thought understand ‘as a mental construction of objects in the world and as a source of form of life that have impact social becoming’ (Jodelet, 2015. p. 7). We will show how common sense thinking, by mobilizing polymorphic notions such as proximity, manages to give meaning to practices and endow them with meanings (Bruner, 1990) and how the consumption of bread produced by baker and farmer-bakers helps consumers ‘finding one’s way in social space’(Boltanski & Thévenot, 2015).",1

Stein,Fabien Santini,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Not least in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the promotion of local food systems and short supply chains is seen by some policy-makers as a means to increase the resilience of the food system. In this context, and harking back to the concept of “food miles”, the promotion of local food systems is also suggested as a means to improve the sustainability of the food system. For instance, during the pandemic, several European countries set up online platforms to give visibility to local food producers and connect them with consumers (ENRD, 2020); the European Committee of the Regions called for the promotion of local food production and of short supply chains, both in the context of the COVID-19 crisis and in view of the sustainability focus of the European Commission’s European Green Deal (CoR, 2021); and the European Commission itself acknowledged that calls for shorter supply chains intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic and it announced in its Farm to Fork Strategy that it will support reducing dependence on long-haul transportation to enhance resilience of regional and local food systems (EC, 2020a). At the same time, others warned that overreliance on local production may cause food shortages rather than help addressing food security (Glauber et al., 2020). Therefore, to inform policy-makers and the wider public discussion, we review the existing literature and summarise the evidence on the sustainability of “local” food, covering the environmental, social and economic dimensions of sustainability.",41

Many initiatives have flourished, as has a wide variety of organisations ranging from short supply chains with vague claims to official geographic indications (GIs). The term “local” may encompass either narrow locations or very large areas such as regions or even countries. As local food initiatives boom and continue to grow, it is worth examining the phenomenon to ascertain whether further action is necessary. In this issue of the Review of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Studies, Stein and Santini (2022) present a critical overview of agronomic and economic literature and conclude that local food does not guarantee food security and does not necessarily have a lower carbon footprint than ordinary food systems. Despite highlighting these relative inefficiencies, they nevertheless point out that local food may also contribute to other goals that matter to citizens, such as rural development and a sense of community (see also Stein & de Lima, 2022). Although this contribution by Stein and Santini (2022) offers a very interesting overview of current debates, several questions remain unanswered, which deserve attention. The purpose of this short article is to discuss some of these open and/or overlooked questions. Firstly, we present some questions related to the supply side followed by issues linked to the demand side before addressing possible policies. These various aspects are addressed from a public economics perspective.",

Faced with such risks, importing countries have always protected themselves by means of trade restriction measures that we now refer to as non-tariff measures, and more particularly as sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) measures. Often imposed unilaterally by importing countries or bilaterally with the agreement of partner countries, SPS measures have enjoyed an impressive boom since the beginning of the 1990s.Footnote 1 The development of national SPS regulations, as well as that of international trade disputes, quickly drew the attention of researchers in economics and social sciences. The former (the economists) have often focused on evaluating the distorting power of national SPS measures, by measuring their ‘barrier’ effect on international trade and social welfare (Calvin and Krissof, 1998; Beghin & Bureau, 2002; Disdier et al, 2008; Marette & Beghin, 2010). They generally arrive to the conclusion that, while national SPS standards can facilitate trade, they can also act as trade impediments, or, even worse, be voluntary used for protectionist purposes, showing so their deep political nature rather than their scientific legitimacy. The second (mainly researchers in law, political sciences or sociology) have questioned the capacity of actual multilateral trade regime to build a neutral and efficient international trade space, and in particular its capacity of resolving members’ trade disputes based on scientific knowledge (what is known as ‘science-based trade discipline’: Atik & Wirth, 2003; Bonneuil & Levidow, 2012; Wirth, 1994). They often conclude to the inefficacy of WTO’s trade regime, showing that international regulatory devices, as trade disputes resolution bodies or the very concept of risk, which should be neutral, technical and scientifically measurable objects, are in fact objects deeply political and partisan in nature. In this work, we try to contribute to the analysis of the impact of SPS measures on international trade in a third different way. Different in the sense that, on the one hand, we are interested in SPS measures promoted by international authorities (and not by national ones), and, on the other hand, we assume that these international standards may be inadequate not because they would be the result of a partisan selection process, but because, although based on scientific knowledge, they would be the result of a path-dependent selection mechanism (North, 1990) specific to international institutions of scientific expertise. With the application of the Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures in January 1995 (SPS Agreement, 1995), the WTO recognised that each member state has the right to impose trade restriction measures to ensure the safety of imported agricultural and agri-food products (art. 2.1). Nevertheless, while recognising this right, the main aim of the Agreement is to regulate the sovereign production of such restrictive measures in order to avoid duplication and protectionist excesses. To this end, the SPS Agreement entrusts science, and in particular scientific proof, with the role of assessing the validity of the restrictions imposed (art. 2.2) by proposing three conditions. The first is that the states base their requests for restrictive measures on internationally recognised scientific studies illustrating the extent of the risk involved and the validity of the requested restrictive measure (art. 2.2 and 3.3). The second condition is that, when faced with the choice of several equivalent restrictive measures (in terms of the level of quarantine security they provide), states prioritise those which minimise the economic impact on trade (art. 5.4 and 5.5). The third and final condition is that where international standards exist, states make every effort to comply with them (art. 3.1 and 3.2). International standards are determined by specialist international science-based bodies recognised by the WTO: the World Health Organisation together with the Food and Agriculture Organisation (WHO/FAO) with regard to all issues relating to food intended for consumption by humans and animals (e.g. Codex Alimentarius, maximum residue limits); the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), which prepares standards for managing epizootic risks (thus relating to animals); and the International Plant Protection Organisation (IPPO), which prepares standards for managing phytosanitary risks (thus relating to plants). In the case of interest to us here, plants, it is the IPPO which prepares the international phytosanitary risk management standards, referred to as ISPMs (International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures), based on suggestions submitted by the member states. To this end, the IPPO calls on groups of experts from around the world (EWGs) as well as scientific criteria on which there is a general consensus and which serve to evaluate the efficacy of the measures suggested. According to the WTO, the scientific nature of the work undertaken by these science-based international organisations (determination, evaluation and harmonisation of SPS standards) would be proof not only of the strictest efficacity of the standards developed but also of their utmost neutrality (Atik & Wirth, 2003; Bonneuil & Levidow, 2012; Wirth, 1994) compared to the SPS measures imposed by the states. In light of their singular and partisan nature, national measures could be suspected of reflecting political opportunism or disguised commercial protectionism. While there is a certain logic to the WTO’s position, we suggest that despite the eminently scientific work carried out by the specialist international organisations, there is no guarantee that the international standards they develop are either neutral (no partisan interests) or efficient (in the economic sense of the word). In this respect, we call on the theory of institutional path dependence developed by North (1990), according to which the existence of increasing returns of adoption combined with high transaction costs allows the persistence of sub-optimal standards over time, despite the existence of alternative solutions which are probably more efficient. More precisely, we suggest that, when international organisations choice a scientific criterion (one among others) to evaluate and select the most effective SPS treatments, and make it an evaluation standard, this criterion will be also subject to the risk of path dependence, because of its new institutional nature (that of standard). A better understanding of this problem (the path dependence of scientific standards), which we feel is insufficiently developed in the economic literature (compared to the path dependence of technical or institutional measures), would enable the international organisations tasked with developing phytosanitary standards to promote innovation and change, or at least to pay more attention to the weak signals of change coming from the communities of scientific experts. To support this point of view, we propose here to study the case of a ‘statistic’ largely known as ‘Probit 9’. This statistic is used systematically as a standard in the international processes of scientifically evaluating the efficacy of phytosanitary treatments. Our aim is to show that, while facilitating the emergence of highly robust (in statistical terms) SPS risk management systems, this standard (Probit 9) has prevented the emergence of other equally effective and potentially less costly risk management methods, leaving us to ponder this situation of ‘lock-in’ so typical of path dependence. In order to illustrate the relevance of this standpoint, we will use the case of ‘certified wooden pallets’ and the associated international certification standard, ISPM 15. This purely instrumental choice is based on the fact that certified wooden pallets are the most commonly used material element in global trade and that the standard used to certify them (ISPM 15) has, for a number of years, been the subject of criticism by the scientific community targeting the ‘Probit 9’ standard. Finally, the document is organised as follows: in the first section, we quickly recall the theoretical and methodological framework used in this case study. We then examine ‘Probit 9’ and the factual elements underpinning the success of this statistic and making it a ‘de facto’ international standard of evaluation. In the third section, we call on the existing scientific literature (and in particular that published by the community of entomologists) to show why this standard poses a problem with regard to certifying wooden pallets intended for use in international trade and, more broadly speaking, in research and innovation activities in the field of phytosanitary risk management. In the fourth section, we address the question of the institutional economics standpoint and return to the concept of path dependence before concluding.",

An ethnographic study of partnership working in the context of agricultural diffuse pollution,June 2022,Thomas Vetter,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Several benefits—and indeed hopes—have become associated with partnership working in agri-environmental governance. These benefits are usually presented in terms of their contributions to environmental, economic and/or social objectives. Whereas collaboration between farmers, for instance, may help avoid further landscape fragmentation (Emery & Franks, 2012; Leventon et al., 2017), reduce long-term transaction costs (Franks, 2011), help (re-)build social capital (de Krom, 2017; Mills et al., 2011; Wynne-Jones, 2017), and encourage peer-to-peer learning (Lucas et al., 2019), the inclusion of non-farming actors such as environmental charity groups within wider agri-environmental collaboratives promises more balanced and legitimate outcomes over competing demands through the generation of mutual trust and understanding (Prager & Vanclay, 2010; Prager, 2015a). These latter examples of multi-actor “partnerships for sustainability governance” (McAllister & Taylor, 2015, p. 86), in particular, have come to be viewed very positively for their wide-ranging contributions to more sustainable land management. According to Prager (2015a, p. 375) those contributions can include “policy implementation and service provision; coordination and mediation; awareness raising and behaviour change; […] maintenance and protection of landscapes […]; and income generation and economic benefits.” As such partnership working is understood as a vehicle for sustainable development (Prager, 2015a, 2015b), as much as it is seen as a conduit to foster more equitable, democratic and adaptive governance systems (Hahn et al., 2006). However, in contrast to these potential outcomes of partnership working, the actual ways towards them—including what it really means to work together on a day-to-day basis—have received little attention. So far, most studies have either approached the topic somewhat theoretically—by exploring the barriers, pathways and motivations of farmers to work together within potentially revised versions of the EU’s agri-environment schemes (Emery & Franks, 2012; Franks & Emery, 2013; Leventon et al., 2017)—or somewhat distanced, by gathering and contrasting the ex-post accounts of various actors involved in agri-environmental collaboratives (Enengel et al., 2011). More process- and practice-oriented research was rarely conducted and where this was done, the insights mainly derive from researcher-led focus group discussions (see, e.g., Leventon et al., 2017). The resulting narratives are therefore largely devoid of the social interactions and struggles that characterize partnership working, and most studies remain silent about the dynamics that emerge from such collaborative activities. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring the everyday aspects and meanings of partnership working. In particular, how do different stakeholders become trusted partners, bridge their interests and coordinate their actions? What codes of conduct become established within partnerships? Which spaces for discussion open-up or are closed down? How are different roles and characteristics reworked within such groups? And how does all this in turn affect the representation of the governance problems and the solutions at hand? Answers to these questions are not only important to better understand the factors that can contribute to successful ways of partnership working, but also to account for its limitations. Because, as McAllister and Taylor (2015, p. 87) pointed out “Partnerships are no panacea,” in spite of their potential benefits. As with any governance instrument, such modes of collective action entail costs and risks. They are embedded in power relations, they can become captive to certain interests, they may be lacking in transparency, accountability and inclusiveness (Dandy et al., 2014; McAllister & Taylor, 2015), and they may turn out to be counterproductive for bringing about change (Blühdorn & Deflorian, 2019; Turnhout et al., 2020). This paper will provide more clarity about this ambivalent picture of partnership working by exploring the example of Farm Herefordshire. This cross-organizational partnership addresses the problem of diffuse pollution from agricultural practices within the Wye catchment of the UK. The insights from this case study contribute to the literature on several fronts: First, the paper follows Prager’s (2015a) prompt to study such modes of collective action holistically and bottom-up to capture all their contributions and implications. It does so by employing an ethnographic research approach to investigate the social interactions, struggles and dynamics that characterize joint working. This commands attention to the backstories, the work meetings, the discussions, the processes of consensus building, and the joint actions undertaken. Second, and most notably, the paper connects with wider social science concerns around the underlying processes and practices of governmentality, which are essential for establishing social and ecological orders (Jasanoff, 2004). Thus, the paper explores how everyday practices of partnership working contribute to the co-production of institutions, discourses, identities, and representations which in this case all become strategically deployed to nudge—rather than revolutionize—better land management practices. Finally, the paper helps to fill an empirical gap. According to Emery and Franks (2012) most insights about environmental partnership working derive from case studies in Germany, Australia, and the Netherlands, yet detailed accounts of similar examples are largely missing for the UK (but see e.g. Dandy et al., 2014; Wynne-Jones et al., 2019). Overall, the insights of this case study draw a more nuanced picture of the contributions and limitations of partnership working, which should prove useful to inform and improve similar approaches elsewhere. The remainder of this article is structured as follows: The next section explains the theoretical perspective employed in this paper. This will be followed by the methodology (Sect. 3) and some background information about the Farm Herefordshire case study (Sect. 4). Section 5 then presents and discusses the co-products of partnership working, which will provide the basis for some concluding remarks in Sect. 6.",

Stein,Marcelo de Lima,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The sustainability of the global food system is high on the political agenda. The General Assembly of the United Nations included the goal of ensuring sustainable food production systems in its 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN, 2015). The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) described the objective of feeding a growing population, providing a livelihood for farmers and protecting the environment, as the “triple challenge” of food systems (Brooks et al., 2019). More recently, the European Commission published its “Farm to Fork” strategy for a more sustainable food system. One of its goals is to create a sustainable labelling framework that covers the nutritional, climate, environmental and social aspects of food products (EC, 2020). The European Economic and Social Committee also called for food labelling to improve transparency and to guide consumer choices towards healthier and more sustainable options (EESC, 2020). In this context, a critical review summarising the current state of knowledge on sustainability labelling of food products can support decisions by policy-makers and stakeholders in the food supply chain. In particular, we focus on how sustainability labelling can guide consumer choice, while allowing operators in the food supply chain to add value to their products. We present an overview of theoretical and applied aspects of sustainability labels and discuss the elements that would need to be taken into account by policy-makers when designing a comprehensive and ambitious labelling framework. We describe the implications of sustainability labelling, in particular of agri-food products, following a narrative approach. We review the literature based on an open selection of studies, given the wide field of research, where diverse methods are used in different contexts (Ferrari, 2015; Tallontire et al., 2012). We start by explaining how sustainability labels can be defined and how they can be differentiated and categorised. We then explain the purpose and limitations of sustainability labels, how they have evolved over time and how common they are. We also briefly address the business opportunities presented by sustainability labelling. We then describe the current state of the research on sustainability labels, focusing on the impact of labels on consumer choice and on suppliers, before discussing the sustainability concerns of consumers. We conclude by describing the elements needed for an effective labelling scheme, both in terms of label design and in terms of governance of the scheme.",3

With a point of departure in this need, the book “Sustainable Agri-food Systems. Case studies in Transitions Towards Sustainability from France and Brazil” goes in-depth on the challenge this transition is, and also details how French and Brazilian food actors take on this task and navigate in the different political and social contexts they are in. The author, Claire Lamine, is research director of sociology at the French National Institute for Agriculture,  Food and Environment (INRAE). She has long experience in the research fields that the book covers, and she is one of the most respected scholars in her field. The book ties many of the threads together that Lamine has worked with and the thinking that she has developed along the way. Thus, the book is an excellent introduction, not only to the topics it covers but also to the overall work of Claire Lamine. The book builds on food studies and rural sociology and has the overarching aim to contribute to the discussion about the sustainability transition in the food sector. The perspective Lamine takes, and advocates for, is a systemic, dynamic and pragmatist approach based on pragmatist sociology. Systemic, since the studies focus on the interactions and feedbacks between inter-related components of the agri-food sector, including actors, institutions, norms, and rules involved in all parts of the value chains. The dynamic stance emerges from the focus on transition, i.e., processes of transformation and change in relation to what Lamine calls “ecologization processes” in agri-food systems. The pragmatist approach means viewing agri-food systems as systems of actors and institutions with different viewpoints and aims that may enter into conflicts or alliances with each other (p. 2). Using this systemic, dynamic, and pragmatist approach, Lamine examines sustainability transitions at different scales and parts of agri-food systems in France and Brazil. The reason for choosing these two countries is obviously that Lamine has considerable research experience and empirical data from these contexts. However, it could also be argued (as Lamine does) that Brazil and France are two countries with a major agri-food industry, with many different food actors and controversies around sustainability issues connected to agri-food systems. Since the two countries are also very different, with different trajectories and foci of the controversies, their comparison provides relevant insights. Throughout the book, Lamine highlights a number of different case studies based in either France or Brazil to illustrate how different transition processes take place. Based on the declared approach and a comprehensive account of previous decades of research on agri-food systems sustainability, the book covers a number of scales of agri-food systems in the different chapters. Thus, Lamine moves from agriculture, over advisory systems and food value chains,Footnote 1 to regions and governance to capture the dynamics of different trajectories and controversies of sustainability transitions. There is no designated chapter on methods, but throughout the text, it emerges that Lamine mainly uses her own research carried out over a longer period of time in the two countries. She mainly draws on interviews, observations, the scrutiny of policy documents and deep insights into the two contexts covered.",

French local food policies in the making,September 2022,Jeanne Pahun,Eve Fouilleux,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The food we eat is at the centre of a complex system of interactions and a growing body of research is showing how capitalist food systems have a negative impact on both public health (Neff et al., 2015) and the environment (Lang & Barling, 2013). Transition to sustainable food systems requires not only changing our diets (Goodman et al., 2012) but also shifting food system governance towards more integrated policies (De Schutter et al., 2020; Lang & Barling, 2012). Although national food strategies are emerging in many countries, implementing “integrated” political management of a food system that simultaneously addresses all food-related issues is challenging and truly integrated food policies are far from being achieved (Candel & Pereira, 2017). As an illustration, French public policies explicitly labelled as “food policies” are twofold, focusing on nutrition on the one hand and on food quality market segmentation on the other hand, and it is notable that other ministries than the ministry of Agriculture were only very recently included in their making (Fouilleux & Michel, 2020). Although food and agricultural policies are increasingly open to new concerns (provision of ecosystem services, animal welfare, biotechnology, etc.) (Daugbjerg & Swinbank, 2012), national governance structures of the food system are still administered in silos (Fouilleux, 2021; IPES-Food, 2017). In contrast, several authors emphasise the fact that local policiesFootnote 1 are probably more capable of embracing the complexity of food systems. Territorial policies are sometimes analysed as synonyms of cross-sectoral approaches, either because they connect to the network of local actors in a horizontal and concerted manner (Southern, 2002; Hemphill et al., 2006), or because they adapt their public actions to local specificities (Trouvé et al, 2007). Among territorial policies, urban food policies are a good example of this recognition of the interconnected nature of food system challenges (Sibbing et al., 2021; Sonnino et al., 2019; Sonnino, 2017; Mansfield & Mendes, 2013) and “a trend to link specific policies and programmes through comprehensive urban food system strategies or plans” has been noted (Baker & de Zeeuw, 2015). Thus, after a period during which these issues were neglected, cities now seem to be increasingly interested in food issues, driven by citizens’ enthusiasm and by rising concerns including increasing urban food insecurity (Brand et al., 2019; Pothukuchi et al., 2000; Steel, 2013). This situation is even more acute in times of conflict and global trade disorders as the Russo-Ukrainian War revealed in 2022. Urban food initiatives are mushrooming and a network for connecting and sharing experiences among cities, the Milan Urban Food Policy Pact,Footnote 2 has even been created. Addressing food issues now appears to be compulsory for urban governments (Cretella, 2016; Dubbeling et al., 2015; Moragues-Faus & Morgan, 2015). Various institutional innovations have appeared, including food councils and urban food strategies (Jarosz, 2008; Morgan, 2015). In France, urban food policies are proliferating too (Brand, 2017) even though food regulation does not fall under the mandatory competence of local authorities. The growing literature that addresses urban food policies focuses on their scope (Candel, 2020; Sibbing et al., 2021), their institutionalisation (Sibbing & Candel, 2021), or their governance (Santo & Moragues-Faus, 2019; Termeer et al., 2018) but their practical implementation or “everydayness” remains understudied. In this paper, we analyse three French urban food policies with the aim of answering the following questions: beyond paper realities, how are urban food policies being implemented in municipalities, and how do they adress the intersectoral nature of the food system concretely? We compare food policies in three French urban areas, one metropolitan area with 500,000 inhabitants (Montpellier), one city area with 215,000 inhabitants (Rennes), and one case of a city food policy backed by a metropolitan government (Strasbourg, 280,000 inhabitants).Footnote 3 Our analysis targeted an in-depth understanding of early stages in the conception and implementation of these urban food policies. The food policy of Rennes is called the “City of Rennes sustainable food plan” (Plan Alimentaire Durable de la ville de Rennes). It was initiated in 2014 right after the municipal election, was formally launched in 2017, and ran until 2020.Footnote 4 The food strategy of Strasbourg is called the “Development strategy for local, sustainable, and innovative agriculture that meets the population’s food needs” (“Stratégie de développement d’une agriculture locale durable et innovante répondant aux besoins alimentaires de la population”). It was initiated in 2008 right after the municipal election and has since been regularly renewed. Montpellier metropolitan area’s food policy is called “Montpellier metropolitan area policy for agroecology and food” (Politique Agroécologique et Alimentaire de la Métropole de Montpellier). It was initiated in 2014 and voted in 2015. The three food policies were initiated after municipal elections with no major political changeover. Nevertheless, these elections were an opportunity to update the policies already implemented, backed against new political coalitions (in the case of Rennes) and citizen activism (Montpellier and Strasbourg). The first author collected empirical data on these three cases between 2016 and 2019. In addition to a wide review of the grey literature, she conducted 29 in-depth interviews with key stakeholders, including six elected officials (two in each study area), seven municipal/metropolitan agents (ibid), and 16 private or institutional partners involved in these policies. In addition, she undertook several series of participant observations on the ground, such as attending internal meetings and official events in the three cities.Footnote 5 Our enquiry covers a mid-range period, from the early 2000s to 2019. In this paper, our key issue is to understand intersectoral/integrated policies in the making while policy design is usually meant to be mainly sectoral. We chose to use the multi-dimensional framework of policy integration proposed by Candel and Biesbroek (2016), a reference in the policy study literature, which allows to explore policy integration dynamics. We use this analytical framework as a starting point to analyze the empirical material collected on our three urban food policies, and discuss the model based on both our literature review and our analytical results.   In the following sections, we first present our theoretical framework, which combines Candel and Biesbroek’s model and some insights from the literature on urban food policies. In the second section, we explore how cross-cutting food system issues were put on the political agenda of the three cities, in other words, how the need for integration was politicised. In the third section, we trace the multitude of partnerships established within the framework of these policies. In the fourth section, we show that despite positive indicators of political integration, the implementation of all three urban food policies suffers from serious organisational difficulties: lack of a specific administrative unit, understaffing, and low budgets committed. In the fifth section, we discuss the importance of considering the organisational resources dimension (including the allocation of appropriate budgets, the creation of specific units, and the appointment of trained staff) when it comes to assessing policy integration dynamics, a dimension not adequately highlighted in Candel and Biesbroek’s model.",3

Class-based approaches have likewise regained stature in the social sciences more broadly (Burlaud & Mauger, 2019), and there is potential for cross-fertilisation with the agri-food justice paradigm, provided the classes identified are relevant to the inequalities observed across the different fractions of these agricultural worlds. The lowest rung of social stratification in agriculture corresponds to the ‘social demotion of the small-scale peasantry’ (Bessière et al., 2014, p. 5): growers with insecure revenue despite some accumulation of patrimony (Laferté, 2014a, p. 431). At the highest rungs are found segments of the bourgeoisie and even the haute-bourgeoisie. This hierarchy coexists with a transversal segmentation of various Professions and Socio-professional Categories (PCS),Footnote 7 as shown by a statistical analysis of asset bands that identifies small farmers as ‘scarcely better endowed with economic capital’ than the working classes (Sinthon, 2019, p. 44). Higher up the socio-economic ladder, large farmers enjoy levels of inherited capital similar to those of the upper classes (id., p. 45). There thus emerges a three-way division of agricultural social classes, which Laferté aligns with the Bourdieusian categories of the economic bourgeoisie, the cultural petite bourgeoisie and the propertied fraction of the working classes (2014a, 2021). This tripartite perspective has the advantage of moving beyond a binary division of dominant/dominated, although it still tends to minimise the ‘hidden field of class struggle’ (Bihr, 1984) and to homogenise the nuances of class belonging within the petite bourgeoisie. This tendency is evident in the study of social structure within local food networks (Paranthoën, 2013; Richard et al., 2014). From a mobility and social relations perspective, ‘it would appear that the social distance separating [some] farmers from the intermediate or higher professions of the tertiary sector is diminishing’ (Bermond, 2007, p. 112). In strictly economic terms, however, how much does ‘the petite bourgeoisie (made up of [farmers,] artisans, and small shop owners)’ really have in common with ‘the mid- [or upper] level salaried employees’ whom Alain Bihr refers to as ‘the capitalist supervisors’ (l’encadrement capitaliste)? (Bihr, 1984, p. 103). From the perspective of agri-food justice, this question echoes the takeover of small-scale market gardening by capitalist modes of production (Robert, 1986, p. 109), and reminds us of the pre-capitalist character of the petite bourgeoisie, ‘historically condemned to disappear in and through capitalist development, even as it is reproduced in a subaltern and degraded form’ (Bihr, 1984). This degradation, or ‘downclassing’ fits well with the trajectories of downward mobility noted above (Bessière et al., 2014), while at the same time some segments of the agricultural petite bourgeoisie have emancipated themselves via productivist modernisation, thus embarking on the road to embourgeoisement (or ‘bourgeoisification’) (Laferté, 2014b). Leaving behind the rural sociabilities of the petite bourgeoisie, their embourgeoisement is characterised by an integration into new agri-food relationships, accompanied by new forms of agricultural management. Lastly, it is the ‘cultural’ agricultural petit bourgeois fraction (Laferté, 2021) that develops in parallel with new forms of local food leadership (Naves, 2016). Departing from this positioning within the current literature, this article’s hypothesis is as follows: within the relationships among the ‘embourgeoisé’ and petit bourgeois agricultural fractions, on the one hand, and agri-food and food movement professionals, on the other, complex dynamics of exclusion and inclusion exist; these dynamics, moreover, may run contrary to or in sync with objective notions of agri-food justice. In pursuit of this hypothesis, the qualitative analysis of individual case studies using ethnographic methods can contribute to a larger effort of generalisation (Laferté, 2021, p. 167). The present study of field vegetable growers and market gardeners in Normandy (with social characteristics comparable to those of other regions and other types of agriculture) was conceived of in this light (id.). The findings presented here were gathered using a mixed methodology approach. Nineteen interviews, averaging 90 min in length, were completed as a part of research for a PhD thesis. The first interviews were conducted as a follow-up to a survey, conducted in 2016, of small market gardeners selling at a market in Caen. This initial phase of research provided ‘a series of opportunities to elaborate new’ hypotheses (Olivier de Sardan, 1995), in an iterative fashion, and was likewise supported by a typology of field vegetable growers and market gardeners (Guillemin, 2020). Vegetable farms of different types were identified in order to investigate the social logics internal to the sector, which is less accessible than that of small-scale market gardening. In other words, the dynamic specific to the study was used to direct the choice of farmers to interview, rather than random sampling; this had the advantage of providing a sampling of information internal to the ‘strategic group’ (id.) of farmer leaders. The relatively high number of interviews in the Calvados area was due to practical considerations as well to the intersection of the thesis with a larger research initiativeFootnote 8 and a representative sampling of other supply chains (wholesalers and the Coop de Creully). One organic market gardener was originally interviewed for separate project, a study of the Gilets Jaunes,Footnote 9 using a dedicated interview guide. To better understand the growers’ position with respect to other class segments within the agricultural social hierarchy (Bessière et al., 2014), three semi-directive interviews were conducted with other key individuals: the directors of two local coops (the Coop de Creully and the Groupement des Producteurs de Légumes de la Manche) and the head of a local experiment station. The relational approach to market gardening worlds using a combination of different investigative techniques had been previously validated for the analysis of shorter, regional supply chains (Ripoll, 2008, p. 24). Social characteristics of the organic market gardeners’ clientele were determined using two questionnaire-based surveys. In addition, drawing on a network of acquaintances in the area, two immersive ethnographic experiences and two direct observation opportunities were completed. The wide range of different observational contexts (peri-urban areas around the regional capital, isolated rural areas/hamlets, traditional vegetable-growing areas near the coast) provided contrasting situations in which to observe the ‘internal differentiation’ (Bessière et al., 2014) of the agricultural group under examination (Fig. 1). Field research location and methods: three départements in the western part of the region of Normandy This methodological framework was put to use for an extended field study (2014–2020), yielding an initial research result that seeks to go beyond a tripartite social division of the farming population (Laferté, 2021) and to instead understand farmers as currently belonging to a minimum of five social class fractions. The unequal distribution of capital among market gardeners and field vegetable growers in Normandy (Guillemin, 2020) is broadly reflective of structural inequalities in the agri-food sector as a whole. The stratified picture that emerges suggests typical inequalities in the means of production among large farmers and small producers. This article provides a complementary view, based on field research (Fig. 2), highlighting the mechanisms of domination and/or cooperation that exist among different fractions, more or less socially proximate, of the vegetable-production sector. Relational view of stratification within the worlds of vegetable production The dominant members of these vegetable-production worlds belong to the agricultural bourgeoisie (Laferté, 2021). This includes the well-established agricultural bourgeoisie, many of whom are the ‘inheritors of the most valuable [agricultural] land’, and ‘the rising petite bourgeoisie’ (id., p. 167), whose embourgeoisement is incomplete. These two fractions come together within the agro-industrial co-ops (Agrial and the Groupement des Producteurs de Légumes de la Manche). In the traditional growing areas near the coast (the Créançais and the Val de Saire in the département of Manche), salaried directors monitor the technical and economic performance of the farmers with the largest farms, who are themselves in charge of significant numbers of full-time staff. But their embourgeoisement remains incomplete. The study found that the ‘closed system’ constituted by the producers’ co-op did not allow for their emancipation with respect to the agri-food sector leadership and the heads of their supply chains. The leading vegetable growers’ world has been reorganised both socially and geographically in recent years by the integration into Agrial of a number of large farms historically linked to the irrigated parts of the Caen Plain. Many of the farmers here identify culturally as the (third generation) descendants of Flemish immigrants. Their fathers were active in the co-ops, and they in their turn have gotten involved in building the regional, multi-national cooperatives of today, developing new markets for diversified, high-value vegetable production. Together with a few large farms owned by non-Flemish families, they constitute a nexus of successful, large-scale vegetable operations that refers to itself collectively as the ‘CAC Carotte’.Footnote 10 The largest of these farms employ substantial numbers of both permanent and temporary workers (e.g., 10 year-round and 50 seasonal employees; 40 year-round and 100 seasonal employees), hierarchically organised, following a logic of maximum workforce flexibility. They favour simplified management structures and make significant use of short-term contracts and temporary migrant labour (primarily Poles and Senegalese). Benefitting from many years of experience supplying both national and European markets with large volumes of product, these ‘capitalist farmers… are often also involved in ancillary agricultural enterprises such as marketing, processing, and distribution’ (Berstein, 2010, trad. 2019, p. 153), adopting an attitude of ‘market opportunism’ (Laferté, 2021) to advance their position within the organic and local market segments. Within the local market, these large farmers may act as both suppliers and buyers to the market gardeners of the petite bourgeoisie, whom they tend to regard with a sort of pity, tinged with contempt for those who have failed in their efforts to scale the economic ladder. For the bourgeois vegetable growers and market gardeners, the downwardly mobile, petit bourgeois position of the smaller market gardeners appears to reflect a ‘social order [understood as] the natural result of each individual’s abilities’ (Laferté, 2018, p. 128), whereas in fact, objectively speaking, it corresponds to differences in inherited wealth (smaller farms) and market access (fewer commercial contracts, uneven supply). Traditional, petit bourgeois market gardeners, like other small business owners, struggle to survive from one generation to the next. Business domination (opaque wholesale markets, price variability) and uncertain land access (short-term rental agreements, large farms buying up additional land) lead many to keep working past retirement age, rounding out meagre pensions and maintaining market relationships for direct sales to consumers. For others members of this class fraction, their low social position corresponds to a shift from the working classes via the ‘professionalisation’ of a gardening hobby as an alternative to unemployment. A different form of social repositioning into the market gardening world characterises the ‘reinvented’ fraction of the independent petite bourgeoisie, those coming from the qualified tertiary sector. These social trajectories and the alternative modes of production associated with them (small-scale organic farming and/or local direct marketing) are remaking the population of specialised market gardeners both in urban agriculture (Poulot, 2020) and in rural areas. If it is difficult to ‘specify the contours of this group of new arrivals’ (id.), this is because their position as a reinvented petite bourgeoisie is often temporary or partial, resulting from multiple moves (Paranthoën, 2014) in and out of other forms of employment. This fraction finds its legitimacy (and its markets) by drawing on resources linked to these social trajectories, which in turn structure their alliances with other social fractions (Richard et al., 2014), including ‘public sector employees, the intellectual and artistic professions, intermediate-level members of the teaching and healthcare sectors’, etc. (Paranthoën, 2013). Indeed, some of these resources—prominent chefs, journalists, local elected officials, municipal employees—constitute critical infrastructure for market gardening and have been contributing to the recent elevation in social status of this reinvented agricultural petite bourgeoisie (Guillemin, 2020), symbolic representatives of a typically French gastronomic ideal, for whom they are helping to develop markets and thus constituting a new type of territorialised leadership framework (Fig. 2). To speak of displacement in analysing the reinvention of the agricultural petite bourgeoisie ‘to the left of the social space’ is to agree that these farmers ‘are not becoming bourgeois (Laferté, 2014b, p. 45) because ‘becoming bourgeois presupposes recognizing… a normal or natural order of things, including a respect for the social authorities that serve as guardians of this order’ (id., pp. 46–47). This fraction of the agricultural petite bourgeoisie has defined itself by means of a critique of productivist agriculture, a critique which in turn requires a rejection of the ‘miserabilist’ critique of alternative agriculture offered by the established bourgeois vegetable growers (with interviewees citing, for example, the difficult working conditions of small-scale market gardening, resulting in low output and insufficient returns). The disdain of the latter extends not only to the small-scale organic farmers, but also to the cooperative vegetable growers whose ‘bourgeoisification’ is still incomplete. In the view of the agricultural bourgeoisie, this failure is linked to the petit bourgeois’ relationship to work. The fact that they work ‘uncounted hours’ (Laferté, 2018, p. 129) both limits the development of their farm business—which would require wage stratification—and impedes their access to a lifestyle featuring leisure habits similar to those of the upper classes. All these elements contribute to the petit bourgeois growers’ incomplete social elevation, which in turn impacts their social relations of production.",1

But he doesn’t want to be a farmer, he wants to be a Paulistano” (extract from an interview conducted in January 2021). This is how Terezinha, a farmer born in the State of Bahia in the Northeast Region, explains why she is disappointed that her employee, who has worked for her for 16 years, has just accepted a job as a waiter in a restaurant and that he will stop working on her urban farm in São Mateus, in the East ZoneFootnote 1 of São Paulo. When Zeco arrived in the metropolis of São Paulo 1 year ago, he never thought that he would be working again in the roçaFootnote 2, which he left behind when he left his native region. Like many migrants from the Northeast Region, Zeco and Terezinha learned to plant in their childhood and have been taking up this activity again in their new living space: the urban margins. Urban margins refer to poor areas which are a mix of illegal settlements and consolidated residential areas situated on the outskirts of a dense urban area (Théry, 2017). In a metropolis like São Paulo, they are the result of urban sprawl which accelerated during the second half of the twentieth century, mainly due to an influx of economic migrants from Brazil’s interiorFootnote 3 (Goirand, 2012). In areas which could still be considered rural or peri-urban up until the 1970s–1980s, the urban sprawl, which is less dense in some areas, gives communities access to vacant and arable spaces. Urban farming is an activity used to ensure the food sovereignty of local communities by producing food which is culturally and nutritionally adapted to their needs (Paddeu, 2012). In fact, urban farming which feeds around 700 million citizens, i.e. one quarter of city dwellers worldwide, plays a major role in subsistence (Fumey, 2011). However, we observe that, in emerging metropolises like São Paulo, the status of urban farming goes beyond its sole productive function and takes on a socio-landscape role useful to the metropolis (Proust, 2020). Indeed, another form of urban farming has been developing for about 10 years in the central and peri-central suburbs of São Paulo, in the form of community gardens, testifying to the emergence of a middle class (Giacchè, 2015). Unlike urban farms on the margins of the metropolis which, as a result of their geographic location, are stigmatised, community gardens coincide with the image of the sustainable city, in line with globalised urban marketing applied to city centres (Rivière d’Arc, 2009). The metropolis gives well-off communities an opportunity to maintain a quality urban environment by making their living space green again, while the aspect of nourishment is secondary. These differences in function raise issues insofar as urban farming is perceived as a way to develop principles of food justice, which is understood as “the equitable distribution in the way food resources are produced and shared out in a given territory” (Hochedez, 2018, p. 2). As shown by several studies in the scientific literature, the equitable distribution of food resources depends on the improved image of the work of food producers (Hochedez & Le Gall, 2016) and on the significance attached to food sovereignty on the local scale (Slocum et al., 2016). To this end, food justice requires a radical transformation of the neoliberal system and institutional racism of food systems (Sbicca, 2018), particularly in Brazil where racism is an integral part of social structures. For Jessé Souza, racism is the first factor responsible for inequalities in the country and has a direct impact on access to land and food (Souza, 2021). Similarly, many studies in the scientific literature show that land access has a direct impact on food systems and that food justice cannot prevail unless land can be accessed, particularly in urban areas (Perrin & Nougarèdes, 2020) and in the vicinity of towns (Baysse-Lainé, 2018). The relationship between land and food systems raises strategic issues in urban areas where land encompasses residential, economic, financial and political roles. This article will focus on the issue of land justice in the urban space, as a prerequisite for food justice. In this context, the racialised minorities who practise urban farming on the margins of the city need greater visibility in order to overcome the institutional and spatial invisibility which has been largely responsible for situations of food injustice (Reynolds & Cohen, 2016). While pursuing a theoretical discussion of food justice, this article will explore this concept in the context of an emerging metropolis. It will seek first to distinguish the several forms of urban farming found in São Paulo, by relying on socio-economic criteria and the profile of relevant actors. It will then show how the visibility and invisibility of urban farming, in a fluid yet constrained urban context, influence its development. Finally, we will emphasise the weight of land speculation-related problems and their repercussions on food justice, by using the example of the East Zone of São Paulo.",1

This system has proved to fail in responding to problems like malnutrition, socioeconomic inequalities, and environmental degradation (Markard et al., 2012; McMichael, 2009; Moragues-Faus et al., 2017). Recent changes in the food sector have been encouraging the use of the expression “FST” to translate the notion of sustainable development into the agri-food sector (Stassart et al. 2012; Lamine, 2020). This shift relies on agroecological production methods and local food (from producer to consumer with no or one intermediary (Chiffoleau, 2012) within the same farming region). The FST has seen a scaling up in the agenda of several cities in the USA and Europe (Jouen & Lorenzi, 2014; Sonnino, 2013) and includes practices such as community gardens, local markets, and community-supported agriculture (CSA) initiatives. Over 100 large cities from the 5 continents, of which 10 French cities,Footnote 1 signed the Urban Food Policy Pact of Milano in 2015.Footnote 2 Since the 2000s, an increasing number of French urban and rural small regions have developed sustainable food strategies, following the national law of 2014 that promotes territorialising food systems.Footnote 3 In Brittany, North-West France, where our survey was carried out in 2018, the number of local food initiatives based on agroecological practices has been multiplied by 8 in the period 2007–2013 (Berger and Guesdon 2013). In the FST, the use of the term “system” recognises the interdependence between the different dimensions of sustainability: economy, ecology, and social. In this systemic perspective, we want to address in this article a particular aspect of these interdependencies: the link between the social dimension and the other two dimensions, ecological and economic. In the wider context of sustainability transition, social sustainability remains often the most underdeveloped aspect (Kohon, 2018). Tregear (2011, 419) claims that “from a socioeconomic perspective […] some localised food initiatives may maintain rather than overturn preexisting inequalities between participants and exhibit insularity and defensiveness rather than openness”. To address this issue, the notion of food justice is particularly interesting. This notion can be summarised around two major components: first, it explores the extent to which all consumers have equitable access to sustainable food and agricultural products; second, it is also defined in terms of the possibility of being an actor by participating in the governance of organizations providing food (Hochedez and Le Gall, 2016). Assuming that the phenomena of food injustice follow the pattern of more general socioeconomic inequalities, we propose to address the question of the inclusion of LICs in this FST and their capacity to be direct actors. The extent to which the alternatives related to the FST are socially inclusive remains contested. Although providing quality products for all is one of their objectives, local food systems primarily reach better-off consumers (Deller et al., 2017; Goodman, 2004; Tregear, 2011; Zepeda & Nie, 2012). Low income is related to less healthy food (Darmon et al., 2014; Shahar et al., 2005; Temple & Steyn, 2009; Gotlieb & Joshi, 2013; Hough & Sosa, 2015). The agro-industrial food system has generated strong social inequities in access to food (McMichael, 2009; Gottlieb and Joshi 2010). In this context, the values promoted by CSAs and, more generally, by the initiatives representing FST are identified as carriers of alternative values (Chiffoleau & Paturel, 2016), based on the contestation of the industrial agri-food system (Merkt-Cakal and Miele 2020). It is, therefore, possible to hypothesise that this value positioning, based on participation (ibid.), the empowerment of the members of these initiatives (Gottlieb and Joshi 2010) through an engagement in social innovation dynamics (Chiffoleau & Paturel, 2016), which contributes to fostering more food justice. Initiatives representing FST have multiplied very rapidly in Europe over the last two decades (Spaargaren et al., 2012; Merkt-Cakal and Miele 2020), including in Brittany and the Rennes basin (Berger and Guesdon 2013), which is our study site. This observation encourages us to refine the hypothesis according to which the acceleration of the FST should be accompanied by a greater number of initiatives translating social justice values into action. In this case, the processes involved ought to be studied. The path of construction of this hypothesis justified our conceptual framework and our methodological approach. We explored the space of convergence between FST and social focus on LIC based on two categories of initiatives representative of these two components (Fig. 1). On the one hand, we explored all the CSA initiatives, here represented by the AMAPs,Footnote 4 as an illustration of the pioneering dynamics of FST: are the LICs included, and if so, to which extend, and under what conditions do they effectively participate in the governance of these CSAs? On the other hand, we explored all the social grocery stores in this same region as an illustration of the dynamics of socioeconomic inclusion of LICs: is access to sustainable agricultural and food products (as defined in the FST, i.e. agroecological and local) possible for them, and if so, under which conditions do they effectively participate in these dynamics? Our study focused on a sub-region of the Rennes basin that combines rural and urban areas, where some key representatives of all the AMAPs and all the social groceries were interviewed. Exploring the improvement of food justice through the participation of LIC in FST: at the intersection of two dynamics (source: author’s elaboration) Our survey focuses on local food systems (LFS) as a preferred space for translation of the FST. Local food systems are rooted in concepts of ecological sustainability as well as in visions of social sustainability (Tregear, 2011). Rural sociology and rural development research on LFS are argued to too often focus on the farmers’ perspective, assuming that positive externalities in consumers will follow the reconfigured relationships between producers and consumers. Consumers’ participation and motives had received less attention (Tregear, 2011) until recently, but a growing number of studies (Chiffoleau & Paturel, 2009; Mundler, 2013; Paturel et al., 2015; Darrot and Noel 2018) and experiences in France are drawing the attention to the consumer’s perspective on FST and, particularly, LIC. A general argument is that local foods can improve community health by providing access to healthy foods and awareness. Local food initiatives are also seen as capable of improving food desert situations (Deller et al., 2017; Sadler et al., 2013) and of balancing social differences related to food behaviour and access. In the first part of this article, we will review the definitions of the key concepts mobilised and detail our analytical framework based on an original diagram. In the second part, we will present the territory chosen for this study and detail the two types of initiatives analysed (AMAP and social grocery stores) and our sampling and survey approach. We will present the results obtained, in particular by drawing up a typology of each of the two categories of initiatives: this typology is based on criteria (defined inductively) allowing us to discriminate our initiatives with regard to the question respectively addressed: are the LICs included in the public of the CSAs, and if so, under what conditions of participation in governance? Is access to sustainable agricultural and food products possible for LIC beneficiaries of social grocery stores, and if so with which conditions of participation? The third part will discuss our results, first by returning to our working questions and our initial hypotheses in the light of our case studies, and then by suggesting the conditions for extending this reflection to the national level.",1
103,4,"Review of Agricultural, Food and Environmental Studies",16 January 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41130-022-00185-z,From “noble” to “ugly” but “well-worked” fish—food morals in the Breton fish landings,December 2022,Fabien Clouette,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"With the effects of overfishing (Cury, 2019; Gascuel, 2019) and the successive crises of the fishing industry since the 1990s, political conflicts between small-scale Breton fishermen and the largest fishing companies have been deepening (Clouette, 2019). The process of valuation of the caught product, fish, or shellfish is a cornerstone of the political struggles. It can be sold in an auction, directly on the quay “at the back of the boat” or through short food supply chains. It can also be shared through informal circuits organized around “the fisherman’s cut”—called “godaille” in France (gift or sale of an in-kind wage share normally intended for personal consumption and also known as “fake fish”). The decrease of the inshore small boat fishing fleets is to the benefit of larger units that fish offshore and are grouped in an “armement”—a larger fishing boats company. Small-scale fishermen and industrial vessels do not land fish of the same quality, and in the same quantity. Both types of economic actors work differently with fish, and allegedly target different species. But in fact, they regularly happen to land the same species of fish, especially the ones that are the most expensive products, and that have been considered “noble,” because of an historical context that we will explain in the first part of the article. This competition has been going on for a century, creating inequalities. The modalities of struggle for small scale fishermen, notably around the fluctuating setting of prices (Jorion, 2010), however, reveal agency opportunities, both because the methods with which they catch their “noble” fish correspond more closely to the specifications of gastronomic catering and “good food” (Hochedez & Le Gall, 2016), but also through a revaluation of discredited—or “forgotten”—fish, a term reminiscent of that used by locally sourced vegetable producers. A whole palette of words is used onboard, on the quay, in fish shops, or in communication campaigns: noble fish, ugly fish, “well-worked” fish (“bien travaillé”), and industrial fish. The product definitions, by using binary oppositions between categories, create contradictions between their uses. Food networks are constituted through social distinction and even social inequalities, expressed through consumption practices, which in turn influence the practices of producers at the start of the supply chain. How do food inequities on the consumer side affect the whole fishing system, and in particular the choices and practices of producers? Can an industrial fish be noble? What is an “ugly” but “well-worked” fish? Which social assets do you need to have access to this or that fish, on a stall or on a quay? For which clientele is the small-scale fishing industry meant to survive? What sociological issues are at stake between producers, sellers, and consumers? The aim of this text is to question a system that could be perceived as binary, by putting it into perspective with the diversity of practices and actors in the Breton fishery. Another aim of the article is to bring to the field of food justice a perspective that is anchored in an original ethnographic terrain for this field—fishing. The originality of this fieldwork and study lies in the fact that fishing is an industry with producing processes that engage with uncertainty. Its food morals are linked to the fact that producers do not grow or farm products, but hunt for wild animals and develop strategies to catch the right fish. Food morals lies in the definition of this “right” fish to catch. What are the moral stakes of the question: what is the right fish to catch? And is not it more a matter of knowing how to fish well than knowing which fish to catch? The aim of the article is also to bring a perspective on this industry that is part of the moral economy tradition. Fishing constitutes a perfect fieldwork to analyze the infra-political struggles around a fair price, especially because of the producers’ labile relationship to norms. It shows that illegality or legality of exchanges, or even good and bad practices, are considered according to a kind of food morals. These food morals are organized around infra-political community links and practices that only ethnography can render. The article is based on transcripts of participant observation (commercial fishing and fish landing on the quay) and more than eighty interviews (semi-structured, generally about 2 h long) from the ethnographic fieldwork of the PhD (2014–2019, mostly in Finistère, Brittany, France). This fieldwork was carried out on board all types of vessels engaged in fishing activities from Breton ports: from small coastal vessels spending only a few hours at sea,Footnote 1 to ocean-going vessels leaving for two weeks far from the Breton coast.Footnote 2 I got on board under the status of “passenger,” also informally called “marée-test” in French, because this status is a way for young fishermen that are still in school to get a first impression of the work onboard vessels. The examples given in this article will be mainly those of coastal fishing, especially during the unloading work. Through the description of moments of sale, landing, and killing, the article questions the complex realities of the exploitation of fishery resources, revealing a multifaceted professional world. First, the article analyzes the issues of a campaign to promote the so-called ugly fish, created in 2020 by the Association des Ligneurs de la Pointe BretagneFootnote 3 and anchored in a history of consumption discriminating fish by species. Then, it analyzes a little more these stakes, by means of an ethnographic scene of landing of purse seiners (“bolinche”), showing how the idea of the “beautiful” fish is created, which tends more and more to be a “well-worked” fish. These definitions overlap with a grid of geographical and social inequalities in terms of consumption. Finally, in the last part, the article will show that this injunction to produce a “beautiful” fish is an entrepreneurial and neoliberal imperative that affects the ethos of the small-scale fisherman today in the context of the struggle for economic survival facing the largest fishing companies’ omnipresence. The ethnographic examples of 1 day of conger eel fishing and of ikejime killing technique show how the “responsible” fisherman is embodied differently. During a violent capture of an “ugly fish” (the conger eel), a form of transgression of this ethos respectful of the environment and the animal appears, which allows us to highlight the criteria of sustainability (Probyn, 2016) necessary to correspond to the model of “good food” closed to the underprivileged classes.",

Sosa Varrotti,Delia C. Ramírez,Paula C. Serpe,Female,Female,Female,Female,"This paper aims to contribute to the analysis of land grabbing as a complex and multidimensional phenomenon (economic, social and political). We have defined land grabbing as “a social process of transfer of control over land in terms of capital accumulation, the scale of which conditions access to land and other associated natural resources and/or control over its uses by other users in each socio-territorial situation” (Ramírez, Sosa Varrotti & Zorzoli, 2021). As other scientific literature has shown, as well as the denunciations of environmentalists, rural producers and indigenous leaders, land grabbing has also implied social impacts, injustices, conflicts and territorial displacement of local communities (Busscher et al., 2020). Drawing on our previous work (Zorzoli et al., 2021), we delve into different critical dimensions and make conceptual proposals to study this phenomenon. We deploy a broad and comprehensive approach to land grabbing, not only from the review of critical studies but also articulating data obtained during geographically extensive and temporally extended fieldworks. Through the analysis of different cases, territories and actors, we seek to illustrate the diversity of the land grabbing phenomenon in Argentina and the specificities of each territorial response. While focusing on the Argentine variation of this process, we illuminate similar land grabbing phenomena in the Global South, not only for the period before 2010 but also for the less studied following decade.",1

Integration is a prerequisite for economic efficiency, namely the maximization of benefits accruing to the society from the existence and the efficient operation of markets (Fousekis and Grigoriadis, 2019). Well functioning integrated spatial markets are characterized by strong price dependence, meaning that price shocks in one market induce price responses to the other. The European Union (EU), as a prime example, has been engaged in a process of market integration for a very long period of time. Starting in 1993, with the Single Market Programme (SMP), all tariff and non-tariff barriers between the geographically separated markets of the member states within the EU were removed.Footnote 1 The main idea behind the SMP was to promote trade and create a more efficient market. As a consequence, over the last 25 years, there has been a number of empirical studies on the integration of the (especially food) markets among the member states of the EU (Zanias, 1993; Morgan & Wakelin, 1999; Emmanouilides & Fousekis, 2015a; Emmanouilides & Fousekis, 2012; Serra et al., 2006; Fousekis & Grigoriadis, 2019; Sanjuán & Gil, 2001). The aforementioned empirical research on the integration of the EU food markets has been undertaken with a variety of statistical tools and econometric techniques. More specifically, the linear co-integration analysis was employed by Zanias (1993) as well as by Sanjuán and Gil (2001). Non-linear co-integration techniques were employed by Emmanouilides and Fousekis (2012) and by Emmanouilides and Fousekis (2015a). Parametric and non-parametric regressions were employed by Serra et al. (2006). Lastly, the statistical tool of copulas was utilized by the studies of Emmanoulides et al. (2014) and by Grigoriadis et al. (2016). In the majority of the studies, the empirical findings indicate that markets are well integrated. On the other hand, there are some works that suggest a low degree of integration (Emmanoulides et al., 2014, found a low degree of integration in the short run) or no integration (Zanias, 1993) among the food markets examined. In the last decade, copulas have gained momentum in the analysis of co-movement between stochastic processes (Reboredo, 2011, 2012; Emmanouilides & Fousekis, 2015a; Panagiotou & Stavrakoudis, 2016; Emmanoulides et al., 2014; Goodwin & Hungerford, 2015; Neumeyer et al., 2019; BenSaïda, 2018; García-Gómez et al., 2020; Gaupp et al., 2017; Sriboonchitta et al., 2013). The most attractive feature of the copulas is that they can deal with non-linearities, asymmetries, and heavy tails of the marginal and the joint distributions of variables. In addition, copulas allow for the joint behavior of random processes to be modelled independently of their marginal distributions. The latter presents significant flexibility in empirical works (Panagiotou & Stavrakoudis, 2016; Emmanouilides & Fousekis, 2015b; Goodwin & Hungerford, 2015; Fousekis et al., 2017). On the other hand, a noticeable disadvantage of the copulas as well as of the commonly used approaches is that they do not account for the role of time scale (time horizon) in price dependency. The latter means that some agents operate on short time scales/horizons, some on medium time scales, and some others operate on much longer planning time horizons. As noted by Fousekis and Grigoriadis (2016b), differences in agents’ time horizons may render the relationships between economic time series scale and frequency dependent. Scale and frequency are inversely related: a high scale is related with low frequency whereas a low scale is related with a high frequency. Accordingly, when it comes to spatial market integration, scale/frequency dependence suggests that the strength and the mode of price linkages may differ by time scale and time frequency. In the most recent study, Emmanouilides and Proskynitopoulos (2019) analyze the spatial price causality structure between the pig meat markets of 24 European countries. More specifically, the authors studied the EU pig meat market as a dynamic complex network of linkages between prices in member states. The study investigated the temporal development of the spatial network of price relationships, and through the dynamics of its major structural characteristics we draw insights about the horizontal agricultural market integration process in the EU. For the empirical part, weekly time-series data from 2007 to 2018 were utilized along with non-linear Granger causality. The data provide evidence not only for a large degree of heterogeneity in market power between countries, but also for the existence of market segregation into high and low power groups (clubs) that are strongly connected to each other. The presence of such groups is an inefficiency of the market system in the European Union. In the light of the preceding, the goal of this study is to analyze the strength and the pattern of price dependence among the major extra virgin olive oil markets in the EU, namely Italy, Spain, and Greece. These three Mediterranean countries are responsible for 95% of olive oil production within the EU (European Commission, 2020b). Concurrently, more than 70% of the world olive oil production stems from the EU (Commission, 2020a). On the consumption side, Italy, Spain, and Greece account for 80% of olive oil consumption within the EU (European Commission, 2020b). Statistics regarding olive oil intra-trade among Italy, Spain, and Greece are also very remarkable. More specifically, above 70% of Spain’s exports and almost 90% of Greek exports have Italy as their destination; 98% of Italy’s imports from EU members stem from Spain and Greece (Commission, 2020a). The exports of Spain and Greece to Italy consist to a large degree of extra virgin and virgin olive oil (European Commission, 2020b). In the present work, the evaluation of price dependence is undertaken with the employment of discrete wavelets along with copulas, while utilizing monthly prices of extra virgin olive oil from Italy, Spain, and Greece. More specifically, the tool of discrete wavelets is applied initially to analyze the activity of the individual time series into different components where each component is associated with a time scale (Fousekis & Grigoriadis, 2016a; Fousekis & Grigoriadis, 2016b). Afterwards, the tool of non-parametric copulas is employed to extract information about dependence by scale/frequency level. The present manuscript builds on the work by Emmanoulides et al. (2014). The aforementioned study assesses the degree and the structure of price dependence in the principal EU extra virgin olive oil markets (Spain, Italy, and Greece), with the utilization of the statistical tool of parametric copulas and monthly data. On average, the empirical results reveal olive oil prices are likely to boom together but not to crash together. The present study builds on the study by Emmanoulides et al. (2014) since it utilizes monthly extra virgin olive oil data in order to also assess the degree and the structure of price dependence (Spain, Italy, and Greece). However, it departs from the seminal study in two ways: First of all, with the utilization of discrete wavelets, data are divided and the assessment of price dependence has been undertaken for low, medium, and high frequencies, namely time scales. Secondly, the degree and the structure of price dependence, for the different time scales, has been estimated with the use of non-parametric copulas. As Fousekis and Grigoriadis (2016a) point out, the non-parametric estimation of copulas allows the data “to speak for themselves,” eliminating this way potential misspecification bias. The combination of the statistical tools of discrete wavelets and non-parametric copulas enables us to determine the extent to which the mode and the strength of price linkages change by the time horizon (i.e., short-, medium-, and longer-run). The work by Fousekis and Grigoriadis (2016b) on the to investigation of price dependence in the international butter markets has been (so far) the only earlier study that has employed both wavelets and copulas for agricultural/dairy commodities. The authors used monthly wholesale prices from Oceania and the European Union and the statistical tools of copulas and wavelets. Their empirical results suggested that price linkages between the two butter-producing regions are weak in the short run but stronger in the long run. Furthermore, the time scale was relevant not only for the intensity but for the structure of price co-movement between Oceania and the EU. More specifically, in the long run, strong positive shocks were transmitted with a higher intensity compared to strong negative ones, indicating asymmetric price dependence. In what follows, the “Methodological framework” section presents the methodology for copulas and wavelets, the “Data” section the data, and the “Empirical models, results, and discussion” section the empirical analysis, the results, and discussion. The “Conclusions” section offers conclusions.",

The legal perspective,March 2023,Alexandra Langlais,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"While agriculture’s shift towards an agro-ecological transition is considered not only necessary but also obvious in the form that it should take (Altieri, 2015; Bodiguel, 2022; Guillou, 2013), the current CAP reform, which will not be implemented until 2023, offers an ideal opportunity to assess the reality of this statement. Several legal texts, in particular the regulation of 6 December on national Strategic Plans, set out this reform for greater environmental integration and will form the basis of our analysis. The European regulation on national Strategic Plans is of specific importance insofar as it establishes the “rules governing support for Strategic Plans to be drawn up by Member States within the framework of the CAP”. These plans are now at the heart of the new CAP, representing the key tool both to construct and implement the future policy. Our attention is drawn to three main points here. The first concerns the absence of any reference to the term “agro-ecological transition” in the texts of the PAC reform and its preparatory work. The chosen terminology is the “transition to sustainable agriculture”. While the logic of transition is clearly displayed, the model to aim for, however, remains unclear. As it stands, it is not possible to determine what changes it will lead to or to connect it with a precise transition objective. In its literal sense, the term “transition” refers to a dynamic process designating “the passage from one state to another”. Therefore, while the process of change is important, so, then, is the result of this process. It is therefore important to focus on the second point that attracted our attention. According to the Belgian philosopher Pascal Chabot (2015, p. 11), “transition is the desired change”. This desire for change, and thus the passage from one state to the other, is, according to the authors, more or less intense depending on whether it refers to a mutation, a rupture, a transformation, a development, etc. As well as the clarity of the transition objective to be achieved, we need to consider the concrete legal translation of this transition and its assessment. In other words, we need to take into consideration all the legal means used to implement the transition. This analysis hopes to help clarify the desired transition by assessing the nature and intensity of changes accompanied by law, in particular any changes in agricultural practices resulting from the new applicable legal provisions. Lastly, the third focal point aims to examine the exit from this agro-ecological transition dynamic. Since every transition is, by its essence, a process to pass from one state to another, it is not, therefore, a permanent situation but a specifically temporary one. It is thus important to identify whether or not there are legal indications to orchestrate the post-agro-ecological transition and to think more broadly about the timelines of this transition.

First, at individual level, the technical, agronomic and economic orientations of farmers play a direct role in coping with the consequences of an economic shock or environmental event on the farm. Notably, economists highlight the extent to which diversified farms are less subject to significant farm income variations. The economic management of farms, including savings, credits and investments, as well as private storage and sale, is also a key dimension of what can be achieved by farmers at the scale of the farm (Mishra & El-Osta, 2002). More recently, specific legal set-ups for decoupling land, capital and labour are also on the rise as a means to handle economic risks. Second, from a broader productive perspective, supply chains and professional organisations define a collective level of risk management (Zeuli, 1999). Farm diversification can notably be linked to or constrained by supply-chain organisation. In this regard, studies highlight how the historical specialisation of areas into production basins through specific processing infrastructure leads to lock-in effects and currently limits the development of new cropping systems. This is the case for protein crops, praised for their climate mitigation potential (through carbon sequestration and nitrogen fixing), whose cultivation is limited by the fact that grain cooperatives are no longer equipped to process and store them (Magrini et al, 2016). From a financial perspective, supply-chain integration, achieved through specific contracts with cooperatives or industries, is another expression of the social organisation of risk management in relation to the fact that the deregulation of direct aids and price support has led to greater dependence on the market economy. The diversity of contract terms with regard to quantity, quality, price, input, etc. can be interpreted as a consequence of the current evolution of agricultural markets and policies, as cooperatives and supply chains are increasingly involved in the design and implementation of their own risk management tools. In a landscape of increasing market segmentation linked to traceability systems, contractualisation with specialised farms may appear more appealing for cooperatives. The debate about the relevance of this orientation of farm risk management is not new: critics have long questioned farmers’ autonomy in this economic structure, and the globalisation of agricultural commodity markets may both increase cooperatives’ dependence on the rules of a globalised economy and limit farmers’ ability to make autonomous production choices (Billows, 2022). In synergy, as direct interventions have been reduced, the marketing of agricultural goods has evolved and risk management is achieved through greater reliance on forward and futures markets (Domanski & Heath, 2007). These derivative markets underwent rapid growth and this has led to a change in financial strategies, as futures and derivatives are integrated in larger investment portfolios, with a direct impact on commodity price fluctuations. The 2007–2008 food crisis raised public awareness of the negative impacts of agricultural markets’ financialisation, and this is now a major focus of academic attention (Headey & Shenggen, 2008). These levels of agricultural risk management are interdependent (van Asseldonket al., 2013) hence worth addressing together in order to grasp the direction in which the CAP is heading. They have given rise to several risk management policies, broadly tackled as ex-ante and ex-post, whose enforcement can be complementary or somewhat incompatible. The core objectives of the CAP’s recent reform (2023–2027) highlight the many dimensions of the economic regulation of agricultural production: sustaining farm income and resiliency; enhancing market orientation and increasing competitiveness; enhancing the farmer’s position in value chains.Footnote 1 In relation to this, public support for agricultural risk management is manifold, encompassing farm, supply-chain and market levels and consisting of ex-post and ex-ante actions. Member States and the European Union historically play a direct role in supporting the agricultural sector during major crises. This is tackled as ‘ex-post’ risk management and relates to specific policy instruments based on compensation for damages. They are mostly product-based interventions. A number of exceptional interventions and rescue plans are implemented as a last resort when specific sectors (e.g. livestock farming production in 2015 and 2016) are confronted with sanitary or economic disruptions, and include subsidies for the voluntary reduction of production or public takeover of loans reimbursement. To a lesser extent, these extraordinary measures also include direct interventions on commodity markets, such as public storage or support for private storage. The levels of intervention are lower than during the early days of the CAP, but they are usually carried out over a longer period (Détang-Dessendre & Guyomard, 2022). In addition to the ex-post management of wide-range crises, public regulators are also involved in risk prevention at farm, supply-chain and market levels through dedicated regulations. The past three decades have seen major changes in the way risk management and support is addressed at the various levels of agricultural production and marketing. In France, one of these changes was the creation of ‘production organisations’ in the dairy industry in 2011: after the phasing out of milk quotas, the French government drew up new regulations about value distribution among supply chains. Producers and processers are now obliged to formalise their contractual terms and producers are allowed to circumvent competition law and collectively negotiate prices and volumes through a production organisation. In this case, public intervention has been replaced by local and private regulation directly involving producers’ responsibility. Tax measures are another important change: they are a type of state-intervention lever to address farm-based risk management. These are designed to promote precautionary savings, such as the ‘dotation pour aléa’ (hazard provisioning) in France, an individual risk management tool that aims to spread farm income more evenly over time through tax incentives on savings. However, implementing this tool has proved complex and it has been underused. Moreover, critics have highlighted that this measure is better adapted to regulating the income of large farms whose economic operation is based on a high labour productivity and proves less efficient for small farms. Lastly, the 2006–2008 food crisis led to renewed attention on derivative markets from regulators in Europe and the USA (Clapp & Helleiner, 2012). The European Commission has stated the need to strengthen their regulations so as to sustain less volatile price setting, and has launched initiatives aiming to increase transparency and the centralisation of market clearances, the overall objective being to limit disproportionate price movements or the concentration of speculative positions (European Commission, 2009). Meanwhile, since 2008, the Common Agricultural Policy has also addressed risk management at farm level through support for developing a private insurance industry. This highlights the entrance of new players in the field of agricultural risk management—notably insurance companies, reinsurance companies, banks and financial investors—and calls into question the transformations of farm economy regulation that this entails.",1

European Union (EU) funds are the main source (approximately 80%). Over the budgetary period 2014–2020, they amounted to €58 billion annually, which represents 37% of the European total budget. The successive reforms of the CAP implemented since 1992 have led to the replacement of price support at the expense of the consumer by direct aids funded by the taxpayer (Bureau & Thoyer, 2014; Butault, 2004; Guyomard et al., 2020a). However, this substitution does not mean that price support is zero today, notably because tariff and non-tariff protection remains in place on entry to the EU market (World Trade Organization, 2019; Chatellier et al., 2022). The distribution of the CAP budget between European member states (MS) depends on several factors (European Commission, 2020), in particular, the size of agricultural land areas and the number of ruminants (because first-pillar direct aids have historically been calculated on the basis of these variables), agricultural specialisation (because some productions were, before decouplingFootnote 1 was applied, better supported than others), and agricultural land productivity (because amounts of direct aid per hectare were defined on the basis of historical reference yields, which were often regionalised). Although measures have been gradually adopted to rebalance national budget allocations in favour of the least-endowed MS (the so-called “external convergence” process), differences between countries remain significant (Hanson, 2021). As the leading European agricultural producer (16.8% of the EU’s agricultural final production in 2019), France is the largest beneficiary of the CAP budget (16.4%). In 2019, the top 10 MS, which produced 78% of the EU’s final production, received 79% of the CAP budget. At the other end of the scale, the lowest 10 MS, which produced 4.8% of the EU’s final production, received 6% of the funds. For many years, the modalities for allocating CAP direct aids have been the subject of heated debates. Some actors consider that the CAP budgetary support still favours the historical MS to the detriment of new entrants from Eastern Europe; others emphasise that direct aids do not sufficiently target the protection of the environment or job creation; still others point out that direct aids favour the largest farms in terms of land area although they are already the most productive and profitable. Although the decoupling of a large proportion of direct aids has made the CAP more compatible with WTO rules, this has not mitigated the criticisms mentioned above. In this general context, our article examines the links between budgetary support and agricultural income. More specifically, we seek to shed light on the three following points: firstly, the dependence of agricultural income on budgetary support, in particular, decoupled direct aids, for different MS; secondly, the relative effectiveness of different income support instruments; and thirdly, the legitimacy of the explicit inclusion of an agricultural income support objective in the CAP.",1

An approach based on the diversity of prescription systems in dairy cattle farming,June 2023,Eulalie Ramat,Lucie Gouttenoire,Nathalie Girard,Female,Female,Female,Female,"Today, the development of more sustainable modes of agriculture, such as agroecology, calls for social, economic, and technical changes (Wezel et al., 2009) and for new practices. Farmers and the professionals working alongside them are now expected to embrace and evaluate new knowledge (Compagnone et al., 2018). This implies redesigning complex agricultural systems by adopting different forms of knowledge (Girard, 2015) which are often implicit, hardly formalised (Huntington, 2000), and have not necessarily been scientifically validated (Compagnone et al., 2018). Defining agricultural practices that are adapted to each system, based on the theoretical principles of agroecology, is thus a rather complicated affair (Toffolini et al., 2019). This is particularly difficult when animal husbandry health issues are involved, notably with regard to the management of so-called production or enzootic diseases. These diseases, whose causes are multiple, are largely influenced by the conditions on the farm (Nir Markusfeld, 2003) and have a significant economic impact on farming (Kossaibati & Esslemont, 1997) because of their poor zootechnical performance (Nir Markusfeld, 2003). Unlike regulated diseasesFootnote 1, farmers have considerable leeway in terms of the practices that they can implement to manage these diseases. They can choose when and how to address them, and are also free to choose the professionals that they believe can help to manage them. Given today’s shift towards sustainable agricultural practices, farmers now have greater options from which to choose: alongside conventional chemical medicinesFootnote 2, they are now encouraged to use alternative medicine such as homeopathy, essential oils, osteopathy, and acupuncture. Although these alternative approaches are more widely used today than in the past, notably in organic farming (Lund & Algers, 2003), they are not always viewed as valid from a scientific and/or social perspective, nor are they mastered by all animal health professionals. Moreover, farmers occasionally view them as being too difficult to implement. Lastly, beyond the use of alternative medicine, the shift towards agroecological farming practices requires a more global reflection on the restructuring of livestock systems, one which is perceived as a means of preventing the emergence of diseases (Dumont et al., 2013), and which is sometimes embodied in holistic approaches such as the One Health approach (Bellet et al., 2021). The manner in which farmers choose the professionals with whom to work with regard to herd health management, and how they interact with these professionals, is therefore critical to the implementation of sustainable animal health management practices. They can choose with whom to work from a multitude of professionals. Among those who have always been traditionally involved in farms (agricultural extension specialists, veterinarians, animal feed sales representatives, etc.), some actors, such as veterinarians, are essential from a regulatory point of view, and others have historically been present in the dairy production framework, such as livestock advisers who undertake the “performance control” that dictates the bonusesFootnote 3 that farmers receive. Others, however, are chosen by farmers for their specific skills (Hellec et al., 2021). New players have therefore emerged in the field of agroecological approaches to health management, such as acupuncturists, osteopaths, or even trainer veterinarians. These players belong to different structures and have different professional backgrounds, and their visions of health are not always compatible (Experton et al., 2021). In parallel, different forms of support for farmers are emerging in the field of alternative health management, such as peer group discussions or individual follow-ups by trainer veterinarians (Hellec et al., 2021). Farmers can therefore rely on different forms of support to adopt sustainable herd health management. In a context in which farmers are free to decide and act with regard to managing the production diseases that impact herd health, this article seeks to explore how these farmers perceive the different forms of animal health management support that they receive. We thus propose to characterise the different forms that professional systems can take, as perceived by the farmers, and to shift away from the numerous studies that have addressed agroecological transition from the angle of agricultural practices and technical content. First, we will undertake a literature review of the studies on agricultural extension to highlight their strengths and weaknesses. Second, we will present our theoretical framework, and then show how we have used this to define the types of professional systems developed by dairy cattle farmers in the Massif Central region (France) for herd health management.",
