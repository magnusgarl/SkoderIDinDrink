Carayannis,Aris Kaloudis,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"New frontiers of the mind are before us, and if they are pioneered with the same vision, boldness, and drive with which we have waged this war we can create a fuller and more fruitful employment and a fuller and more fruitful life. Franklin D. Roosevelt, November 17, 1944 There are specific approaches that need to be considered across regions, sectors, and technologies that can help us all transform global and precipitous threats into a real opportunity for peace and prosperity around the globe. On November 4, 2008, a new ray of hope shone on a world full of gloom and doom with the unprecedented, over the last century (since 1908), level of participation of US voters in electing a president that may indeed be a major part of the solution required to tip the world into a better path and away from despair and decline. The key realization that leaders in politics, the economy, society, and science need to endorse and make it the conscience and mantra of us all as citizens and economic agents is the systemic interconnectedness of the world. Therefore, to address challenge and opportunity today, sectors of priority where sustained action and inspired democratic leadership are needed and must be empowered by both top-down policies as well as bottom-up, grass-roots initiatives and intelligent use of technology are as follows:
 Financial/economic system, Environmental challenges, Feed and heal the world challenges, Energy challenges, Educational challenges, Political democratic reform across the world, Transformative government across the world, Equity and security across the world, Technology innovation and entrepreneurship as drivers of knowledge-based societies. These challenges are themselves logically and systemically interlinked in many and complex ways. We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too. It is for these reasons that I regard the decision last year to shift our efforts in space from low to high gear as among the most important decisions that will be made during my incumbency in the Office of the Presidency. JFK, September 12, 1962 Education, entrepreneurship, and innovation are the keys for solving these challenges. They are human endeavors and complex socioeconomic phenomena that are intrinsic to human nature as well as constitute both social and political engines of positive change and growth, provided they are balanced and guided by effective and transparent regulatory and incentive systems in place. Current local, regional, and global economic and financial conditions and trends make the need to trigger, catalyze, and accelerate high-quantity and high-quality entrepreneurial initiatives that are based on high-quality and high-quantity innovations (low-tech, medium-tech, and high-tech) even more clear and present as this is one of the major ways and means to target and achieve real, sustainable, and eventually accelerating GNP growth. Creative destruction is the “powerful mechanism” transforming and adjusting not only economies but also societies to new technoeconomic regimes having profound implications on the societal equilibrium and status quo. The systemic socioeconomic and cultural impacts of technology and innovation-driven creative destruction must, therefore, be better understood and politically managed. Instead of a wild force, creative destruction can and must be steered and put in the service of democratic societies. In doing that, policies should become not only global but also holistic and more sophisticated, thus, overcoming their traditional sectoral boundaries (policies for research, innovation, education, labor market, transport, and health). The holistic policy perspective should support and leverage creativity in the entire society, while losses due to the destructive powers of (radical) innovation and entrepreneurship should be alleviated at the level of the individual as opposed to the level of firms or sectors, irrespective of how big and important these firms or sectors are for a nation. If not, inequality, bitterness, defiance, distrust to democratic institutions, and violence will only increase and worsen in the world. Hence, economic growth may come from new and qualitatively different and superior initiatives in “sunrise” industries as well as revival of existing industries as it may be strategically more prudent to invest scarce and precious resources in carefully calculated strategic “bets” against main societal threats rather than keep throwing them after waning industrial sectors and declining firms and, in that sense, it may be best to provide incentives and possibilities for retraining, reinsertion, and/or early retirement programs to allow for real growth strategies to be implemented The so-called low-tech sectors are constantly revitalized and revolutionized with the help of generic technologies and innovative management practices. Think only of the green revolution with the tremendous effects on societies, including urbanization it still has. Textiles, food industry, and construction are but a few examples of areas where innovation and entrepreneurship does already make a difference. From a sector-specific perspective, one could assert that the high-tech growth is a myth. In fact, structural change is actually a very slow process in all national economies and the high-tech sectors represent still a very low share of national economies. The truth is that most often than not old industries adopt new technologies and breed new solutions as the expertise and know-how can most often than not migrate and be capitalized to closely interlinked activities and technologies.
 Hence, already here we are discerning a dilemma regarding targets in the modern innovation policies we most need. Hidden innovation practices must be better understood and supported and not only the new and high-tech areas of industrial development should benefit from the public policy support and R&D funding of more or less the same prioritized areas across the globe: that is, biotechnologies, nanotechnologies, ICT, and now most recently, on clean-tech.
 Since the beginning of our American history we have been engaged in change, in a perpetual, peaceful revolution, a revolution which goes on steadily, quietly, adjusting itself to changing conditions without the concentration camp or the quicklime in the ditch. The world order which we seek is the cooperation of free countries, working together in a friendly, civilized society. FDR, January 6, 1941 This is perhaps the most fundamental lesson we learn from the Nordic socioeconomic models and innovation policies, namely, that a strong focus on excellence and the needs of the few, while neglecting the needs and interests of the vast majority of the populations will not only lead to more unjust and polarized societies, it will also lead to grossly underperforming socioeconomic regimes compared to their overall performing potential. For each unemployed, sick, uneducated, or undereducated individual, there is a price to pay, an opportunity loss for all the others—sooner or later (see Fig. 1).
 Participation rates in vocational training and nonformal education versus formal education. Source: Adult Education Survey. The secret of success of the Nordic countries and economies is that policies address and balance needs of the many, not of the few, but without hampering personal development paths. The majority of citizens are included in multilocal decision-making webs and they learn early to trust and manage the basic rules of distributed power. It follows that innovation cannot exist without trusting the individual and without individuals trusting the state and the public sphere. Let us shortly consider what the main achievements of these societies are:
 The level of corruption is low and there is a system of check and balances and transparency that makes the public trustful and willing to contribute to common goods and to societal investments in education, training, health, public infrastructures, etc. There is always the scope of improvements, but the fundamental challenge for these societies is to preserve these qualities intact. Flexicurity systems enable the creative destruction forces in the economy to freely enfold and develop while the individual (the ordinary employee) as such is protected from the adverse consequences of these forces and increase mobility in the labor market. Hence, the incentive to try and fail, to innovate, and to experiment at the individual level are amply there, risk-taking costs are clearly lower in Nordic countries than in other areas of the world where individuals are most worried for how secure are their jobs because the consequences of losing it are enormous and with repercussions to the education and status of their children, etc. Again, the main challenge is the problem of “moral hazard” where individuals are tempted to lavishly misuse societal benefits. This is why empowering by allocating responsibilities, articulating expectations, and integration is a major policy and cultural issue in Scandinavia. Developing individual competences and focusing on high-quality education for all as well as on lifelong learning policies (see the figure) seems to be an additional major advantage of the Nordic knowledge-based economies. Lifelong learning in this respect is a key issue, as is the trust and the quality and effectiveness of the public services at all levels. Hence, the lessons learned from the Nordic countries are that innovation in the broad domains of the economic life, investment in human capital, development of democratic processes, and constant innovation in the public sector are fundamental aspects of future prosperity. From this follows the direct derivative of a collection of top-down policies as well as bottom-up initiatives. Specifically, the concepts of robust competitiveness and sustainable entrepreneurship are pillars of a regime that we call democratic capitalism (as opposed to “popular or casino capitalism”) where real opportunities for education and economic prosperity are available to all and especially the younger people (but not only). This would be the direct derivative of a collection of top-down policies as well as bottom-up initiatives (including strong R&D policies and funding but going beyond that to the development of innovation networks and knowledge clusters across regions and sectors):
 We define sustainable entrepreneurship as the creation of viable, profitable, and scalable firms. Such firms engender the formation of self-replicating and mutually enhancing innovation networks and knowledge clusters (innovation ecosystems) leading toward robust competitiveness. We understand robust competitiveness as a state of economic being and becoming that avails systematic and defensible “unfair advantages” to the entities that are part of the economy. Such competitiveness is built on mutually complementary and reinforcing low, medium, and high technology and public and private sector entities (government agencies, private firms, universities, and nongovernmental organizations).

First, existing and new small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that can provide better solutions for less and more environmental friendly will always be winners—even and perhaps especially in down markets and recessionary economic cycle stages—and this is the area where fiscal, monetary, institutional, intellectual property rights-related, and other public–private sector programs and initiatives are needed to help unlock, capture, and leverage fully the value-adding potential of the world's knowledge creation infrastructure (i.e., universities, research institutions, and private sector R&D facilities) by providing incentives and establishing a large number, scale, and scope of pilots connecting organically and effectively all stages of the value-adding knowledge chain (from the laboratory to the market via world-class SMEs that will be both locally as well as globally oriented by design and the new ones from their inception). Second, the role of an ever-innovating public sector, not only toward greater levels of efficiency and effectiveness, but also to new ways of organizing and addressing new emerging issues with the objective to provide framework conditions for socioeconomic development and to empower and attribute responsibility to citizens is fundamental. The more complex the world, the more important it is to develop intelligent, robust, responsive, learning, and flexible organization of the public services and policies (Fig. 9).
 The twenty-first century fractal innovation ecosystem. Adapted from: Carayannis E, Campbell D (2009) “Mode 3” and “quadruple helix”: toward a 21st century fractal innovation ecosystem. In: Carayannis EG, Formica P (eds) International Journal of Technology Management Special Issue on Innovation Networks and Knowledge Clusters 46(3/4) (forthcoming). Japan is a country where, on many indicators, is at the forefront of global knowledge production. The OECD STI Outlook 2008 states: “…, R&D outputs have not always appeared commensurate with the substantial investment in R&D. …Strengthening the efficiency of the innovation system will be essential to increasing growth” (see Fig. 10).
 Science and innovation profile of Japan. Yet, strengthening the efficiency of the innovation system implies that more efforts should be invested in making the Japanese society even more responsive and flexible to the needs of future knowledge societies and even more open to innovation and entrepreneurship by focusing on individual skills and empowerment. We would like to point out, in particular, the following challenges:
 Low levels of international R&D linkages, including a relatively low level of high-skill mobility. For example, R&D funded from abroad is very low in Japan. Career paths open to women. Generous maternal leave schemes and greater inclusion of women in high-skill professions is still a considerable challenge for a society facing the challenge of one of the fastest aging and least growing populations in the world. Job-to job mobility is very low. This is probably a reflection of the low structural change in the Japanese society, a result partly of excessive regulations in the most dynamic segments of all modern societies, that is, the service sector and partly a low degree of entrepreneurship, venture capital investment, and low numbers of new entries in a number of key economic sectors. Instead of securing jobs, the Japanese society should pay more attention to increasing of job mobility rates through ambitious and bold flexicurity as well as lifelong learning policies, such as what we find in the Scandinavian countries. This does not mean, however, that Japan should pursue a high-tech policy of economic restructuring. Innovation in the public sector should be prioritized as a key area of policy focus. The fundamental point to be made here is that all these issues are areas where several policies intermingle. These are also areas closely related to the final performance and direction of the Japanese economy and society. Therefore, they should be regarded equally as societal and economic challenges requiring considerable and more encompassing policy reforms than the ones already announced in the narrower domain of the present research and innovation policies. Again, the ultimate aim is that policies contribute to the empowerment and innovativeness of responsible citizens in a democratic and prosperous society. The challenge and opportunity is to engage on a large enough scale to convert the past failures of courage and imagination into future successes and to learn to convert counterproductive cynicism into empowering dreams grounded into reality. To identify and outline clearly and convincingly to all citizens of the US and the world a vision for the future and a strategy for change that is comprehensive, feasible, and compelling enough so to overcome the “cynicism premium” that politics has to pay to atone for prior failures of omission and commission.",13

Kassicieh,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The link between new firm creation and economic development has been documented by many authors such as Phan and Foo [1], Birch [2], Kirchhoff and Phillips [3], Park [4], Oakey [5], Reynolds [6], and Betz [7]. Malecki [8] maintains that capitalist systems are concerned with two major imperatives: creating new jobs and developing the economy through structural changes of innovation and through productivity improvement. The two development activities are extremely dependent on innovation and the effect of the knowledge economy. Castells and Hall [9] recount the story of Silicon Valley as the first of many technopoles where industrial complexes helped shape the future of their regions. Many authors have used many different factors to explain the increase in entrepreneurial activities in the Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). Smilor et al. [10] have described the role of university and laboratory spin-offs in local economic development. Florida and Gates [11] describe economic development as the situation where “people with ideas” and an environment that nurtures them is more important than research and development (R&D), financing, and entrepreneurial groups for job and wealth creation. Venkataraman [12] indicates the need for more than capital to accomplish development based on technology. Miller [13] supports the view that technological innovation drives economic growth, the globalization of markets, firm competitiveness, and a nation's standard of living. The resource availability and its effect on competitive advantage as well as the multiplier effect of such economic activity have been furthered by Porter [14]. Thompson [15] indicates that high technology development provides above average growth rates in a situation that requires balance between the countercyclical high technology sector and the more cyclical manufacturing sector. Bruno and Tyebjee [16] indicated that many factors encourage entrepreneurship in a region. These factors include availability of venture funding, experienced entrepreneurs, skilled labor, supplier's access, market access, universities, supportive government policies, facilities, logistics, receptive population, support services, and living conditions. The entrepreneurial act has been explained by personal individual factors as well as by many exogenous factors. Risk-taking behavior, motivation, and personal characteristics in technology-based start-ups have been explained by many authors such as Kassicieh et al. [17], Linton [18], Carayannis et al. [19], and Newbert et al. [20]. These are factors that are indigenous to the entrepreneur but what are the exogenous factors that can be influenced by public investments? The multiple factors have been well established but the policy makers especially in areas that do not have many of these factors are asking the question: Which areas do we fund to encourage entrepreneurial activities in an era of limited resources? Authors such as Acs and Storey [21], Armington and Acs [22], Audretsch et al. [23], Carlsson [24], DeVol and Fogelback [25], Delapierre et al. [26], Anderson [27], Kassicieh [28], Kassicieh and Radosevich [29], Reynolds et al. [30], Neck et al. [31], Wren [32], Smilor and Matthews [33], Antoncic and Hisrich [34], Von Bargen et al. [35], and Anderson et al. [36] tested many of these factors individually or in small clusters. Policy makers are interested in devising policies that can improve the situation in their regions and support more entrepreneurial activities but they would like to understand which of these policies, incentives, and conditions are more likely to lead to job and wealth creation if one if faced with a resource allocation question. Entrepreneurial activity drives economic development as jobs and wealth pump up the standard of living and the tax base of the region allowing further development over time. While new companies can focus on low technology or mature products or services, regions have figured that price-taking in these commodity product areas is less likely to produce comparatively high levels of wealth or high-paying jobs. This has increased the focus on technology-based entrepreneurship. Atkinson and Gottlieb [37] suggest that many governmental and nongovernmental organizations have undertaken efforts to better understand economic development in order to identify the factors that lead to a healthy job and wealth creation climate. It is widely believed that differences in economic development results seen between regions are largely attributable to initial differences in the factors that enable business creation. In an extensive search of the literature, we were able to identify 11 broad categories of factors identified as drivers for technology-based economic development as can be seen in Fig. 1.
 Link between government policies, factors, and economic development. This paper will examine the link between the factors and economic development, collect data to test hypotheses that link these exogenous factors to economic development establishing a priority of factors, and test these for 361 US MSA that include high-technology and low-technology environments to determine success factors in entrepreneurial activities.",12

Goldberg,Male,Male,Male,Male,"It is now well accepted that established technology firms must become “ambidextrous” to achieve optimal balance between exploitation and exploration [84], build entrepreneurial capabilities, and continuously innovate in order to survive long term. To augment their in-house research and development (R&D), such firms could avail themselves of external R&D, by now a proven resource of intellectual property (IP) and creative work. Such IP comes in tangible and intangible forms of inventions and technologies that can be the basis for or merely assist in developing incremental as well as disruptive products by the firms. In recent years, a new model of business based on “open innovation” has been espoused [20]. We introduce the construct of corporate exploration competence as a dynamic capability, important to strategic management in achieving ambidexterity. The proposed theoretical foundation for corporate exploration competence uses the strategic management framework of resource-based view (RBV) to integrate organizational entrepreneurial capabilities with organizational absorptive capacity (ACAP) [25] into the dynamic capability of corporate exploration competence. Corporate ACAP enables organizations to recognize opportunities, evaluate their market potential and technical feasibility, and make decisions toward utilizing them. Our study focused on the interdisciplinary field of medical imaging that integrates medicine, biology, physics, electronics, and computing. Sixty interviews and discussions were held with executives and researchers at GE (American), Siemens (German), Philips (Dutch), and Hitachi and Toshiba (Japanese) and with people from firms in other fields as well to gain a broader scope and to confirm findings. The first three listed above readily look for external knowledge (“we have adopted open innovation policy in our research program,” says Dr. Paul Smit [103], Senior Vice President of Strategy and Business at Philips Medical Systems). We found that these three firms have maintained top-notch internal R&D, which in turn allowed them to recognize and absorb external inventions and established and sustained both culture and structure that are directed specifically at the task of exploration and provide a readiness by the organization to introduce and internalize new knowledge. We found that GE, Siemens, and Philips have actively engaged in “open innovation” through both R&D and acquire and develop (A&D), while Hitachi and Toshiba did so to much lesser degree. Indeed, it turns out that the first three invested not just in a structure for exploration but also in creating a culture conducive to exploration. Coincidentally, the first three dominate the field of medical imaging, together owning about 85% of the market. Although it is tempting to look for causality here, we limit ourselves to conclude that culture and structure are each necessary but not sufficient for creating high corporate exploration competence, and having them together is a precondition for developing and sustaining such competence. To dispel a presumption that Japanese firms have an inherent difficulty in establishing a culture espousing open innovation, we found evidence to the contrary at Yamaha, a firm not involved in medical imaging, which has executed a brilliant strategy of open innovation, creating a technology from which we all benefit: digital electronic music [53].",6

Halal,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Most organizations sense that the world is passing through this technological revolution, but they lack convenient, reliable information to guide decisions. The TechCast Project (http://www.TechCast.org) conducted at George Washington University’s Institute for Knowledge & Innovation is designed to fill this need. Working online through a sophisticated website, we pool the knowledge of 100 high-tech executives, scientists and engineers, academics, consultants, futurists, and other leading experts around the world to forecast breakthroughs in all fields. And by cycling through this process every few months, we create a “learning system” leading to what can be thought of as “a scientific consensus.” Results are automatically aggregated and distributed over the site to corporations, governments, scientists, and the public—anywhere in the world, on any prominent technology, in real time. We suspect this may possibly represent the best forecast data ever assembled covering the entire spectrum of scientific and technological innovation. The US National Academies issued a recent report ranking TechCast among the top three such systems available, and Google searches rank it No. 2 or 3 out of 45 million hits. Results have been published in scientific journals, widely reported in the media, and used by organizations around the globe. The site reaches one million hits per year, and we have worked with corporations, governments, and other organizations. We find this approach to be very powerful. It can forecast any issue in any field; results are replicable within ±3 years, and the forecasting process itself enhances understanding. Our clients tell us “There is nothing else like it.” Figure 2 below illustrates that the TechCast method consists of the five phases: For more details, readers are referred to the website at www.TechCast.org.
 TechCast online research system. We first do extensive scanning of the scientific literature, media, Internet, interviews, and other sources to accumulate background data. Next, we organize the scanning data into an analysis consisting of the event to be forecast, data points, and trends opposing and driving each technology. The “events” or “milestones” are precisely defined adoption levels to be forecast for each technology. We usually use the 30% adoption level, but others are used where they seem appropriate. The 30% level is of particular interest because emerging technologies are usually entering the economic mainstream at this point. The breakthrough analyses are considered especially useful because they summarize the available knowledge on any technology in a succinct and convenient format. The experts work online to integrate all this information using their judgment to provide accurate estimates. We strive to enlist the most competent authorities with advanced degrees, extensive publications, relevant experience, and breadth of knowledge. Experts are drawn from nations around the globe, male and female, young and old. They include authorities working in research, business, government, academia, and other fields. Experts are asked to focus on areas they feel most knowledgeable about, so not all respond to all technologies. The system automatically aggregate estimates to calculate means for the “Most Likely Year” each technology will reach its adoption level in industrialized nations, the “Experts’ Confidence” in this forecast, and the likely “Market Size.” Delphi studies are consider reliable if they include a dozen or more experts, and these results surpass that criterion considerably, usually running about 50 or more datasets [4]. Experts’ comments and new background information are incorporated in an updated breakthrough analysis, and this process is repeated every year or so to “track” the forecast over time, allowing us to extrapolate better forecasts. “Arrival” dates are also noted to evaluate the accuracy of forecasts.",

From the first oil shock in the early 1970s to the current debate on how to combat climate change, policymakers in Europe have devoted attention and resources on developing economically and environmentally sustainable energy solutions. Governments are increasingly accepting the implications of climate change and taking measures to prepare their economies to a low carbon future. There are several events that express the increased policy focus on sustainable development and clean energy technologies. The Kyoto Protocol commitment among the European Union (EU)-15 for reducing GHG emissions by 2008–2012, is an important achievement. To promote clean energy by 2010, the EU has agreed, in accordance with the RES-E Directive of 2001, that 22.1% of electricity consumption should be met by renewable sources of electricity. In accordance with the objectives of the EU Spring Council in 2007, a new Energy and Climate package was presented by the EU Commission in January 2008, with an ambition of promoting 20% reduced GHG emissions, 20% renewable energy sources and 20% improved energy efficiency by the year 2020. These ambitions contribute to a certain degree to strengthening the legitimacy to support the development of sustainable energy technologies and to allocate resources for this development [15]. While many governments claim to support the diffusion of renewable energies, the actual rate of diffusion of technologies in the energy system varies to a large extent between countries [19]. There are countries that are fast movers. Other countries are to a larger extent struggling with issues of path dependency of dominant energy systems [24]. Central is also the role of policy makers’ expectations in technology development. These expectations are reflected in the rhetoric used by policy makers [15]. Energy R&D is an important policy instrument to meet national energy policy objectives. In the same time R&D priority setting is helping governments optimise national investments in R&D. As it has been pointed out by [20] for climate reasons in particular the energy sector needs a “creative destruction”, in which renewable energy technologies replace those using fossil fuels. Some European countries look at renewable energy combined with nuclear power as a solution for “clean” energy, as for instance France, Finland and the UK. Other countries, such as Denmark, Austria and Norway have firmly excluded nuclear as an option and focus on renewable energies and clean carbon technologies as long-term solutions. Public investments supporting high-risk and long-term energy technology projects play a central role. Government R&D investment is in many cases targeting high-risk areas and with a long-term perspective. On the other side, private sector investments are targeting on pre-competitive, short-term experimental technologies. Trends in R&D funding are in this context an important indicator of national energy R&D policy and of technical change [16]. The new technologies will have to challenge technologies that have been in place for a long time and that are essential to our economies. A transformation of the energy system can therefore not be expected to be achieved without government support [20]. Government policy has been the major incentive mechanism. R&D funding supports the creation of new knowledge, supplied resources and “guides the search of various actors to the new technologies” [20]. As is being argued by Hekkert, the “guidance of the search” indicates that technological change is not autonomous. Moreover, he argues that changing preferences in society can influence R&D priority setting and thus the direction of technological change. However, it is essential to stress that the guidance of the search is not only a matter of government influence. “It is often an interactive and cumulative process of exchanging ideas between technology producers, technology users” and many other actors in the market [15]. So far, there is no single technology that is capable of solving all challenges for a “carbon-free” future. Therefore, a portfolio of technologies is needed. Essential is coherence between overall energy strategy and actual funding of projects [16]. While the main goals for energy policy such as energy security, economic efficiency and emission reductions are similar from country-to-country, the technologies and resources differ, as we will see in the description of the countries selected for this paper. A recent study on energy research capacities in the EU concludes that Member States award a relatively low importance to energy research. Public funding for energy related R&D declined between 1991 and 2005. Large countries, like France, Germany and Italy allocated most of the funding on energy research in 2005. Despite that the situation seems to have been improved during last years on an aggregate level, the EU is lagging behind the USA and Japan [30]. A problem seems also to be a lack of synergies among member states which can be traced to heterogeneity in energy research priorities and institutional capacities [30]. As smaller states are concerned, it is especially important to take part in international science and technology networks as well as establish efficient knowledge transfer systems. The small size of the country may offer advantages for having access to a rather uncomplicated research and innovation system. On the other hand, the countries face the problem of critical mass, in terms of both finances and resources for the creation of needed knowledge [23]. Furthermore, competitive firms in small regional clusters and small countries often find their demanding customers internationally [18]. Factors such as interregional and international relationships and knowledge flows are seen as essential in innovation dynamics [14]. In literature on innovation systems, it is acknowledged that innovations are carried out by networks of actors where the interaction between them is stimulated and facilitated by national institutions setting the “rules of the game” [4]. Important to mention is also that in a EU context, specialisation of some smaller countries is recognised as central to the construction of a European Research Area in especially non-nuclear energy R&D [7]. One of the main objectives of the paper is to examine how Denmark, Austria and the Netherlands are using energy R&D as a policy instrument to reach energy policy targets and to guide the search for new technologies. A fundamental question is how public energy R&D spending correlates to the energy mix. The paper deals with the following research questions:
 Is the existing energy production leading the way for new technologies or is the opposite the case? Are policy makers trying to break the path dependency by funding energy technologies that are not part of the existing energy mix? Can the level and the direction of allocated public resources to energy R&D tell us something about the political ambition to create a low carbon society? The paper is structured in the following way. “Case selection” and “Method” sections contain a brief description of the criteria used for the selection of the case studies and the method applied for the analysis of the data. “Case studies” section gives a presentation of each case study with the empirical data. “Comparative analysis” section discusses and compares the data and the findings from the case studies. The main conclusions are presented in the final “Concluding remarks” section.",1

Some important considerations have walked through that door, for instance, human capital, research and development (R&D) expenditures carried out by firms, and technical change can all be summed up to explain why advanced economies grow beyond considering labor force and capital allocation efficiency. A superior ability to explode the new technology is required [27] at the same time that two important trends in the world economy are reinforcing: first, technological innovations are becoming an ever more important contributor to economic well-being; second, the nations in the world economy are becoming increasingly open and increasingly interdependent. Recent economic history has registered two stylized facts. First, growth in per capita income has been sustained at positive and apparently nondeclining rates for prolonged periods of time. Second, dynamic performance has varied greatly across different countries in a given time period (see [8, 19, 24, 26] among others). However, advances in economic growth theory are in contrast on the growth mechanics experimented by the economies. In one hand, some defenders of the so-called Neoclassical position find that this process is result of factors accumulation (physical and human capital, mainly). On the other hand, the endogenous growth theory considers that the process is explained by technological progress (Solow’s residual).Footnote 1 This controversy is not far of being crucial because if realized growth rates are not the outcome of a random process but rather of observable features of the economies, such as government policies; then the economic growth promotion through public expenditure (guided by government) or guided by market forces in many developing countries may be questioned. Meanwhile, a reason for the second stylized fact seems to be in the different abilities of the countries to access the technological innovations. This paper offers an empirical contribution about the behavior of the innovation activity in Mexico, a country that has experimented important reforms and changes in economy policy that altered his path of growth. The literature has emphasized the importance of the innovative activity for the economic growth performance of the economies (see [3, 5, 7] among others). In this work, we address an experience where innovations may help to explain a great part of the history. During a long period of time Mexico was a small closed economy that generated all (or almost) of its technical know-how by its own research efforts.Footnote 2 In making so, Mexico neglected perhaps one important mechanism by which integration into the world economy can promote innovation and growth. That is, interacting with the world may gain access to the large body of knowledge that has already been accumulated in the international research community, as well as to some of the new discoveries that are being made there. As a result, Mexico remained behind of the international community in many technological aspects. With the change of accumulation pattern towards the international scene since the eighties, a process of catching-up in technology terms is expected, mainly because multinationals investments arrived to the country. From the trade opening in the 1980s, and most specifically, from the signature of the North-American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mexico has increasingly been more integrated to the world economy, and the transfer of technology has considerably grew as consequence of the great increase in the number of patents registered by the multinationals in the country. Due to the high costs in research and development (R&D) in Mexico, the joint ventures, the strategic alliances, and any type of agreement among enterprises have been multiplied. Some works ([6, 15, 16, 25] among others) have documented the economic impact of the trade openness in Mexico. However, the technology transfer and the patents have been scarcely studied. We consider the patent system like crucial because it reflects a new phase of the economic integration of Mexico as a result of the great transformation undergone by the Mexican economy to the process of world integration. The aim of this work is to study if the flow of patents in Mexico has undergone a structural change from the trade openness in the 1980s and 1990s. If the Mexican residents meet and interact with foreign counterparts, they may find occasions to learn technical information that contributes to the Mexican stock of knowledge. The crucial value is to find that these structural changes are linked with the main economic events occurred in the national sphere. Our hypothesis is that in the 1980s and 1990s, the openness trade (particularly NAFTA) and, conversely, the modification to the rights of intellectual property produced one inflection (structural change) in the capacity of the Mexican patents system to expand and assimilate the technological information that allowed to the country major economic growth, at the same time that regional inequality was increased—for the regional aspects, see, for instance, Esquivel [21], Chiquiar [15], Carrion-i-Silvestre and German-Soto [13], among others. In this work, we will concentrate in the first part of the hypothesis. With the end to offer empirical evidence on this hypothesis, we based our innovation regressions in techniques of time series that estimate unit roots having breaks. Time series studies focus on the long run behavior of one variable, and also, they allow identifying the effects of such breaks. A structural break essentially corresponds to an intermittent shock with a permanent effect on the series. If this shock is not explicitly taken into account, standard unit root tests would in general mistake the structural break for a unit root. Because of our patents, series are expected to have one or two structural breaks, as consequence of trade reforms, this technique is widely appropriate for the purposes of this work. The results from regression equations suggest the existence of one strong link among innovation and trade liberalization in Mexico because it is possible to identify a depth upwards inflection in the innovation series from the time when Mexico started the process of world integration around 1994. Until two structural breaks are located after 1994 suggesting an important increase of innovation activity with the trade openness. The break points were estimated by the models around 1996 and 1999 for the nonresidents’ series case; in contrast, 1978 and 1993 were identified for the residents’ series. One explanation is that trade liberalization increased the investments by multinationals in this country and they also augmented the number of patents. Because of patents signify more advanced technology, and then this new process of economic growth essayed by Mexico may be defined as one of “technology learning.” Our work is developed as follows. In this first section, we have displayed the introduction. In the second section, we approached the theoretical background, whereas in “Time series methodology,” we review the main aspects of the methodology. The fourth section is dedicated to describe the database and “Empirical results” comments on the main empirical results. Finally, “Conclusions” emphasizes some conclusions.",4

Exemplification of such cycles references radical innovation such as sail-to-steam in shipping, air versus ground mobility and digital over analogue communication media. This perspective comes under severe scrutiny when it is realised that all these transitions shared dependence on a fundamental hydrocarbon energy input. We are privileged as social scientists and citizens to live at a point in time when the deep, propulsive resource that fuelled every technological paradigm since the onset of the Industrial Age seems itself to be in question. Under the hypothesis that climate change and the so-called peak oil explain the possible future demise of hydrocarbons as main energy providers to economic evolution, we propose to consider the present conjuncture alternatively, and more boldly speaking, as a new post-hydrocarbon ‘socio-technical landscape’ [22, 40]. In the first section of this paper, two approaches to regime theory (urban and technological) will be contrasted and the case made for the superiority of the coevolutionary elaboration of the latter perspective over the former for this specific, meta-transitional conjuncture. In time, if this analysis is correct, the post-hydrocarbon landscape may expect also periodically to be characterised by technological paradigms as post-hydrocarbon radical innovations effect ‘creative destruction’ of the kind Schumpeter identified. At this point, an attempt is made to interpret transition thinking with an important foundation of this paper, namely transitions in relation to varieties of capitalism. Our two main exemplar ‘transition regions’ are moderately well representative of national/regional varieties of capitalism. The first exemplar is Jutland, Denmark, normally considered a ‘coordinated market’ country, whilst the second is California, USA, that in most accounts is considered a ‘liberal market’ economy. Aficionados of such typologies will immediately recognise certain weaknesses in such designations, seldom made to include regional institutional variance. In Cooke et al. [15], we noted that Denmark had evolved a liberal economy whilst retaining a Nordic-style welfare state. It was therefore a hybrid that we termed ‘social market’. For example China is also a hybrid with both coordinated and liberal market characteristics. California is closer to the liberal market archetype, yet retains certain countercultural social capital (e.g. Silicon Valley oppositionalism to East Coast corporate capital) and, for example, strong environmental consciousness. Thus, California’s Republican Governor Schwarzenegger was among that party’s greenest politicians. At least we may suggest that California has not been America’s most neoliberal market state. Earlier mention of Schumpeter in the context of California and America’s West requires a small addendum to the theoretical section of this paper. It is widely assumed that Schumpeter had little of direct interest to say regarding the concerns of regional science and, especially, evolutionary economic geography, the perspective from which this contribution is positioned. Even in Andersen’s [1] magisterial treatment of Schumpeter’s intellectual evolution, only one tiny and a second, less tiny, fragments of interest are evidenced. The first concerns the impact of the department store upon the rise of cities that possessed them, leading to the demise of smaller, specialist stores. But the second introduces the category of regional innovation as one of the five types (product, process, organisational and input being the others) of innovation envisaged by Schumpeter, the one, furthermore, that he considered promulgating the purest type(s) of radical innovation. Somewhat clumsily, he termed ‘regional’ innovation by the epithet ‘railroadization’. Pure radical innovation occurs when new lands are opened up because novelty is unleashed in many related ways. Thus, mail order logistics were both necessary and enabled by railroads—not just for clothing but agricultural equipment and ‘flatpack’ housing more contemporarily associated with IKEA. Services innovation emerged with farming manuals supplied by the railroad companies meeting the need to coach new farmers in the rubrics of agriculture appropriate to the new lands. Farmers and their intermediaries innovated the forerunners of today’s hedge funds with their need for ‘futures’ and ‘options’ to insure against price fluctuations in the new specialised beef, sheep or pork farms. The architecture of the railheads, especially that of the new cement-built grain silos, influenced the Bauhaus style, the epitome of modern architecture of the early twentieth century, and so on. In Cooke and Schwartz [16], we showed how one evolutionary strand of Schumpeterian regional economics led from Veblen’s concept of ‘cumulative causation’ to Myrdal and Hirschman giving us a regional disequilibrium perspective that underpins the present paper. But, better known perhaps is the strand woven first by Perroux, directly rendering Schumpeter’s notion of ‘swarming’ of entrepreneurs imitating innovations and causing the evolution of complex input–output schedules into regional space and then advocating growth pole policy on its back, stimulating also technical instrumentation such as input–output modelling, linkage studies (Hirschman, again) and, ultimately, regional science after Isard.Footnote 1 This, of course, introduced also the Trojan horse of neoclassical economics and positivism, thus condemning regional economics to the outer darkness until Krugman [36] rescued it with a variant of disequilibrium theory. This rested upon increasing returns to scale and, accordingly, spatial monopoly as end-products of spatial competition. At this point in time, it is possible to discern some temporal as well as spatial repercussions of ‘railroadization’ that seem to continue to underpin the few innovative or inventive and potentially innovative regions to have been studied in this way. Some, it has to be admitted, seem like dinosaur economies that refuse to die, as with Klepper’s [33] studies of Detroit, and Boschma and Wenting’s [5] study of the rise of Britain’s automotive industry. In both cases, though, related variety explains much of the phenomena of their cluster emergence, as does Buenstorf and Klepper’s [6] complementary study of the rise of the Akron tyre cluster. Contrariwise, Cantwell and Iammarino [7] found Italy’s economically buoyant regions to have consistently displayed elements of sectoral ‘related variety’ of the kind associated mostly with Jacobs [28] in their innovativeness. Even Glaeser et al. [26], setting out to understand the growth of cities as an effect of specialisation of industry, found the empirical counterfactual of Jacobian variety explaining more of the variance. The second and third sections of the paper thus take advantage of this author’s current concern about the state of this planet and interest in finding out as much as possible about innovations aimed at finding markets (strategic niche management) to mitigate and assist in the eventual transition to a post-hydrocarbon technological ‘landscape’. Accordingly, ‘convergence’ among technological innovations is unusually clearly to the forefront, as will be seen. But instead of this being confined to some semi-random or complex entrepreneurial process, it can also be shown to operate in structured ways dependent upon Jacobian clustering and Schumpeterian path-dependent regional innovation processes, resulting in ecologies of what can only be described as regionalised cluster ‘mutation’. Empirics are drawn from strong evidence in North Jutland and California. Alternative models are hinted at for Norway (Statoil; REC) and Sweden (Örnsköldsvik) in brief sketches of other variants of regional innovation by mutation. Brief conclusions form the final part of the paper.",16

Innovation policy is the cross-cutting policy or vehicle through which STI is to be stimulated to play an economic role: Science and technology itself is becoming more integrated in economic life, and national innovation systems have become the accepted frame of reference for policy making in this area [11, 12]. Optimizing the interrelations between institutional and technological developments in national innovation systems or its regional version, regional innovation systems, are seen as key instruments in achieving competitiveness. To be competitive implies being dynamic, being able to change and adapt to new circumstances, to adopt and develop new knowledge and technologies. It means not only to succeed in product markets, but also in competing for people, resources and investments and skills. This dynamism is mostly addressed at the national level in the context of national policies for competitiveness, implying also that national innovation systems are competing which each other. Dynamism is improved through framework conditions, cluster policies, research policies, taxation policies and education policies, to name but a few, with the view to stimulate competitive capabilities at the national (or regional) level. At the same time, the world economy is integrating, a process mostly referred to as globalisation. The key challenge for national and regional governments is then to adapt their governance systems and processes to take this context into consideration. The increasing importance of global governance was recently addressed by an expert group on the global governance of science to the EU Commission.Footnote 1 The expert group states: “As countries and regions set their sights on becoming “knowledge economies” and mandated science is targeted particular objectives, there emerge new forms of “techno-nationalism”. By contrast, scientists tend to look across national borders, creating a tension between science and national political economies. Yet links between scientists and mechanisms of global governance are typically much weaker than those with national governments. Where international organisations have the potential to govern globally, they do not have the weight, in terms of funding, steering and the use of science to complement their policies. The global governance of science thus calls for new global relations between what might be called the society of science and the larger society in which science exists, treating each as active participants in new relationships.” (p. 17) Such governance structures have been put in place to solve joint problems, not to enhance competitiveness. In fact, the expert group points to the potential problem of excessive attention to governance might be detrimental to competitiveness in a global context if, e.g. Europe should pursue higher standards in the production of knowledge than other countries or regions. Hence there is a need to distinguish between global governance of science, as an imperative for sound and common frameworks for science worldwide, from international governance of research and innovation which may be better suited to enhance competitiveness of knowledge economies. For this purpose, regional (supra-national) solutions are emerging, providing institutions and mechanisms for coordination and steering to, e.g. improve competitiveness. Examples are the EU (European Research Area and the EU framework Program), the African Ministerial Council on Science and Technology, the MERCOSUR of Latin America, the Nordic Council of Ministers, and the ASEAN in South-EAST Asia. Such governance solutions lie at the heart of this article and will be discussed below. In these cases, the key issue is integration leading to new governance mechanisms. I will argue in this article that in the area of science, technology and innovation supra-national, regional integration emerge to respond to the challenges of the global economy. This integration offers dedicated governance mechanisms, creating an additional layer of governance to which regions and nations must adapt and shape their own responses. I will place this development in the broader discussion of governance, using as examples developments in the European Research Area (ERA), the Nordic cooperation, and the increasing cooperation in South-East Asia through ASEAN. The issue to be researched in this paper is therefore to what extent there may be a potential tension between national and regional science and innovation governance structures for enhancing competitiveness and the need of global science policy governance structures for jointly solving global societal and environmental challenges. More concretely, this paper examines supra-national research and innovation governance solutions for competitiveness and economic growth as integration mechanisms for tackling economic globalization.",9

While this encompassing view implied a systemic approach, the European knowledge landscape remains fragmented [4]. The European Commission has been expressing the need to better integrate all the parts of the knowledge policy agenda for some time, noting in particular [13]:
 the lack of innovation and entrepreneurial culture in research and higher education; a lack of investment, in particular private investment, in research and development (R&D); the difficulty Europe has in translating R&D results into commercial opportunities. Why, despite the official efforts supporting investment in R&D, education and innovation, the objective of a knowledge-based economy and society has been attained just in part? A mere increase in financial resources devoted to R&D achieves little in the absence of an increase in the level and quality of education of the population and in the use of research output by innovators.Footnote 1 Some objectives within each of the knowledge domains cannot be attained if addressed in isolation: while it is in principle possible for public funds for R&D to be increased at will, it is not possible to mandate increases in private ones. Even granting tax incentives to private R&D could not be enough to do the trick if other conditions are missing: lack of qualified personnel (inadequacy of the education system), costly patenting of new products (inadequacy of the innovation system) and so on. In this article, we rely on the concept of knowledge triangle to argue that:
 Progress in research, education and innovation has to be looked for in a synchronised way: lack of progress in one domain can hinder advances in the others too. Attention must be paid to the links between the three domains: lack of proper links between the elements of the system can render advances in a single domain ineffective. The different degree of overlapping of institutional responsibilities at the EU and member state level, i.e. the governance of the whole process, make it even more complex to articulate adequate policy measures. In what follows, we use the concept of knowledge triangle to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the EU knowledge policies as set in the Lisbon strategy and to highlight the increasing prominence it is having in its follow-up, the Europe 2020 strategy. We will also examine the governance aspects, as they are crucial for an effective implementation of an integrated knowledge policy.",32

Worldwide, the economy is changing thanks to an unprecedented revolution in technology. This age is marked by nations making the transition towards a knowledge-based economy (KBE), due to the increasing global interdependency and rapidly evolving technologies across various industries. While there is little consensus as to what knowledge actually is, its accumulation, transformation, and valuation lie at the heart of intellectual capital management. It has come to play a predominant role in defining the productive power of corporations, and it accounts for an increasing proportion of their capital. The accounting expression for the knowledge resource discussed above is commonly referred to as “intangible assets” or as “intellectual capital” (IC). The term IC has many complex connotations and is often used synonymously with intellectual property (IP), intellectual assets, and knowledge assets. IC can be classified into two categories: human capital and structural capital (Best Practices in Knowledge Management, GIGA Information Group, 1997). This categorization can be illustrated within a knowledge management framework as illustrated in Fig. 1.
 A knowledge management framework Human capital or intangible capabilities are defined as those distinctive factors of competitive advantage that differentiate a business from its competitors. They deal with the people aspects of knowledge management. Examples include: human resources or employee know-how, customer satisfaction, trade secrets and consulting processes, and market competences. Structural capital are defined as those assets which have enforceable ownership rights—this means they can be bought, sold, stocked in disembodied form, and they can also be securitized. Examples are: franchises, copyrights, patents, trademarks, brands, domain names, software, and licenses. They have the human knowledge embedded in them by transforming them into tangible company goods. These assets are the only form of IC that can be objectively valued and are recognized for accounting purposes. Hence, from these definitions, IC can be viewed as both the end result of a knowledge transformation process or the knowledge itself that is transformed into IP or intellectual assets of a firm.",8

Hanna,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"National e-development strategies and programs are typically communicated in planning documents in terms of their final design. Similarly, aid agencies present these national information and communication technologies (ICT) programs and projects for financing in final blueprint terms, not process terms. That gives the impression of a highly controlled, deductive, linear planning exercise, starting from a comprehensive analysis and ending with a comprehensive blueprint, or starting from an isolated pilot that is fully designed and appraised upfront.Footnote 1 The reality is quite different. Like all strategies, those related to e-development seldom emerge full blown. This article presents the case of e-Sri Lanka strategy, more as a vision and process than a final product and detailed prescriptive plan. Examining e-development strategy formulation and implementation as a process through a case study can make important contributions to our understanding and practice. First, it offers a model for practitioners to reflect on their own practices, become participant–observers, and help contribute to multidisciplinary research on national ICT strategy. Second, it conveys a more realistic picture of the messy, creative, and emergent processes involved—providing researchers with a rich source for theory building, hypothesis testing, and capturing best practices. It can thus help engage scholars and thoughtful practitioners and enhance their dialog on building the knowledge society [37]. Third, it shows the role of frameworks and conceptual models in guiding strategy design and implementation. Fourth, it captures the political and institutional dynamics that shapes e-development strategies. Early political backing and coalition formation, timely mobilization of resources, dynamic negotiation of priorities and sequencing of implementation are often neglected in the reductionist recasting of ICT application in development. Yet, these are critical aspects of strategy design, implementation and sustainability. Finally, a case study of the strategy development process allows for contextual understanding of the linkages and interdependencies among the various elements of e-development. Unlike common descriptions of national ICT strategies, this case study goes beyond static assessment of the knowledge economy and e-readiness to capture the dynamics of developing and implementing a strategy and of building partnerships within the country. It goes beyond the typically long laundry list of recommendations for transforming a country into a knowledge economy. It reflects the hard choices and tradeoffs that must be made in designing and implementing e-development within real-life human, financial, and institutional constraints. It takes account of initial conditions, stakeholder interests, institutional learning, and political dynamics. Obviously, this does not suggest that the emerging e-development strategy analyzed here was perfectly designed upfront, or guaranteed successful implementation; the outcomes will depend on many contextual factors that are beyond the control of the designers and implementers. In fact, this case study demonstrates that much of the success (or failure) of e-development programs can depend on continuous adaptation and learning during implementation, that is, on integrating deliberate and emergent strategies. This case study gives an overview of the experience of e-Sri Lanka, moving from a vision of e-development to a full-fledged program design and then to implementation. It analyzes the process that motivated the design of e-Sri Lanka and came to guide its continuing evolution. It examines the dynamics of the donor–country relationship, the efforts to bridge the gap between local aspirations and capabilities, and the iterative process of moving from initial entry points to a holistic vision and integrated program of ICT-enabled development. It opens up the design process and the influence of stakeholders to examination and reflection so as to search for lessons—lessons in building e-leadership institutions, designing e-government programs, and promoting innovation in ICT use for reducing poverty and empowering communities. It sheds light on the dynamic nature of partnership between the aid agency and client country and how this partnership has been shaped by incentives facing individuals and institutions.

But now it is silent. In deconstructing the silence, it would be untrue to state that Canada has abandoned its position as a “world leader” in the uses of the Internet for development, which would imply someone had thought about it. If the silence is a sin, it is one of omission. There is no longer a sustained commitment to a comprehensive national vision. The issues of e-development are not a concern of everyday politics. The reasons why are embedded in the general context of Canadian politics and public administration. Success in Canadian political decision making can be understood as a process of holding competing visions of Canada in balance. But the Canada of today has no means to examine its collective aspirations as a nation, never mind the particulars of its response to the complexities of an Internet economy. Conscious of this absence, the Canadian electorate has just voted three times for minority governments.Footnote 1 They presumed correctly that national capacity for government can continue while the ability to govern should be limited. This put Canadian politicians in a double bind. Partisan conflict has risen because of the tensions that sharing power in minority governments produce. Canadians are not hard-nosed partisans. John Ralston Saul has listed the “strategic elements”Footnote 2 of Canadians:
 Obsession with egalitarianism. Desire to maintain a balance of individuals and groups. Delight in playing with a non-monolithic idea of society—a delight in complexity. Tendency to run society as an ongoing negotiation, which must be related to our distaste for resolving complexities. Preference for consensus—again, an expression of society as a balance of complexity, a sort of equilibrium. Belief that behind the formal written and technical face of society lies something more important, which Canadians try to get at through complex relationships. Sense that the clear resolution of differences will lead to injustice and even violence. Preference for minimal impairment—the obligation of those in authority to do as little damage as possible to people and to rights when exercising that authority. In the jargon of global Internet Governance debates, Canadians believe in the efficacy of “collaborative peer-to-peer relationships in open systems.” in the resolution of complex problems. By causing an enormous shift in the autonomy of individuals, the Internet intensifies the significance of their local knowledge and practices. The Internet intensifies the self-determination of identity and re-defines the nature of governance.Footnote 3
 The networks of an “Internet Economy” are made up of people, not technologies. Viewing the Internet as a symptom of a transformation already in being makes it possible to ask—what happens when a nation, acting as an organizational system that learns, begins to internalize that transformation? This question is at the heart of e-development planning as a practice. As individuals, many Canadians would recognize the importance of modeling the Canadian societyFootnote 4 as an organizational system that learns. But, at the national government level and in current Canadian politics, there is no obvious repository of intellectual curiosity about the nature of the socioeconomic and political shifts in the system's worldview and governance that the Internet's existence reveals. And yet, there is a rapidly growing political responsibility to apply what we now know about daily life online. Canada is almost a fully wired country.Footnote 5 But the Government of Canada is resting on the assumption that the technology in itself is the job, and that the job is largely finished. Deregulation of the telecommunications industries in favor of a “market-based approach” has slowed down Internet oriented infrastructure investment. As a consequence of policy drift, and because of growing bandwidth limitations and an absence of plans and policies to address them, growth in capacity for the effective use of ICTs in Canada has stalled. Whatever the Canadian experience of addressing and then neglecting e-development shows, Canada is a nation with an advanced networked economy. Its economy is Internet based. Yet its capacity to formally recognize and address the significance of that fact is extremely limited.",2

Knight,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Developing the information society in Brazil was the subject of a pioneering effort by the Ministry of Science and Technology back in 1999–2000. A team coordinated from that Ministry produced a report known as the Green Book (Livro Verde) in the year 2000 [51]. In that same year, an institutional framework was created to develop e-government programs at the federal level. Then, in 2004, the subject of e-government in Brazil was treated in a pioneering way in e-gov.br—a próxima revolução brasileira (e.gov.br—the next Brazilian revolution) [18]. Contributions by 44 specialists documented and analyzed Brazil’s achievements in building an information society and conducting a wide range of e-government activities in education, health, public safety, justice, elections, legislation, public administration, and digital inclusion (bridging the digital divide). Brazil’s major regions and the federal, state, and local governments were covered. Shortly after this publication, another book appeared, e-government—o governo eletrônico no Brasil (e-government—electronic government in Brazil) [26] with contributions by 30 specialists. A major project on strategic scenario development was carried out by the Presidency of Brazil’s Strategic Studies Nucleus (Núcleo de Assuntos Estratégicos, NAE) in 2005, and this included scenarios for ICT use [42, 52]. But through 2009, there was little evidence that they had much impact on national development strategy, perhaps in part because of staff changes at the NAE, now the Secretariat for Strategic Affairs (Secretaria de Assuntos Estratégicos, SAE). The e-Brasil Project (Box 1), initiated in October 2005, was a continuation of these pioneering efforts to mobilize the intellectual capital needed to raise the priority of a more focused e-development strategy at the national, state, and municipal levels. Box 1: The e-Brasil Project
 During 2009, in the context of a growing national debate on a proposed National Broadband Plan being prepared by the Federal Government, some participants proposed elements of transformation strategies for Brazil that go well beyond such a plan, stressing the positive role ICT can play. One such proposal has been published in both Portuguese and English versions [53], a white paper drawing on the presentations and discussions held during a conference on ICT 2020—Transformation Strategies for Brazil.Footnote 1 The SAE organized a seminar held in Brasília in November 2009 at which the government revealed the general outlines of the National Broadband Plan. This plan was finally launched in May 2010 in the form of a presidential decreeFootnote 2 creating the National Broadband Program (Programa Nacional de Banda Larga, PNBL), discussed further below. Other participants in this debate have been presenting their views in private to government policy makers and in public during various national and regional conferences. For example, at a high-level seminar organized by Telebrasil, a trade association led by large telecommunications operators, and Brasscom, another trade association representing large ICT equipment and service companies, presented a range of quite detailed proposals, with quantified targets for most of them, for accelerating Brazilian socioeconomic development through a wide variety of programs. Most of these involved further stages of existing government programs or private sector initiatives, with governments providing new government financing, tax reductions, and other incentives. A major new program would be the PNBL, using Brasscom’s preferred approach of tax reductions at both the federal and state levels as a principal means to stimulate demand and encourage private sector investment, one of the approaches also preferred by Telebrasil [5, 54]. Within the federal government, different ministries and organs presented competing views regarding the role of the state. Diverse private sector enterprises and interest groups as well as NGOs lobbied for their viewpoints. The Ministry of Communications favored a greater role for the private sector, while groups within the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management and the Presidency favored greater public sector involvement, including in the ownership and operation of fiber optic backbones, networks for the government’s own use, and in some cases sales direct to final customers. As it turned out, the PNBL is to rely less on tax reductions and more on the use of a federal telecommunications enterprise, a resurrected Telebrás, to achieve its goals, discussed below, though the private sector will be expected to expand services and engage in greater competition. A 4-day National Communications Conference (Confecom), with participation of government, private, and organized civil society sectors was held in Brasília in December 2009, approving 641 different proposals. It is possible that from the debate centered on the PNBL and the Confecom, some kind of consensus and a more coherent national strategy for e-development may emerge, though as of mid-2010, it was still far from clear. A Presidential decree in June 2000 established the Secretariat for Logistics and Information Technology in the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management (SLTI/MP) as the lead agency for developing and implementing an e-government framework. SLTI/MP serves as the secretariat for an inter-agency e-government committee chaired by the President’s Civilian Chief of Staff (Ministro da Casa Civil), the Executive Committee on e-Government (Comitê Executivo do Governo Eletrônico, CEGE), to which a number of specialized inter-agency technical groups report. These formal e-government structures remained in place with only minor changes through June 2010. Other ministries and agencies have responsibilities for other aspects of e-development—most importantly the Ministry of Communications and the National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) for Telecommunications (including radio and television) and their regulation, the Ministry of Science and Technology and its agencies for ICT R&D and innovation (including the development of the important academic and research Internet, RNP), the Ministry of Trade and Economic Development for ICT industrial and trade strategy, and the Ministry of Education for formal ICT education and e-learning. Training in ICT skills is the province of specialized agencies in the “S system” (SENAI for industry, SENAC for commerce, SEBRAI for small business, etc.). The private sector and NGOs also play important and complementary roles in shaping e-development strategies. As digital inclusion became an increasingly important theme during the two governments of President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (2003–2010), programs in this area were developed by several different ministries. Despite several attempts at coordination, including through a technical group of the CEGE, it was not until well into the second half of the second Lula government, in August 2009, that a serious effort to coordinate them was undertaken through a Presidential DecreeFootnote 3 creating the Management Committee for Digital Inclusion (Comitê Gestor do Programa de Inclusão Digital, CGPID), this time based in the office of the President. The CGPID originally had the following five principal responsibilities:
 Establish general directives for the management and application of financial resources for the Digital Inclusion Program and the projects which make it up; Approve the annual work program of the Digital Inclusion Program and evaluate its results periodically; Accompany and monitor the implementation and performance of the projects in the Digital Inclusion Program; Interact with other management committees and inter-ministerial working groups in the Federal Government, the States, and Municipalities having specific objectives linked to digital inclusion programs and projects; and Undertake studies and proposals related to projects in the Digital Inclusion Program to provide inputs into decisions in the sphere of the Presidency of the Republic relating to digital inclusion projects and programs. In the decree establishing the PNBL, six additional responsibilities were added:
 Provide assistance and advice to the organs of the Presidency of the Republic related to projects and programs of digital inclusion; Define the actions, goals, and priorities of the PNBL; Promote and encourage partnerships between public and private entities to achieve the objectives of the PNBL; Determine the technical definition of broadband access for the PNBL; Accompany and evaluate the actions to implement the PNBL; and Publish an annual report on the actions, goals, and results of the PNBL. The CGPID also was broadened from 8 to 12 members in the PNBL decree. Furthermore, CGPID’s mandate was expanded with the general objective encouraging and disseminating the use and supply of ICT goods and services to:
 Massify access to broadband Internet connections; Accelerate economic and social development; Promote digital inclusion; Reduce regional and social inequalities; Promote the generation of employment and income; Expand e-government services and facilitate citizen access to State services; Promote the training of the population in the use of information technologies; and Increase Brazilian technological autonomy and competitiveness. Four members of the CGPID represent organs related to the Presidency of the Republic (President’s Civilian Chief of Staff, its chair with a tie-breaking vote; President’s Personal Office; Secretariat of Social Communication; and Secretariat for Strategic Affairs) and eight represent ministries (Communications; Science and Technology; Education; Culture; Planning, Budget and Management; Development, Industry, and Foreign Trade; Health; and Finance). Members of the CGPID are nominated by their respective organizations and approved by the Minister Chief of the President’s Civilian Staff (Ministro Chefe da Casa Civil da Presidência da República). The CGPID has an Executive Secretariat based in the Personal Office of the President to which a Permanent Technical Advisory Unit is attached. The Executive Secretariat can invite representatives of other public or private organizations to participate, without vote, in meetings of the CGPID. Resolutions of the CGPID are approved by a simple majority vote. Four thematic groups, coordinated by representatives of different Ministries, report to the CGPID: Infrastructure and Telecommunications Services; Applications; Content; and Industrial Policy, Technological Development, and Innovation. Additional thematic groups can be created by decision of the CGPID. The overall structure relating to the CGPID is provided in Fig. 1.
 Structure of the management committee for digital inclusion (GGPID) The decree instituting the PNBL also gave an important role to Telebrás, formerly a federal holding company for state telecommunications companies and largely inactive after their privatization in 1998. Telebrás is to:
 Implement the private communications network of the federal public administration; Provide support for public policies on broadband Internet connections for universities, research centers, schools, hospitals, health posts, community telecenters and other points of public interest; Provide infrastructure and support networks for telecommunications services supplied by private enterprises, States, the Federal District, Municipalities, and non-profit entities; and Provide broadband Internet connections for final users (only in localities where there is no adequate private sector supply of such services). To carry out its mandate, Telebrás was authorized to use, operate, and maintain the telecommunications networks belonging to the public federal administration or controlled by it, including public and mixed capital enterprises. For those federally owned or controlled enterprises, Telebrás has to enter into formal agreements (convênios)—the most important will be with the federal electric distribution companies controlled by Eletrobrás and the federal mixed-capital enterprise, Petrobrás, that have extensive networks of fiber-optic cables linked to their respective high-tension transmission networks and pipelines. To provide some important inputs to the CGPID, a Connected Brazil Forum composed of some 60 representatives of various federal, state, and municipal government agencies, private sector interest groups, and NGOs was established in June 2010. As of mid-2010, it was not yet clear how effectively CGPID and Telebrás will be able to carry out their important responsibilities. The new institutional arrangements offer some promise for establishing what had previously been missing in Brazil: an overarching e-development strategy and plan capable of realizing the potential synergies and returns to scale in the use of ICT to accelerate socioeconomic development. Without a whole-of-government approach and effective coordination from near the top of the government providing clear incentives to adhere to the plan and to involve major non-government stakeholders (the private sector, academic and research institutions, and NGOs), e-development is unlikely to realize anything like its full potential at any level in Brazil’s federal system. The new arrangements were announced just as the campaigns to elect a new President, state governors, and both federal and state legislatures were about to begin. Thus, whether the promise is fulfilled will depend on how these campaigns develop and the priorities of the new federal and state governments to take office in January 2011. It will also depend on the leadership and membership of this inclusive team of stakeholders.",4

Knight,Jorma Routti,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Finland, a Nordic country bordering Russia and Sweden with a territory the size of Germany but a population of only 5 million, managed in the 1990s a high-profile breakthrough to the forefront of the international information society. The case of Finland is interesting for two reasons; first, Finland transformed itself in a short period from a resource-intensive economy into a knowledge economy very much driven by the information and communications sector. Second, this transformation coincided with major economic crisis in the early 1990s. Recovery from a deep recession and major structural transformation took place simultaneously. Finland’s early industrialization took off in the latter part of the nineteenth century. It was based on abundant forest resources and initially on imported and later newly developed Finnish technologies. In the second half of the twentieth century, Finland had one of the highest rates of investment in Europe and from the Finnish forest and related metal industries successful global companies emerged as the economy rapidly moved into the top tier of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. In the 1990s, Finland went into deep economic recession caused by an overheated economy, newly unregulated financial markets leading to a domestic banking crisis similar to the global crisis that began in 2008, and loss of attractive barter trade with the collapse of the Soviet Union. Many traditional Finnish industries with less competitive technologies and cost structures and limited market access suffered. Unemployment and government debt reached alarming levels. Finland’s response to these difficulties was to craft new policies, strategies, and action plans. They were largely centered on increasing investments in research and development (R&D), enhancing open competition, and emphasis on information and communication technologies (ICT). Today, Finland is not only one of the most open economies in the world, but also one of the leading ICT- and knowledge-based economies, ranking high in a number of international comparative studies (Table 1).
 Research and development investment as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the highest in the world—about 3.5%. Finland’s innovation system generates a supply of new knowledge that yields clear economic and social benefits. This innovation system is considered one of the best in the world. Higher education enrollment is well above the OECD average; the number of researchers in relation to population is higher than in any other country. During the 1990s, the economy oriented strongly towards ICT, and by the end of the decade Finland had become the most ICT-specialized economy in the world. This remarkable ICT and e-development is exemplified by the rapid growth of Nokia and a powerful telecommunications cluster that has grown up around it. But it also based on long-term investments in knowledge and competence, complementary public sector activities, and citizens’ active interest in ICT. Such developments do not come easily, especially in the midst of a recession. Finland’s path to success has been tough. The country got into deep trouble and had to undertake difficult fiscal and other policy changes to join the European Union and become internationally competitive. But national institutions for the formation of national consensus, including special programs in economic policy management and national strategy issues for national leaders conducted over decades, helped enormously in conceiving and executing these changes. Finland’s accomplishments have been the subject of intensive studies. International organizations, such as the World Bank and the World Economic Forum, have sought to analyze the country’s accomplishments and institutions, to see what is behind its high standings in competitive ranking of regions and countries. Four times in the early 2000s, Finland was ranked number one by World Economic Forum competitiveness index. Such rankings show fairly high degree of volatility and thus the possibility of rapid advances or decline are common as well as the emergence of winners and losers. This makes it important to study the factors of success and failure E-development, innovation systems, and consensus formation are discussed in this chapter in the wider context of structural changes in Finland’s economy. The analysis and results presented here draw on studies conducted in Finland, including three consecutive national information society strategies formulated beginning in 1995 [12, 15, 22], and the World Bank book Finland as a Knowledge Economy—Elements of Success and Lessons Learned, [7]. The possibility of rapid improvement in international competitiveness exemplified by Finland is encouraging and the lessons learned can be useful to other countries, including the transition economies and developing countries. While Finland’s institutions and policies cannot be transplanted directly to other countries, we believe many of Finland’s experiences may serve as useful models that can be adapted to conditions elsewhere.",3

Mobile telecommunications networks have spread across the country; sophisticated information and communication technology (ICT) applications have been adopted by businesses and government; and the Internet provides a foundation for information flows and transactions in banking and financial services, universities and other scientific performing agencies, as well as in shopping and entertainment services. However, this e-development excludes large numbers of the population and large parts of the country, where there is limited or no access to advanced communications or e-services at the household or firm level. Thus the digital divide of the early twenty-first century parallels the racial and class divide of the previous three centuries. The majority of the African black population still live in low-income households with limited access to global communications infrastructure and services; while the minority population (defined as Whites, Coloureds and Indians) has differentiated, but nevertheless disproportionate access in relation to the country's demographic profile [47]. There is also a geographic divide with respect to e-development, with little advance in ICT-enabled development outside the six metropolitan municipalities. Progress on e-governance is patchy at best, with very few public services available online or through other ICT channels. E-business has evolved in large-scale enterprises, in particular, in service industries such as banking and finance, tourism, hospitality and entertainment. While small, medium and micro-enterprises (SMMEs) have a strong profile of mobile voice access, this does not translate into e-enabled businesses using a combination of mobile voice, Internet and small-scale ICT applications. E-society is evolving slowly, partly due to the high investment required per household with respect to computer ownership and broadband Internet usage. This article reviews South Africa's e-development from the perspectives of leadership, infrastructure, ICT industry development, human resource capacity and the contribution of these elements to the formation of e-government, e-business and e-society [19].",4

Herstad,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Industrial strategy and organization is interwoven with national level institutional incentives and constraints. These institutions, the patterns that shape behavior in the collective action game of capitalism, are subjected to continuous and shifting forces of change. This paper proposes that different institutional configurations reveal their inherent strength and weaknesses during different phases of large-scale technological change, during which certain forms of industrial organization flourish at the apparent expense of others. From this follows that institutional systems cannot be discussed independently of such paradigm phases, and the related modes of organization which appear conducive to growth within them. This line of reasoning is explored theoretically by drawing on contributions spanning from economic history through business system and varieties of capitalism approaches, and well into evolutionary and financial economics. As the US institutional system has been paramount both to the establishment of the present technological paradigm and triggered the ongoing economic crisis, particular emphasis is put on exploring how its inner dynamics worked in tandem with the evolving paradigm to bring us both these distinct outcomes. As an extension of this, it questions the future viability of the US economy and the relevance of its institutional system as a model for other economies.",1

Carayannis,Stephen C. Clark,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Technology has played a role in human affairs including business for millennia—starting with the lighting of the first fire, the carving of ideograms on the walls of caves and inventing the first round artifact that would eventually serve as a wheel. In that regard, “smartphones” are the latest developments in a long line of predecessors some illustrious and some infamous, however, there is a qualitative as well as quantitative difference in where, how and why “smartphones” make a difference in people’s professional and personal lives. These differences are manifested in the way people lead their lives and interact with each other personally and/or professionally. “Smartphones” have truly served to abolish distance (this concept was articulated nicely by Frances Cairncross [5]. We have tried in this research to empirically document the ways and means that “smartphones” impact people’s productivity and efficacy at work by conducting a series of semi-structured interviews with top level executives from businesses across a wide swath of business sectors. Our findings further corroborate the presence, role and impact of what we call “happy accidents” [9] in terms of knowledge serendipity and knowledge arbitrage (ibid) as factors shaping and even driving choices made by business leaders and managers with strategic intent and implications. We also find that “smartphones” can incur opportunity costs in terms of the effectiveness and efficiency of conducting business by causing distraction and disruption of the otherwise regular and natural flows of daily business and personal lives. In that regard, and unless carefully managed and controlled, “smartphone” technology can literally “hijack” people’s minds and even psyches and convert them into Marcuse’s “One-dimensional man” (1964) or even worse, fully ICT-enabled automata: “The best ambassadors for business are the outsized figures who have changed the world and who feel no need to apologize for themselves or their calling. There is no long-term comparative advantage in being forgettable.” (Economist, Schumpeter, November 15, 2009). On the more optimistic side, “smartphone” technology may simply help liberate and unleash the creative genius of individuals and teams by enabling a virtual “omni-presence” and collaborative innovation commons. Current academic and business literature stresses the importance of creating a business network within a social framework while leveraging learning opportunities. By creating this framework, global economic development will flourish when strong knowledge foundations exist that allow societies to be innovative and create ongoing technological partnerships [9]. Historically, business networking was introduced through the use of the radio. According to Nuttall [35], 100 years of technological revolution has transformed our ability to communicate through a wireless device known as the radio. When the radio was first introduced, its foundation was built upon amplitude modulation, today the radio has transformed into multiple channels and opportunities for communication. It has become a means to not only seek information but it also affords the ability to deliver information to others. As cited in Nuttall ([35]:7), according to Albert Einstein “The radio was a wonderful tool of communication that had a unique function to fulfill in terms of international reconciliation.” Nuttall also stated if Einstein were living today he would describe the Internet in the same context as he described the radio in 1930. Therefore, the evolution of this communication process has provided unlimited access to the Internet. Due to the Internet’s global reach, business leaders have the ability to obtain past and current information from any geography within seconds. The Internet contains a vast array of informational resources and services for any person worldwide who has the ability to turn on a computer and connect via, cell phone, phone card (wireless), dial up (telephone), cable service, or through a company network. The ability to quickly obtain and process this information may affect one’s decision making, innovation, and productivity from one participant to another. Information is gained from knowledge; therefore, knowledge is the impetuous for communication. Executives who share knowledge are contributing to the creation of informal and formal learning. Having the ability to quickly obtain information in different ways, executives are able to broaden their base of knowledge ultimately becoming strategic business leaders. As Hemp [24] stated, in a growing economy that is driven by knowledge, communication, innovation, and information becomes our most valuable asset. Related to this valuable asset, Carayannis [9] has stressed the value of concepts to disassemble or dismantle old ideas developing a space for creating and establishing new conceptual frameworks. Earl and Scott [15] agree with Carayannis and state that “focusing on knowledge is a necessity to become a competitive force in any industry.” Building upon the concepts of dismantling old ideas while acquiring or creating knowledge [34] requires the knowledge seeker to tap into a person’s or group’s inner tactic, which includes one’s collections of previous experiences, emotions, insights, intuition, or internalized information. Acquiring knowledge through one’s tactic is substantiated by Kim and Mauborgne [27] acknowledging that knowledge creation and sharing are powerful intangible and intellectual assets; trapped within the human mind. In order for knowledge exchange to occur, trust and commitment must be established. This will encourage each participant to share these internalized resources. The process of learning, within the dismantling of old ideas and diffusing knowledge results in the field of technology. This is the impetus for creative destruction. According to Hakansson and Ford [22] learning becomes the foundation for the development of connected relationships within any network structure. This is dependent upon the history of the past relationships and the value added from the prospective relationships; emphasizing the current state of the relationships between the firms and other related parties. Consequentially, the transition from communication, knowledge, relationships, and learning via the radio has transitioned from the Internet to human networks via the smartphone. Although it has not been acknowledged, the radio as a communication and learning device might have been designated as a tool for social networking. Executives, who strategically build and manage networks through the use of technology, are able to quickly obtain valuable information. This information can be used to increase management skills, leadership qualities, economic business efficiencies, and ultimately company profits. Hemp [24] acknowledged that the smartphone is an efficient way to seek information. This information is quickly obtained through text messages, Facebook friend alerts, visual or phone voice mail, instant messages, Twitter tweets, e-mail, online industry reports and industry data, blogs written by colleagues, wikis, corporate intranet, discussion forums on topics they are following, and continuous updates from other participants who are part of their various networks. Some co-researchers have observed that learners from various backgrounds are using smartphone technology as a facilitating tool in both formal and informal learning environments [12].",11

Lam,Elias G. Carayannis,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The world of cyber terrorism is constantly evolving at a scary rate, with new threats being cranked out each and every day. Every second that passes by, someone’s life gets ruined because cyber criminals are stealing people’s identity by using sneaky techniques to retrieve personally identifiable information. Hackers are also stealing billions of dollars each and every day from corporations all over the world. With new hacker techniques and attacks coming out each and every day, the latest methods of technical information security controls become obsolete all the time. That means anyone’s personal safety can be easily compromised at any given moment, since in this day of age, everyone’s personally identifiable information can easily be found in datacenters throughout the world. With internet security being extremely important in this time of war, there is a huge emphasis within the federal government to have strong cyber security controls. Unfortunately, federal government agency guides do not emphasize ongoing, constant risk management. In fact, the standard that the government uses has only been revised three times since 2002. The standard preaches the traditional method of setting up anti-virus programs and firewalls alone, which does not improve the security posture of any organization. As a result, the standard leads organizations to a path of insecurity. This should be a concern to all citizens, because the lack of cyber security in society means that anyone can be attacked. In order to remediate this issue, the security standards that the agencies use must incorporate the best practices used today, such as higher order learning [2] and knowledge management. During the technology boom in the 1990s, the US federal government did not have very many regulations in regarding to purchasing and obtaining information systems. Also, IT security was not a major concern to the government back then, because people who wanted to become hackers required a lot of skill and technical knowledge, thus hacking attacks were minimal compared to now. Without many regulations from the White House in regards to the procurement of expensive information systems during the 1990s, federal agencies ended up purchasing many expensive technologies that ended up becoming obsolete very quickly. The Clinton administration, seeing how federal agencies have wasted so many tax dollars on obsolete technologies, decided that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) should be in charge of establishing federal information technology directives since they are the ones who are in control of distributing funds. As a result, the Clinger–Cohen Act of 1996 was introduced that formalized OMB’s new responsibilities. The Clinger–Cohen Act was formerly known as the “Information Technology Management Reform Act”. As part of ensuring that the information systems that federal agencies procured were reliable and stable, OMB also inherited the responsibility of making sure that these information systems were safe from information technology attacks. The rapid rise of globalization and emerging information technologies in the past two decades has created many issues for securing critical information systems. Before the internet became popular in the 1990s, the only people who could damage critical information systems were those who were very skilled in the field of information technology. Nowadays, young teenagers are able to deliver denial of service attacks with a click of a button by using simple applications. Marty Linder, a senior member of the technical staff at Carnegie Mellon University’s Computer Emergency Response Team, says that, “cyber threats have become more serious as adversaries learn the value of stolen personal information”. He also mentioned that “whether the actual frequency of attacks is increasing or agencies are simply becoming better at detecting them is harder to know for certain” (FCW, 2009). Federal Computer Week also reported that “a new report from the Homeland Security Department’s US Computer Emergency Readiness Team adds even more fuel to the fire. The report listed 18,050 cyber security incidents in agencies in fiscal 2008, compared to 5,144 in fiscal 2006”. As a result, “President Barack Obama has ordered a review of the government’s cyber security plans, programs and activities. It shows that cyber security remains an important concern for the government” (FCW, 2009). The introduction of wireless computing has also posed new threats to end users, such as via Internet Protocol spoofing, man-in-the-middle, and denial of service attacks. Also, the information systems boundary between countries such as the USA and China has diminished since both are connected to one another via the internet. A recent event highlights why this is an issue. Hackers from China hacked into Google’s information systems. This happened because of the rise of both the internet and globalization.",

NATO maybe engaged still, in reviews of its institutional, ethical, and operational strategic foundations; however, it needs to take into consideration the practical development and application of a new Strategic Concept that will be financially feasible, given the NATO’s members budgetary national cuts [1]. It is the argument of this article that a new financially futuristic viable Alliance should make amongst others a greater use of technology tools, rather than human resources in its operational fields or elsewhere requested. The costs will diminish, and as such NATO will project also a financial stability and development. It will have a positive impact factor on the financial needs of the new operations and new challenges and will utterly bring closer, civil to military relations. This following article is part of primary research on NATO new security issues raised. This research also examines the new security challenges raised, upon the time of application of the Alliance’s new Strategic Concept, post Lisbon Summit. It should be noted that this research has been conducted mostly with primary resources and much of it reflects discussions with leading professionals, held, officially and unofficially with regards to the finances that are used or should be used by NATO. First feedback was given in an open lecture at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington DC, where as a Policy Scholar for South-East Europe, the following arguments were presented for open discussion by officials and professionals that attended the lecture. The global economic crisis already affects the defense expenditures of member states but also the Alliance, as an organization. The latest casualty is the UK; its Ministry of Defence has finally decided to withdraw from manufacturing the Harrier’s Fighter planes. General estimation in this paper is that NATO should re-examine its financial posture and expenditure now, rather than later. The Alliance needs to positively react to the international market with new methods of and for development, at a time of much needed initiatives for overall development of its organization. Simply put it, if NATO is to deal with global issues, while retaining its peripheral role, NATO should become a truly dominant security and joint foreign political–military organization, financially as well. To be internationally and financially secure in its future as a dominant power and to be viable as an organization, NATO has to construct a robust and futuristic-minded financial viable organization; as such agreed by member states, to conduct financial operations in a globalized world. The NATO report of the 12-member committee [2] that was presented on May 17, 2010 explicitly refers to an array of more diffused challenges, without however specifying which. They range, but can be narrowed down to the following: international piracy, terrorism, proliferation of WMDs, energy security and cyber attacks, demographic concerns, and natural disasters, amongst others. NATO’s credibility and value were considered to be at stake as was implied by the report. How would NATO win the support of the wider public sector and how will that be shown at this upcoming Strategic Concept were the aspects that were put in question. NATO renewed its “vows” at the Lisbon Summit of 2010. However, NATO is still struggling in preventing possible rises of new internal and external challenges that will undermine the essence of the North-Atlantic Alliance and as such its financial civilian/military “entrepreneurialship.” The official agreement of the President of the Russian Federation to attend the Lisbon SummitFootnote 1 seems to satisfy on the other hand NATO’s immediate concerns and therefore, will politically still portray NATO as an organization of high level civilian meetings, where military issues are well operationally discussed and agreed. The Russian factor or otherwise stated the high level meeting, the NATO-Russia Council [3], therefore becomes, at a time of much needed “financial burden sharing,” a balancing tool for NATO. Foreword to this, high level meetings and decisions require also a financial agreement on joint alliance or partner expenses. As such and coming back to the initial question, how can NATO therefore counter the current international financial crisis in its own abilities, as for its financial concerns to not become, yet another burden for the Alliance? What should future measures be, considering the current and new challenges raised for the twenty-first century?",

 Diplomacy is the art and practice of conducting negotiations between representatives of groups or states. It usually refers to international diplomacy, the conduct of international relations through the intercession of professional diplomats with regard to issues of peace-making, trade, war, economics, culture, environment and human rights. International treaties are usually negotiated by diplomats prior to endorsement by national politicians. In an informal or social sense, diplomacy is the employment of tact to gain strategic advantage or to find mutually acceptable solutions to a common challenge, one set of tools being the phrasing of statements in a non-confrontational, or polite manner.

 What is “Science Diplomacy”? Science Diplomacy (SD) is the exchange of Science and Technology across borders. A valuable resource and little understood tool of awareness, understanding, and capacity building, its power is not widely known or considered often enough. 
http://mountainrunner.us/2007/04/science_diplomacy.html
 Cultural diplomacy specifies a form of diplomacy that carries a set of prescriptions which are material to its effectual practice; these prescriptions include the unequivocal recognition and understanding of foreign cultural dynamics and observance of the tenets that govern basic dialogue. Milton C. Cummings Jr. draws out the meaning of these cultural dynamics in his description of cultural diplomacy as “… the exchange of ideas, information, art, lifestyles, values systems, traditions, beliefs and other aspects of cultures....” 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_diplomacy
 Berridge and James (2003) state that “economic diplomacy is concerned with economic policy questions, including the work of delegations to conferences sponsored by bodies such as the WTO” and include “diplomacy which employs economic resources, either as rewards or sanctions, in pursuit of a particular foreign policy objective” also as a part of the definition. Rana (2007) defines economic diplomacy as “the process through which countries tackle the outside world, to maximize their national gain in all the fields of activity including trade, investment and other forms of economically beneficial exchanges, where they enjoy comparative advantage; it has bilateral, regional and multilateral dimensions, each of which is important”.

 Science, despite its international characteristics, is no substitute for effective diplomacy. Any more than diplomatic initiatives necessarily lead to good science. These seem to have been the broad conclusions to emerge from a three-day meeting at Wilton Park in Sussex, UK, organized by the British Foreign Office and the Royal Society, and attended by scientists, government officials and politicians from 17 countries around the world. The definition of science diplomacy varied widely among participants. Some saw it as a subcategory of “public diplomacy”, or what US diplomats have recently been promoting as “soft power” (“the carrot rather than the stick approach”, as a participant described it). Others preferred to see it as a core element of the broader concept of “innovation diplomacy”, covering the politics of engagement in the familiar fields of international scientific exchange and technology transfer, but raising these to a higher level as a diplomatic objective.

 “Science and innovation together have a role that can be used to promote global equality and sustainable development,” Seabra da Cruz said. He pointed out how Brazil’s surging capacity in science and technology (ibid) has provided a new channel for establishing relations with other countries, particularly emerging economies such as China and India, and those in other parts of the developing world: “The big challenge to us and other emerging economies is to find ways of using scientific knowledge to enhance our competitiveness and create a new international division of labour. Without linking scientific knowledge to innovation policy, it is impossible to have sustainable development.” As an example of innovation diplomacy in action, he pointed to how technical knowledge can be exchanged between countries about the best ways of using cheap, sustainable sources of energy—as Brazil is doing with its experience in biofuels—helping to improve relations between the providers of such knowledge and those that receive it. “This is an example of where we can exchange information about best social and innovation practices—which are all likely to involve science to a greater or lesser degree—and also provide an immediate and relatively easy way of making innovation work for diplomacy.” He admitted that, as with science diplomacy, innovation diplomacy presents a number of challenges. Diplomats need to be well informed on innovation-related issues, embassies need to develop “observatories ” that monitor the innovation landscape of the countries in which they are based, and ways need to be found to engage a country’s scientific and technological diaspora. (Excerpted from Carayannis, Keynote Lecture, BILAT, Vienna, Austria, March 2011) More specifically, Innovation Diplomacy leverages Entrepreneurship and Innovation as key drivers, catalysts, and accelerators of economic development and envisions in particular the development of efforts and initiatives along the following axes concerning in particular the socio-economic condition and dynamics in Greece currently (excerpted from Carayannis, Keynote Lecture, BILAT, Vienna, Austria, March 2011): 
Re-engineer mindsets, attitudes, and behaviors in Hellas to help people—and especially the younger ones—realize the true nature and potential of innovation and entrepreneurship as a way of life and the most powerful lever for and pathway to sustainable growth and prosperity with positive spill-over effects staunching the brain drain, reduced cynicism and increased optimism and trust in the future and each other, reduced criminality and social unrest, higher assimilation of migrant groups, etc. 
Engage in sustained, succinct, and effective dialogue with stakeholders and policy makers within Hellas as well as the European Union to pursue the reform and as needed re-invention of institutions, policies, and practices that can make entrepreneurship and innovation flourish in areas such as related laws, rules and regulations, higher education, public and private Research and Development, civil society movements and non-Governmental organizations, etc. 
Identify, network, and engage purposefully and effectively with the Hellenic Diaspora professional and social networks around the world to trigger, catalyze, and accelerate their involvement and intervention in a focused and structured manner to help with goals 1 and 2 above as well as help establish, fund, and manage entrepeneurship and innovation promoting and supporting initiatives and institutions such as business plan competitions, angel and other risk capital financing of new Hellenic ventures, mentoring of and partnering with said ventures to ensure their survival, growth, and success both within Hellas and in the global markets. Of particular interest and importance would be communities of practice and interest among the Hellenic Diaspora that would include the shipowners, large trading concerns, and technology entrepreneurs in countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia, as well as the European Union and the rest of the world. (Excerpted from Carayannis, Keynote Lecture, BILAT, Vienna, Austria, March 2011) But, if all this can be achieved, “like science diplomacy, innovation diplomacy is a way of broadening the scope and functions of traditional diplomacy”.

Technology is defined as that “which allows one to engage in a certain activity …with consistent quality of output.”, the “art of science and the science of art” or “the science of crafts”. Diwan adds that technological foundations are market size, standards, innovation, high motivation, and supply of capital. The impact of innovation may be directed to multiple sectors. For example, Jonash lists product/service, process, and business innovation as the key impact areas. Product/service is the development and commercialization of hard goods; process is new ways of producing and delivering cost–time–quality advantages, and business innovation is new models of conducting business for competitive advantage. 
Technology is a Greek word derived from the synthesis of two words: “techne” (meaning art) and “logos” (meaning logic or science). So loosely interpreted, technology means the art of logic or the art of scientific discipline. Formally, it is defined as “a design for instrumental action that reduces the uncertainty in the cause–effect relationships involved in achieving a desired outcome. A technology usually has two components: (1) a hardware aspect, consisting of the tool that embodies the technology as a material or physical object and (2) a software aspect, consisting of the information base for the tool”. Although technology is often embodied in a product, technology in general should instead be conceived of as a process, as dynamic rather than static, and as social rather than disembodied. It is a combination of both creative and structured tangible artifacts, codified knowledge, and tacit know-how embedded in individual, group, and organizational routines. Thus, technology is systematic knowledge, which from an information theoretic and meta-cognitive/linguistic perspective emphasizes the role of knowledge stocks and flows in linking technology management and technology strategy with business strategy. 
Technology management is the set of policies and practices that leverage technologies to build, maintain, and enhance the competitive advantage of the firm on the basis of proprietary knowledge and know-how. The US National Research Council in 1987 defined Management of Technology as linking “engineering, science, and management disciplines to plan, develop, and implement technological capabilities to shape and accomplish the strategic and operational objectives of an organization”. While technology management techniques are themselves important to firm competitiveness, they are most effective when they complement the overall strategic posture adopted by the firm. The strategic management of technology tries to “build advantage on the basis of technology”, or “bring the potential opportunities that technology creates to bear on the formulation of corporate strategy”. Before a definition of innovation can be discussed, the related term “invention” must be understood. Florida considers invention as a breakthrough and innovation as an actualization. Hindle further clarifies invention by labeling it as the creative origin of new process and the enabler of innovation, which has impacts on social, economic, and financial processes. Thus, the emerging definition of invention may be stated as the creative process of progress while innovation is defined by the impact on societies and markets (actualization). “Innovation generally lowers the cost of responding to a change in the commercial environment.” Thus, innovation has the connotation of market influence. “Management is, all things considered, the most creative of all arts. It is the art of arts, because it is the organizer of talent.” Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber Starting at the individual level, creativity may be defined as the capacity to “think out of the box”, to think laterally, to perceive, conceive, and construct ideas, models, and constructs that exceed or supersede established items and ways of thinking and perceiving. Creativity is related to the capacity to imagine, since it requires the creator to perceive future potentials that are not obvious based on current conditions. From a cognitive perspective, creativity is the ability to perceive new connections among objects and concepts—in effect, reordering reality by using a novel framework for organizing perceptions. Creative types such as artists, scientists, and entrepreneurs often exhibit attributes of obsessed maniacs and clairvoyant oracles (George Washington University Lectures on Entrepreneurship) as well as the capacity and even propensity for creative destruction that is how Joseph Schumpeter qualified innovation. Albert Scentzgeorgi, a Nobel Prize laureate, defined creativity as “seeing what everyone sees and thinking what no one has thought before”. “Imagination is more important than knowledge. To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science.” Albert Einstein The problem with “creativity” is that it is an intangible. While we generally know when something is creative, we often don’t know why. It seems difficult to articulate a precise definition of the topic. Aristotle, for example, suggested that inspiration involved a form of madness whereby great insights began as a result of a person’s own thoughts progressing through a series of associations. This view of the creative individual as mad, or potentially so, continued through the nineteenth century. Freud believed creative ability was a personality trait that tends to become fixed by experiences in the first 5 years of life. He maintained that creative expression was a means of expressing inner conflicts that otherwise would result in neuroses. Creativity was a sort of emotional purgative that kept men sane (Kneller, 1965, p. 21). During the first half of the twentieth century, B. F. Skinner and other behaviorists considered creative production to be strictly the result of “random mutation” and a product of appropriate reinforcers provided by society. Kneller (1965, p. 3) suggested that definitions of creativity seem to fall into four categories. Creativity is considered from the standpoint of the person who creates, in terms of mental processes, in terms of its products, or focuses on environmental and cultural influences. He states that “an act or an idea is creative not only because it is novel, but also because it achieves something that is appropriate to a given situation” (1965, p. 6). We create when we discover and express something that is new to us. The operative phrase is “new to us;” even if another person has discovered something, it is still creativity if we have re-discovered it for ourselves. Amabile (1996, p. 33) appears to provide the most complete definition available to date. She suggests a two-part definition of creativity: (1) that a product or response is creative to the extent that appropriate observers independently agree it is creative. Appropriate observers are those familiar with the domain in which the product or the response articulated (p. 33), and (2) that a product or response will be judged as creative to the extent that it is both a novel and appropriate task at hand, and the task is heuristic rather than algorithmic. She defines algorithmic tasks as those for which the path to the solution is clear and straightforward; heuristic tasks are those for which algorithms must be developed. She calls these tasks “problem discovery” (p. 35). Amabile (1996, p. 90) also lists personality traits that appear repeatedly in summaries of empirical work on the characteristics of creative persons: High degree of self-discipline in matters concerning work Ability to delay gratification Perseverance in the face of frustration Independence of judgment A tolerance for ambiguity A high degree of autonomy An absence of sex role stereotyping An internal locus of control A willingness to take risks A high level of self-initiated, task-oriented striving for excellence Of their nine principal traits, it may be helpful to further define three: stimulus freedom, functional freedom, and flexibility. Stimulus freedom occurs when people are likely to bend the rules to meet their needs, if the stated rules of a situation interfere with their creative ideas. Functional freedom is the ability to use items for other creative or unique uses. Dacey and Lennon contend that the more education a person has, the more rigid his or her perception of function is likely to become. Also, because education tends to encourage complexity of thought, this may produce a convoluted thinking style which works against producing simple ideas—the ones that comprise many of the world’s greatest solutions. Flexibility is the capacity to see the whole of a situation, rather than just a group of uncoordinated details. Gestalt psychologists believed that creative problem solving is similar in important ways to perception. They argued that it is primarily a reconstruction of gestalts, or patterns, that are structurally deficient. Creative thinking begins with a problematic situation that is incomplete in some way. The thinker grasps this problem as a whole. The dynamics of the problem itself and the forces and tensions within it, set up similar lines of stress within his/her mind. By following these lines of stress, the thinker arrives at a solution that restores harmony of the whole (Kneller, 1965, p. 27). Re-structuring and productive thinking often do not occur because problem solvers tend to become fixated on attempting to apply past experience to the problem and thus do not deal with the problem on its own terms. “Culture is the invisible force behind the tangibles and observables in any organization, a social energy that moves people to act. Culture is to the organization what personality is to the individual—a hidden, yet unifying theme that provides meaning, direction, and mobilization.” Killman R., Gaining Control of the Corporate Culture, 1985 In the business context, creativity now is championed by certain authors as the critical element enabling change in organizations. Kao (1996, xvii) defines creativity as: The entire process by which ideas are generated, developed and transformed into value. It encompasses what people commonly mean by innovation and entrepreneurship. In our lexicon, it connotes both the art of giving birth to new ideas and the discipline of shaping and developing those ideas to the stage of realized value. Kao views creativity as the “result of interplay among the person, the task, and the organizational context”. Drazin and van de Ven (1985) agree with this assertion. They conclude that creativity is both an individual and group-level process. Complex, creative projects found within large organizations require the engagement of many individuals, rather than just a few. It is often difficult to assign credit to any one individual in a creative effort (Sutton and Hargadon, cited in Drazin and van de Ven 1985). Creativity, they believe, is an iterative process whereby individuals develop ideas, interact with the group, work out issues in solitude, and then return to the group to further modify and enhance their ideas. Their sense making perspective of creativity illustrates the notion that individuals are influenced in their creative efforts by such factors as conflict, political influence, and negotiated order at the group level. “When I am, as it were, completely myself, entirely alone, and of good cheer… it is on such occasions that my ideas flow best and most abundantly. Whence and how they come, I know not; nor can I force them. Those ideas that please me I retain in memory.” W.A. Mozart, quoted in Brewster Ghiselin, 1952, p.34 Woodman and Schoenfeldt (1990, p. 18) stress the importance of social environment. They state: “it is clear that individual differences in creativity are a function of the extent to which the social and contextual factors nurture the creative process. Research on creativity has led to a recognition of the fact that the kind of environment most likely to produce a well-adjusted person is not the same as the kind of environment most likely to produce a creative person.” Because of the dearth of research in this area, we will briefly examine the factor through an ever-widening circle of social influences—from family to culture. Amabile (1996, p. 179) reports that there appear to be three social factors that are important for creative behavior: Social facilitation (or social inhibition), brought about by the presence of others: She reports that the presence of others can impair performance on poorly learned or complex tasks, but enhance performance on well-learned or simple tasks (p. 181). In addition, there is much evidence that subjects perform more poorly on idea-production tests when they work together than when they work alone. Modeling, or the imitation of observed behavior: Research suggests that a large number of creative models in one generation will stimulate general creative production in the next generation (Simonton, cited on p. 189). At the individual level, the pattern of influence seems to be complex. At the highest levels of creative eminence, modeling may be relatively unimportant. In addition, although exposure to creative models may stimulate early high-level productivity, it may be important at some point to go beyond the examples set by one’s mentors. Motivational orientation, or an individual’s intrinsic or extrinsic approach to work: Studies suggest that intrinsic orientation leads to a preference for challenging and enjoyable tasks, whereas an extrinsic orientation leads to a preference for simple, predictable tasks (p. 192). There is some evidence that cultures may promote or inhibit creativity. Arieti (1976, p. 303) explored cultural influences on creativity and suggests that the potentiality for creativity is deemed much more frequent than its occurrence. Some cultures promote creativity more than others, and he labeled these cultures as “creativogenic.” He held that people become creative (or to use his term, “genius”) because of the juxtaposition of three factors: The culture is right. He uses the example that the airplane would not have been invented if gasoline had not been invented. The genes are right. The person’s intelligence, which is known to be genetic, must be high. Creativity, which may or may not be genetic, must also be high. The interactions are right. He offers the example of Freud, Jung, and Adler. If Jung and Adler had not had Freud to compete over, and against, it is questionable whether either Jung or Adler would hold such a high position in psychology today. Hofstede (1980, p. 43), in a study of the culture of 40 independent nations, found four criteria by which their cultures differed: power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism–collectivism, and masculinity–feminity. These dimensions appear to have a powerful influence on the “collective mental programming of the people in an environment.” They are also grounded in our collective cultural history. Americans, for example, tend to exhibit high individualism, small power distance, and weak uncertainty avoidance. That they show these tendencies reflects American history which has placed high value on equality, independence, and willingness to take risks. This cultural influence is qualitatively different than the social influences mentioned in previous creativity models. For want of a better term, we call it “cultural embeddedness,” because it implies more than a society’s norms, values, and mores. It is what defines our reality. In light of this additional component, we are proposing a new model of creativity which not only illustrates the components of creativity but the creative process as well. In this model, personality and cognitive factors interact with the individual and vice versa. The social environment interacts with the three factors and vice versa; the individual initiates and participates in the creative process. Cultural embeddedness influences not only all of the creative factors but all steps of the creative process. Discovery consists of looking at the same thing as everyone else and thinking something different. Albert Szent-Gyorgyi, Nobel Prize Winner 
Innovation is a word derived from the Latin, meaning to introduce something new to the existing realm and order of things or to change the yield of resources as stated by J.B. Say quoted in Drucker. In addition, innovation is often linked with creating a sustainable market around the introduction of new and superior product or process. Specifically, in the literature on the management of technology, technological innovation is characterized as the introduction of a new technology-based product into the market: “Technological innovation is defined here as a situationally new development through which people extend their control over the environment. Essentially, technology is a tool of some kind that allows an individual to do something new. A technological innovation is basically information organized in a new way. So technology transfer amounts to the communication of information, usually from one organization to another.” The broader interpretation of the term ‘innovation’ refers to an innovation as an ‘idea, practice or material artifact’ adopted by a person or organization, where that artifact is ‘perceived to be new by the relevant unit of adoption’. Therefore, innovation tends to change perceptions and relationships at the organizational level, but its impact is not limited there. Innovation in its broader socio-technical, economic, and political context can also substantially impact, shape, and evolve ways and means people live their lives, businesses form, compete, succeed, and fail, and nations prosper or decline (see Fig. 1). Specifically, Fig. 1 attempts to illustrate the nature and dynamics of an emerging globalization framework in which creativity and innovation—as enabler of technological effort in manufacturing and as an engine of industrial development—can lead to improved competitiveness and sustained development. On the other hand, lack of creativity and innovation constitutes a factor for failure in manufacturing performance and, as a result, is a factor for failure in economic performance, too. For those countries in which creativity and innovation is applied effectively, globalization can be an engine of beneficial and sustainable economic integration. However, globalization can be a powerful force for deprivation, inequality, marginalization, and economical disruption in those non-competitive countries. Government or market success or failure is determined by how they take advantage of the four major elements that shape the setting for creativity, innovation, and competitiveness in the globalized world: (1) The coordination and synergy in the relationship between governments, enterprises, research laboratories, and other specialized bodies, universities, and support agencies for small and medium enterprises (SMEs); (2) The power of information and communication technology; (3) The efficiency that managerial and organizational systems can bring to production and commerce; and (4) The international agreements, rules, and regulations. All the four elements of this framework will impact on creativity and innovation at the micro level (firm level) as well as on innovation and competitiveness at the macro level (industry, national, global). From a business perspective, an innovation is perceived as the happy ending of the commercialization journey of an invention, when that journey is indeed successful and leads to the creation of a sustainable and flourishing market niche or new market. Therefore, a technical discovery or invention (the creation of something new) is not significant to a company unless that new technology can be utilized to add value to the company, through increased revenues, reduced cost, and similar improvements in financial results. This has two important consequences for the analysis of any innovation in the context of a business organization. First, an innovation must be integrated into the operations and strategy of the organization, so that it has a distinct impact on how the organization creates value or on the type of value the organization provides in the market. Second, an innovation is a social process, since it is only through the intervention and management of people that an organization can realize the benefits of an innovation. The discussion of innovation clearly leads to the development of a model, to understand the evolving nature of innovation. Innovation management is concerned with the activities of the firm undertaken to yield solutions to problems of product, process, and administration. Innovation involves uncertainty and dis-equilibrium. Nelson and Winter (1982) propose that almost any change, even trivial, represents innovation. They also suggest, given the uncertainty, that innovation results in the generation of new technologies and changes in relative weighting of existing technologies (ibid). This results in the disruptive process of dis-equilibrium. As an innovation is adopted and diffused, existing technologies may become less useful (reduction in weight factors) or even useless (weighing equivalent to “0”) and abandoned altogether. The adoption phase is where uncertainty is introduced. New technologies are not adopted automatically but rather, markets influence the adoption rate. Innovative technologies must propose to solve a market need such as reduced costs or increased utility or increased productivity. The markets, however, are social constructs and subject to non-innovation-related criteria. For example, an invention may be promising, offering a substantial reduction on the cost of a product which normally would influence the market to accept the given innovation, but due to issues like information asymmetry (the lack of knowledge in the market concerning the invention’s properties), the invention may not be readily accepted by the markets. Thus, the innovation may remain an invention. If, however, the innovation is market-accepted, the results will bring about change to the existing technologies being replaced, leading to a change in the relative weighting of the existing technology. This is in effect dis-equilibrium.
 Given the uncertainty and change inherent in the innovation process, management must develop skills and understanding of the process as a method for managing the disruption. The problems of managing the resulting disruption are strategic in nature. The problems may be classified into three groups: engineering, entrepreneurial, and administrative. This grouping correlates to the related types of innovation namely, product, process, and administrative innovation: 
The engineering problem is one of selecting the appropriate technologies for proper operational performance.
 
The entrepreneurial problem refers to defining the product/service domain and target markets.
 
Administrative problems are concerned with reducing the uncertainty and risk during the previous phases.
 In much of the foregoing discussion, a recurring theme about innovation is that of uncertainty, leading to the conclusion that an effective model of innovation must include a multidimensional approach (uncertainty is defined as unknown unknowns whereas risk is defined as known knowns). One model posited as an aide to understanding is the multidimensional model of innovation. This model attempts to define the understanding of innovation by establishing three-dimensional boundaries. The planes are defined as product–process, incremental–radical, and administrative–technical. The product–process boundary concerns itself with the end product and its relationship to the methods employed by firms to produce and distribute the product. Incremental–radical defines the degree of relative strategic change that accompanies the diffusion of an innovation. This is a measure of the disturbance or dis-equilibrium in the market. Technological–administrative boundaries refer to the relationship of innovation change to the firm’s operational core. The use of technological refers to the influences on basic firm output while the administrative boundary would include innovations affecting associated factors of policy, resources, and social aspects of the firm. We develop our conceptual model of organizational innovation from a resource-based perspective of the firm. In particular, we draw upon the concept of knowledge as an intangible resource that flows throughout organizations to render new routines, technologies, or structures that affect future performance (Nelson and Winter 1982). In order to capture the multi-layered influence of organizational innovation, we conceive our framework for innovation routines as a procedural model. We focus on intangible resources that contribute inputs to the innovation process. We examine the firm's capabilities for engaging in innovating activities and finally consider the range of organizational outputs from innovation that span short-horizon outcomes to long-horizon lasting impacts. This composite of measures is housed within a “3P” framework for organizational innovation. Innovation emerges from three critical firm-level factors: Posture, Propensity, and Performance. “Posture” refers to an organization’s position within the greater innovation system of its environment (i.e., region, industry, technological domain). Specifically, Posture comprises a firm’s state along three dimensions: the organizational, technological, and market lifecycles, reflecting its readiness to both engage in and benefit from innovation. It thus identifies the conditions influencing a specific firm within a specific technology regime serving a specific market. Each firm’s ability to engage in innovative activities will be constrained by its Posture, which is exogenous to the innovation process being measured. That is, regardless of whether and what type of innovation process is employed, a firm exists at a point in its lifecycle from formation to failure (organizational lifecycle). The firm also selects technologies to employ in the implementation of its strategies and thus is subject to the state of the technology regime lifecycle within which these technologies exist (technological lifecycle). For example, a handful of stagecoach companies continued operation for a period of time after the introduction of the automobile and thus their place in the stagecoach technology regime could be measured. Finally, the firm exists on a competitive landscape within significant strategic activities in one or more markets. These markets exist at various points in their own lifecycle; therefore, they also constrain the innovative actions available to the firm. “Propensity” is a firm’s ability to capitalize on its posture based on cultural acceptance of innovation. In this way, propensity is an intangible reflection of processes, routines, and capabilities established within a firm. A firm may possess adequate resources and consequently higher externalized innovation stature, yet have an underdeveloped capacity for innovation due to cultural or other constraints. “Performance” is the lasting result of innovation. This part of the framework comprises three levels: output, outcome, and impact. Outputs occur as the immediate, internalized results of innovation. New product introductions, patents, and technology transfer licenses are among the outputs that emerge. Outcomes include mid-range results such as revenues contributed by new products. Finally, impacts represent more lasting, long-range benefits that accrue to the firm from its innovative competence and are transformed into results for the firm’s environment too. Examples of impact performance include status as a top innovator in the industry. All three factors—Posture, Propensity, and Performance—are captured empirically in the form of a combinatorial we define as the Composite Innovation Index. This comprehensive measure demonstrates the superior evaluative results of measuring innovation across all facets of its process in concert. Measurement of innovative performance at the firm level has been paid less attention than at a project level of analysis. Project-level studies provide more nuanced understanding of the mechanisms behind innovation and their impacts on the organization. Most of these studies exclude the controls managers possess to navigate uncertain and dynamic environments. The disparities of these studies have not lead to a generally accepted indicator of innovative performance or a common set of indicators at the organization level. Input indicators mainly measure resources that are put into the innovation process. These inputs include intellectual, human, and technological capital. Process indicators reflect the organizational and innovation process management systems. They also embody the design of a firm’s innovation system and its innovative. Performance indicators identify the results of organizational innovation. Output indicators represent the realized, shorter-term success of innovative activity. Indicators of this group count patent numbers and rates, patent quotes, number of new products, percentage of sales with innovations, and others. Outcome indicators represent the realized, longer-term success of innovative activity, e.g., medium- to long-term—firm profit margins or market share, firm growth rate, dominant designs or technological standards shaped by firm innovations, second- and later-stage innovations derived from an originating innovation, degree of disruptiveness. Impact measures the sustained advantage a firm enjoys as a result of innovation. Many studies use a single input or output indicator to determine the innovative performance of a firm. It has been shown, however, that there are measurement problems with innovation, especially with input indicators. Critical issues include (1) some input measurements that do not capture process efficiency, (2) single measurements that do not reflect economic or qualitative value, and (3) lack of indication of technological complexity in the inputs. Similarly, Santarelli and Piergiovanni (1996) have shown that output indicators that are based on patents might be problematic because technological level and the economic value of patents are highly heterogeneous, the nature of patent content varies widely across countries, not all innovations are patented, not all patents become innovations, and the propensity to patent varies greatly with firm size. Furthermore, output indicators show limitations due to industry-level antecedents when multiple industries or firm sizes are compared. Other studies have criticized the isolated measurement of innovative business functions or parts. Advancing that critique, we have identified three limitations of the existing literature. The emphasis is primarily put on (1) the manufacturing sector and (2) product innovations, while ignoring (3) process variables. As a result, existing innovation measures disregard some important indicators for innovative success and show limitations in considering different sizes, objectives, and activities of businesses. Competitiveness is the capacity of people, organizations, and nations to achieve superior outputs and especially outcomes, and in particular, to add value, while using the same or lower amounts of inputs. Moreover, entrepreneurial value-adding and entrepreneurial learning by doing, learning by analogy, and learning by failing, do not belong to the realm of for-profit entities only but also in the domain of not-for-profit entities. This is shown in Fig. 2 with the overlapping circles connecting creativity and innovation activities across for-profits and not-for-profits. The standard for judging whether these results are “superior” can encompass both prior capabilities of a particular organization or nation and a comparison with other organizations or nations. The critical assumption of competitiveness, then, is that it is accomplished through a process of organizational improvement, where the institutions in an economy leverage people, knowledge, and technologies to rearrange relationships and enable higher states of production. “But in capitalist reality, … it is not price competition which counts but the competition from the new commodity, the new technology, the source of supply, the new type of organization, … competition which… strikes not at the margins of the existing firms but at their foundations and their very lives.” Joseph A. Schumpeter, Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy, 1942 To review the history of innovation, one must look toward the classic works of Schumpeter. Schumpeter, an economist, wrote The Theory of Economic Development in 1934 as an inquiry into profit, capital, credit, interest, and the business cycles. His main contributions were (a) the expansion of Adam Smith’s economic principles of land–labor–capital into land–labor–capital–technology–entrepreneurship and (b) the introduction of the concept of dis-equilibrium into economic discourse. It is interesting to note that Schumpeter was a socialist and believed that the capitalist system would eventually collapse from within and be replaced by a socialist system. On this point, he agreed with Marx, but his version of socialism was in many respects very different. Marx felt very strongly that the economic model employed would determine the construct of society. The cornerstone of his theoretical structure was the “Theory of Value” (Das Kapital) where the value of a commodity, given perfect equilibrium and perfect competition, is proportional to the input of labor. Schumpeter disagreed with Marx on this issue offering the conclusion that both perfect equilibrium and perfect competition were problematic at best. Additional disagreements centered on the inclusion of the value of land in the equation. Another point on which Schumpeter disagreed is Marx’ contention that the capitalist system would implode (Zusammenbruchstheorie) as a result of its intrinsic inequities. In Schumpeter’s view, the natural evolution of capitalism would destroy the foundations of capitalism from within. In fact, he believed that the economic depression of the 1930s was an indication of a paradigm shift, reinforcing his beliefs. Schumpeter viewed capitalism in much the same way as he viewed the process of innovation. Both were generally considered stable processes (under perfect conditions) from a theoretical model perspective, but Schumpeter introduced the conceptual theory of dis-equilibrium as the key influential factor, and this could be further expanded into the concept of continuum of punctuated dis-equilibria to capture and articulate the concept of successive Fisher–Pry curves (S-curves) with discontinuous and/or disruptive innovations causing a change of curve and/or change of “the rules of the game” as we will see later: Michael Tushman and Charles O’Reilly suggest that discontinuous innovation involves breaking with the past to create new technologies, processes, and organizational “S-curves” that result in significant leaps in the value delivered to customers. Similarly, Clay Christensen, Gary Hamel and C.K. Prahalad, and James Utterback describe discontinuous innovation as involving “disruptive technologies,” “discontinuities,” or “radical innovations” that permit entire industries and markets to emerge, transform, or disappear (Kaplan, 1999). Early capitalism is often referred to as “laissez-faire” but post-World War II capitalism is much more bounded by social, political, and legal norms. In following Schumpeter’s principle of evolutionary capitalism, it may be that the bounded capitalism of the modern era is a logical extension of Schumpeter’s theory. The concept of innovation as a “socio-technical” system is well established. Rogers (1995), for example, defined innovation in terms of the perceptions of the individuals or groups which adopt an innovation. Attempts to classify innovations in purely technical terms fall into the trap of portraying the result of a social process as something entirely divorced from human influence. We propose an approach to classifying and subdividing the concepts of innovation along four fundamental dimensions: The process of innovation (the way in which the innovation is developed, diffused, and adopted) The content of innovation (the specific technical or social nature of the innovation itself) The context of innovation (the environment in which the innovation emerges and the effect of that environment on the innovation) The impact of innovation (the social and technological changes which result from the completion of the innovation process). Using these four dimensions of innovation, we can delve more deeply into the social implications of disruptive and discontinuous innovation, which in turn facilitates the integration of innovation management concepts with those of organizational learning and knowledge management. In putting these elements in perspective, one needs to bear in mind the following key creativity and innovation drivers and qualifiers: 
Context: In what context do all of the above occur? 
Process: What is the process by which the above are realized? 
Content: What is the content of the above in terms of reaction on the others? 
Impact: What is the impact of each of the above on the others? All of these attributes must be considered at all levels including the firm, industry, national, and global levels. What you invent determines the content of the innovation. Commercialization is a necessary but not sufficient condition for innovation. Creativity and competition may be exogenous factors to competitiveness. Competition facilitates or suppresses competitiveness (see Fig. 1). Consolidation may breed complacency. Disruptive technologies can renew competitiveness. However, excessive rivalry may sap competitiveness leading to the Acceleration Trap and the Differentiation Trap (Christensen 1997; see Fig. 1). These are situations of increasingly shorter and unsustainable product cycles and spiraling research and development (R&D) costs with shrinking profit margins and market shares—the result of excessive competition and declining competitiveness (what we term hyper-rivalry in the private sector). In these situations, change takes place so fast that firms often fail to benefit fully from it (their learning curves are not steep enough), and they also end up using resources inefficiently and undermining their market position by engaging in price wars or frivolous innovation races. Then, firms can find themselves “trapped” in a vicious spiral of increasing competition and declining competitiveness and end up rendering their market niches increasingly hard to sustain. “Comforted by idols, we can lose the urge to question and thus we can willingly arrest our growth as persons: “One must invoke tremendous counter-forces in order to cross this natural, all too natural progressus in simile, the continual development of man toward the similar, average, herdlike common!”” Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zaratustra, 58 Innovation may be generally categorized as product, process, or administrative. Others classify innovation by regional influences, or decision criteria (Rogers 1995). Still, others view innovation as product-process-radical-technological. Another view of classifying types characterizes innovation by decision systems (Rogers 1995). This method relies on the principle that adoption of innovation may be influenced by both individuals and entire social systems. There is also a distinction between sustaining and disruptive innovations (Christensen 1997) and continuous and discontinuous innovations: Discontinuities are often described as technological breakthroughs that help companies rewrite industry rules or create entirely new industries. Rarely have distinctions been made within the concept of “discontinuity,” not to mention how to identify these radical innovations. For the corporate strategist, a big question remains: how to actually structure opportunity identification so it becomes a rational process-one that yields breakthroughs reliably (versus waiting for opportunities to arise serendipitously). (Kaplan, 1999) 
Process innovation refers to change in the methods employed by a firm in delivering products or services. An example is the use of internet technologies for supply chain management, where the process of ordering, tracking, and billing would be Internet-based. Product innovation reflects change in the end product or service of the firm. An example of product innovation is the addition of a new feature such as adding a remote to a television to improve the user interaction. Administrative innovation refers to change in the characteristics of organizational or institutional elements. A change in policy, organization structure, or resource allocation are examples of administrative innovations. Using regional differences to classify innovation is a very narrow view, usually reserved to a specific technology innovation comparison. One of the drawbacks with this method is assessment of the regional nature of an innovation. For example, in the case of R&D measured by the number of patents, the region of patent invention may differ from the locale of registration—especially in the case of multinational corporations (MNC). A patent for an invention of Asian origin may be initiated in a US patent filing if the headquarters is a US MNC—thus the patent would be considered US if measured regionally. Integrating numerous past studies on technological innovation (especially those by Abernathy, Anderson, Clark, Henderson, Tushman, and Utterback) produces a common framework distinguishing four generic types of technological innovation: incremental, generational, radical, and architectural. 
Incremental innovations exploit the potential of established designs and often reinforce the dominance of established firms. They improve the existing functional capabilities of a technology by means of small-scale improvements in the technology’s value-adding attributes such as performance, safety, quality, and cost. 
Generational or next-generation technology innovations are incremental innovations that lead to the creation of a new but not radically different system. 
Radical innovations introduce new concepts that depart significantly from past practices and help create products or processes based on a different set of engineering or scientific principles and often open up entirely new markets and potential applications. They provide “a brand-new functional capability which is a discontinuity in the then-current technological capabilities.” 
Architectural innovations serve to extend the radical–incremental classification of innovation and introduce the notion of changes in the way in which the components of a product or system are linked together. Another common distinction is the difference between evolutionary innovation, where technological change appears to follow a process of “natural selection” (with technical improvements resulting from the “survival of the fittest”) and revolutionary innovation, where the change appears as a break or non-contiguous change in the course of the technology. These two approaches to envisioning innovation are not mutually exclusive, however. Using the four perspectives given above, we can show how these concepts relate to one another in a more complete framework for the analysis of innovation.

Not all innovations are discontinuous, and not all discontinuous innovations prove to be disruptive, and not all disruptive innovations are discontinuous. This is determined by the scope, timing, and impact of the innovation under consideration, and there are different strategies to deal with the challenges and opportunities arising from planned or serendipitous technological discontinuities and disruptions. Christensen (1997: 179) recommends three strategies for leveraging such contingencies and specifically in the case of “technological performance over-supply” that creates the potential for an acceleration and/or a differentiation trap (see Figs. 2 and 3): 
Strategy 1 is to ascend the trajectory of sustaining technologies into ever-higher tiers of the market.
 
Strategy 2 is to march in lock step with the needs of customers in a given tier of the market.
 
Strategy 3 is to use marketing initiatives to steepen the slopes of the market trajectories so that customers demand the performance improvements than the technologists provide.
 Kaplan (1999) discusses four strategies for leveraging such contingencies: Substantial growth over the long horizon requires discontinuous innovation—disruptive technologies, radical innovations, and discontinuities that permit entire industries and markets to emerge. Soren Kaplan’s experiences as process technology manager with Hewlett-Packard’s Strategic Change Services in Palo Alto serves as a framework for all businesses dealing with the new innovation paradigms. He proposes four strategies: radical cannibalism, competitive displacement, market innovation, and industry genesis. A strategy involving industry creation has a big advantage in that direct competition does not usually exist. It results in a new form of customer value with a new-to-the-world value proposition. “The lowest form of thinking is the bare recognition of the object. The highest, the comprehensive intuition of the man who sees all things as part of a system.” Plato An adequate definition of the process of innovation is inherently problematic. The field is nascent, and there seems to be as many different definitions as there are researchers. However, there is sufficient information available to evoke a common understanding on many points. The innovative process is defined by the correlation of its elements of study. Inventions may be measured, and the R&D process may be studied and defined. Science and invention may be linked, sources of innovation elaborated upon, organization factors investigated, the evolution of technology studied, diffusion of innovation measured, and the learning phenomena exposed. Invention is viewed as complimentary, cumulative, and leap-frogging. Complementary invention is the invention of a new process/product that is related to an existing technology, the invention of the mouse to support computer–human interaction is an example. Cumulative inventions are those that build upon, or “tweak” an existing invention, such as a product improvement like the pouring spout on juice containers. Leap-frog invention infers a radical change away from existing technologies and echoes discontinuity in markets. In understanding the process, one must understand the concept of innovation “imperative” as a key driver. In a competitive environment, managers are driven to success, both individually and organizationally. In order to achieve organization success, the manager must do more than develop, implement, and approve innovation. They are compelled to constantly innovate in order to attain success, driving the organization to higher levels of innovation diffusion. Most models of innovation are based on three basic ideas. First, organization can act to create or choose their environment. Second, management’s strategic choices shape the organization’s structure and processes. Third, once chosen, the structure and processes constrain strategy. This is a very interesting insight into innovation models. If an organization can choose its environment, and if the choice is rational, it should be able to choose the best environment for success of its strategy. There are numerous examples of firm strategies that did not perform as expected. Is this principle negated by non-performance of strategy? It may be that exogenous factors influence the choice of environment. This is an interesting question for further study, but it is not in the scope of this paper. In the USA, economic policy has an influence on innovation. In general, US policy may be categorized as selective targeting. Historically, US policy could not necessarily be labeled as supportive of innovation. Advances have been uneven (disruptive) and slow to influence productivity and relative costs. This is evidenced by a review of Total Factor Productivity comparisons: 
Total Factor Productivity (TFP) was developed by Solow in 1957 as the Growth Theory and has become the dominant approach to measuring productivity. Solow’s theorem is that the Productivity Residual is uncorrelated with any variable that is uncorrelated with the rate of growth, or, in other words, the Productivity Residual is a measure of the shift of the production function (increase in efficiency). TFP considers the traditional inputs to productivity of labor and output and adds the dimension of the influence of capital. TFP is often referred to as Solow’s residual. Prior to TFP, measurement of productivity was subject to factors that may incorrectly influence the outcome, like a rise in demand or a rise in price would cloud the real measurement. It is interesting to note that the TFP calculation is neutral to a rise in demand or a rise in price. The TFP residual is considered to be an indicator of R&D performance and as such, can be a measure of the effectiveness of innovation—at the industry or national level. Many researchers have concluded that TFP residual, as a measure of industry-wide R&D effort, is more influential than measuring a single firm. There are several key recurring principles of innovation. They are an integrated organizational approach, incentives for innovators, a systematic process to convert invention into innovation, team skills, communications, learning, and project management. These principles are instrumental in developing an innovation process. It is interesting to note the interdependencies of learning and team skills to innovation. Generally, in a team environment, individual members of a team do not possess sufficient knowledge in themselves, but, if collectively, the team “knowledge sum” is greater than non-team knowledge, the team will be a successful implementor of innovation. Since the common construct of teams is subject to change, the ability of the team to retain knowledge through effective learning is an important criteria for long-term success. Identifying innovation as a process as opposed to a discrete event or outcome is generally credited to Peter Drucker. The control of the process of innovation is referred to as innovation management. In this context, innovation management is defined by five key activities: technological integration, the process of innovation, strategic planning, organizational change, and business development. Technological integration refers to the relationship between technologies and the product of the firm. The process of innovation is the set of cross-functional activities that create and sustain innovation. Strategic planning involves the planning of technologies related to the innovation. Organizational change comprehends the disruptive nature of innovations on knowledge/skill requirements, new markets, new employees, etc. Business development refers to the creation of new markets for the products of innovation. It is interesting to note that innovation may be a driver of business development and also be driven by it. This dichotomy may be explained by the fact that, in the early stages, innovation causes a disruptive change in the organization by its very nature, creating new markets, for example. As the business evolves, “technology pull” becomes evident. As competition catches up or competitive innovations become evident, the requirement for more and more innovation to maintain market position will surface, thus causing the firm to drive innovation. The organization is influenced by innovation in several ways. Creativity is driven by competition, change, externalities, learning, climate, communications, processes, and social interaction of individuals. While innovation is a purposeful act, the prime characteristic is uncertainty. This characteristic tends to influence the set of drivers affecting the organization. In this way, as characteristics such as creativity drives innovation, the creativity itself is impacted. The impact may be positive or negative, thus the creativity may be changed and strategic plans may ineffectual. Soren Kaplan (1999) discusses the four types of discontinuities identified at Hewlett-Packard and outlines a framework that could serve as a guideline for technology managers and policy makers alike: We have discovered four types of discontinuities through our work at HP. As a result, we have developed a framework to help leaders with discontinuous innovation opportunity identification-the process of exploring new revenue streams and identifying compelling propositions for providing heightened forms of customer value. This is the strategic intent that defines compelling new business possibilities capable of driving substantial growth. The framework takes the perspective of an organization that wishes to explore opportunities for discontinuous innovation and is founded upon three assumptions. First, we believe discontinuous innovation involves creating new forms of customer value within existing or new markets. Second, by pursuing discontinuous innovations, organizations create new competitive space or displace existing methods of delivering value to customers. Our final assumption involves the structure of the model itself. We define four discrete innovation strategies but suggest that these classifications not be regarded as mutually exclusive. Instead, these categories should focus efforts on opportunity identification by providing an understanding of “gray areas” that all too often cloud the definition of “discontinuity.” (Kaplan, 1999)",11

Campbell,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"New frontiers of the mind are before us, and if they are pioneered with the same vision, boldness, and drive with which we have waged this war we can create a fuller and more fruitful employment and a fuller and more fruitful life. FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT November 17, 1944 Our conceptual point of departure here is our article release in the International Journal of Technology Management that was published back in 2009: “Mode 3” and “Quadruple Helix”: Toward a 21st Century Fractal Innovation Ecosystem [43]. In the following, we iterate and reiterate our earlier work and focus on analytically and discursively expanding our previous propositions. With this analytical expansion, we want to reflect the discussions since. We also want to develop a more future-oriented outlook and vision, addressing the current challenges and introducing a problem solving that is interested in sustainable solutions, emphasizing a sustainable development perspective that brings together innovation, entrepreneurship, and democracy. Developed and developing economies alike face increased resource scarcity and competitive rivalry. Science and technology increasingly appear as a main source of competitive and sustainable advantage for nations and regions alike. However, the key determinant of their efficacy is the quality and quantity of entrepreneurship-enabled innovation that unlocks and captures the pecuniary benefits of the science enterprise in the form of private, public, or hybrid goods. In this context, linking university basic and applied research with the market, via technology transfer and commercialization mechanisms including government–university–industry partnerships and risk capital investments, constitutes the essential trigger mechanism and driving device for sustainable competitive advantage and prosperity. In short, university researchers properly informed, empowered, and supported are bound to emerge as the architects of a prosperity that is founded on a solid foundation of scientific and technological knowledge, experience, and expertise and not in fleeting and conjectural “financial engineering” schemes. Building on these constituent elements of technology transfer and commercialization, innovation diplomacy encompasses the concept and practice of bridging distance and other divides (cultural, socioeconomic, technological, etc.) with focused and properly targeted initiatives to connect ideas and solutions with markets and investors ready to appreciate them and nurture them to their full potential. The emerging gloCalizing, globalizing, and localizing [35, 36], frontier of converging systems, networks, and sectors of innovation driven by increasingly complex, nonlinear, and dynamic processes of knowledge creation, diffusion, and use, confronts us with the need to re-conceptualize—if not reinvent—the ways and means that knowledge production, utilization, and renewal take place in the context of the knowledge economy and society (gloCal knowledge economy and society). Perspectives from and about different parts of the world and diverse human, socioeconomic, technological, and cultural contexts are interwoven to produce an emerging new worldview on how specialized knowledge, which is embedded in a particular socio-technical context, can serve as the unit of reference for stocks and flows of a hybrid, public/private, tacit/codified, tangible/virtual good that represents the building block of the knowledge economy, society, and polity. “Mode 1” of knowledge production refers primarily to basic university research (basic research performed by the higher education sector) that is being organized in a disciplinary structure. “Mode 2” focuses on knowledge application and a knowledge-based problem solving that involves the following principles: “knowledge produced in the context of application,” “transdisciplinarity,” “heterogeneity and organizational diversity,” “social accountability and reflexivity,” and “quality control” [60]. As a more far-reaching re-conceptualization of knowledge production, we postulate and introduce a new approach that we call the “mode 3” knowledge production system (expanding and extending the “mode 1” and “mode 2” knowledge production systems), which is at the heart of the fractal research, education and innovation ecosystem (FREIE) and consists of “innovation networks” and “knowledge clusters” (see definitions below) for knowledge creation, diffusion, and use [37]. This is a multilayered, multimodal, multi-nodal, and multilateral system encompassing mutually complementary and reinforcing innovation networks and knowledge clusters consisting of human and intellectual capital, shaped by social capital and underpinned by financial capital. The “mode 3” knowledge production system is in short the nexus or hub of the emerging twenty-first century innovation ecosystemFootnote 5 where people,Footnote 6

Footnote 9 [31] (forming the essential “mode 3” knowledge production system building block or “knowledge nugget”) [28] meet and interact to catalyze creativity, trigger invention, and accelerate innovation across scientific and technological disciplines, public and private sectors (government, university, industry, and non-governmental knowledge production, utilization, and renewal entities as well as other civil society entities, institutions, and stakeholders), in a top-down, policy-driven as well as bottom-up, entrepreneurship-empowered fashion. One of the basic ideas of the article is: coexistence, co-evolution, and co-specialization of different knowledge paradigms and different knowledge modes of knowledge production and knowledge use as well as their co-specialization as a result. We can postulate a dominance of knowledge heterogeneity at the systems (national, transnational) level. Only at the subsystem (subnational) level should we expect homogeneity. This understanding we can paraphrase with the term “mode 3” knowledge production system. Embedding concepts of knowledge creation, diffusion, and use in the context of general systems theory could prove mutually beneficial and enriching for systems theory as well as knowledge-related fields of study as this could: Reveal for systems theory a new and important field of application and At the same time, provide a better conceptual framework for understanding knowledge-based and knowledge-driven events and processes in the economy and, hence, reveal opportunities for optimizing public sector policies and private sector practices. Thus, the major purposes of this chapter could be paraphrased as: 
Adding to the theories and concepts of knowledge further discursive inputs, such as suggesting a linkage of systems theory and the understanding of knowledge and emphasizing multilevel systems of knowledge and innovation, summarized also under the term “mode 3” knowledge production systems approach to knowledge creation, diffusion, and use that we discuss below. This diversified and conceptually pluralized understanding should support practical and application-oriented decision making with regard to knowledge, knowledge optimization, and the leveraging of knowledge for other purposes, such as economic performance: knowledge-based decision making has ramifications for knowledge management of firms (global multinational corporations) and universities as well as for public policy (knowledge policy, innovation policy). The exploration, identification, and understanding of the key triggers, drivers, catalysts, and accelerators of high-quality and quantity (continuous as well as discontinuous, reinforcing as well as disruptive) innovation and sustainable entrepreneurship (financially and environmentally; see the work by the authors on the quintuple innovation helix in [44], pp. 58–63) that serve as the foundations of robust competitiveness within the operational framework of open innovation diplomacy and Diaspora entrepreneurship and innovation networks.

Diplomacy is the art and practice of conducting negotiations between representatives of groups or states. It usually refers to international diplomacy, the conduct of international relations[1] through the intercession of professional diplomats with regard to issues of peace-making, trade, war, economics, culture, environment and human rights. International treaties are usually negotiated by diplomats prior to endorsement by national politicians. In an informal or social sense, diplomacy is the employment of tact to gain strategic advantage or to find mutually acceptable solutions to a common challenge, one set of tools being the phrasing of statements in a non-confrontational, or polite manner.

 What is “Science Diplomacy”? Science Diplomacy (SD) is the exchange of Science and Technology across borders. A valuable resource and little understood tool of awareness, understanding, and capacity building, its power is not widely known or considered often enough. 
http://mountainrunner.us/2007/04/science_diplomacy.html
 
Cultural diplomacy specifies a form of diplomacy that carries a set of prescriptions which are material to its effectual practice; these prescriptions include the unequivocal recognition and understanding of foreign cultural dynamics and observance of the tenets that govern basic dialogue. Milton C. Cummings Jr. draws out the meaning of these cultural dynamics in his description of cultural diplomacy as “…the exchange of ideas, information, art, lifestyles, values systems, traditions, beliefs and other aspects of cultures….” 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_diplomacy
 Berridge and James (2003) state that “economic diplomacy is concerned with economic policy questions, including the work of delegations to conferences sponsored by bodies such as the WTO” and include “diplomacy which employs economic resources, either as rewards or sanctions, in pursuit of a particular foreign policy objective” also as a part of the definition. Rana (2007) defines economic diplomacy as “the process through which countries tackle the outside world, to maximize their national gain in all the fields of activity including trade, investment and other forms of economically beneficial exchanges, where they enjoy comparative advantage; it has bilateral, regional and multilateral dimensions, each of which is important”.

 Science, despite its international characteristics, is no substitute for effective diplomacy. Any more than diplomatic initiatives necessarily lead to good science. These seem to have been the broad conclusions to emerge from a three-day meeting at Wilton Park in Sussex, UK, organised by the British Foreign Office and the Royal Society, and attended by scientists, government officials and politicians from 17 countries around the world. The definition of science diplomacy varied widely among participants. Some saw it as a subcategory of “public diplomacy”, or what US diplomats have recently been promoting as “soft power” (“the carrot rather than the stick approach”, as a participant described it). Others preferred to see it as a core element of the broader concept of “innovation diplomacy”, covering the politics of engagement in the familiar fields of international scientific exchange and technology transfer, but raising these to a higher level as a diplomatic objective.

 Science and innovation together have a role that can be used to promote global equality and sustainable development,” Seabra da Cruz said. He pointed out how Brazil’s surging capacity in science and technology has provided a new channel for establishing relations with other countries, particularly emerging economies such as China and India, and those in other parts of the developing world: The big challenge to us and other emerging economies is to find ways of using scientific knowledge to enhance our competitiveness and create a new international division of labour. Without linking scientific knowledge to innovation policy, it is impossible to have sustainable development.” As an example of innovation diplomacy in action, he pointed to how technical knowledge can be exchanged between countries about the best ways of using cheap, sustainable sources of energy—as Brazil is doing with its experience in biofuels—helping to improve relations between the providers of such knowledge and those that receive it. “This is an example of where we can exchange information about best social and innovation practices—which are all likely to involve science to a greater or lesser degree—and also provide an immediate and relatively easy way of making innovation work for diplomacy.” He admitted that, as with science diplomacy, innovation diplomacy presents a number of challenges. Diplomats need to be well informed on innovation-related issues, embassies need to develop “observatories” that monitor the innovation landscape of the countries in which they are based, and ways need to be found to engage a country’s scientific and technological diaspora. More specifically, innovation diplomacy leverages entrepreneurship and innovation as key drivers, catalysts, and accelerators of economic development and envisions in particular the development of efforts and initiatives along the following axes concerning in particular the socioeconomic condition and dynamics in Greece currently: 
Re-engineer mindsets, attitudes, and behaviors to help people—and especially the younger ones—realize the true nature and potential of innovation and entrepreneurship as a way of life and the most powerful lever for and pathway to sustainable growth and prosperity with positive spillover effects staunching the brain drain, reduced cynicism and increased optimism and trust in the future and each other, reduced criminality and social unrest, higher assimilation of migrant groups, etc. 
Engage in sustained, succinct, and effective dialog with stakeholders and policy makers within the involved countries to pursue the reform and as needed reinvention of institutions, policies, and practices that can make flourish entrepreneurship and innovation in areas such as related laws, rules and regulations, higher education, public and private research and development, civil society movements and non-governmental organizations, etc. 
Identify, network, and engage purposefully and effectively with the Diaspora professional and social networks around the world to trigger, catalyze, and accelerate their involvement and intervention in a focused and structured manner to help with goals 1 and 2 above as well as help establish, fund, and manage entrepreneurship- and innovation-promoting and -supporting initiatives and institutions such as business plan competitions, angel and other risk capital financing of new ventures, mentoring of, and partnering with said ventures to ensure their survival, growth, and success both within a given country and in the global markets. Of particular interest and importance would be communities of practice and interest among the Diaspora entrepreneurship and innovation networks. To fully leverage the potential of systems (and systems theory), one should also demonstrate how a system design can be brought in line with other available concepts, such as innovation networks and knowledge clusters. With regard to clusters, at least three types of clusters can be listed: 
Geographic (spatial) clusters: In that understanding, a cluster represents a certain geographic, spatial configuration, either tied to a location or a larger region. Geographic, spatial proximity, for example for the exchange of tacit knowledge, is considered as crucial. While “local” clearly represents a subnational entity, a “region” could be either subnational or transnational. 
Sectoral clusters: This cluster approach is carried by the understanding that different industrial or business sectors develop specific profiles with regard to knowledge production, diffusion, and use. One could even add that sectoral clusters even support the advancement of particular “knowledge cultures.” In innovation research, the term “innovation culture” already is being acknowledged [69] (p. 958). 
Knowledge clusters: Here, a cluster represents a specific configuration of knowledge, and possibly also of knowledge types. However, in geographic (spatial) and sectoral terms, a knowledge cluster is not predetermined. In fact, a knowledge cluster can crosscut different geographic locations and sectors, thus operating globally and locally (across a whole multilevel spectrum). Crucial for a knowledge is if it expresses an innovative capability, for example produces knowledge that excels (knowledge-based) economic performance. A knowledge cluster, furthermore, may even include more than one geographic and/or sectoral clusters. Networks emphasize interaction, connectivity and mutual complementarity, and reinforcement. Networks, for example, can be regarded as the internal configuration that ties together and determines a cluster. Networks also can express the relationship between different clusters. Innovation networks and knowledge clusters thus resemble a matrix, indicating the interactive complexity of knowledge and innovation. Should the (proposed) conceptual flexibility of systems (and systems theory) be fully leveraged, it appears important to demonstrate how systems relate conceptually to knowledge clusters and innovation networks as they are key in understanding the nature and dynamics of knowledge stocks and flows. What we suggest is to link the two basic components (attributes) of systems (“elements/parts” and “rationale/self-rationale”) [12] (p. 426) with clusters and networks [37] (pp. 9–10). What results is the formation of two pairs of theoretical equivalents (see Fig. 1):Footnote 10
 
Elements and clusters: The elements (parts) of a system can be regarded as an equivalent to clusters (knowledge clusters). 
Rationale and networks: The rationale (self-rationale) of a system can be understood as an equivalent to networks (innovation networks). Theoretical equivalents between conceptual attributes of systems and clusters/networks. Source: Authors' own conceptualization based on [43] (p. 204) The rationale of a system holds together the system elements and expresses the relationship between different systems. It could be argued that, at least partially, this rationale manifests itself (“moves through”) as networks. At the same time, elements of a system might also manifest themselves as clusters. Perhaps, networks could be affiliated with the functions of a system and clusters with the structures of systems. This would help indicating to us, should we be interested in searching for structures and functions of knowledge and innovation systems, what exactly to look for. This, obviously, does not imply to claim that structures and functions of knowledge (innovation) systems only fall into the conceptual boxes of “clusters” and “networks.” However, clusters and networks should be regarded as crucial subsets for the elements and rationales of systems. This equation formula (between elements/clusters and rationales/networks) might need further conceptual and theoretical development. But it lays open a convincing route for better understanding knowledge and innovation through tying together two strong conceptual traditions (systems theory with clusters and knowledge). A further ramification of networks, as we will demonstrate later on, could also imply understanding (at least the large-scale) knowledge strategies as complex network configurations. As a new input for discussion, we wish to introduce the concept of the “mode 3” knowledge creation, diffusion, and use system, and we define below the essential elements or building blocks of “mode 3.” The notion “mode 3” was coined by Carayannis (late fall of 2003) and was as a concept jointly developed by Carayannis and Campbell [37]. In the following, we list some of the key definitions which refer to “mode 3” and associated concepts (see also [39, 43]). The “mode 3” systems approach for knowledge creation, diffusion, and use “Mode 3” is a multilateral, multi-nodal, multimodal, and multilevel systems approach to the conceptualization, design, and management of real and virtual, “knowledge stock” and “knowledge flow,” modalities that catalyze, accelerate, and support the creation, diffusion, sharing, absorption, and use of co-specialized knowledge assets. “Mode 3” is based on a system-theoretic perspective of socioeconomic, political, technological, and cultural trends and conditions that shape the co-evolution of knowledge with the “knowledge-based and knowledge-driven, gloCal economy and society.Footnote 11
 Innovation networks Innovation networksFootnote 12 are real and virtual infrastructures and infra-technologies that serve to nurture creativity, trigger invention, and catalyze innovation in a public and/or private domain context (for instance, government–university–industry public–private research and technology development co-opetitive partnerships).Footnote 13

Footnote 14
 Knowledge clusters Knowledge clusters are agglomerations of co-specialized, mutually complementary, and reinforcing knowledge assets in the form of “knowledge stocks” and “knowledge flows” that exhibit self-organizing, learning-driven, dynamically adaptive competences and trends in the context of an open systems perspective. Twenty-first century FREIE A twenty-first century FREIE is a multilevel, multimodal, multi-nodal, and multi-agent system of systems. The constituent systems consist of innovation meta-networks (networks of innovation networks and knowledge clusters) and knowledge meta-clusters (clusters of innovation networks and knowledge clusters) as building blocks and organized in a self-referential or chaoticFootnote 15 fractalFootnote 16 [61] knowledge and innovation architecture [27], which in turn constitute agglomerations of human, social, intellectual, and financial capital stocks and flows as well as cultural and technological artifacts and modalities, continually co-evolving, co-specializing, and co-opeting. These innovation networks and knowledge clusters also form, reform, and dissolve within diverse institutional, political, technological, and socioeconomic domains including government, university, industry, and non-governmental organizations and involving information and communication technologies, biotechnologies, advanced materials, nanotechnologies, and next-generation energy technologies. In the following chapters, we present in greater detail different aspects of advanced knowledge and innovation. Crucial for the suggested “mode 3” approach is the idea that an advanced knowledge system may integrate different knowledge modes. Some knowledge (innovation) modes certainly will phase out and stop existing. However, what is important for the broader picture is that in fact a co-evolution, co-development, and co-specialization of different knowledge modes emerges. This pluralism of knowledge modes should be regarded as essential for advanced knowledge-based societies and economies. This may point to similar features of advanced knowledge and advanced democracy. We could state that competitiveness and sustainability of the gloCal knowledge economy and society increasingly depend on the elasticity and flexibility of promoting a co-evolution and, by this, also a cross-integration of different knowledge (innovation) modes. This heterogeneity of knowledge modes should create hybrid synergies and additionalities. The “triple helix” model of knowledge, developed by Henry Etzkowitz and Loet Leydesdorff [53] (pp. 111–112), stresses three “helices” that intertwine and, by this, generate a national innovation system: academia/universities, industry, and state/government. Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff are inclined to speaking of “university–industry–government relations” and networks, also placing a particular emphasis on “tri-lateral networks and hybrid organizations” where those helices overlap. In extension of the triple helix model, we suggest a “quadruple helix” model (see Fig. 2). Quadruple helix, in this context, means to add to the above stated helices a “fourth helix” that we identify twofold as the “media-based and culture-based public” as well as the “civil society” (see, furthermore, [43], pp. 206–207) [47, 49, 75]. This should emphasize that a broader understanding of knowledge production and innovation application requires that also the public becomes more integrated into advanced innovation systems. The public uses and applies knowledge, so public users are also part of the innovation system. In an advanced knowledge society and knowledge economy, knowledge flows out into all spheres of society. When we speak of the “public” in context of the quadruple helix, we mean, in more particular, the media-based and culture-based public and civil society. But also other aspects are being addressed: culture (cultures) and innovation culture (innovation cultures)Footnote 17; the knowledge of culture and the culture of knowledge [45]; values and lifestyles; multiculturalism, multiculture, and creativity; media; arts and arts universities; and multilevel innovation systems (local, national, global), with universities of the sciences but also universities of the arts. These diverse and heterogeneous settings of culture should help in fostering creativity, which is so necessary and essential for creating and producing new knowledge and new innovations. “We can also call this the creativity of knowledge creation” [44] (p. 48). In organizational and institutional terms, this encourages developing “creative knowledge environments”. Hemlin et al. [64] define such contexts in the following way: “Creative knowledge environments (CKEs) are those environments, contexts and surroundings the characteristics of which are such that they exert a positive influence on human beings engaged in creative work aiming to produce new knowledge or innovations, whether they work individually or in teams, within a single organization or in collaboration with others”.Footnote 18 Richard Florida [57] coined the notion of the “creative class” (a term, coined by Richard) [57]. Plausibility for the explanatory potential of such a fourth helix are that culture and values, on the one hand, and the way how “public reality” is being constructed and communicated by the media, on the other, influence every national and every multilevel innovation system. The proper “innovation culture” is here key for promoting an advanced knowledge-based economy. Through public discourses, transported through and interpreted by the media, it is crucial for a society to assign top priorities to innovation and knowledge (research, technology, education). The conceptualization of the “quadruple helix” innovation system. Source: Authors' own conceptualization based on [53] (p. 112), [43] (p. 207; 2010, p. 62), [49] The creative industries are part of an economy, in context of the quadruple helix. It is reasonable, however, not only to speak of the creative industries but also to envision more comprehensively a “creativity economy,” where creativity is relevant for all sectors of the economy as well as all sectors of society. An advanced knowledge economy is a knowledge economy, innovation economy, and a creativity economy at the same time. The more mature and advanced a knowledge economy, innovation economy, and knowledge society are, the more creativity is being demanded. As Dubina et al. [52] state: “The more advanced and mature a knowledge economy (creativity economy) and knowledge society (creativity society) are, the more knowledge, innovation and creativity can be absorbed and are even being demanded for further progress. The creativity economy creatively interrelates technological innovations with social innovations” (see Fig. 3). The increasing cross-interrelation of innovation and creativity in advanced knowledge economies, knowledge societies, and knowledge democracies. Source: Authors' own conceptualization based on [52] In the multilevel innovations systems, which are being carried and driven by advanced knowledge production in the context of the quadruple helix innovation model, research activities of the universities of the sciences (natural sciences, life sciences, social sciences, and humanities) are essential. However, what counts here are not only the sciences but also the arts. The sciences are a manifestation of knowledge, but also the arts, at least partially, can be understood as a manifestation of knowledge. In the context of higher education and the universities, we are often inclined to speak of “scientific research.” But there exist also important forms of “artistic research.” Artistic research, in fact, represents an innovative conceptualization of a new form of art creation and art practice, possibly also a new form of knowledge creation. “‘Artistic research’ is a new practice in the arts in which artists themselves act as researchers and present their findings in the form of artwork. This practice is firmly established at European universities but has so far provoked little public response. What distinguishes artistic research from ‘mere’ art, and what contributions can it make to the art world?” [7] (cover page; see also [82, 83]; furthermore, see [103]). Artistic research and research in the arts can engage in interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary network arrangements with research in the sciences. Artistic research and universities of the arts should be regarded as being of a crucial importance for multilevel innovation systems in advanced knowledge economies that are also creativity economies (see also [118]). Artistic research, research in the arts, and arts universities, in hybrid, pluralized, and heterogeneous combinations with universities of the sciences and research in the sciences, add to the creativity of new knowledge production and new innovations. In the sciences, there is often the understanding of a spectrum from basic (pure) research to applied research. Also for the arts, one may propose a spectrum of (pure) basic artistic research to the (applied) practice of arts (see Fig. 4).Footnote 19
 Research and knowledge application in the sciences and the arts. Source: Authors' own conceptualization The triple helix may be regarded as a “core model” for innovation, resulting from interactions in knowledge production referring to universities (higher education), industries (economy), and governments (multilevel). The triple helix is being contextualized by the broader innovation model of the quadruple helix, which is blending in features of the public, for example civil society and the media-based and culture-based public. The quintuple helix innovation model, finally, contextualizes the quadruple helix (and triple helix). The quintuple helix brings in the perspective of the natural environments of society and the economy for knowledge production and the innovation systems. “For the purpose of further discussion and analysis we lastly want to propose and introduce the five-helix model of the ‘Quintuple Helix’, where the environment or the natural environments represent the fifth helix” [44] (p. 61). A sustainable balance between the paths of development of society and the economy, with their natural environments, is essential for the further progress of human civilizations. The quintuple helix, however, also emphasizes that the natural environments should be conceptualized as drivers for the further advance of knowledge production and innovation systems. Thus, the quintuple helix model appears to be compatible with the interests, also analytical interests, of social ecology (on social ecology, see [56]). The quadruple helix contextualizes the triple helix, and the quintuple helix contextualizes the quadruple helix (see Fig. 5). Depending on the interests and the analytical interests, it could be equally appropriate to frame a research question either in reference to the triple helix, quadruple helix, or quintuple helix innovation models. However, even when an analysis or assessment is being carried out in a triple helix framework, also, at one point, the contexts of quadruple helix and quintuple helix should be taken into consideration. The knowledge and innovation perspectives of quadruple and quintuple helix are broader; thus, they add crucially to the prospects and opportunities of a sustainable problem solving. The more advanced knowledge societies and knowledge economies are progressing, the more there is a need to shift the attention to broader innovation models (see Fig. 6).Footnote 20

Source: Authors' own conceptualization based on [53] (p. 112), [49] (p. 207; 2010, p. 62) and [49] Figure 7 displays visually from which conceptual perspectives the co-evolution and cross-integration of different knowledge modes could be approached. Mode 3 emphasizes the additionality and surplus effect of a co-evolution of a pluralism of knowledge and innovation modes. Quadruple helix refers to the structures and processes of the gloCal (global and local) knowledge economy and society; quintuple helix also brings in the perspective of the natural environments (social ecology). Furthermore, the “innovation ecosystem,” combining and integrating social and natural systems and environments, stresses the importance of a pluralism of a diversity of agents, actors, and organizations: universities (universities of the sciences and arts), small- and medium-sized enterprises, and major corporations, arranged along the matrix of fluid and heterogeneous innovation networks and knowledge clusters. This all may result in a democracy of knowledge, driven by a pluralism of knowledge and innovation and by a pluralism of paradigms of knowledge modes. The democracy of knowledge, as a concept and metaphor, is being carried by the understanding that there operates (at least potentially) a co-evolution between processes of advancing democracy and processes of advancing knowledge and innovation. Between processes and structures of advanced knowledge democracy, knowledge society, and knowledge economy, there is a certain congruence [44] (pp. 54–58, 60–61). Concepts of democracy (moving from electoral to liberal and high-quality democracies), and of knowledge and innovation (for example, refocusing from triple helix to quadruple and quintuple helices), are becoming broader and increase their complexity considerably. Political pluralism in democracy cross-refers to creativity-encouraging heterogeneity and diversity of different forms, modes and paradigms of knowledge and innovation.Footnote 21 In “The Republic of Science,” Michael Polanyi [100] expressed already some similar ideas: “My title is intended to suggest that the community of scientists is organized in a way which resembles certain features of a body politic and works according to economic principles similar to those by which the production of material goods is regulated.” We suggest here that the democracy of knowledge contextualizes the republic of science in an already broader perspective. Knowledge creation, diffusion, and use in a democracy of knowledge. Source: Authors' own conceptualization based on [43] (p. 208); see also [115] and [100] In the “Frascati Manual,” the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development [93] (p. 29) distinguishes between the following activity categories of research (R&D, research and experimental development): basic research; applied research; and experimental development. Basic research represents a primary competence of university research, whereas business R&D focuses heavily on experimental development. Assessed empirically for the USA, one of the globally leading national innovation systems, with regard to the financial volume of R&D resources, the experimental development ranks first, applied research second, and basic research third [96, 87] (Chapter 4, pp. 8–16). Interesting, however, is the dynamic momentum when observed for a longer period of time. Basic research in the USA grew faster than applied research. In 1981, 13.4% of the US R&D was devoted to basic research. By 2008, basic research increased its percentage share to 17.47%. During the same time period, the percentage shares of applied research stagnated and experimental development even declined (see also [43], pp. 209–210). This links up to the question whether we should expect an R&D “U-curving” for US innovation system, implying that basic research further will increase its percentage shares of the overall R&D expenditure while experimental development may slide back. This would go hand-in-hand with an importance gain of basic research. Furthermore, would such a potential future scenario for the USA also spill over to other national innovation systems? Assessed in a long-term perspective (1953–2008), there has been a substantial shift in the financing and funding of the national R&D in the USA. Until the early 1970s, the federal government was the most important funding source for R&D. After that, business moved up to become the primary funding source and gradually increased its dominance since then. During the 1970s, the funding base of national R&D in the USA converted from primarily public to primarily private [87] (Chapter 4, pp. 11, 14). This feeds general expectations that mature and advanced national R&D systems are being funded and performed, first of all, by the economy (the business enterprise sector). In less advanced R&D systems, the role of business is less important, in relative terms. However, and this appears to be a crucial argument here, this importance gain of the economy does not imply that basic or applied research is becoming less important. What seems to count then is the basic and applied research conducted by business. Business basic research creates key opportunities to interact, cross-link, and network with the university basic research in the higher education sector, thus fostering hybrid knowledge and innovation interactions, in a linear and nonlinear fashion. The OECD [95] provides the following definition for basic research: “Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundation of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view.” We should raise the question whether this is still an appropriate or sufficient definition for basic research? The problem is that this definition creates a contradiction between basic research and application, but why? In the old world of a dominance of “mode 1” for the universities, this may have been a legitimate position or proposition, but in the new worlds of mode 2 and mode 3 of knowledge production, this general exclusion of application, for basic research, does not make sense. In the old world of knowledge production, perhaps there was a reasonable interest in a sharp line of division (boundary) between basic and applied research. Nowadays, basic research in the context of application has risen to new prominence and importance, and may be one of the keys for remodeling our knowledge and innovation systems. So there also appears to be a need or even a demand for a more “application-friendly” redefinition of basic research. The here suggested phrasing for a redefinition of basic research could be as follows: “Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundation of phenomena and observable facts, without or with a particular application or use in view (in the long run).” Such a redefinition nicely balances the qualities of basic research with the opportunities of more simultaneously coupling basic research with application, linearly and nonlinearly. There is even a chance that the established definition of basic research, quoted above and still being used by the OECD, really underestimates the extent of basic research that already is being conducted by the economy. Is the economy (in the advanced knowledge economy) performing more basic business research than the conventional definitions capture and reflect? Our proposed conceptual redefinition of basic research may radically and substantially shift and transform our assessment of the patterns and behavior of advanced knowledge and innovation. In a simple understanding, the “linear model of innovation” claims: first, there is basic university research. Later this basic research converts into applied research of intermediary organizations (university-related institutions).Footnote 22 Finally, firms pick up and transform applied research to experimental development, which is then being introduced as commercial market applications. This linear understanding often is referred to Vannevar Bush [5], even though Bush himself, in his famous report, neither mentions the terms “linear model of innovation” nor even the word “innovation.” “Non-linear models of innovation”, on the contrary, underscore a more parallel coupling of basic research, applied research, and experimental development. Thus, universities or higher education institutions in general, university-related institutions, and firms join together in variable networks and platforms for creating innovation networks and knowledge clusters. Even though there continues to be a division of labor and a functional specialization of organizations with regard to the type of R&D activity, universities, university-related institutions, and firms can perform, at the same time, basic and applied research and experimental development. Surveys about sectoral innovation in the pharmaceutical sector [81] and the chemical sector [48] reveal how each of these industries may be characterized by complex network configurations and arrangement of a diversity of academic and firm actors. The mode 3 innovations ecosystem thus represents a model for an interactive coupling of “nonlinear innovation modes”: partially, this also could mean linking together “linear innovation modes” of different degrees of maturity in the knowledge value chain or closeness to market application, fostering the setup of “creative knowledge environments” in organizations and institutions (see Fig. 8). Cross-employment (multi-employment) may be regarded as one strategy for realizing creative knowledge environments. Cross-employment (multi-employment) refers to a knowledge worker, employee, who is being simultaneously employed by more than one organization, possibly being located in different sectors (for example, a higher education and a non-higher education institution, e.g., a university and a firm). This supports the direct network-style coupling of very different organizations in knowledge production and innovation application, expressing, therefore, what nonlinear innovation could mean in practical terms [19]. Linear and nonlinear innovation modes linking together universities (mode 1, mode 2, and/or mode 3 universities) with commercial and academic firms (firm units). Source: Authors' own conceptualization based on [43] (p. 211) The concept of the “entrepreneurial university” captures the need of linking more closely together university research with the R&D market activities of firms (see, for example, [54]). Mode 1 refers to a university knowledge production that focuses on basic university research that is interested in delivering comprehensive explanations of the world, structured in a “disciplinary logic,” and not (per se) interested in knowledge application and innovation. Mode 2 refers to a university knowledge production that is based on the following principles: (1) “knowledge produced in the context of application,” (2) “transdisciplinarity,” (3) “heterogeneity and organizational diversity,” (4) “social accountability and reflexivity,” and (5) “quality control” (see [60], pp. 3–8, 167). “Mode 2” universities and “entrepreneurial universities” overlap, at least conceptually. A “mode 3” university (higher education institution) or higher education sector would be an organization or a system that operates simultaneously according to the two knowledge principles of modes 1 and 2. Mode 3 universities seek organizational designs in trying to combine, in co-evolving, and co-learning patterns; modes 1 and 2, by believing that this creates a surplus in high-quality, creative, and sustainable knowledge (knowledge production). Are mode 3 universities ideal–typical concepts or are they empirical concepts? Do mode 3 universities indicate examples for ambidextrous organizations? As important as the entrepreneurial university or the mode 3 university is for us the concept of the “academic firm,”Footnote 23 which represents the complementary business organization and strategy vis-à-vis the entrepreneurial and mode 3 universities. The interplay of academic firms and entrepreneurial (mode 3) universities should be regarded as crucial for advanced knowledge-based economies and societies. The following characteristics represent the academic firm [21] (p. 171): “support of the interfaces between the economy and the universities”; “support of the paralleling of basic research, applied research and experimental development”; “incentives for employees to codify knowledge”; “support of collaborative research and of research networks”; and “a limited ‘scientification’ of business R&D.” Despite continuing important functional differences between universities and firms, also some limited hybrid overlapping may occur between entrepreneurial universities and academic firms, expressed in the circumstance that entrepreneurial universities and academic firms can engage more easily in university/business research networks. In an innovation-driven economy, the business R&D is being supported and excelled when it can refer to inputs from a networking of universities and firms clearly supporting business R&D. The academic firm also engages in “basic business research.” Of course, we always must keep in mind that academic firms and universities are not identical because academic firms represent business units, still interested in creating commercial revenues and profits. The commercial firm concentrates on maximizing or optimizing profit, whereas the academic firm focuses on maximizing or optimizing knowledge and innovation. While the entrepreneurial (mode 2) university represents a partial extension of business elements to the world of academia, the academic firm could serve as an example for an extension of the world of academia to the world of business. Academic firms are knowledge-oriented, interested in engaging in networks with universities (the higher education sector), encourage “academic culture and values” to motivate their employees, allow forms of academic work (such as academic-style publishing), and support continuing education and life-long learning of and for their employees (flexible time schemes, honoring life-long learning and continued, continuing education with internal career promotion). The concept of the “academic firm” may refer to: A whole firm, A subunit, subdivision, or branch of a “commercial” firm,Footnote 24 and Certain characteristics or elements of a whole (commercial) firm. Are academic firms ideal–typical or empirical concepts? Are firms, interested in integrating principles of the commercial and academic firm, examples for ambidextrous organizations? For the future, this may have the following challenging implication: How can or should firms balance, within their “organizational boundaries,” principles of the academic and of the more traditional “commercial” firm? The “technology life cycles” explain why there is always a dynamic momentum in the gloCal knowledge economy and society [109]. The “saturation tendency” within every technology life cycle demands the creation and launch of new technology life cycles, leading to the market introduction of next-generation technology-based products and services. In reality, always different technology life cycles with varying degrees of market maturity will operate in parallel. To a certain extent, technology life cycles are also responsible for the cyclicality (growth phases) of a modern market economy. The perhaps shortest possible way of describing the economic thinking of Joseph A. Schumpeter is to put up the following equation: entrepreneurship, leveraging the opportunities of new technology life cycles, creates economic growth. Addressing the cyclicality of capitalist economic life, Schumpeter [105] used the notion of the “creative destruction”. “Mode 3” may open up a route for overcoming or transforming the destructiveness of the “creative destruction” [42].",188

By nature, radical innovation, being a priori unforeseen, requires a far more risky innovation strategy compared to the more foreseeable incremental innovation. This is because radical innovation advances prior art to a new border, while incremental ones help to better manage the existing borders. Accordingly, there is a sizable literature that shades light on how firms try to manage this risk, and on how they pace their R&D in pursue of either radical or incremental innovations. By contrast, we are, in many ways, agnostic as to the effects of risk in shaping and developing innovations at the country level. Different economies (similar to firms) have developed different approaches and attitudes towards innovation through what is more commonly known as a National System of Innovation (NSI). There is a growing literature that examines the differences between various NSIs, see Nelson [21] and Mowery and Rosenberg [20]. This literature suggests that different NSIs employ state, university, laboratory, and firm research in different ways.Footnote 1 How countries employ the above elements affects their ability to innovate and the type of innovation they can produce. This is highlighted in the different research paths US and German firms follow in the field of biotechnology. Specifically, German firms follow a low-risk innovation strategy, concentrating on proteins whose therapeutic properties are already well established; incremental innovations. By contrast, US firms, as Henderson et al. [14] note, have used biotechnology as a search technique and their primary focus is on the discovery of small molecules designed to increase the productivity of synthetic drugs. In fact, as Goyer [11] notes, “By contrast [to the German system of innovation], the American system.... is well suited for radical innovation, which requires the introduction of radical innovative design and rapid development based on pure scientific research”. Accounting for the above, concentrating on the economy as a whole, the aim of this paper is to examine how the choice of risk affects the way countries innovate and on how this risk affects economic growth. This paper concentrates on only one aspect of the innovation process, namely intellectual property protection. Specifically, in countries, such as the US, where intellectual property is well defined and protected, there exist borders between technologies, rending them proprietary only to the patent holder. In the absence of such protection anyone can freely copy an innovation. Thus, the original innovator is faced with competition from free riders. However, as Harris and Vickers [13] and Beath et al. [2] suggest, the more one feels a competitor’s breath behind her back the more she is forced on adopting riskier strategies. There is a well-known historic precedent that displays how lack of competition can lead an innovator to rest on her laurels failing to advance a valuable and radical innovation further. Specifically, in the 1890s, Edison successfully patented the light bulb filament invention; however, until the patent expired, he did not improve on this technology. In addition, even though others had created a better light bulb, he managed (through successful litigation) to keep competitors out of the market, increasing his market share and sales. In the light of the above, this paper models a patent race between two competing innovating firms, where an innovation is a twofold process, based on prior art and risky experimentation. These two firms innovate sequentially and the winner is the only firm to put its innovation into production. The variable of choice for the firm is the amount of R&D effort that is diverted to risky research paths, i.e., research that can lead to breakthroughs, as well as pitfalls. The production side of the economy is a simple growth framework based on Aghion and Howitt [1]. Within this context, the role of a central planner (who acts on behalf of the courts and the PTO) is to maximize production, using patent breadth as her choice variable. Patent breadth is indicated by how much the losing firm can copy (within the boundaries of legal protection) the winner’s innovation. Overall, if the loser can fully copy the winner then they both have a similar technology at hand, which indicates that there is more competition between them during the patent race.Footnote 2 On the whole, within a static framework, the aim of this paper is to study optimal patent breadth, the one that maximizes production. As the paper shows, there is a decreasing relationship between how strong the optimal patent protection should be and the ability of the economy to successfully follow risky innovation strategies. Bearing in mind that developing economies lack the capacity to successfully follow risky innovation strategies, this finding suggests that developing economies should adopt a more strict intellectual property policy, compared to the ones followed by more advanced economies. The literature connecting growth theory to intellectual property is rather slim, see Gallini [9] for a survey. A notable exception, from a theoretical point of view, is Horowitz and Lai [15] who show that there is an inverted U relationship between the rate of innovation and patent length. The argument that they present is that an increase in patent length leads to larger, but less frequent, innovations. Moreover, from an empirical perspective, Lerner [18], in an international analysis of the relationship between patent strength and innovation, examines 177 policy shifts in 60 countries over 150 years and finds some support for a non-linear relationship. In what follows, the sections “Introducing the general framework” and “Innovations” introduce the model, the section “Solving the model” discusses the ways patents foster innovation, while the section “The optimal patent protection” derives the optimal patent protection.",7
2.0,3.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,30 November 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-010-0031-6,Are We Ready for Knowledge Economy in Jordan?,September 2011,Loay Salhieh,Ahmad Mashal,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"During the last century, the world underwent the various phases of development from agriculture economy (society), where manual labor was the critical factor, to industrial economy, where the management of technology, capital, and labor provided the competitive advantage. This gave away to the information era which had connectivity and software products as the main driving forces [19]. Firms today are living in a chaotic transition period to a new age defined by global competition, rampant change, faster flow of information and communication, increasing business complexity, and pervasive globalization. The pace of change has become so rapid that it took a different type of firms to be dominant and marked entirely new era of business. This new environment is also characterized by more far-reaching technological advances and a consumer who has adjusted to this quicker pace and whose fickle preferences are revised with the speed of a television commercial [16]. At present, a new economy (society) is emerging where knowledge is the primary production resource instead of capital and labor. So, a major shift has taken place in the relative importance of production factors. Earlier, the three main factors of production were land, labor, and capital. In the recent years, however, intellectual labor has become by far the most important factor of production. The rise of knowledge economy severely defies the conventional economic and management theories. According to the analysis of production process, knowledge economy brings about the challenge to the former system of “capital employs labor” and puts forward the assumption of “labor employs capital”. A knowledge-driven economy is one in which the generation and exploitation of knowledge play a predominant part in the creation of wealth [1]. And the knowledge-based economy is all about adding ideas to products and turning new ideas into new products [15]. In a knowledge economy, a firm’s intellectual capital represents the only sustainable source of competitive advantage. The ability to learn is, therefore, a key success factor [5]. During the transition process to knowledge economy, the learning organization will emerge as one of the most effective theories that would guide the construction of a new organizational and management model. With the advent of globalization and the resulting political and economical complexities, firms in the developing countries are going through battles of survival. The economic liberalization and competition from foreign organizations operating in Jordan have put a lot of pressure to prepare and develop their human resources. The Jordanian organizations have a compelling need to transform a highly diverse workforce into learned, motivated, effective, and efficient employees. They are trying to get organized around learning for continuous cultivation and deployment of knowledge [10]. Thus, the challenge is more acute for firms in Jordan. As “developing” countries like Jordan have missed the industrial revolution and many are trying to enter and take advantage of this new form of economy “Knowledge economy”, there is need to transform our enterprises into learning organizations in order to lay down the required seeds to transform our economy into knowledge economy. It is the purpose of this study to examine and investigate the realities of our enterprises regarding their readiness to transform into learning organizations. The aim of this study is to identify the gap between the realities and the desired state of knowledge economy in Jordan and to come out with recommendations that include government policies to narrow the gap and help organizations into becoming a learning organization. The study intends to adopt and adapt a holistic view in terms of assessing the readiness of organizations to transform into learning organizations. The paper is divided into seven sections. The next section will explain the realities and features of knowledge economy per se, while the third section will elaborate on the concept, elements, and nature of a learning organization. The fourth section will discuss the proposed framework pinpointing the rational of considering a learning organization as an enabler. The methodology will be discussed in the fifth section. Results and analysis will be shown in the sixth section. The last section will elaborate on the recommendations and implications.",2
2.0,3.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,17 March 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-011-0035-x,Innovation in India: A Path to Knowledge Economy,September 2011,Sonali Bhattacharya,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Powell Walter and Snellman [25] defined knowledge economy as “production and services based on knowledge-intensive activities that contribute to an accelerated pace of technological and scientific advance as well as equally rapid obsolescence.” Earlier works on knowledge economy focus on effect of science and technology on socioeconomic development [18, 23, 24, 31]. Some works on knowledge economy highlight on contribution of knowledge intensive industries like information technology industries to national productivity [3, 11]. Yet, another most modern and important dimension of study on knowledge economy is on contribution of innovation and learning to industrial performance [7, 9, 22]. How knowledge has affected modern civilization can be understood from the fact that how search engines and knowledge database had made accessibility of knowledge easier. Computer games, DVD, and television have become an integral part of teenage learning and entertainment. Information technology has been highly successful in creating solidarity of thoughts and harmonization of actions of people of all corners of the world irrespective of cultural differences [15]. In a survey conducted by Radovan [28] in Croatia on students of information technology, mathematics, and pedagogy, 26% of respondents felt that information technology stimulates creativity and diminishes the inclination towards destruction, 14% hold the view that technology has exactly the opposite effect, a vast majority of 60% hold that technology by itself does not have a relevant impact on human inclinations; technology only intensify the effects of human inclinations and activities, equally of the creative and of the destructive ones. There has been growing interest in measurement of development of status of knowledge economy in the society. A major thrust has been in measurement of human capital, intellectual capital, and efforts towards research development. The World Bank has initiated the Knowledge for Development Program to help client nations to assess their capability of tapping global knowledge for social welfare and development. The four pillars of knowledge assessment (www.worldbank.org/kam) as stated by World Bank’s Knowledge Assessment Methodology are as follows:
 Economic and institutional regime: The country’s economic and institutional regime must provide incentives for the efficient use of existing and new knowledge and the flourishing of entrepreneurship. The indicators are tariff and non-tariff, regulatory authorities, and rule of law. Education and skills: The country’s people need education and skills to enable them to create and share, and to use it well. Gross secondary and tertiary enrollment rate and adult literacy rate are key indicators of educational achievement. Information and communication infrastructure: A dynamic information infrastructure is needed to facilitate the effective communication, dissemination, and processing of information. The indicators are telephone, internet, and computers per 1,000 people. Innovation system: The country’s innovation system—firms, research centers, universities, think tanks, consultants, and other organizations—must be capable of tapping the growing stock of global knowledge, assimilating and adapting it to local needs, and creating new technology. The indicators are royalty and payments/receipts per person, technical journal articles per million and patents granted to nations by US Patent and trademark office per million people. Confederation of Indian Industries in collaboration with INSEAD World Business School supported by Cannon India has devised the Global Innovation Index It considered the five parameters of innovation enablers namely, human capacity, general and ICT infrastructure, business and scientific sophistication, two measures of innovative output measure, i.e., scientific outputs and creative outputs and well-being. India has been ranked 56th in the 2009–2010 Global Innovation Index out of 132 nations. Goswami and Mathew [12] have given a detailed literature review on the definition of innovation. Myers and Marquis [21], Zaltman et al. [32] and Drucker 1985 [8] look at innovation in the point of view of technological innovation. Lundvall’s [17] definition includes non-technological innovations, including institutional innovations. Freeman [10] emphasized role of social and educational innovations (pp. 339–41). Carlsson and Stankiewicz [4], extended definition of innovation to include the development of new organizational setups. Schumpeter’s definition sums up the following forms of innovations : (1) introduction of new product or qualitative change in existing product, (2) process innovation new to an industry, (3) opening of a new market, (4) development of new sources of supply for raw material, and (5) other inputs and changes in the industrial organization. Boer and During [1] defined innovation as the creation of a new product–market–technology–organization combination. Indian Upanishad [6] speaks that there are four forms of education: learning from the teachers, learning through self-reflection and introspection, learning through peer interaction, and learning in time context through experience. Upnishad describes five layers of knowledge: knowledge for satisfying basic needs, knowledge for developing means of existence, knowledge for psychological well-being, knowledge based on rational thinking and knowledge of purpose. India’s quest for knowledge began from the prehistoric period, with the discovery of zero, Hindu-Arabic numerical and discoveries in astronomical science which have been popularized by Al’Beruni. The Srimad Bhagvat Gita is the treasure house of spiritual knowledge, morality, ethical way of life, and knowledge of highest pursuit of differentiation between good and evil. Kautilya’s Arthashastra teaches us the ethical code of conduct in administration and accounting rules, arguably the first work ever on principles of governance. India’s expertise in various fields of knowledge had attracted expedition by foreign travelers like Huin Tsang, Marco Polo, and Vasco Da Gama. The eighteenth century saw an emergence of another string of famous scientists in various domains of science and mathematics like Meghnath Saha, Chandrashekhar Venkat Raman, Jagdish Chandra Bose, Srivivas Ramanujan. The twentieth and twenty-first century saw human interest in multidisciplinary studies like biotechnology, genetic engineering, neurophysics, biochemistry, econometrics, etc. There is no denying the fact that India is still moving ahead to assimilate itself in the modern Knowledge Economy brought in by the Information Technology Revolution of the 1990s and signing up of the Intellectual Property Rights under World Trade Organisation (WTO). Information technology, in the present era, provides the basic framework for acquisition and creation of knowledge repository on various domain and application and distribution of knowledge for the betterment of the society. The focus now in India has shifted substantially towards research and development (R&D) and innovation having successfully registered several applications under US Patent and Trademark. Internet, broadband connections have penetrated to most urban household, but rural areas are still lacking on IT infrastructure as would be discussed in more detail in the coming sections. India has been included in the 34 nations under World Knowledge Competitiveness Indexes (WKCI). India, along with China is considered to form the Knowledge Cluster of South Asia with three of its cities, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad enlisted among the 145 cities which form knowledge powerhouse under WKCI report. Revolution in the ICT has brought forth new opportunities by easy accessibility of knowledge at all levels. The knowledge workers, the managers, information technology professionals, the medico-professionals, lawyers, educationists form a substantial part of the population than even a decade ago. Bangalore boosts to have nurtured three of the global leaders in software solution like Wipro, Satyam, and Infosys. After the modernization of the Intellectual Property Right (IPR) in 1995 with full compliance with the WTO, there has been much focus in India towards promoting research and innovation and IPR infrastructure. India is considered to be the 11th largest patent office of the world in terms of number of patent filings. According to the WIPO statistics database, July 2008, there have been 24,505 patent filings in the Indian patent office out of which there are 4,521 resident filings in the year 2006. In fact, an annual growth rate of patent filings in India in 2000–2007 has been the second largest with 24.5% next only to China which has a growth rate of 32%. Out of the total filings India granted, there are 2,924 nonresident patents and 1,396 resident patents. The Relative Specialisation Index, which shows a country’s share in foreign-oriented patents in a specific technology as compared to a country’s share in all foreign-oriented patents is specially high in organic fine chemistry (1.88), pharmaceuticals (1.672), food chemistry (1.13), and medical technology (0.711). India has filled 1,635 patents through business houses, 730 through government-owned organizations, and only six through other research institutes between 2000 and 2007. No patent has been filled by universities. India’s research development expenditure is a little over 1% in the last few years. According to the WIPO statistics database and UNESCO, July 2008, the research and development expenditure (in millions of constant US dollars, based on purchasing power parities and lagged by 2 years to derive the resident filings to R&D ratio) of India is 0.398 which makes India the 22nd ranked in R&D expenses. The figures for comparable economies are Brazil (0.519), Russia (3.385), China (2.439), and Republican of Korea (5.597). The average annual salary of researchers is US $11,526 and when adjusted for purchasing power parity it is US $56,780. So, India has a cost advantage for research investment. The government still forms the bulk of the R&D investment. The government agencies such as Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), ICAR, NCAER, and ICMR form bulk of patent filings in USPTO. In 2004–2005, out of a total of 229 patents granted to Indian innovators, CSIR has 140. The research innovation in CSIR and other Indian research institutes have been in areas of pharmaceuticals and food chemicals [5]. Out of the top 1,400 global companies with the highest R&D expenditures, there are only 15 Indian-based companies. By R&D as percentage of sales, these companies are Tata Motors (10.5%), Mahindra & Mahindra (11.7%), Bharat Heavy Electricals (3.1%), Corus now part Tata Steel (5%), Novelis (Canada) now part of Hindalco Industries (1.6%), Reliance Industries (8.7%), Ranbaxy Laboratories (6.7%), Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories (17.6%), Sun Pharmaceuticals (23.1%), and Cipla India (17.9%). The software companies included in the list are Polaris, KPIT Cummins, Infosys, Aztecsoft, and Prithvi Information. The R&D innovations in the software sector have mostly been by foreign companies. Of the top 50 most innovative companies by Business Week and Boston Consulting Group Survey 2009, there are three Indian companies Infosys, Reliance Industries, and Tata group. The major knowledge clusters in India are the National Capital Region of Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bangalore, and Hyderabad due to the simultaneous existence of research laboratories, MNCs with high innovative index and quality higher education institutes. Globally, innovation is recognized in the form of product innovation, process innovation, and service innovation. Indian IP laws allowed only process innovation. Indian pharmaceutical companies copied and developed low-cost molecules discovered in Western countries. With a change of IP laws in 2005, product innovation has been allowed. Some of the ventures in India on product and process innovation are as follows. On realization of the significance of nanotechnology in the fields of health, science, and defence, there has been a growing impetus on R&D in nanotechnology in the Indian Institute of Technology, Indian Institute of Science, National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research, and National Instrumentation Organisation. Besides, there are private–public partnerships as given in Table 1.
 There has been evidence of a successful use of nanotechnology in the health sector like development of Nanoxel—indigenously developed nanotechnology-based drug delivery system for cancer treatment in the Indian market by Dabur India, patented technology for gene repair therapy by Virtuous Innovation, a group company of Khandelwal Laboratories, etc. The success of nanotechnology has also been seen in other fields like creation of Nano-shirts under the brand name of Park Avenue by Raymonds, and the successful launch of nanotechnology-based water purifier by IIT Madras, etc. Some of the ICT-based initiatives to ensure inclusive development have been indirection of expanding telemedicine connecting 180 rural centers to 20 super specialty health centers to telehealth care and prevention, including teleconsultation, telediagnosostic, and teletreatment. The project was initiated by the Appolo group of hospitals at 24 clusters covering 50,000 villages around Aragonda village in Andhra Pradesh. Further, there has been introduction of the Max Vijay scheme, an insurance product aimed for the deprived section of society to be sold by non-government organizations (NGOs), microfinance organizations connected IBM-designed wireless hand-held devices, which enable data transfer through GPRS to the back-end system and facilitate on-the-spot issuance of insurance policies. In the education sector, EDUSAT is a satellite connectivity system which is developed and used for teacher training and higher education programs in remote villages by Indira Gandhi National Open University. The National Council of Education and Research Training also hold satellite-based interactive educational programs for teachers all over the country. EducompTM MagiKeys solution is a unique software application that allows millions of government school students to surf the web, email, chat, and write documents in their mother tongue. It supports 11 Indian languages, namely Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Punjabi, Urdu, Telugu, Bengali, and Konkani. Reliance Communication is collaborating with One Laptop per Child Foundation to provide network facility for providing every child with a low-cost, handy, rugged laptop to experience collaboration and a joyful learning experience in 25,000 towns and 600,000 villages in India. MCA21 is a Ministry of Corporate Affairs and Tata Consultancy effort for e-business transaction using a director identification number and digital signature. The state of Gujarat which has won the national award for best e-governed state has the largest optical fiber wire area network of 50,000 km in Asia. All activities of governances like procurement of business, taxation, and public grievance management are carried out mandatorily through the Internet. EnAble India, an organization started by two software engineers works towards an increasing employability of handicapped people by ICT-based training by using software like SAFA, a low-cost screen reader software based on windows, which transforms text on screen into synthetic speech aimed for visually challenged people and also by creating digital audio books and other educational tools in collaboration with other NGOs. It also acts as a link with organizations which can provide employment opportunity for these people, by helping these organizations to create a barrier-free workplace. Lifeline, a project initiated by One World Foundation in collaboration with CISCO and British telecom aims at providing its clients, farmers with requisite information on their queries using telephony and Internet in their mother tongue. Queries made through landlines or mobiles are passed through interactive voice response to a knowledge worker who tries to solve the problem with the help of a database of 30,000 frequently asked questions with answers or else refers it to an expert. For providing white collared employment to various unemployed youths, a project SMSOne was started by a Pune-based entrepreneur under which an unemployed youth builds an SMS community of about 1,000 cell phone users in his area and provides them with news and updates through an SMS newsletter. The service is free of cost for the user, and revenue is generated through advertising. Only one message per week is permitted. The news can be government messages, news, and advertisements of shops of the locality, birthday alerts, and election propaganda of local leaders and politicians. CG-Net and ICT-based forums of journalists created by Shubhranshu Choudhury of Chattisgarh, which aims at ensuring public participation in development, is a web-based discussion forum of ordinary people of local community which feeds in news related to tribal life, culture, farming, Dalit issues, the Naxal movement, education, gender issues, health, mining, employment, etc. In 2008, the vice president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Lalit Modi, partnered with IMG executive Andrew Widblood to initiate the India Premier League, a T-20 version of cricket, in which each match is to be of around 3 h with each competing participant having to face 20 overs each. Teams were auctioned to leading business tycoons and Bollywood celebrities which ensured pumping in huge money. The IPL was expected to generate revenue of nearly US $2 billion over in 2008–2019, including proceeds from TV rights (US $918 million), promotion (US $108 million), and franchises (US $724 million). Players are being offered US $1.55 million for an IPL season of about 5 weeks as against US $50,000 to US $ 1 million for having to play for their national team in a year, depending on how engaging the schedule their respective national teams have. VNL, a start-up company, awarded as Telecom Asia’s Best Green Infrastructure of the year in 2010 (http://www.telecomasia.net/content/ta-reader-choice-awards-2010-winner-list) is the first solar power-driven World GSM mobile service meant for rural areas with low levels of average revenue per user. It has also been named as “Technology Pioneer 2010” by the World Economic Forum. It had to face the challenges of low power services, availability of less number of skilled engineers for installation and maintenance of the GSM system, and poor infrastructure. The model developed requires less than 50 W of power per base station and hence does not require a power grid, nearly zero maintenance; the entire base station can be packed into two carts and can be installed by even unskilled laborers. According to the World Health Organisation Report, the number of doctors per 1,000 population in India is less than one, and there is a requirement of 6,000 doctors, ten lakh nurses, and two lakh. Only 0.5% of Indians have health insurance, and out of pocket spending is about 85%. About 2.4 million Indians require cardiac surgery per year, and only about 60,000 operations are actually carried out. Narayana Hrudayalaya at Bangalore was initiated by Dr. Devi Shetty with the vision of providing the highest quality health care services to patients with heart problems at the lowest cost. It planned to achieve high volumes of OHS and catheterization operations per day which brought down the unit cost of surgery. Also, high-cost machines are rented instead of purchased to bring down the cost further. Suppliers are hired under short-term contracts and low-cost dual medicines like cardio-diabetic medicines of Bicon for bringing down costs of medication. It has initiated India’s largest telemedicine and network and also has provision of mobile cardiac care. Dr. Shetty is also credited to have started the most successful microinsurance project in India called Yashwashini targeted for farmers of Karnataka for Rs 5 (US $0.11) a month; cardholders had access to free treatment at 150 hospitals in 29 districts of the state for any medical procedure costing up to Rs 100,000. It is now working to extend its clinical expertise to cancer with the launch of Biocon, a 1,400-bed facility providing treatment for head-and-neck, breast, and cervical cancers. An artificial limb invented by an Indian temple sculptor, Ram Chandra in the 1960s, is now being made out of lightweight polyurethane with the intervention of the Indian Space Research Organisation which brings down the cost to US $27, and the foot can be bended to perform different postures like squatting which are commonly done by the Indian population. The people’s car was introduced by Tata Motors in January, 2008 at a price rate of a minimum of Rs 100,000 which is stylish, fuel efficient, comfortable, and safe—targeted for families who travel by bikes/scooters as they cannot afford to buy cars. Medical tourism in India as found by Brotman [2] is either outbound, inbound, or intrabound. Hospitals catering to both inbound and intrabound medical tours have shown significant profits with India’s growing economy. Tourists from the USA prefer to go to developing nations for medical tours as there are many forms of surgery such as cosmetic surgery, dental reconstruction, gender reassignments, etc. Similarly, in Britain and some other European countries where health care is controlled by the government health care system, long queuing for requisite operations may lead citizens to foreign lands [14]. People also come here from certain countries for certain operations like bone marrow transplant, joint replacement, and stem cell treatment for cancer which otherwise are not performed in their countries. Also, medical treatments in India are considerably lower. A heart valve replacement surgery would cost [30] patients US $10,000 in Thailand, US $12,500 in Singapore, US $200,000 in the US, and US $90,000 in Britain and only US $8,000 in India. While a bone marrow transplant would cost US $30,000 in India, doctors in the USA would charge anywhere between US $250,000–400,000 while those in the UK would charge US $150,000. A cosmetic surgery would cost US $3,500 in Thailand, US $20,000 in the US, and US $10,000 in Britain and will cost only US $2,000 in India. According to the American Medical Association data, a spinal fusion would cost US $62,000 in the USA, US $5,500 in India, US $7,000 in Thailand, and US $9,000 in Singapore. Medical tourism in India is growing at the rate of 30%. It is expected to reach US $2 billion by 2012. Escorts, Apollo Group of Hospitals, Hinduja and Jaslok are some of the major plyers in Medical tourism. Indian medical treatments include alternative treatments like ayurveda, yoga, unani, sidha, and homeopathy treatments. There should be insurance policy, travel support, and online information on the types of treatment availability and hospitality, and there should be clean and hygienic conditions in hospitals. Lack of Innovation Culture As Welzel Iglehart cultural map puts India along with other developing nations at a position of higher survival values and low in self-actualization value, Hofstede’s [13] scores also indicate that India has a low to moderate uncertainty avoidance, high power distance, low masculinity, and low individualism. Although it is only indicative, it reveals that Indians are probably risk averse, hesitant to make important decisions in work-related matters, and probably lack initiative. Mashelkar [19], in his speech, says that there are several ideas by Indians which have been converted into successful patented products by Japanese after research papers written by Indians related to the same were published. The educational system have long been “encouraging rotting” rather than experimentally learning in the form of problem solving, design, experimentation, etc. in the education curriculum. Evaluation requires encouragement in subjective responses rather than objective answers. Competency-based customized career plan and curriculum is required to be designed for each child. Lack of Innovation Ecology According to the National Knowledge Commission survey, the most important barriers to innovation as perceived by both large firms and SMEs, is skill shortages due to the lack of emphasis on industrial innovation, effective collaboration for research between universities and R&D institutions, excessive government regulation as well as insufficient pricing power to derive value from innovations. Further, it has been found that out of the graduates passing out of professional institutes [20] only 25% of engineers, 15% of finance and accountancy professionals, and 10% of graduates with Indian degrees are employable by multinational companies. Fifty-four percent of the Universities under University Grant Commission are giving education in the general discipline (Table 2). The data shows that, clearly, majority of the students in higher education institutes are educated in the general streams which necessarily implies that there are few institutes providing education in the technological and medical fields (Table 2). Further, the number of researchers in India has increased by only 20% from 1991 to 2001 as compared to China where the comparative increase was about 80% (Knowledge Commission Report). To develop quality researchers, India should promote a university–industry link in running PhD programs, for example, Reliance Life Sciences has developed a model under which they facilitate employees getting admission for a PhD degree from Mumbai University. BITS Pilani, similarly, has a PhD program for working executives (http://www.knowledgecommission.gov.in/downloads/documents/moreQualityPhD.pdf). A report on 1,473 NAAC accredited colleges between 2002 and 2004 shows that there are, overall, only 25.6% PhD teachers. Indian universities need to have good academicians with a PhD degree. According to Furqan Qamar and S. Sinha [27], there are 57% of teachers in higher education who are without an MPhil and a PhD degree. With various universities not being able to fill up the posts under various reservation categories, universities are recruiting ad hoc and guest faculty. To emphasize individual and industrial innovation, NKC suggested to allow licensing and royalty arrangement in which the inventors as well as research institute would have a share. To promote research, several government programs have been initiated like New Millennium Indian Technology Leadership (NMITL), Techno-Entrepreneurs Promotion Program, and Technology Development Board. To provide for need of a talent pool, eight IITs and three ISAERs are being opened. NMITL has so far evolved 57 largely networked projects in diverse areas viz. agriculture and plant biotechnology, general biotechnology, bioinformatics, drugs and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, materials, information and communication technology, and energy, involving 80 industry partners and 270 research groups. Lack of Venture Capital There is a general lack of venture capital for start-ups who want to experiment with new ideas. The investment by venture capitalists has been in the late stage as can be seen from the Table 3. To facilitate commercialization at the early stage innovation, several incubation centers are being obtained all over the country like the ICICI Knowledge Park in Hyderabad; International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics; Centre for Innovation, Incubation and Entrepreneurship at IIM Ahmadabad; National Institute of Technology at Calicut, Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at IIT Mumbai; Vellore Institute of Technology. Some of the government initiatives taken are writing off research and capital expenditure in companies having in-house R&D centers, a 10-year tax holiday to R&D companies approved by DSIR, no import duty charged on import for equipment by public R&D institute, and 125% tax deduction on donation to research institutes carrying out social and statistical research. Corruption in the System Most studies validate the fact that either democracy or autocracy does not considerably enable to combat corruptions. Corruption can only be prevented by greater accountability. In his keynote address at the Indian Independence day Celebration of 2005 conducted by a non-government organization Nandini—Voice for the Deprived at Chennai, Mr. N. Vittal,Footnote 1 former central vigilance commissioner said, “there are five basic reasons for corruption in India. (i) scarcity of goods and services; (ii) red tape and complicated rules and procedures; (iii) lack of transparency in decision-making; (iv) legal cushions of safety for the corrupt under the ‘healthy’ principle that everyone is innocent till proved guilty; and (v) tribalism among the corrupt who protect each other.” The report of the Civil Services Examination Review Committee (October 2001), which was set up by the UPSC made the following observations: “It is very crucial to understand what happens to the values and integrity, motivation and other qualities assessed at the time of recruitment after 10 years and 20 years of service. It is said that initially many of the officers have positive values, but they change during the course of service. When they appear before the UPSC interview boards, most of the candidates are idealistic, bright, committed and sincere. However, once they join the service, within a period of time they seem to become cynical, negative and possibly even corrupt. Even the most outstanding officers feel frustrated after their idealism has been dimmed by the systemic realities. Some of them succumb to pressures easily. Therefore, a deeper insight into the systemic mechanism is required to ascertain the causes affecting this change and take remedial action.” Corruption in the society has resulted in failure of several social development initiatives, like Public Distribution System and the Mid-Day Meal Scheme. In a survey undertaken by Transparency International and a Delhi-based center for media studies, the value of corruption under PDS is whooping to Rs 375 crore per year. Kumar [16], in his extensive study of corruption in India, has indicated that implementation of The Prevention of Corruption Act [26] has been a failure in India. He was of the view that the right to uncorrupted service should be made a fundamental right, and the right for jurisdiction against violation of this right should also be a fundamental right. Corruption can be thought of as a violation of human rights as it has been established that only 17% of the fund allocated by the government for poverty reduction actually reaches to the needy [29] which is a great impediment to innovation for inclusive development. Citizens should be made aware of their rights and be made knowledgeable about government provisions which are meant for their development. The Majdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan, an NGO, had initiated an awareness campaign and holds the government accountable for any corruption or mismanagement of developmental funds in many parts of the country.",6

N. Wickramasinghe,Nobaya Ahmad,Zahid Emby,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"Levels of technological innovations and factors that influence it have become the key determinants of the success of knowledge economy [33]. With the emergence of Western knowledge economies, the importance of the local innovation systems has rapidly increased, even in the developing world [31]. However, so far, the readiness of developing countries to become the knowledge economies has been mainly measured based on the organizational and explicit objective measures, which have been developed or modified based on the measures developed by the industrial nations [48]. Hence, the locality and unique attributes of local invention systems in developing countries have significantly been overlooked in the discussions of readiness of these countries to be knowledge economies. Owing to this trend, the role of independent inventors in developing countries has been ignored and organizational innovations have been recognized as the driving force in knowledge creation even in the developing countries. Even though the inventors’ objective success measures such as number of patents, patent citations, commercialized patents, and profit earned are rapidly becoming the universal indicators of success, there are complex social and psychological incentives within the inventors that cannot be directly explained by universal objective measures. Continuous involvement of independent inventors in technological inventions in unfavorable conditions is such a phenomenon that cannot be explained by pure objective measures. As far as the invention is a part of human creativity, to interpret this phenomenon, independent inventors need to be understood by their unique psychological characteristics and environment of the specific locality. Providing new avenue to fulfill this need, subjective well-being, the subjective feelings of general happiness and satisfaction with life, have emerged as key aspect of human capital that influences the development of nations [32]. A study conducted by Anchor [1] found that subjective happiness has influenced the work performance of the employees in multinational innovative companies [1]. However, so far, there was no attempt made to understand how the psychological facets such as subjective happiness and satisfaction of independent inventors are determined and how it influences their inventive success in developing countries.",1
2.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,11 October 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-011-0063-6,"Organisational Learning, Supportive Innovation Systems and Implications for Policy Formulation",December 2011,Arne Isaksen,James Karlsen,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Innovation mode has become a key concept in innovation studies, economic geography and related subjects in order to underline the differentiated nature of firms' learning and innovation processes [1, 15, 17, 26]. Innovation modes denote main ways for firms to organise and carry out innovation and learning processes. The concept focuses in particular on the key, necessary competence for firms' innovation activities and how this competence is being created. We distinguish between three main innovation modes. Firms often combine several innovation modes as firms, for example use different types of knowledge in specific phases of their product development activities [25]. Even so, most firms may be characterised by one dominant innovation mode. We should however keep in mind that innovation modes are theoretical categories that highlight typical ways of carrying out learning and innovation processes in firms, which are not always found in these pure forms in real firms. The three innovation modes are, however, useful analytical concepts in studies of firms' innovation activities. A first innovation mode is the science-based Science, Technology, Innovation (STI) mode. Innovations, and first of all new products, are developed through research and development. STI firms have dedicated R&D units, or include small, research intensive spin-off firms from, for example, universities. The firms are typically engaged in product and technology fields where research activities are necessary to be competitive. The STI mode summarises in many ways the traditional idea of how innovation occur through a linear model [11]. The model conceptualises the innovation process as departing from ideas originating from firms' R&D activities and then going through stages of development, construction of prototypes, testing, industrialisation, production and marketing. It is characterised by technology push, and represents largely an elitist model in which innovation activities are reserved for the science-based and research-intensive firms. The Doing, Using, Interacting (DUI) mode was developed to counterbalance the STI model, exactly to demonstrate that there are other ways to be innovative than the science-based one. The DUI model is also seen to illustrate how innovation activities occur in the larger part of small- and medium-sized firms. The DUI mode is seen as essential in industries where firms do not build their innovation activities mainly on research-based knowledge, but rather on competence acquired through experience-based learning from working long time with specific activities. These firms create new solutions in their ‘daily work’ in order to solve practical problems in their own production or to adapt solutions to specific requests by customers. Solutions are mainly found through trial and error, through building on existing knowledge and experiences, but without necessarily knowing how new solutions do function. To really be efficient, the DUI mode requires learning organisations, characterised by decentralised responsibility, team work, employees' circulation between tasks and firms' investment in employee training [18]. Such organisations in many ways resemble what Gustavsen (in this issue) denotes as ‘good work’ which is a specific characteristic of Nordic work life. Leaning organisations stimulate on-the-job learning, and helps employees at many levels to solve upcoming problems and to propose improvements in products, services and production processes ([6]: 369). Lorenz (in this issue) demonstrates that learning organisations are particularly innovative. The DUI mode nevertheless has some problems with regard to more radical innovation activities. The DUI mode typically consists of customer-driven innovation in which customers' request are often solved ad hoc by the use of much tacit, experience-based competence. Firms then risk starting almost from scratch in every new customer project, if the firms' core knowledge remains tacit and less systematic. Several studies point to the fact that firms combining the DUI and the STI innovation mode are generally more innovative than firms focusing on one of the modes. Jensen et al. ([17], p. 685) thus concluded that ‘firm that combines a strong version of the STI mode with a strong version of the DUI mode (…)’ excels in product innovation, while Laursen and Salter ([19], p. 131) find that ‘firms (…) who search widely and deeply tend to be more innovative’. Isaksen and Karlsen [15] have conceptualised and described a third innovation mode, denoted as Complex and Combined Innovation (CCI) that exactly combines elements from the two other modes. This occurs, for example, through the development and/or absorption of science-based knowledge and then its diffusion, transformation and/or redevelopment by a wide range of workers and managers in organisations [26]. A key aspect of the CCI mode regards responding to a weak part of the DUI mode as CCI firms systematise their core competence by the development of technology platforms. The CCI innovation mode can be illustrated by an example from the firm Kongsberg Automotive (KA), located at Raufoss in south-east Norway. KA produces some tens of millions of couplings for brakes in trucks each year [15]. The firm has over the last 10 years or so changed its technological platform from brass to composite. As typical in the CCI mode, the development of a new type of couplings made in composite has involved the linking of many types of competence, both at new employees in KA with competence in composite and experienced production workers with regard to developing the production process. KA also used the competence at R&D institutes in material technology, a specialised firm and a machine-building company, and Volvo as a pilot customer. This process then links customer-driven innovation and technology push in the development of composite as a new technological platform in KA. The CCI mode is characterised by system integration which denotes the linking of specialised, explicit and tacit knowledge across functional boundaries [23]. The integration of different types of knowledge and skill is complicated as it requires several types of specialised competence in firms, not least that firms are able to put scientific knowledge to practical use. The complexity of system integration is illustrated by the fact that it is often difficult to achieve outside particular industrial districts ([5], p. 102) owing to the importance of gained experience and tacit knowledge which make geographical proximity critical in knowledge exchange. Malecki [23] thus maintains that multinational corporations largely keep system integration activities at their home base. System integration is typically not moved to new locations in China and India, and is at all difficult to achieve in China and India because these countries (for the time being) have few advanced manufacturing milieus. Thus, Malecki [23] concludes that China and India do not represent any real threat to western countries when it comes to advanced innovation activities building on system integration. These ideas are to a large extent supported by the analyses in the articles of Gustavsen and Lorenz in this issue which point to the relative importance of ‘good work’ and learning organisations in the high-performing Nordic countries. These countries may have some advantages when it comes to the linking of different types of competence, due to a generally well-educated labour force, flat organisations and to some extent effective cooperation between academia and industry, amongst others.",14
2.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,27 October 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-011-0064-5,The Nordic Model of Work Organization,December 2011,Bjørn Gustavsen,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"According to Gallie [20], there is a high degree of agreement concerning “the good work”. From the Marxist left to the neo-liberal right, variety, learning, freedom to take initiatives, participation in decisions concerning the job, and the possibility of developing social contacts, are generally held forth. Disagreements do not pertain so much to the nature of the good work as to how it should be brought about. What forces and actors are needed to create the good work? The answers given over the years are many, ranging from management education to revolution. It is within this context that a specific “Nordic model” has appeared [6]. This model can be described in different ways, but its core element is a co-operation between organized labor market parties, and between these parties on the one hand and the state/the public on the other. It is often assumed that the good work emerges as a direct consequence of this co-operation (i.e., [35]). The argument is that co-operation on the central level will diffuse to the local level and promote co-operation and mutual trust between management and employees in the workplaces. However, even though the Nordic countries (here taken to refer to Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden) show a wider diffusion of the good work than the rest of Europe [19], the Nordic countries also show a broad set of measures to promote the good work. If the good work appeared as an automatic consequence of central co-operation in working life, there would be little need for special agreements on workplace development, programs to promote new forms of work organization, and similar. Although no exact comparative data are available on this point, it is fairly certain that there are more such initiatives in the Nordic countries than in Europe in general [1, 23]. At best, there is a relationship between “the Nordic model”, the emergence of initiatives to promote the good work and the emergence of the good work itself. “The Nordic model” appeared during the first decades of the previous century; of particular importance was the development that occurred in the 1930s when the social democrats came into government. The good work as defined above was, however, not an issue at this time. Although unequivocal comparative data on the level of nations is lacking also on this point, i.e. Johansson [30] assumes that the introduction of rationalization through Taylorism took, in the period 1930–1970, place in a more intensive way in Sweden than in perhaps any other European country. It took more than three decades before the emergent tripartite co-operation inherent in the Nordic model started to generate non-Taylorist forms of work organization. Similar pertains to the other Nordic countries, although none of them had as intensive an application of Taylorism as Sweden. To Denmark and Norway, Taylorism largely came after the end of World War II, as part of the conditions associated with the Marshal Aid program. We need, in other words, not only to explain the emergence of specific initiatives to promote the good work, we also need to clarify when and how the turn from intensive Taylorism to other forms of work organization took place and why it took place. The purpose of this contribution is, first, to trace the roots of the idea of “the good work” in a Nordic context; second, to look at how the various initiatives to promote the good work have been shaped and carried through and, third, to see to what learning they have given rise concerning how to create “the good work”.",24

The early work on regional innovative systems [4, 8, 9] drew inspiration from seminal contributions to the research on national innovation systems, in particular work by Freeman [12] and Lundvall [17]. A central idea was that of two subsystems engaged in processes of interactive learning, one composed of private enterprises, often tightly clustered, and the other composed of the regional supportive infrastructure, composed of a variety of organisations responsible for processes of knowledge generation and transmission, including public research institutions, universities and vocational training providers. A central issue addressed in this literature has been the relation between geographic distance and knowledge transmission. One strand of literature has focused on the role of knowledge spillovers in the performance of high technology sectors. It has provided evidence that the formal R&D activities of private sector enterprises benefit from their location in regions that are well endowed with university research or other public sector research institutions. Proximity favours the transfer scientific and technical knowledge both though the recruitment of university-trained scientists and through formal R&D collaboration [1, 14, 16] At the same time, there has been an appreciation that the knowledge upon which the innovative performance of regionally clustered enterprises depends is not solely the result of formal R&D activity, but also the result of informal processes of learning by doing and learning by interacting [15, 18, 19, 27]. This emphasis on informal experience-based learning in turn has generated an interest in the regional foundations for the development of ‘learning organizations’, with a focus on the way the regional institutional structure can support processes of interactive learning within the firm ([5, 6, 7, 22]). This paper contributes to this research agenda by drawing on survey data in order investigate the links between styles of employee learning, the innovative performance of enterprises and the characteristics of regional education and training systems. One of the central contributions of the paper is to develop a measure of creative employee learning on the job and to compare differences in its frequency across a sample of 81 regions in 18 European nations. Using this measure, a multi-level regression analysis is undertaken in order to explore the relation between differences in the development of regional education and training systems and the characteristics of employee learning on the job. The analysis addresses the issue of how differences in the level of development of the region’s tertiary education system, and differences in the provision of various forms of formal and informal lifelong learning, impact on the development of creative forms of learning at work at the regional level. By exploring the links between regional context conditions and individual-level characteristics and behaviour, the paper addresses important policy issues, such as whether robust systems of further education and lifelong learning can compensate for relatively low levels of initial formal education in promoting dynamic learning at the workplace. The paper builds on a methodology for addressing these issues at the national level, as developed in a series of co-authored papers. In Lorenz and Valeyre [20] the basic methodology for developing a taxonomy of forms of work organisation and employee learning for the EU-15 is developed. Arundel et al. [3] build on this analysis and present evidence for the EU-15 showing that in nations where work is organised to support high levels of discretion in solving complex problems firms tend to be more active in terms of innovations developed, at least to some degree, through their creative in-house efforts. In countries where learning and problem solving on the job are more constrained, and little discretion is left to the employee, firms tend to engage in a supplier-dominated innovation strategy. Their technological renewal depends more on the absorption of innovations developed elsewhere. In Holm et al. [13] the framework is extended through the use of multi-level regression analysis to explore the relation between forms of work organisation and institutional context for the EU-27 and Norway. The results point to systemic relations between differences in labour market mobility and regulation on the one hand, and the adoption of different forms work organisation on the other. National systems combing high levels of labour market mobility with high levels of expenditure on both unemployment protection and active labour market policies designed to move the unemployed into employment are associated with the adoption of forms of work organisation characterised by high levels of autonomy and learning on the job. This paper builds on the approach developed in these papers in order to explore the relation between employee learning, innovation performance and systems of education and training at the regional level using the regional breakdown of data according to the European Union’s NUTS nomenclature available in Fourth European Survey on Working Conditions (EWCS) carried out in 2005. The paper is structured in the following way. Section Measuring Employee Learning Dynamics describes the employee-level measures derived from the results of the 2005 EWCS that are used to characterise different forms of employee learning at the regional level, and presents differences across nations and regions. Certain limitations of the employee-level data entail limiting the analysis to 81 regions in 18 European nations. Section Links Between Employee Learning and Innovation examines the relation between the frequency of the different forms of learning and measures of enterprise innovative performance at both the national and regional levels. Section A Multi-Level Analysis of Employee Learning and Regional Education and Training Systems presents the results of a multi-level regression analysis used to explore the impact of the development of the regional education and training system on the likelihood of the different forms of learning. Section Conclusion concludes by drawing out some of the policy implications.",9
2.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,20 October 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-011-0065-4,Industrial Innovation Collaboration in a Capital Region Context,December 2011,Sverre Herstad,Øyvind Pålshaugen,Bernd Ebersberger,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The competitiveness of regions in a globalizing economy rests on their ability to continuously develop, accumulate, and exploit specialized knowledge assets. At present, the process of globalization appears to favor those regions which develop information processing and knowledge diffusion infrastructures [135] which are able to link a set of technologically related [55] and globally networked actors [62, 66] and industries [102]. Urban regions are generally portrayed as such centers of innovation [84, 136]. They can be interpreted as venues for new firm formation in science-based sectors (through spillovers from academic research, see, e.g., Ref. [38]), in creative industries (driven by the ability of cities to attract individual talent and develop vibrant labor markets for such, see, e.g., Refs. [24, 54, 128]), and in business services (following from dense interaction with advanced headquarter functions located in the region, e.g., Refs. [11, 106, 107]). The industrial structure of the Norwegian capital region aligns well with this picture of the urban economy: it is specialized in wholesale trade, logistics, knowledge intensive services, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals while traditional manufacturing industries are under-represented (Table 1). Urban economy dynamics are thoroughly discussed in the literature (see, e.g., Refs. [58, 129, 135, 145]) and the characteristics of such regions have been described empirically (see, e.g., Ref. [124]). Yet, the extent to and mechanisms by which they condition innovation behavior at the individual firm level remains empirically unexplored. As a result, no common agreement has been reached among researchers about internal dynamics of cities and their role in larger national innovation systems [84, 85]. The main research question in this paper is therefore whether or not contextual conditions specific to the Norwegian capital region determine firm level innovation behavior within it. We estimate region location effects on (1) the likelihood of innovation activity, on (2) the likelihood of innovation collaboration at various spatial scales, and on (3) the likelihood of innovation collaboration along various functional dimensions. Although capital regions share many defining characteristics with urban economies more generally, they merit special attention. This is because higher-order administrative functions, knowledge institutions, and specialized business services tend to concentrate in them, and migration flows tend to converge towards them. In 2005, the capital region of Norway contained nearly a quarter of all innovation-active private sector firms with more than five employees and almost a third of those firms which maintained international innovation collaboration within corporate group networks (see Table 1). In the same year, this industrial base accounted for as much as 42% of domestic private sector research and development (R&D). In 2009, 15% of all registered migration events in Norway involved inflow into the capital region from other regions. Furthermore, the capital served as the target region for 33% of all labor mobility inflows from abroad. This adds to the 10% of migration events occurring intra-regional, making it by far the most important migration target and thus mobility induced knowledge inflow region (see Table 2). The capital also houses two public university colleges, numerous private higher education institutions and research institutes; the largest university and the dominant university hospital; around which an advanced infrastructure for commercialization of university research has been built [23]. This concentration of human resources and knowledge institutions [135] makes it the most important research and higher education region in Norway [124]. In order to understand the impact a region has on firm level innovation behavior, we need to identify the main dimensions of this behavior. According to resource-based theories, “what firms do” [94] is absorption, assimilation and transformation of knowledge from different areas [93], the results of which accumulate as knowledge assets specific to the individual firm [45, 150]. This involves processes which can be characterized along five dimensions: 
First, internal knowledge development activities, ranging from systematic R&D to informal processes of “doing, using, interacting” [18], are critical not only for cumulative knowledge asset refinement [21, 93], but also for the ability of the firm to effectively exploit inputs from outside [35, 36, 122, 153]. Second, the stock of specialized knowledge held by the firm is augmented by the inflow of workers with complementary competences [22, 113] and networks [2]. Internal R&D and inflow of competences through the labor market generate the organizational core upon which the firm builds its bundles of externally oriented innovation activities. New market and technology opportunities available externally have to be identified by the firm itself. This is commonly referred to as a process of innovation search [3, 53, 73, 90]. It represents the third dimension of industrial innovation behavior. Studies have found the impact of innovation search on subsequent technological evolution to be contingent on extending beyond organizational [133] and sector boundaries [89], and on targeting knowledge domains which are characterized by a lack of shared experiences with the searching firm [74, 111]. Search processes may include the intentional use of information sources such as publications, databases, and collaboration partners. Yet, they often draw heavily on information spillovers diffusing through layers of personal ties [2, 44] within business communities [116], or in the local environment surrounding the firm [4]. Thus, firm level search will often draw on the information “buzz” of the surrounding regional economy. Search does not in itself transfer knowledge or technology. Consequently, solving the search problem opens up the issue of knowledge transfer. According to the recent literature on “open innovation” [30, 31], firms may under certain circumstances source not only component knowledge or technology but full-fledged solutions from other actors [146]. Knowledge may also be sourced as embodied in various form of software and hardware [76] or as contract R&D services [52, 71, 134]. The processes of innovation sourcing are the fourth behavioral dimension of industrial innovation. Sourcing processes have in common that they are market-based, and rest on a high degree of modularity. Due to the tacit and organizationally “sticky” [10, 149] nature of knowledge, and due to the complexity and uncertainty involved in much industrial development work, firms will often encounter situations in which external knowledge resources cannot be accessed and coordinated by means of labor inflow or different sourcing arrangements [82]. In these cases, firms holding knowledge assets are forced to engage in direct, two-way collaborative interaction. Such innovation collaboration is the fifth activity dimension. Collaboration comes with specific organizational challenges and requirements. In order to ensure understanding, assimilation and transformation of partners’ competences, the focal firm must be endowed with competences complementary to those of the collaboration partner [122]. The focal firm must also be able to allocate necessary human resources [98] and management attention [123] to the joint project in order to ensure beneficial knowledge exchange. Collaboration furthermore entails the exposure of the firm’s own knowledge, which might result in losing control over proprietary knowledge. As a consequence, collaboration requires mutual trust [103, 108, 110] and compatible objectives [138]. Collaborative linkages are therefore necessarily selective and prone to inertia due to the transaction costs and the uncertainties involved in changing existing configurations [6, 120]. Hence, they can be expected to form primarily when involved actors recognize that a potential cannot be harnessed by activities along either one of the other four main dimensions. Let us now introduce the larger regional context, and consider how it is shaped by the activities of individual firms within it. The mirror image of labor mobility inflow is labor mobility outflow, through which informal “broadcasting” [139] networks are created between firms. These networks play a crucial role in the diffusion of knowledge assets [14, 63, 69, 70, 78, 87, 113, 131]. These processes are subject to strong distance decay effects [9, 25, 117, 148]. As a result, regions develop along different industrial development paths. The rapid growth of urban economies has been interpreted as particularly strong empirical manifestations of these network impacts on structural change and growth [20, 64, 78, 88, 96, 130, 147]. The composition of the industrial structure determines mobility patterns, the richness of local information “buzz” and the content of diffused knowledge [16, 49, 55]. Localization economies arise from a high degree of regional specialization, the formation of a thick and highly specialized labor market, a common supplier infrastructure, and a common research infrastructure upon which technologically similar firms may draw. Cognitive proximity, that is the similarity of knowledge underlying industrial activities, combined with co-localization foster trust conducive to voluntary information sharing and collaboration. It also enables knowledge diffusion and knowledge absorption with limited search costs and cognitive friction. However, homogeneity substantially reduces the likelihood that knowledge enters into combinations which are truly novel. It also increases the likelihood of competition between local actors [16]. It is therefore increasingly argued that the diversity of urbanization economies [86] is more conducive to innovation-based growth. This is because it facilitates more radical innovation by way of providing contextual conditions conducive to the diffusion of different knowledge assets and technologies across firms and sectors [55, 121]. Research on regional development and regional innovation systems has traditionally put a very strong emphasis on knowledge diffusion by means of direct collaborative linkages [59, 78], as they have the capacity to transfer valuable tacit components [40, 142, 143, 149]. The importance of collaborative relationships has been stressed by, e.g., new growth theory [96, 131] and by different innovation system approaches [48, 110]. Others question the importance of local collaboration as an enabler of interactive learning and growth. They argue that density of such linkages is neither necessary for knowledge to diffuse and recombine at the local level [1, 59] nor is it commonly occurring [114]. The last conceptual issue is therefore whether or not urbanization economies stimulate such innovation collaboration at various spatial scales. A recent study of Norwegian regions using descriptive statistics found no substantial differences in innovation activity [85]. The earlier study by Fritsch [58] is noteworthy, because it is one of few attempts made at addressing this issue econometrically and thus account for firm level structural characteristics known to influence collaboration. It found that urban regions are not associated with stronger collaboration propensities. Consistent with this, the later Teirlinck and Spithoven [144] found firms in rural areas to be more “open” in their innovation processes than firms in urban regions. When studied empirically, the direct interaction between headquarter functions and KIBS has come out as far less contingent on proximity than assumed in theoretical work on the headquarter-business services complex in the urban economy [5]. As other relationships which can be governed contractually [1, 79, 140], these are rather found to show decreasing dependence on proximity with increasing strategic importance to the client firm (ibid). Last, internal (to the corporate network) and external (to territorial system) linkages may compete for firm resources and attention [19]. The process of “corporatization” of the urban economy through multinational enterprise (MNE) activity may be forcing attention away from local linkages, including those towards the surrounding KIBS complex [47, 60, 80, 127, 137]. The link between urban region location and behavior at the firm level is thus not immediately clear [65, 97]. This may partly reflect the fact that firms operating in a dynamic labor market context may experience appropriability problems [63] directly attributable to this context [37]. This may reduce their willingness to invest in new knowledge development and their propensity to engage in collaboration [47]. This s reinforced by the availability of competences in the external labor market, and by the dense “local buzz” within personal networks created through inter-firm mobility and frequent face-to-face contact [139]. The diversity of the capital region economy may also reduce the likelihood that partners are identified, even though they are present [145]. Collaboration requires mutual trust [103, 108, 110] and a sense of common, long-term objectives. The institutionalization of such “conventional–relational assets” [138] may be constrained by the diversity and velocity of the capital region economy. These factors combined lead to hypothesis 1: Local innovation collaboration: firms in the capital region are less likely to engage in local innovation collaboration than are firms located in other Norwegian regions. In contrast to intra-regional labor market mobility and information buzz, collaborative knowledge development can be organized contractually and span geographical distances [1, 141]. Extra-regional collaborative linkages may therefore provide knowledge, competences and expertise which compensate for intra-regional supply side limitations. These supply side limitations will be more pressing in regions where the industrial structures is less diverse than in the capital, and in regions which are not favored by knowledge inflow through migration (cf. Table 2). Hence, locations outside the capital region may therefore be associated with a higher propensity to establish collaborative linkages with actors elsewhere within the domestic economy. This leads to our second hypothesis: Domestic innovation collaboration outside the own region: firms in the capital region are less likely to establish collaborative linkages with actors elsewhere in Norway than are firms located in other Norwegian regions. Firms are increasingly embedded in globally distributed production and innovation networks [34, 79], by means of which they access information and competences located abroad [67, 125, 140]. For this, neither local buzz nor domestic collaboration are functional substitutes [120]. Such international linkages increase the exposure of internationalized regions to global information and knowledge spillovers [62, 66, 102, 125, 135]. This potentially creates a distinct “local buzz—global pipelines” dynamic of industrial development [15, 83]. MNE affiliation and international market orientation increase the likelihood that firms collaborate internationally [8, 47]. Headquarter functions concentrate in capital regions [11, 12, 106] and serve as gravitation points for the vast flows of information and knowledge contained within multinational corporate networks [72]. Short paths lengths to information gravitation points within the corporate network, namely strategic functions with a coordinating role [17], increase the information exposure of individual units, and contribute to the formation of personal networks which link people in different parts of the MNE [47]. This broadening of the international search space is strengthened by the role of the capital region as a domestic hub for international migration flows. Taken together, these arguments suggest that firms in the capital region are more densely embedded in global innovation networks than firms in other regions: International innovation collaboration: firms in the capital region are more likely to establish collaborative linkages with actors abroad, than are firms located in other Norwegian regions.",13

The conditions for interactive innovation, however, vary by location as firms are faced with particular settings in different types of regional innovation systems (RIS) [5, 6] such as metropolitan, industrial, and less urbanized regions as it has been pointed out by Tödtling and Trippl [18]. In metropolitan regions, firms usually find superior prerequisites for innovation such as a highly qualified labor force, a high density of universities and knowledge organizations, knowledge intensive services as well as a well-developed transport and ICT infrastructure [16, 19]. Such a setting of “institutional thickness” [1] provides for companies many opportunities to source knowledge locally and internationally and to engage in knowledge linkages with a variety of actors. Still, we may find a lack of knowledge interactions in such regions and, thus, problems of fragmentation within the RIS [18]. Firms in less urbanized regions face worse preconditions for innovation and knowledge sourcing compared to metropolitan regions [18]. There are fewer and less specialized knowledge generating organizations and schools as well as a lower density of firms. Companies, therefore, may need to reach out for relationships at higher spatial levels to compensate for lacking local opportunities. Industrial regions are usually in-between the two other types. The RIS is “thicker” than in rural settings but less diversified than in metropolitan regions. Firms and knowledge organizations are often focused on one or few sectors, resulting in a rather specialized institutional landscape. The preconditions for innovation in the respective regions are not fixed but can be influenced, e.g., by policy as several examples of regions like Baden Württemberg, Tampere, Wales, Catalonia, and others have shown (see, e.g., [6]). In fact, innovation-oriented policy interventions have gained an increasing acceptance. In the past years, policy actors have often used standard approaches such as focusing on “high-tech” industries, attracting R&D intensive international companies or stimulating university spinoffs. However, as we have argued in Tödtling and Trippl [18], regions differ widely in their industrial composition, innovation conditions, and the level of networking. This calls for a fine-tuning of regional innovation policies. Three broad dimensions are of crucial importance in this context and have to be taken into account: first, the institutional and policy setup of the respective RIS such as the size and scope of universities and other research organizations, technology transfer organizations, innovation funding organizations, and their strategies; second, the business subsystem and its sectors and knowledge bases; and third, the way how companies innovate and the knowledge bases and knowledge sources they are using. In this paper, we investigate innovation activities and knowledge sourcing patterns of firms belonging to the ICT sector as well as innovation policy initiatives in three different regions of Austria—Vienna, Salzburg, and Upper Austria—representing different types of RIS. Vienna is a metropolitan region with good innovation conditions and a “thick” RIS, but with certain characteristics of fragmentation as some former studies have shown. Salzburg stands for a “thin” RIS with a low density of knowledge organizations and firms. Upper Austria represents an industrial region with strong focus on traditional industry sectors, but also a well-developed ICT sector. In Upper Austria, furthermore, we find very active innovation and networking policy programs making it a prime example of a “networked” RIS. Based on interviews with firms and policy actors in all three regions, we will investigate the following research questions: How do RIS characteristics and innovation conditions for ICT firms vary for the three regions? How do firms’ innovation activities and knowledge sources differ between the types of RIS? To which extent do policies take such differences in innovation conditions, processes, and knowledge bases into account? The following, “Theoretical Concepts” section introduces the theoretical concepts and reviews the existing literature. “Methodology” section lays out the methodology. “Innovation Patterns and Policies in the Three Types of Regions” section, then, investigates the institutional setup, the patterns of innovation and of knowledge sourcing, as well as the policy initiatives for each of our three regions. In “Comparing the Cases” section, we describe our findings and in “Conclusions: Relating Policies to Concepts” section, we summarize the key results and draw conclusions.",1

This paper explores those facets and attempts to open the black box to see how regional agents—not just policymakers, but others as well—learn in the policy process. The starting point is the concept of constructing regional advantage ((CRA); [2, 13]) focusing on the idea that regional advantage can be deliberately constructed. As such, in the future, it will not be practical to assume that competitive advantage can be created by simply having the relevant actors in place. On the contrary, it will need to be consciously and proactively constructed. This implies a new, more dynamic role for the public sector in general, and for government and governance in particular in terms of interaction with the private sector. From the CRA perspective, regional development must be regarded as an evolutionary process; i.e., as being based on path-dependent technological progressions [7–10]. There are no valid recipes available for policymakers to use in any region, achieving the right combination of policies depends on the historical progression of the given region. The evolutionary perspective enhances the debate with relevant socio-institutional features that are critical for constructing regional advantage, such as social capital. Drawing on Putnam et al. [29], social capital refers to features of social organization—such as trust, norms, and networks—that can improve the efficiency of society by facilitating coordinated actions. This paper approaches the regional innovation policy process as part of the process of constructing regional advantage. The policy process is interpreted as a learning process in which governments and other regional actors such as firms or universities can develop the capabilities to construct regional advantage. However, this view is not always shared by policymakers themselves. They often expect recipes, predominantly based on best practices applied elsewhere. The main argument of this paper is that, unless the right kind of policy learning processes are developed to provide a context for such recipes, efforts to apply those best practices become far less efficient. The way policy learning has often been approached up to now is described by Sotarauta [35]; in his reflection on strategic planning processes, he says they have not turned out to be such an efficient producer of success as the handbooks and consultants indicated, and that strategies easily remain floating, as they continue to be paper among more paper. And when decision time comes, the strategy papers have been forgotten. An adequate policy learning approach can develop strategies, scenarios, and plans that not only exist on paper, but also affect the mental frameworks of the regional actors, so that when decisions must be made, they cannot be disregarded. To expound this argument, the paper focuses on the following research questions: What determines the potential of a policy learning process to construct regional advantage? How can policy learning be organized to help construct regional advantage? The first research question is addressed by defining an analytical model to propose that the determining factor is the capacity for knowledge cogeneration in the process. The second question is approached by presenting a case study to describe the whole cogeneration process with particular emphasis on how it was organized. In order to contextualize the specific approach used, we must comment on certain aspects regarding our interpretation of learning processes. By “policy learning,” we are referring to what the actors contributing to the policy process learn in order to improve the policies they are helping to define and develop. In some cases, the goal of policy is to help regional actors to learn; in these cases, learning is the object of policy. At the same time, there is a policy learning process, those defining the policy learn about the policy process. For instance, the goal of a particular policy might be to develop a certain kind of technical knowledge at firms and technology centers. Discovering how to foster public–private partnerships to enhance such learning processes would be considered part of the policy learning process, whereas the specific technical learning generated from such policies would not be considered as policy learning. Meanwhile, we argue that learning occurs throughout the process and is done not only by the government, but by all actors involved in the process. Consequently, learning can occur in the stages of agenda setting, policy formulation, decision making, policy implementation, and policy evaluation [16]. In fact, policy learning is also social learning in communities or networks [6]. Since discussion on policy learning processes tends to be abstract, citing specific examples can help clarify the message. Thus, the main arguments in this paper are illustrated with the case study of Ezagutza Gunea (EG), a public–private cooperation network in the Basque Country that defines and develops local programs to support the innovation processes of firms. The paper is structured as follows: the section Theoretical Framework: Evolutionary Economics and Challenges for Policies Focused on Constructing Regional Advantage presents the concepts related to the evolutionary perspective that provided the inspiration for this paper. The section Improving Policy Learning: The Role of Networks and Social Researchers focuses on the learning process for such policies, underlining the role that networks and social research can play in the process. The section An Analytical Framework to Study Policy Learning Processes proposes an analytical framework that helps analyze policy processes and their capacity to extract actionable knowledge. This framework is then used to elaborate on a case study in section Systemic Policy Learning in Practice: The case of Ezagutza Gunea in the Basque Country. The final section covers some specific lessons and outlines further challenges for research in this field.",7

The Case of “HealthInnovation”,December 2011,Anne Haugen Gausdal,Etty Ragnhild Nilsen,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"In the learning economy and at times of increasing globalization, both geographical proximity and regional cooperation paradoxically appear to be of increased importance to firms’ competitiveness [22, 26]. Such cooperation is often deployed in the form of networks. Firms generally enter networks to increase innovation and competitiveness, but this is no guarantee for success [19]. It appears that orchestration, or management processes, constitutes a critical factor for network success [6, 31]. This paper aims at creating a new framework for the orchestration process of developing networks of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). It does this by including elements from the literature of communities of practice (CoP) [2, 14, 30]. There is a lack of research on network orchestration [24], and, as Batterink et al. [1] state: “Further research into the multifaceted orchestration process in innovation networks of SMEs remains essential if we want to fully understand how innovation networks function and why innovation networks succeed or fail.” Hoang and Antoncic [18] ask for more longitudinal, qualitative, process- and outcome-oriented research on networks; moreover, Freeman [13] claims that “longitudinal case studies on the evolution of networks could be particularly valuable.” The research question is: What are the processes of successfully orchestrating innovative SME networks?
 To answer this question, the paper discusses theoretical insights and illustrates a longitudinal process-oriented case study of the development of an experimental project. The experimental project is a regional innovative SME network—HealthInnovation, which was studied from 2006 to 2010, with a qualitative approach including some elements of action research. The network combines two business sectors, health care and technology, and this combination is new to the region. In 2008, the network was found to be in a bad condition and very close to failure. Making this diagnosis and devising a strategy for recovery constitute important empirical findings. From being simply a good idea launched by the regional university, but without being rooted in the regional industry or in the public sector, it has become a dynamic network with active firms and an active public sector. Network orchestration was originally defined by Dhanaraj and Pharkhe ([6]: 659) as the set of deliberate, purposeful actions undertaken by a hub firm to create value (“expand the pie”) and extract value (“gain a larger slice of the pie”) from the network. Their framework for network orchestration is developed for large “hub firm networks” with a dominant firm managing up to more than 500 alliances simultaneously. Such hub firm networks are typically common in supplier networks, e.g., in large industries like the car industry [9]. However, many innovative networks—like the one under study—lack the dominant hub firm and consist of a small number—often 10–30—of independent firms, typically SMEs. Since the definition of network orchestration holds the word hub firm, and the role of the hub firm is so central in it, there is a need for a broader definition that also applies to SME networks. We therefore suggest defining network orchestration as the set of deliberate, purposeful actions to create and extract value from the network. Batterink et al. [1] argue that Dhanaraj and Pharkhe’s [6] framework also fits networks of independent SMEs. We agree with Batterink et al. [1] that the framework fits, but argue that the SME networks need a somewhat different approach to orchestration. This is mainly because they have different structures, different size, and—due to scarce resources—SMEs must be selective about what to participate in. In a network with a dominant hub firm, the other firms are generally hub firm suppliers and therefore dependent on participating in the network in order to continue their business with the hub firm. For these networks, market access is a built-in business contribution for their members, with power concentrated within the hub firm. Networks of independent SMEs lack a hub firm in the value-chain sense, and will therefore have a different power structure. In an SME network, power is more evenly distributed among its members. The glue that keeps the firms together must be found elsewhere than in the regular customer–supplier transactions—as must the means of orchestration. We therefore think Dhanaraj and Pharkhe [6] framework lacks a process to keep the glue together, as well as a strategy for the recovery of failing networks. Such a process is what we develop in this paper, denoting it “managing network health.” We define managing network health as the process of evaluating the network’s contribution to members, and the construction of a strategy for the recovery of failing networks.",28

Coevolution of Knowledge, Innovation, and Creativity, and of the Knowledge Economy and Knowledge Society",March 2012,Igor N. Dubina,Elias G. Carayannis,David F. J. Campbell,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Presently, we have many concepts characterizing the “new economy.” A search in over 150 research databases shows that the knowledge economy represents a frequently used concept: over 5,000 papers, referring to the term of a “knowledge economy” (in keywords, titles, or abstracts), have been published in the period of 1960–2010. A search within the full text identifies over 17,000 papers with the full phrase of a “knowledge economy” and 34,000 papers with the words “knowledge” and “economy.” There are also other popular concepts: learning economy (about 200 papers with this term in keywords, titles, or abstracts and 950 papers with this term in the text are registered in databases), innovation economy (over 150 papers)Footnote 1 or innovative economy (80 papers with this term again in keywords, titles, or abstracts and 800 papers with this term in the text), e-economy (60 and 1,300 papers correspondingly), etc. Creative economy represents also one of the most discussed concepts of the modern global economy for the last 10 years (almost 400 papers referring to the term of a “creative economy” in keywords, titles, or abstracts and 1,900 papers applying this term in a text have been published during 2000–2010). This concept is also understood as a paradigm for the future economy and the future society as a whole, and creativity in combination with knowledge is being considered the most important economic resource in the world with increasing populations and decreasing natural resources. The widely distributed term “creative economy” accentuates the sharply risen significance of creativity as an economic factor, characterizing a qualitative transition of the modern economy to a new level. The last financial and economic crisis was often considered as a catalyst of this transition, and the mobilization of creative and intellectual potential is considered a way to recover from crisis at the levels of organizations and economies. The development of the economy based on creativity, knowledge, and innovation has been very actively discussed in this context recently. The analysis of creative economy during the crisis period may help to answer the following questions: What will be the new postcrisis economy? How will it depend on creativity, knowledge, and innovations? On which sectors of the new economy should the investments focus primarily? We can often hear optimistic statements about crisis: “it is a way to creativity, invention and changes,” “it is an opportunity to reload,” “it is a stimulator of creativity,” etc. Are such statements really proved? Do the world crisis and recession promote the development of creative economy? Does a crisis really promote the development of creativity and innovation? Or, paradoxically, do some changes in innovation activity provoke a crisis? It is not easy to provide an unequivocal answer for those questions since the substantial analysis is complicated by several serious problems, including the vagueness of creativity economy definitions, limitations of traditional methods and indexes, and a lack of systematic empirical and statistical data for analysis and estimation of creativity economy. In this paper, we make an attempt to demonstrate the limits of the traditional understanding of the conception of “creative economy” and suggest another term, the “creativity economy,” which is more relevant for understanding and demonstrating the complex interrelations of creativity, knowledge, and innovation in a modern economic context. In “Creative Economy’: Limitations of the Industry and Occupation Approaches” section of this paper, we discuss the boundaries of the understanding of “creative economy” based on industrial or occupational approaches. In “Creativity, Knowledge, and Innovation Economies” section, we define the term “creativity economy” in consistence with “knowledge economy” and “innovation economy” and analyze further the interrelations and intertransformations of creativity, knowledge, and innovation in the modern economy. In “An Economic Crisis, Creativity, and Innovation” section, we argue that a relationship between an economic crisis and creative and innovative activities is not necessarily linear: a crisis can really stimulate creativity, inventiveness, and innovation, as widely assumed, but a crisis may also result when shifting from one regime of “creative knowledge innovation” to another. In “The Crisis Consequences and Innovation Policy in Russia” section of this paper, some of the transition problems to a creativity and innovation economy, during a period of crisis and recession, are considered for the case of the Russian economy. In “Conclusion” section, we again summarize the main propositions and ideas of the article and put them finally in a broader context.",105

New wealth is created by the application of knowledge to improve productivity and to create innovations, i.e. new products, services, systems and processes. In order to enhance such innovative processes, Creative Knowledge Environments are required. These environments ‘exert a positive influence on human beings engaged in creative work aiming to produce new knowledge or innovations’ ([14], p 1). In policy, the importance of joint action networks—e.g. Triple Helix constellations with participants from the public, private and academic sectors—has been stressed in order to enhance innovation (c.f. [17]). The public funding of such joint action networks has been criticised for paradoxically consolidating old structures rather than opening up for creative change. A narrow range of actors and areas has been prioritized, ignoring the contribution from other sectors and alternative constellations to the growth of the knowledge economy [18, 19]. In this article, the model of Women Resource Centres serves as an example of how creativity in the organization of joint action networks can make new knowledge and innovation prosper. The empirical study illustrates the need for further development of predominant models for promoting innovation. Suggested concepts such as Creative Knowledge Environments and Quadruple Helix will therefore be scrutinized from their potential to increase the diversity of actors and areas being acknowledged as important in the expanding knowledge economy [6, 7, 14, 18–21]. The article starts with a description of the research design of the presented empirical study. Then, the issue of Creative Knowledge Environments—suggesting an expansion of Triple Helix—is discussed in the light of existing research and contemporary EU policy. The suggested concepts of Quadruple Helix and Quattro Helix are thereto outlined. This is followed by a recite of how the model of Women Resource Centres was developed in Sweden and internationalized throughout Europe. The main features of the model are also highlighted. Finally, the issue of Women Resource Centres as Creative Knowledge Environments of Quadruple Helix is analysed, and conclusions are drawn about how the diversity of actors and areas can be extended in a way that benefits the dawning knowledge economy.",42

Society is looking for pedagogical solutions to cope with problems like migration, unemployment, developing social skills in a society which is guided by efficiency etc. Therefore, we observe a multiplicity of public disputes and discussions dealing with pedagogical contents generating a wide range of effects on society. Most of them are like implementing new pedagogical concepts and curricula through all levels in the educational system. Sabine Andresen explains these observed processes with the implicit openness of pedagogics and educational sciences to interests of society [2]. Because of this, their boundaries constitute themselves as a reaction to and as a function of social developments. In consideration of the fact that these boundaries are fuzzy and always shifting, it is not surprising that these dynamical boundaries are the source of permanent discussions. Analyzing the historical development of pedagogics Heinz-Elmar Tenorth comes to similar findings [20]. In the course of time, he observes a permanently changing and adapting relationship between profession (i.e., application, teaching in schools) and discipline (i.e., theory, education of teachers on university) in educational sciences triggered by sociopolitical changes. He takes up the position that this openness of the dynamical and always new defining boundaries between profession and discipline constitutes a positive characteristic of pedagogics because only with this continuously changing structure pedagogics and educational sciences can cope with ever-changing sociopolitical requirements (e.g., the requirement of teaching economically useful knowledge at school and universities). For the understanding how educational systems are influenced and also influencing sociopolitical processes and structures in different countries, the model of “National Systems of Innovation” will be helpful (see [13]). These dynamical boundaries in the context of pedagogics described above first create functional structures and destroy them after a certain period of time. In macroeconomics, similar processes are characterized with the notion “creative destruction” (see [19]). In the history of educational sciences, it is also difficult to identify processes, which can be described as “paradigm shifts” in the sense of Kuhn’s definition (see [11]). It seems that in the pedagogical context, the changing and adapting boundaries trigger a lot of processes which follow the principle of “anything goes” (see [7]). Because of this dynamical behavior of boundaries in educational sciences, the period of use of successful pedagogical concepts is also limited. With this temporal limitation and this creative area of conflict between theory and application in the context of school and education most of the criteria of creative knowledge environments are fulfilled and also a diversity of creative knowledge environments is established (see [10]). For our purposes the models of knowledge production in terms of “Mode 1” and “Mode 2” (see [9,14,15]) and in terms of “Triple Helix Model” (see [6]) seem to be reasonable in the context described above. The open question now is how to describe adequately these dynamic characteristics of boundaries in educational sciences in order to understand and steer these processes of a meaningful defining of boundaries in pedagogics against the background of knowledge. Andresen points out a possibility of description with the reference to “Fuzzy Concepts”. The problem of a reasonable description of boundaries in pedagogics can be reduced to the problem of membership and assignment of pedagogic contents to theory or to application and accordingly to disciplines dealing with similar contents. In a more abstract mathematical way, this problem of assignment is already described in the so-called “Fuzzy Sets”: What are the degrees of membership of a single element x to a set A and to a set B at the same time? In the context of educational sciences, the same question is expressed as: what are the degrees of membership of a certain pedagogic content to theory which is taught in different departments on universities and to concrete pedagogic situations at school in the daily routines. In the first place, our research question is to identify the potentialities and contexts in which fuzzy concepts can improve the daily pedagogic work and secondly to identify concrete creative knowledge environments in these evolving boundaries in the context of educational science. Based on the works by Andresen and Tenorth, those characteristics of pedagogics will be identified, which underline the necessity for a description through “Fuzzy Concepts”. A short overview of the characteristics of knowledge production in terms of “Mode 1” and “Mode 2” and in terms of “Triple Helix Model”, as well as one section about creative knowledge environments in the context of school and one section dealing with “Fuzzy Sets”, which serves as basis for “Fuzzy Concept”. In the “Terms of Pedagogocs and Fuzzy Concepts” section, the relationship of selected terms of pedagogics/educational science and “Fuzzy Concepts” is elaborated and discussed. In the last section, a reflection about the adequateness of the description of boundaries in pedagogics by “Fuzzy Concepts” and about the identification of these boundaries as creative knowledge environments complete this article.",3

These models structure and analyse the diffusion process of products and try to forecast the diffusion trajectory over the product’s lifetime. The research focus involves the integration of marketing mix variables into these models, in particular rollout price and marketing expenses. The contribution to the literature is an examination of the mathematical functions of these models, their impact on the diffusion trajectory and a comparison to theories from marketing, focusing on interdependencies of diffusion parameters and decision variables. Therefore, simulations of common pricing strategies will be run to analyse if the models accurately reflect their dynamic changes. Afterwards adoption and marketing data from two innovative software products will be applied to calibrate the models and evaluate their forecasting precision by comparing the results with true data within a period of 10 months after initial release. Actual application of diffusion models to true data is extremely scarce and constitutes the major contribution of this paper. It sheds light on actual application of the mathematical functions and benefits and obstacles when using its results for normative inferences. A market analysis will show the complexity of market structures of the software branch and the involved requirements for these models. Critical branch-related aspects, such as the reputation of the company, online distribution channels, and piracy are discussed and disclose future research spots in the estimation of diffusion shapes of innovative products.",4

Due to the influence of team culture on success in project-based work contexts, scholars suggest that team culture should be established early to drive member behavior towards achieving the desired performance outcomes [6]. A question arises about the influence of a team culture in a multiple-project management work environment. In the research domain, multiple-project management (MPM) can take different forms and has different meanings to researchers.Footnote 1 In this study, MPM is referred to as a management practice that a project manager is assigned to simultaneously lead multiple projects. We use the term “management of a group of multiple projects (MGMP)” to refer to this form of MPM. With resource limitation, MGMP is used in many organizations. By practicing MGMP, more projects can be implemented in an organization, since managers can assign multiple projects to a project manager (often referred to as a multiple-project manager). Typically, a multiple-project manager leads short-duration projects that are not mutually dependent in terms of objectives and goals [16, 17]. Since the project manager leads several teams for projects of different objectives, s/he usually does not have sufficient time and resource to spend on one particular team. To ensure team effectiveness and project success, research shows that a multiple-project manager should possess a unique set of competencies to simultaneously lead multiple teams [18]. To have a better understanding of culture in project management, the main objective of this study is to empirically explore the relevance of team culture in MGMP, especially the impact of team culture on project success. Since past researchers have indicated that (1) organizational culture is a multilevel phenomenon, and culture has an impact on performance and (2) project managers’ team management competency has an impact on team and project success, we hypothesize team culture as a mediator of (1) organizational culture and (2) team competency of project managers and project success. Figure 1 illustrates our conceptual model. The conceptual model for studying the relevance of team culture in multiple-project management Even though MGMP has been increasingly implemented in organizations, empirical research on MGMP is limited and well behind its rate of utilization in the industry. It is important to understand what factors influencing project success in MGMP settings. As previously discussed, organizational culture, team culture, and team management competency are investigated in this study. Even though research has been done to investigate the impact of such factors on project success, those research works were conducted in a single-project management setting, especially with long-duration projects. Such factors may have different levels of impact on MGMP where a multiple-project manager simultaneously leads multiple teams of short-duration projects that are typically independent in terms of objectives and goals. This research is among the first to investigate the impact of such factors in a MGMP setting.",5

Daim,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Technology plays an important and decisive role in the economic growth. For this reason, technology has been used in the analysis of the economic growth theories which also consider other factors such as population, capital, and labor. The special emphasis on technology results from the significant acceleration of the economic growth after the World War II. During that period, commercial trades increased as a result of successful technical innovation. As Saiz ([33], p.1) indicates, many underdeveloped countries became technologically dependent on “leading countries” which is an indicator of the technological success. The technological dependency was focused on the main sectors of the economy [33]. In this regard, Wang and Chien [43] emphasize the development and ownership of technology in each country as the most significant factor for economic performance and social development. Moreover, empirical results support the theoretical idea regarding the importance of technology. Thereon, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) points up that long run economic growth depends on the innovation of technology ([5], p.3). Technology has been used in mathematical and econometric models in order to explain the economic growth, especially after 1950s. The models and the empirical evidence consider technological innovation as an agent that plays a crucial role in the economy. Therefore, this close relationship between the economic growth, economic welfare, and technological and scientific development has become a major topic in macro-economic, technology transfer policy, and industry analysis [18]. Since technology is important for the economic growth, how technology affects the economic growth has been discussed, particularly in the context of the endogenous and exogenous theories. The new concept of general purpose technology (GPT) has been used analyzing the effects of technological and radical innovation on the economic growth. In this context, some radical innovations are attributed to be the key factor for changing domestic lifestyle and production policies of firms. One of the technologies considered as GPT is electricity, which has had a significant impact on the households and industries [10]. Electricity, as one of the energy sources, is important for the dynamics of production and consumption in the economy. It would be a chaos if there is no electricity; for example, the power outage in New York in 2003 “stopped trains, elevators… the normal flow of traffic and life… water supplies were affected because water is distributed through electric pumps” [11]. During the last decades, renewable energy technologies have been considered as alternatives of conventional energy. This is because conventional energy is related to many issues, like scarcity of resources, access to energy sources, political issues, and the negative effects of energy price volatility. Understanding these problems, the governments are promoting alternative energy technologies that can replace the conventional energy resources. Alternative energy technologies would diminish the energy dependency and the negative effects of energy price volatility. However, due to technological constraints and economic factors, renewable energy technologies have been unable to compete with conventional energy technologies. Nevertheless, Doner [12] concludes that the future of renewable technology is promised to compete with conventional energy technologies even it will take more time. For these reasons, renewable energy technologies are gaining importance in the macro-economical context level. Lipsey, Bekar, and Carlaw [25] mention nuclear power as a potential GPT and possible competitor to other energy alternatives such as solar or geothermal energies. Following these criteria, it is possible to categorize renewable energy technologies as alternatives to conventional energy, particularly in the electrical field (wind energy or solar energy). By following the analysis of Lipsey, Bekar, and Carlaw [25], leading technologies can be considered as GPTs even they have less pervasive characteristics than other GPTs. Although electricity is already generating power, renewable energy will present competitive advantages compared with conventional energy (cost competitiveness, non-polluters, and practically infinite availability). An empirical analysis of how renewable energy technology affects the economic growth is essential and transcendent. Analyzing the patterns of these relationships, it is possible to evaluate if renewable energy technology can greatly affects the economic growth in the long run. Baron [6] remarks the significance of the national technological program, and its effects on the economic growth and standard of living. Accordingly, the evaluation of renewable energy technologies under an economic growth context is important. In this case, time series analysis of the economic growth and technological innovation is used in order to evaluate the long and short run effects. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to analyze if renewable energy technologies affect the economic growth given the characteristics and time development. A time series analysis is developed, which uses the multifactor productivity and technological change (specifically renewable energy technologies). In this context, the paper analyzes the following questions: how does technology innovation affect the economic growth through the time? How renewable energy technology affects and will affect the economic growth? Can renewable energy technology be considered as GPT? The objectives of this paper are:
 To contribute in understanding the effects of technological innovation on the economic growth through time, focusing on renewable energy technology. To examine the relationship between technological innovation and the economic growth using time series analysis and econometric tools.",7

Vliamos,Nickolaos G. Tzeremes,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The link between economic development and firm creation has extensively attracted the attention of the economic literature [1–4]. During the 1980s, several authors suggested that knowledge creation processes are related to large firms only due to increased costs associated with them, and therefore, a large scale was required to compete successfully globally [5, 6]. However, technology changes over the years introduced new business conditions which made scale economies to be less important enabling entrepreneurial economy to rise [7]. In fact, knowledge-based economy was the main driver behind the rise of entrepreneurial activity [8]. Even earlier literature [9] asserts that, given certain assumptions about the characteristics of knowledge and the knowledge requirements of production, the firm is conceptualized as an institution for integrating the specialist knowledge of its members. Knowledge is viewed as residing within the individual, and the primary role of the organization is knowledge application rather than knowledge creation.Footnote 1 In addition, economic literature considers knowledge to be the “missing” factor in endogenous growth models [10–12] and entrepreneurial capital the “missing” link behind economic performance [13]. Entrepreneurial capital influences economic performance by creating knowledge spillovers [14], by increasing knowledge externalities [15–17] and by developing firm and knowledge diversity [18] making thus cities and firms vital sources of innovation [15, 19]. Therefore, entrepreneurial activity is one of the main channels behind knowledge spillovers and knowledge creation, so it becomes a major driver of the knowledge economy [20]. It seems that factors influencing directly entrepreneurial activity will have an indirect impact on the transmission of knowledge and knowledge creation. This paper focuses on the factors influencing the relation between entrepreneurial action and new business formation. It highlights different empirical results from studies in different countries, and in an effort to establish some norms of behavior, it concentrates on the analysis of motives and characteristics of entrepreneurs that have started their businesses in the region of Thessaly in Greece. To this end, the paper uses nonparametric techniques to illustrate different results from a primary research, conducted by the authors in this area. To develop our arguments, we assume that entrepreneurial actions and hence entrepreneurial processes are the results of both motivational and cognitive factors, like ability, intelligence, and skills.",20

Bernstein,Elias G. Carayannis,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"A Gallup poll [25] conducted in 1994 found that 69% of its 602 surveyed high school students expressed interest in starting a business. However, when these students were asked how they would describe their knowledge and understanding of starting and managing a business, only 13% of these students responded “excellent” or “good.” Entrepreneurship education seeks to address this lack of knowledge of entrepreneurship and to encourage new venture creation. Since the first post-secondary school entrepreneurship course was introduced in 1958 [17], there has been a significant growth in both the entrepreneurship course offerings and the number of institutions offering such education. It is believed to be one of the fastest growing subjects at U.S. colleges and universities [22]. The student enrollment in entrepreneurship classes at the five top U.S. business schools increased 92% from 1996 to 1999, and the number of entrepreneurship classes offered increased 74% [10]. Within a 50-year period, entrepreneurship education has grown from a single course to opportunities at more than 1,500 colleges and universities around the world [7]. It has been estimated that 400 colleges and universities offered entrepreneurship courses in 1995, up from approximately 16 in 1970 [24]. Recently, there has been a significant growth in the undergraduate entrepreneurship major. Unlike students who enroll in a single entrepreneurship elective, those students who pursue the undergraduate entrepreneurship major may be giving up specialization in a particular field which could be the basis for future entrepreneurship endeavors in order to obtain additional entrepreneurship knowledge. This is a simple study about the perceived value of undergraduate entrepreneurship education. Our premise is that motivations as well as expectations and effectiveness of educational design, content, and context matter to both the deliverers and funders as well as the recipients of the education. Our study is a first step towards a better and more systematic and coherent understanding of the relevance, currency, and efficacy of undergraduate entrepreneurship education. We felt that such a study would be current and relevant given the increasing emphasis on entrepreneurship and innovation as drivers of sustainable economic development and even sustainable competitive advantage in developed and developing nations alike [6] and the significance of educational programs and systems that help develop human and intellectual capital in apparent support of such phenomena. Related to this research endeavor is also the question of “nature vs. nurture” of entrepreneurial talent and propensity. This is not something we purport to address at this stage but may be implicitly revisited as a result of our study’s findings. The research presented here is a first step toward understanding the students perceived value proposition for the entrepreneurship major, their most likely non-entrepreneurship alternative, as well as the non-entrepreneurship alternative along with an entrepreneurship elective. This understanding is important because the availability of entrepreneurship education provides an implicit assumption that potential entrepreneurs would benefit from enrollment. However, since formal entrepreneurship education is not a prerequisite for starting a business or an entrepreneurial venture, there is a need to understand the perceived value proposition of such an education relative to other options.",11

Rather, they are said to be the result of a more fundamental force: innovation.Footnote 1 Innovations enhance the efficiency of companies and supply consumers with more and better products. Innovative companies use new technologies or new materials which allow them to produce more products at the same cost or to produce an equal amount of products at lower costs compared to their competitors, and they produce new products which improve on existing products or even create new markets. In all cases, innovations give companies a lead over their competitors and provide them with a highly profitable position: an economic monopoly. Monopolists prize their products above marginal cost, i.e. above the costs dedicated to produce an extra unit, which equal market price in liberal economy. A company that is able to sell its products above market price gains extraordinary revenues. Hence, because innovations bestow a monopoly upon companies, these extraordinary monopoly profits are deemed to be the incentive for companies to innovate. In capitalism, patents aim at supplementing the fundamental forces of the market.Footnote 2 Patents shall be a supplemental incentive to innovate. The supplemental incentive consists in the grant of a legal monopoly for at least 20 years, as stated in article 63 EPC. Patents confer to an innovator the exclusive right to make use of his invention for a minimum period of time, and not only for the uncertain time span competitors need to implement the invention in their business. The right to exclude others from making use of an invention for 20 years creates a legal monopoly. A legal monopoly does not entail that the innovative patent holder is entitled to make use of his invention himself because the production and marketing of a product is subject to national law which may prohibit the use of certain inventions.Footnote 3 Thus, a legal monopoly cannot be equated with an economic monopoly. Rather, patents are supposed to supplement market forces where they do not lead on their own to a socially desirable level of innovation. The advent of the knowledge society increased the demand for innovations and turned the industrial economy into a knowledge economy. In a knowledge economy, technological expertise is commodified and traded, patents being the currency of the trade with knowledge-related products.Footnote 4 The knowledge economy shall preserve economic growth and social welfare. With respect to its patent-currency inflation abounds: the number of new inventions for which patent applications were filed worldwide rose by 60% over the decade of the 1990s.Footnote 5 The supplemental force tends to become a central one. And the more central patents become in a liberal knowledge economy, the more likely they are shaped by market forces. In other words, the role of patents might undergo significant changes in an economy that is based on knowledge, where competition of innovations determines market success rather than monopolist positions do.Footnote 6 This role has to be reconsidered.",4

While other regions have witnessed substantial growth in enterprise size and productivity, sub-Saharan Africa has had only a small number of success stories. Among the few exceptions are the recent important findings of positive impacts of on-the-job training on labor productivity in Kenya and Zambia of Rosholm et al. [30]. Enterprises operating in clusters in Africa are often informal, have low productivity, and grow only when they are very young, according to Ramachandran and Shah [28], Sluwaegen and Goedhuys [33], Mazumdar and Mazaheri [22], Frazer [12], Bigsten and Söderbom [3], Van Biesebroeck [44], Mengistae [24], and Bigsten and Gebreeyesus [4]. These studies find that major determinants of enterprise growth and survival include enterprise age and size and entrepreneurial human and social capital, such as years of schooling, years of business experience, and access to informal network. Bigsten et al. [1], Van Biesebroeck [45], Fafchamps and Söderbom [11], among others, explore what make investment and exporting difficult for African enterprises. The literature has also explored major constraints facing enterprises, such as credit constraints, high risks, corruption, limited contract enforcement, labor costs (which tend to increase with enterprise sizes), and high costs of transportation and electricity due to poor infrastructure [e.g., 2, 6, 9, 10, 14, 35]. Compared with these constraints, little attention has been paid to inadequate skills of small entrepreneurs in marketing, production and quality management, and accounting. Such entrepreneurial skills are part of the human capital of entrepreneurs but not necessarily captured by the number of years of schooling or the number of years of business experience. While it is fair to say that many entrepreneurs are deficient in entrepreneurial skills, questions arise as to whether the skill level is a major determinant of enterprise performance. If important, why do small entrepreneurs remain deficient in such skills even after many years in business? Is it possible to teach such skills to entrepreneurs? Karlan and Valdivia [20] present evidence that a program of teaching entrepreneurship to small entrepreneurs in Peru improved knowledge, practices, and revenues. Does the same apply to Africa? This paper attempts to answer some of these questions by using enterprise data collected from an industrial cluster consisting of garage mechanics and metalworking enterprises in Ghana. To obtain tight evidence for the importance of entrepreneurial skills as a determinant of enterprise development and for the usefulness of entrepreneurial training, it would be necessary to carry out a randomized experiment in which such training is provided to randomly selected participants. This paper is not a report of such an experiment but an assessment of demand for entrepreneurial skill training. We examine the associations among entrepreneurs’ characteristics, their participation in such training in the past, and their current performance, in order to infer how beneficial it will be if we provide a training program to them. The industrial cluster under study is very large in terms of number of enterprises and number of workers and apprentices, but the way in which small entrepreneurs run their businesses is no different from that found in other clusters of small businesses in sub-Saharan Africa, such as the metalworking clusters in Nairobi, Kenya, and a suburb of Kampara, Uganda, and the leather shoe cluster in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.Footnote 1 That is, small entrepreneurs seldom keep records, seldom tout their potential customers, and seldom take the initiative in making efficient use of materials, energy, and time. Frazer’s [12] account of apprenticeship applies perfectly to this cluster. The majority of these entrepreneurs learned production and business operation from their masters through apprenticeship. The business model they were taught would be suitable for self-employed masters working with several apprentices but not for owners and managers ambitious to expand their businesses. It is no wonder their enterprises seldom grow beyond certain small sizes. Moreover, their enterprises may become less profitable gradually since apprenticeship reproduces competitors who produce or provide exactly the same products or services. In fact, profitability has declined substantially in recent years in the cluster. In response, many entrepreneurs have attempted to change the way of running their businesses. We hypothesize that knowledge and skills that they did not learn from apprentice training have assumed importance for their businesses, and that those who have such knowledge and skills have better business results. Schools do not teach such knowledge and skills, but education will help entrepreneurs search for useful information, knowledge, and skills. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, such intangible inputs useful for a managerial reform are difficult to obtain not only for elementary school dropouts but for polytechnic graduates. We conjecture that managerial training plays an important role and find that the current business results are strongly associated with years of schooling and participation in managerial training in the metalwork sector. Participation in technical training programs has no effects. These results are obtained from ordinary lease square (OLS) regressions and the propensity score matching (PSM) estimation. By contrast, we find no such effects in the garage sector. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The “Brief History of the Cluster” section describes the formation of the large cluster under study. The “Data” section presents the basic data of the sample enterprises. The “Hypotheses and Empirical Framework” section advances some testable hypotheses and explains the empirical strategy. The “Estimation Results” section presents the results of OLS regressions and PSM estimations. The “Conclusions” section tries to draw conclusions for future research and policies.",

Daim,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The applications of social network analysis are widely spread, especially in the field of sociology such as social support or social capital. The methods of social network analysis are also applied to the technology area [3, 5, 29, 30, 32]. Social network analysis explores the relationship (ties) between actors (nodes) [28, 37]. Sociologists study social network, in which the actors can be people, groups, a company, or other sociological categories, and the relationships are social relations which depends on the defined actors. In contrast to the sociological studies, social network analyses are applied to the technology studies in which the actors of the network represent innovative technologies, inventions, or scientific papers, and the relationships can be their technological references which are technological commonalities among inventions or ideas, such as patent citations linking patents to their prior arts [24]. Podolny ([24], pp.34–35) clearly stated the advantage of utilizing the method of social network analysis: “we suggest that patents and patent citations can be used to represent this expanding ‘technological network’ for a select number of high-technology industries”. Sternitzke et al. [29] also argued that deployment of network analysis may be beneficial in the identification of important players in technology fields or corporations. The connections among the players can be used for competitor analysis or for identifying partners for joint development projects. The methodologies also lead to the identification of key patents and rivalry between players in the technology field. Traditionally, network analysis treats network structure within the “embeddedness” perspective originally associated with Granovetter [43]. And social networks are technologically embedded [20, 30]. Podolny [24] argued that organization’s niche is its position embedded in technological network. In other words, new ideas and inventions rarely arise in isolation. An organization’s competitiveness emerges from the position of the technological contact with the inventions of other organizations. Embeddedness of social relations or organizational ties shapes economic action in ways [43]. Taking into account the perspective of the behavioral theory of the interfirm [1], Joglekar [16] argued that exploration builds more embeddedness into the periphery than into the core, and exploitation reverses this bias. Based on the arguments as discussed above, we are interested in the following: First, how does structure of technological network influence the innovation activities? And if so, what are the management implications of the position in network? This paper is aimed at illustrating that technologies have their position in their evolving technological network. Besides, we further argue that the position of technological network is in shaping the contribution of technologies in technological development. In order to test the argument, we use empirical data on patents from United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) database. And to identify the network structure, we employ the model of core/periphery structure proposed by Borgatti and Everett [2]. This paper is organized as follows: First, we discuss the social network analysis and its application and second, briefly explain the network structure along with exploitation and exploration. Third, we explain the methodology of core/periphery structure. Fourth is the data and results of analysis. The final is conclusion and discussion.",12

A New Function for Intellectual Property Rights,December 2012,Blandine Laperche,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Despite the diversity of organisational models that can be found in the economic reality, there is no doubt that the organisation and management of activities through networks have gained ground. In particular, big hierarchical firms seem to be part of past history, being replaced by the ‘networked enterprise’. Today, most companies are increasingly concentrated on a very small part or on small parts of the value chain: conception/design of new products (final products or intermediary goods), production (of pieces or final assembling) and commercialisation (services). Also, at each step of the value chain (conception, production and commercialisation), most firms try to reduce the ownership of assets to the core activities (the most profitable but also often the most risky) and use contractual relations to manage the rest of the activities. This type of organisation has been well studied in economics and management of innovation and of the firm, certainly because it seems to be particularly adapted to the economic context characterised by the globalisation of competition based on innovation (see notably Refs. [7, 8, 27, 40, 59, 60, 72]). At the same time, in the field of economics and management of innovation, intellectual property rights (IPRs) have obtained the status of assets showing their crucial role in innovation strategies, as well as in innovation policies [24, 45, 64, 67–69]. Whereas the networked enterprise on the one hand and intellectual property rights on the other hand are well-studied subjects in economics and management, the research on the roles of IPRs in the organisation and the strategy of the networked enterprise still needs to be developed. In this paper, we aim to contribute to the research on this topic and to improve the understanding of the functions of IPRs in the particular case of the networked enterprise building innovation networks. We put forward a specific function of IPRs: their role in the coordination of activities, which is rarely studied. The notion of coordination means the ordering of the parts of a whole according to a logical plan or ‘the management of the dependencies between activities’ [48]. We develop the idea according to which the ownership of IPRs facilitates the efficient allocation of the networked enterprise’s resources. In other words, they may make easier the relationships between all the fragmented parts of the networked enterprise. This role is explained by the analysis of their impacts on transactions. This coordination function is gaining ground in the context of open innovation, which implies the management of multiple contracts among the partners that contribute to the formation of the firm’s innovation potential (called here ‘knowledge capital’). We also study the relation between this coordination function and the more traditional incentive/defensive and offensive roles of IPRs. This paper, thus, offers a new point of view on the strategic but also on the organisational functions of IPRs, in the particular case of the networked enterprise. ‘The Organisation of the Networked Enterprise: Origin and Definition’ section comes back to the origin of the networked enterprise and defines its main characteristics. The ‘Open Innovation Strategies and the ‘Knowledge Capital’ of a Networked Enterprise’ section focuses on the open strategies of innovation and on the formation of the firm’s ‘knowledge capital’. The ‘From the Traditional Roles of IPRs to the Coordination Function’ section presents the traditional roles of IPRs and puts forward the coordination role of IPRs that appears to be fundamental in the networked enterprise. The ‘Links Between Coordination Role and the Other Roles of IPRs in the Networked Enterprise’ section links the coordination role to the more traditional ‘defensive/incentive’ and offensive roles of IPRs. Finally the paper ends with the ‘Conclusions’ section.",8
3.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,28 July 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-011-0055-6,"Innovation Theory, Aesthetics, and Science of the Artificial After Herbert Simon",December 2012,Helge Godoe,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The role of aesthetics is important, possibly paramount, in innovation, but this factor is not reflected in mainstream innovation theory and research. The paper suggests that aesthetics, supported by serendipity, imagination, and creativity constitute the core, i.e., the “soul” of innovation, and that these factors fuel the dynamics of innovation. Archeological evidence suggests that ever since human beings (not just Homo sapiens, but even Neanderthals, cf. [4]) started making tools and artifacts, decorations and patterns (abstractions), shaping and styling, symbolism and use of colors have been integral parts of their design, to the extent that embedded aesthetic codes may be interpreted as having a primary status: making artifacts (utility) may be seen as a pretext for a fundamental aesthetic agency. This aesthetic agency's role in innovation is not well understood and researched although modern society may be seen as being ruled by various aesthetic orders and hegemonies, as evident in fashion, architecture or the lure of holding an iPhone in your hands, to mention a few examples. The challenge of incorporating aesthetics and its associates in innovation theory may become feasible by adoption and further development of Herbert Simon's theory of the science of the artificial. The article suggests how this could be done; basically by redefining Simon's notion of the role of the “utility function” in optimization as one that is ruled by aesthetics. In innovation theory and research, various shades of economic approaches and discourses have gained a dominant status in terms of explanation, i.e., the understanding and explanation of innovation is based on an economic logic and assumptions that are closely related or derived from an economic approach to innovation. Furthermore, the legitimacy of doing innovation research has a similar economistic rationale, such as the assumption that more and improved knowledge of innovation may provide insights that are economically beneficial, and as extension, also relevant and significant for a plethora of policy considerations and deliberations. Hence, economists and pundits who employ economic reasoning qua innovation experts are often called upon for providing advice on policy and strategy matters to governments and similar types of agencies at all levels, in particular to international bodies such as the OECD, the EU, and UN. There are a number of obvious reasons for this, one being a long tradition of an intellectual interest by scholars for centuries on political economy. Their focus has primarily been on the role of technology in socio-economic development. Karl Marx and Friedrich List were pioneers, but there were many others. However, modern innovation research owes its ancestry to the seminal work of the economist Joseph Schumpeter [32] and his followers, also economists, such as Richard R. Nelson and Sidney Winter [28], Chris Freeman [10]; they all had an economic mindset in their approach to innovation.Footnote 1 Thus, the emergence of innovation theory and research as a discipline and distinct, successful body of knowledge is based on a tradition that emerged from economics, which explains why this research is dominated by an economic logic and its axiom of homo economicus and related rationality. This may also explain why the economic approach to innovation is reproduced and reinforced in contemporary research and discourses on innovation. In spite of its success in terms of explaining innovation using economistic logic, the economic approach is not satisfactory because many important dynamics and factors are overlooked or ignored. Somewhat akin to a searchlight at night, it provides brilliant illumination at one spot, but leaves everything else in the dark. Or, to put this in another way, the economic approach seems ill equipped at capturing the “soul” of innovation. For this reason, it is too simplistic. The implication of this may be significant, in particular in a policy perspective. Most fundamental, the economistic assumption of homo economicus, although benign to the purpose and potential benefits of innovation, is inherently hesitant and skeptical to innovation activities because, maybe by instinct, innovation is seen as dangerously cost inefficient and associated with high uncertainty and risk. This may explain why so few economists, in spite of their knowledge and insights on innovation, seldom become innovators and entrepreneurs themselves.Footnote 2 Although this, which may be termed as a “professional paradox,” may be observed in many other professions and disciplines (e.g., the plastic surgeon in bad need of a nose job, or the priests who do not believe in God), the implication of the economic hegemony in innovation theory may be detrimental for policy and strategy. In particular, the promotion of the “market” and assumption of “homo economicus” as agents in this serves as a deus ex machina in innovation policy, and increasingly also in public R&D and innovation policy. This is unsatisfactory because of its inherent limitations and mono-causal approach to innovation, i.e., it is too simplistic. For this reason, we need to look for other sources for approaching innovation. One of these is Herbert Simon.",8

The modern value network thinking extends the level of analysis from supply chains and value chains to cover the characteristics of external business environment. There are several studies on the comparison of the effect of internal and external attributes on firm performance [1], and the underlying assumption is that a strategy is successful if there is coherence between internal and external sets of variables. In line with this definition, the business environment can be seen as the set of external variables affecting and interacting with the structure and performance of a single firm. It follows that external perspective, environmental perspective, and internal perspective are both essential in order to explore the success of a single firm in an industry. For example, the case of Silicon Valley addresses the emerging challenge of knowledge management ecosystems in high-tech knowledge economies where the knowledge linkages to the customer and supplier channels are essential for firms [2]. Following that logic, we argue that there exists no right strategy for positioning in an industry. Thus, there can be several combinations of options which differ from each other in terms of their internal, external, and performance characteristics. Different schools of thought address the advantageous industry positioning of the firm. The competitive positioning framework by Porter [3] explains the competitive positioning of a firm in an industry through competitive forces. These five competitive forces arising from customer and supplier power, substitute and new industry entrant threat, and rivalry among existing industries explain a firm position in its competitive environment. Despite the static nature of a framework, the competitive force model can also be exploited as a framework for analyzing changes and dynamics in competitive positioning. Moreover, it has been argued that perceived power relationships between actors in an industry value network (buyer–supplier relationships) determine the value capture of single firm [4]. This provides an interesting standpoint for understanding the firm positioning in an industry network from the value capture perspective. Nevertheless, it requires explicit understanding of the power relationships between actors in an industry. In general, when an industry develops towards integrated services and horizontal structure, no single company can maintain and develop all capabilities and resources alone [5]. The resource-based view for strategic management addresses the importance of developing internally resources that are most critical, for example those that are valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable in an industry environment. Further, under conditions of high uncertainty, firms prefer the formation of strategic alliance over acquisitions when accessing the complementary capabilities [6]. Nevertheless, certain roles in a value network can be more resource intensive. In a highly uncertain environment, hierarchical governance structure (in-house production) may also provide advantages compared to the usage of external resources. The transaction costs economics [7] has focused on investigation of the most effective governance structure and make-vs.-buy decisions in terms of transaction costs arising for example from asset-specific investments and opportunistic behavior of actors in the industry. However, according to modern supply and value network thinking, the creation of competitive advantage requires a value creation between actors in a value network. Allee [8] defines the value network as “any network or web of relationships that generates tangible and intangible value through complex dynamic exchanges between two or more organizations.” Value network here describes the set of relationships with customers and suppliers, competitors, and complementators in order to attain a specific outcome within a specific industry group. It follows that when the significance of collaboration activities increases, the characteristics and mechanisms for survival and growth in industries are explained via advantageous position in an industry value network. This is achieved through value creation and capture, not purely via excellent positioning in relation to competitive forces. A good example of the innovation networks with positioning advantage derives from the studies of regional clusters and network theory [9]. In these regional innovation networks or ecosystems, such as Silicon Valley, innovation and economic growth are based on the collaboration with the actors in a specific location. There are, however, situations were firm position in an industry and value network cannot be defined or characterized strictly with any single internal or external attributes. In general, the industry positioning can be regarded as relative compared to the set of other actors in the analysis. Furthermore, what seems to be interesting in the empirical context is the possibility to profile the industry actors based on the selected strategy attributes. This would impose how different actors in an industry value network position themselves and what differences it makes in terms of different indicators and performance measures. Recent promising frameworks for strategy-based positioning include the ecosystem view [10] which attempts to cluster the firms based on their relationship characteristics (complexity) and environmental turbulence. These applications, however, seem to contribute more on the conceptual framework development of positioning strategy, leaving it rather shallow how the strategy attributes are measured and how the framework can be applied in different settings. Thus, the motivation for this study is to explore the firm's position in an industry network and apply the methods of structural network analysis for the investigation. The primary research question of this paper is how actors' strategies in an industry value network differ according to their resource intensity measured by relative asset value and research and development (R&D) orientation and how this positioning affects the selected external and internal indicators. The primary aim is to empirically investigate and give explanations of the characteristics and differences of strategic positions of selected firms in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector. The paper is divided into three sections. We firstly make a literature review on the industry positioning and network research in order to provide a theoretical context and develop hypotheses for the empirical study. The empirical study is based on the firm and network-related data of the ICT sector. Finally, we discuss about the major managerial and academic implications of the results.",1

For almost 100 lines Cressida observes this parade, each soldier being identified by Pandarus, who “tell[s] them all by their names as they pass by” (Shakespeare 1988a: 1.2.180), offering a running commentary on their virtues even while he encourages Cressida to “mark Troilus above the rest”. “That’s Aeneas,” says Pandarus first: “is that not a brave man?” Next we meet Antenor of “shrewd wit” (“who’s that?” inquires Cressida); and then Hector, of “brave” countenance and many “hacks upon his helmet”. Paris follows, “gallant” and “brave”; then Helenus: “who’s that?” says Cressida again; “that’s Helenus,” says Pandarus, clearly distracted, “I marvel where Troilus is. That’s Helenus. I think he went not forth today. That’s Helenus. … I marvel where Troilus is. Hark, do you not hear the people cry ‘Troilus’?” (1.2.214–220). A stage direction tells us that Troilus enters at this point, and now we encounter the first difficulty of interpretation in this extract. “What sneaking fellow comes yonder?” Cressida asks. “Where? Yonder?” Pandarus queries, before replying: That’s Deiphobus.—’Tis Troilus! There’s a man, niece, h’m? Brave Troilus, … prince of chivalry! … Mark him, note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon him, niece. Look you how his … helm[’s] more hacked than Hector’s … O admirable youth! Paris? Paris is dirt to him, and I warrant Helen to change would give an eye to boot. (1.2.226–36) Then pass the common soldiers; “here comes more” says Cressida; “asses, fools, dolts” replies Pandarus, “Chaff and bran, chaff and bran. Porridge after meat” (1.2.226–236). There is an easy explanation for this dramatic parade: it is obviously a convenient way for the playwright to introduce to the audience many of the play’s characters. There being 25 of these, plus assorted servants, musicians and retainers, some form of introduction is necessary if we are not to be confused beyond measure by the comings and goings in this most mobile and populated of texts. But a reading of these lines that stopped at this observation would be one of very limited value. The Humanities in general and the discipline of English Literary Studies in particular take it to be axiomatic that language, even when it proclaims itself as such, is rarely transparent or straightforward; and that literary meaning (whether intrinsic to the text or produced in the engagement between text and reader) is virtually inexhaustible. So instead of being content with the proposition that this dialogue can be explained (or explained away) as a dramatic device serving one discrete purpose, a literary enquiry into its meanings and purposes would be more likely to complicate matters, subordinating the value of the purely instrumental to that inherent in questions more difficult to fix or contain. A literary scholar might suggest, for example, that the density of deictic expressions in this scene (“that, that, look you, that”; “Where? Yonder?”; “Here, Here, Here”) might emblematize the unsettling nature of the action that is to come, in which we seek in vain to find our place. She might hypothesize that the play’s technique—overturning the familiar, thwarting expectation, baffling our sense of what are proper and recognizable identities—also underlies the groundstrokes with which the warriors are painted here, as gallant, chivalric, manly, and brave, qualities which many of them are shown singularly to lack as the play goes on. And she might claim that even our one moment of difficulty, the apparent misrecognition of Troilus as a ‘sneaking fellow’ by the woman who says she loves him, or as Deiphobus by the man so concerned to have Cressida “mark” Troilus as a man self-evidently “above” all the rest may dovetail with the larger concerns manifest later in the play about recognition, identity and value. Is Cressida just pretending to misapprehend Troilus for a lesser, sneaking, fellow, either for the fun of winding her uncle up or to preserve her own worth in a world in which, because “men prize the thing ungain’d more than it is” (Shakespeare 1.2.285) it makes sense to understate your desire for another? Or is the moment proleptic of a later failure of discrimination on Cressida’s part, pointing to a possibility that the act of evaluation is always subject to error, or that worse still, such failures of evaluation betray the fact that there is nothing intrinsic there for anyone to value in the first place? It is certainly true that in fusing Cressida’s point of view with that of the audience, and allowing her to ventriloquize some of our own thoughts (“who’s that?”) this scene enables the efficient introduction of the play’s many characters. But it does much more than that. In establishing an empathetic connection to Cressida which it will later overturn, for example, it lays some of the groundwork for our later experience of the “radical discontinuity of character” for which Troilus and Cressida is so well-known (Dollimore 2004), and—far beyond the instrumental function it initially fulfills—it raises from the outset profound questions about identity, about knowing others and about recognizing who they are, that the ensuing play will proceed to explore. In this essay, I want to try to demonstrate what sort of things can be experienced as “difficult” in interpretative literary studies, and to try, through an interrogation of what the value of encounters with “difficulty” in Humanities study might be, to arrive at an articulation of some of the ways in which the Humanities themselves are of value, even in their least canonical manifestations. I have used Troilus and Cressida to open these questions in part because it may well be the most difficult of Shakespeare’s plays (“appallingly difficult”, in the words of Kermode (1955, p. 181); “experimentally” so, and “aimed at discriminating audiences whose judgments matter” in those of one of its more recent editors David Bevington (Shakespeare 1998, p. 11)) but also and more saliently because a key locus of its difficulty resides in its debate on the nature of value. Throughout this text, the play returns, time and again, to questions of what is valued, why things are valued, and whether we are right or wrong to value them as we do, but the play’s most explicit and sustained attention to these questions appears in the Trojan debate in act 2, scene 2 over what to do with Helen. This debate is itself dense, subtle and difficult—so tricky, in fact, that even Jonathan Bate, who’s recently used it to introduce a volume devoted to The Public Value of the Humanities, draws a questionable conclusion about the consequences of the respective arguments that are made in the course of it. Hector begins the quarrel by putting the case for giving Helen back, arguing that “she is not worth what she doth cost/ The holding”, a claim which Troilus counters with the question “What’s aught but as ’tis valued?” (2.2.50–51). For Bate, this remark constitutes an economistic understanding of value wherein is invoked the ultimate quantifiability of a commodity: the logical conclusion of Troilus’ question, Bate claims, is “that there will always come a point where the price is simply not worth paying” (Bate 2011a, p. 3). Now, the relation of “price” to “value” is dense and impenetrable in Troilus and Cressida, complex in the extreme and one reason for the difficulty of this discussion, but it is at least a plausible assumption that in fact, this is a consequence of Hector’s argument, not Troilus’. Hector, as we shall shortly see, is of the opinion that if something has intrinsic value, its price may be readily agreed by two people of equal and reasonable discernment. But Troilus’ question signals rather the impossibility of the reliable and stable quantification of anything, value being instead purely subjective, existing only in the eye of the beholder, the intrinsic worth of anything by extension only a chimera, at best, a folie a deux.Footnote 1 In this view, the value of any one thing as compared against any other can become infinitely greater than it: to borrow a metaphor from another play, it can “receiveth as the sea, naught enters there,/ Of what validity and pitch so e’er,/ But falls into abatement and low price,/ Even in a minute!” (Shakespeare 1988b, 1.1.11–15). Just as easily, it can be denuded of all value at the drop of a hat, when the fickle shape of fancy turns its attention to something else. That’s why Troilus’ question is so frightening, and perhaps why Hector’s reply is so fervent; in any case, it is certainly what Hector understands Troilus to mean, as his realist response makes clear: “But value dwells not in particular will./ It holds his estimate and dignity/ As well wherein ’tis precious of itself/ As in the prizer” (Shakespeare, Troilus and Cressida, 2.2.51–55). For reasons which will become clear later on in this essay, I want to hold on to the essential disagreement here between the relativist, destabilizing skepticism of Troilus, and the idealistic realism (if that is not a contradiction in terms) of Hector. Bate uses the debate to attack the current attempts to quantify the value of Humanities research, usefully historicizing the current contest over the Humanities through J. S. Mill’s account of the earlier quarrel between Benthamite utilitarianism and Coleridgean notions of a clerisy. The duties of the latter were “to preserve the stores and to guard the treasure of past civilization and thus to connect the present with the future” (Coleridge, quoted in Bate 2011, p. 12), a conception of the Humanities researcher’s role which Bate broadly endorses. Other contributors to his collection articulate other benefits issuing from Humanities disciplines: archaeology’s aid in helping us address issues such as global warming, for example (Pearson 2011); Cultural Geography’s contributions to tourism and the management of landscape (Daniels and Cowell 2011); the light that Humanities’ subjects can shed on political appeals to “Britishness” (Bate 2011), or on legal issues, where “the humanities alert us to those places where humanity itself has silently fallen from the scales of logic” (Watt 2011, p. 205). In the strongest of all of the contributions to the volume, Jürgen Zimmerer explains how history can aid our understanding of atrocity, can help its victims to overcome their trauma, and can even help prevent its repetition (Zimmerer 2011). Such defenses of the Humanities are a necessary response to what has widely been seen as an alarming diminution in the value publicly afforded them in recent years. A number of contemporary commentators have understood this diminution as signaling the profound reconfiguration of the role of the University more generally, wherein an older conception of it as “a vital democratic public sphere that cultivates … values necessary for the production of a democratic polity” is giving way to one which reconceives it as “a marketing machine essential to the production of neoliberal subjects” (Giroux 2011). In this view, the Humanities and qualitative social sciences epitomize the University’s civilizing function, constituting as they do the key locus within it wherein may be developed “a commitment to public values, social responsibilities and the broader demands of critical citizenship” (Giroux 2011). For this reason, such commentators argue, the Humanities become the primary “target” of an “extremist” “right-wing” whose assault on the intellectual nexus which best nurtures the “non-commodified values that might challenge the neoliberal worldview” is at once deliberate and self-conscious (Giroux 2011). This assault is achieved by a variety of means, most saliently in the UK by raising tuition fees in order to indebt the young, who will then have neither the time nor energy to challenge the old hegemonies, or (better still) will be forced to “choose” to study something with a more lucrative and less subversive potential in the first place. Giroux is one of the most outspoken of these thinkers, but critics far less politically radical than he agree with him that there is a tension between economistic models of education and the health of the Humanities: “the model of rational economic … choice” articulated in the Browne report, Stanley Fish argues in a recent opinion piece for The New York Times, “does not encourage investment in medieval allegory or modern poetry or Greek history” (Fish 2010). That it is the arts, Humanities and qualitative social sciences which have the most to lose in an instrumentalist reconfiguration of Higher Education (HE), of which the current English reforms are just one example, is incontestable, and that they nurture their students’ capacity for active engagement in critical citizenship is something that I hope to go on here concretely to demonstrate. But Giroux’s claim that such reforms bespeak a conscious intent to do away with disciplines in their entirety may be too undiscriminating (and hence potentially counterproductive) a conclusion. It would be faintly surprising, for instance, if the current UK cabinet saw no value at all in the Humanities and social sciences, given that the degrees of almost all of its members are uniformly distributed within those discipline groupings.Footnote 2 In fact, the majority of this group of politicians would probably argue in support of the intrinsic value of the subjects most disproportionately affected by the reforms they are endorsing. More consistent with this particular set of personal career trajectories is a slightly different belief: that the Humanities and social sciences are valuable only insofar as they are taught and learned in relatively elite institutionsFootnote 3 and that in the current UK HE landscape, they emblematize not so much the civilizing function of higher education, as the fact that over the past couple of decades it has been extended to too many people. It is notable, for example, that one likely consequence of the new market-driven HE landscape in the UK is the closure of institutions rendered insolvent by a new environment wherein elite universities may effectively take students from the quotas allotted to less prestigious ones; government intervention in such an eventuality is explicitly ruled out in the policy documents announcing the current reforms.Footnote 4
 The distinction I am making here—that current UK policies do not so much betray the opinion that the Humanities and social sciences are without intrinsic value as they do the view that there is no value in educating anyone other than a relatively small elite in them—might appear relatively inconsequential. But one of its implications is to suggest that we need to frame our defense of the Humanities and the social sciences not only in terms which focus on research and other forms of public “impact” (as is the case in Jonathan Bate’s volume, for example,) but also in ways which articulate the benefits that our disciplines generate for those who study them, most of whom will not end up as researchers in those disciplines, or even in work directly related to them. More particularly still, we need to explain what benefits the Humanities and Social Sciences confer on those who study them in institutions rather less elite than the almae matres of current UK cabinet members and to articulate why that should matter to those who do not study them at all.Footnote 5 For our disciplines are not under threat in all institutions: on the contrary, in England, they may even expand in elite Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), if elite HEIs wish to avail themselves of the opportunity to take on more highly paying students in subjects which are, we should recall, cheap to teach. But what is at risk is a cycle of decline in which the Humanities become increasingly, perhaps exclusively, the preserve of the privileged and the powerful. However, in order to defend the proposition that study of the Humanities has value also for the non-elite we must first address another prejudicial set of beliefs, which runs something like this: what is “worth” studying must be intrinsically “difficult”; the intrinsically “difficult” is out of reach for the relatively unsophisticated reader or student; almost all A-grade students will in future years be studying in elite institutions now that limitations on those institutions to recruit such students have in the UK been removed; it is therefore rational to limit degree courses in these subjects to a select number of institutions, because students in less prestigious HEIs only study relatively “easy” syllabi anyway, from which they will take away little of value. The view that the expansion of Higher Education has come at the expense of rigor and challenge is now a pervasive one (witness allegations about the proliferation of “Mickey Mouse degrees”, and perennial attacks on Media and Cultural Studies).Footnote 6 And what it presupposes is that difficulty, like value, “dwells not in a particular will,” but is inherent in the object; it takes, as it were, the same realist approach to difficulty that Hector adopts for value, locating difficulty in the text (or body of texts) rather than in the encounter between the text and its reader. There is a long tradition to this insistence and to its parallel or analogy with approaches to “value”, as well as to questions about the “meaning” of the literary text. As Fred Parker has argued, variant approaches to the construction of English Literature syllabi have tended to follow one of two oppositional approaches to the question of value. On the one hand, there is the Leavisite approach, akin to the Hector hypothesis, wherein priority is given to the artist whose literary production offers us a “view of life, and of the things giving it value, that makes the valued appear unquestionably more important than the valuer” (Parker 2005, p. 141, quoting F. R. Leavis, “Tragedy and the Medium”). The other (which is consonant with a Cultural Studies model, for example, and also with Troilus’ perspective that things are of value insofar as they are held in esteem) would insist that value lies not in the work itself, but in its apprehension, otherwise described as “the process of intellectual enquiry” into its terms and nature (Parker 2005, p. 141). A very similar dichotomy inhabits approaches to the ontology of the literary work wherein, as Paul B. Armstrong explains, “two untenably extreme positions mark the poles between which such an ontology must situate itself” (Armstrong 1990, p. 20). One is the conservative position that the text is a “pregiven entity that prescribes a right reading” (Armstrong here cites René Wellek); the other the view that “the work does not have an autonomous existence but instead depends completely on how it is interpreted” (Stanley Fish, for example). Much the same opposition often underlies approaches to the quality of “difficulty”. So for example, in his introduction to Just Being Difficult, a recent collection of essays on the debate over the difficulty of scholarly writing, Jonathan Culler claims that, “difficult writing … seeks to act on the reader, providing an experience as it structures experience” (Culler and Lamb 2003, p. 4), and Judith Butler argues that “one of the most important ways to call into question the status quo is by engaging language in nonconventional ways … because some of the most problematic views about reality have become sedimented in everyday parlance” (Butler 2003, p. 200). Difficulty is for these authors a property of the writing in question, inalienable from it, intrinsic to the work itself, a quality Culler ascribes to the literary as well as to the scholarly text: “When the object under consideration inhabits the literary canon,” he notes, “difficulty is treated as richness and intricacy, the very qualities that make literature an object of exegetical energy and classroom study” (Culler and Lamb 2003, p. 2). It is unclear whether this assumption stems from an attitude to the written word per se—a conviction that its perlocutionary force is somehow autonomous, independent of its reception—or from a preconception about readers, about whom these critics often assume a pronounced homogeneity, implied readers here all being extremely educated ones, occasionally graduate students, sometimes academics from fields such as Philosophy, but usually other literary critics. But there is a danger in this approach, which is that in categorizing writing as objectively “difficult” (or, by contrast, objectively “easy”), and in implying only an elite reader of it, it is relatively easy to slip to a position where one valorizes difficulty for its own sake to the extent to which its simplification or translation is characterized as, de facto, reductive.Footnote 7 This is the position attacked by Gerald Graff when he argues that “the equation of simplification with bad forms of … watering down is harmful” (Graff 2000, p. 1046); and it is also the position of those who hold that the value of a Humanities education begins and ends with the education of an elite. I am not intending to argue here that all texts are alike, difficult only insofar as they are experienced to be so: I do not share Troilus’ conviction that such things exist only in the eye of the beholder. But neither does the extreme pole of the Hector hypothesis analogy seem accurate: the claim, that is, that difficulty inheres only in the object. This cannot be so, for in that case, a piece of writing would be equally difficult to all readers at all times. Of course, that is not quite what Hector does say about value; he says that “value dwells not in particular will:/ It holds his estimate and dignity/ As well wherein ‘tis precious of itself/ As in the prizer”: value, in Hector’s view, exists both within the thing itself and in the eye of its beholder. From this position, there is less of a leap to a relational (as opposed to relative) property to value, or to difficulty, which might be a potential event in the reception of any piece of writing.Footnote 8 Even a lucid text may be difficult to those who have not yet acquired the knowledge to understand it, and, as Graff agues, a degree of “simplification is … a necessary aspect of any effective intellectual communication [including teaching]” (Graff 2000, p. 1046). But what value does an encounter with that kind of difficulty have, one where the text is relatively straightforward, but the reader feels challenged by it, or with something it provokes, nevertheless? To address this question, I want to turn to an instance of a real student experiencing some real difficulty with an ostensibly “easy” text. The following section of this essay, then, opens with a transcript of a discussion taped as part of an interdisciplinary projectFootnote 9 that aims to discover what actually takes place when English Literature is taught and learned in degree courses taking place in English universities of very different characters, traditions and access to resources (elite HEIs, middle-ranking non-Russell group ones, and inner-city “new” universities). Its focus is on ordinary, everyday seminars, which we tape and then analyze, sometimes returning to institutions to discuss our conclusions with the students and teachers whose seminars we have observed. In our analyses of these extracts (texts, as it were, of the classroom) we try to utilize literary methods and approaches (such as close reading, for example, or attitudes towards the relative complexities of superficial and underlying meanings of texts), the application of which to non-literary discourse aims to model the value of what English—the discipline—itself does, and tries to teach. In the discussion from which the following extract is taken, students at an institution which I will call Brancaster City University (BCU) were taking an elective module in Disability Studies as part of their various degree programs. Some were reading Single Honours English, some combining English with other subjects; some were studying full-time, others part-time (BCU allows up to 9 years for the completion of an undergraduate degree). BCU is an inner-city university in a northern English town; it is a “new university”Footnote 10 in the fourth quartile of most league tables.",

As Marx often noted, world market integration tends to universalise competition and, in so doing, to generalise and intensify the contradictions of capital accumulation on a world scale. Globalisation is a recent catchphrase for this process, with important ideological effects. It is an obfuscating description for a new form of imperialism that depends less on territorial conquest and enclosure within military, commercial, or other barriers than on the capacity to dominate the division of labour, commodity chains and financial flows on a world scale. The key stake here is competition among transnational companies to achieve the most profitable organisation of the global division of labour across different scales and sites. This continually rebases the modalities of competition and reinforces its treadmill effects for all market actors. Competition occurs on a stratified rather than level playing field. As the modes of this stratification alter, so do the patterns and dynamics of competition. Changes can occur in the weight of different markets (mainly financial, industrial, commercial and intellectual) in setting the parameters of competition, in the relative super- and sub-ordination of different forms of competition and in the corporate forms assumed by competition setters in different markets (Jessop 2002). The dominant competitive forces are those that set the terms of competition in the most important market. It is important to note here that economic competition includes ‘extra-economic’ factors, forces and capacities, and this is increasingly seen in the KBE. Lastly, the state's capacity to promote competitiveness depends on its ability to adapt relevant strategies to the place of its local, regional, cross-border, national or multi-national economic spaces and their key economic actors in the changing hierarchies of competition in the world market. From a cultural political economy perspective, which integrates the cultural turn into critical political economy, the economy has both semiotic (discursive) and extra-semiotic (material) aspects, which co-exist and influence each other. Considered as the sum of all economic activities, the economy is too complex to be fully grasped in real time by economic actors or external observers. This forces them to engage in simplification as a condition of ‘going on’ in the economic world. Different entry points and standpoints lead to different economic imaginaries that identify different subsets of economic actions and relations as objects of observation, calculation, regulation, governance or transformation (Jessop 2004, pp. 159–174; Jessop 2008, pp. 11–39). While all social agents (individuals, groups, organisations, movements, etc.) are forced to engage in such simplifications as a condition of ‘going on’, not all simplifications are created equal. There is wide variation in economic imaginaries. If they are to prove more than ‘arbitrary, rationalistic, and willed’ (Gramsci 1971, pp. 376–377), these imaginaries must have some significant, albeit necessarily partial, correspondence to real material interdependencies in the actually existing economy or, especially in periods of crisis, to feasible alternative economic arrangements. This poses the question of the performative force of economic imaginaries in shaping the economic realm. It highlights the need to explore the discursive and material factors and forces that shape the selection and retention of hegemonic, sub-hegemonic, counter-hegemonic, or marginal accounts of the economy, its dynamic, and its conditions of existence (Sum 2005; Sum and Jessop 2013). Each imaginary depicts the economic world in its own way (albeit with scope for overlap, articulation and hybridisation) and those that become hegemonic or sub-hegemonic help to shape economic orders and embed them in wider ensembles of social relations. Marginal and counter-hegemonic imaginaries also affect economic conduct in their own ways and, in some circumstances, may become more influential shaping accumulation regimes, modes of regulation and modes of material provisioning. Viewed in these terms, competition is both a real process that ‘works behind the backs of the producers’ (and other economic actors) through the metaphorical ‘invisible hand of the market’ (and other processes that bear on the outcome of competition) and a simplifying reference point for orienting economic action that can never fully grasp all of the factors that shape the competitive process and its outcomes. This distinction is one way to make sense of the simultaneity of the ‘invisible hand’ metaphor and the recurrent efforts of social actors to shape the ways in which markets operate and to enhance their chances of success in competition. The factors, actors and forces relevant to economic competition and economic competitiveness are essentially contested, inherently relational and often politically controversial notions. We illustrate these claims below for theoretical paradigms, policy paradigms and knowledge brands concerned with the KBE. Definitions and discourses of competition and competitiveness date back centuries and are linked to different economic imaginaries at different times and in different contexts. Thus, mercantilist notions from the seventeenth century tied to state policies to control trade and increase financial reserves can be contrasted with 1890s imperialism oriented to state enclosure of territory for military-political as well as geo-economic goals. Following the transition from classical imperialism to a more liberal post-war order (in the shadow of US hegemony), competition focused more on domestic growth and multinational foreign investment, leading to conflicts between techno-nationalism and techno-globalism (Ostry and Nelson 1995; Ruggie 1982). Further, with the rise of the current neo-liberal transnational financial order and the theoretical and policy interest in the globalising knowledge-based economy, competition has refocused on innovation (including in finance and securitisation) and how best to link extra-economic factors to the ‘demands’ of economic competition. Given these complexities, it is hardly surprising that contemporary economists disagree about the relevant units of competition. Some argue that only owners of economic resources (such as firms, banks, workers, and households) compete and that it is mistaken to treat cities, regions, nations, or supranational blocs (such as the European Union) as units of competition (e.g., Krugman 1994, pp. 342–365.). Others argue that these entities can, indeed, compete and that the outcomes of such competition can be measured (e.g., Porter 1990). Yet, it is unclear whether this is literally true, metaphorically plausible, or merely rhetorically useful—each interpretation having different implications for how to define competition, understand competitive strategies, and evaluate success. Overall, while the critics are right that ‘economies’ (as imaginatively construed subsets of all economic activities) are not real subjects capable of more or less strategic economic action, they err insofar as real agents do identify ‘economies’ (construed at different scales and in different ways) as engaged in competition, consider that their material and/or ideal interests may be affected as a result, and act on this perception in a more or less concerted manner. This can occur for political or military as well as economic reasons and is reflected in the rise of ‘competition states’ at different scales of political organisation. A competition state seeks to secure economic growth within its borders and/or to secure competitive advantages for capitals based in its borders, even where these capitals operate abroad, by promoting the economic and extra-economic conditions that are currently deemed vital for success in economic competition with economic actors and spaces located in other states (cf. Cerny 1990; Jessop 2002; Hirsch 1995). Competitiveness refers to the capacity to engage in competition (whether or not this capacity is fully realised) and, as such, varies with the features of the relevant form of competition. There are many ways to define and measure it, and current policy debates indicate the political issues that are at stake. Key indicators in the post-war period include factor endowments; unit labour costs; productivity increases; relative prices, costs and exchange rates; labour market flexibility; shares in world exports or ratios of foreign penetration of home markets; ready access to cheap capital; and ease of setting up new businesses. Given these concerns, real subjects may try to enhance macro-economic competitiveness either because of its perceived impact on the overall competitiveness of individual firms operating in a given national economic space or because of how it affects other objectives—economic (e.g., trade balance, employment, inflation) or non-economic (e.g., electoral consequences or military capacities). When this occurs, it is indicative of the transition from the study of competition and competitiveness from the viewpoint of rival theoretical paradigms to the design of policies and strategies to promote competition (because of faith in the benefits and virtues of market forces) and/or to enhance the competitiveness of specific economic agents, associated stakeholders, and sites of such competition. This marks the shift from theoretical paradigm to policy paradigm for economic imaginaries and discourses concerned with competition and competitiveness (Sum 2010, pp. 184–203). It is depicted, with a subsequent transition from policy paradigm to knowledge brand, in Table 1. We develop the idea of knowledge brand in ‘The Disciplinary Power of Policy Paradigms and Knowledge Brands’. Once deemed relevant, macro-economic competitiveness can be targeted for action. However, the definition of competitiveness, the target variables, and the strategies adopted are all discursively constituted and will vary from case to case. In some cases, extra-economic factors can prove crucial (e.g., tariff and non-tariff barriers to trade, access to state subsidies) as can even broader social factors. This extends economic competition to a virtual competition among entire societal regimes mediated through the audit of the world market and increases pressures to (develop the capacity to) valorise a wide range of extra-economic institutions and relations. Examples include social capital, trust, collective learning capacities, institutional thickness, untraded interdependencies, and local amenities and culture. Overall, this involves redrawing the boundaries between the economic and the extra-economic such that more of the latter are drawn directly into the process of the valorisation of capital. A well-known periodisation of competition and competitiveness strategies is that proposed by Michael Porter, a Harvard Business School professor, management consultant, and policy adviser. Already highly regarded for his analyses of firm- and industry-level competition (Porter 1980), 1985), he turned to study the competitiveness of nations, later generalising his findings to competition among cities, regions, inner cities and regional blocs. He distinguished four successive stages in the competition among nations: factor-driven competition (based on static comparative advantage); investment-driven competition (based on dynamic allocative advantage); innovation-led competition (based on Schumpeterian entrepreneurship leading to creative destruction); and wealth-driven competition (based on the legacies and prestige of past success, e.g., in luxury goods, art markets, consultancy) (Porter 1990). These stages could also be seen as modes of competition in so far as they can be combined in different ways in any actually existing economy. While knowledge is relevant to all four stages, or modes, of competition (for there is no economic activity without some form of tacit or explicit knowledge), the concept of KBE is strongly linked to innovation-led competition and the role of the reflexive application of knowledge to identify and pursue opportunities for innovation that are likely to improve competitive advantages (we return to the problematic status of the KBE in our next section). Porter related competitiveness, regardless of the relative primacy of each mode or stage in competition, to the interaction among four key factors: demand conditions, factor conditions, firm strategy, structure and rivalry and related and supporting industries. These were reinforced by ‘chance’ and the ‘government’ as additional, but not decisive, factors (see Fig. 1). For Porter, the co-evolution of these factors creates the “micro-economic foundations of prosperity” that enable national firms to gain and sustain competitive advantages to the benefit of the national territories in which they were located. These foundations are strongest when they form a ‘cluster’, i.e., ‘a geographic concentration of competing and cooperating companies, suppliers, service providers, and associated institutions (e.g., universities, standards agencies, trade associations) in a particular field that compete but also cooperate’ (Porter 2000, p. 16).Footnote 1 Such concentration enhances interaction among the four factors to boost productivity, growth, employment and, hence, competitiveness. Similar ideas about the spatial factors making for competitiveness have been advanced in other contexts by scholars from other theoretical traditions, both mainstream and heterodox, some of which criticise an emphasis on the primary role of market forces as the drivers of competition (on ‘the other canon’ in classical political economy and recent heterodox work on economic dynamics, see Reinert 1995, 2007). Porter’s diamond model of national advantage. Source: Porter (1990, p. 127) Thus, rather than living in an increasingly ‘flat world’ (Friedman 2005; Augustine 2007) in which all factors of production for goods and services are mobile and respond readily and quickly to changing market conditions, the competitive ‘playing field’ is better described as striated and even ‘spiky’ (on the latter, see Florida 2005). It involves an uneven terrain with uneven flows, differential frictions and unevenly distributed capacities to enhance local, regional or national competitive advantages. New forms of ‘stickiness’ are thereby created in the competition for skilled labour, investment and innovation. In these conditions, territorial planning, place-building (or at least place-marketing), developing institutionally thick local or regional networks and connecting different scales of economic, political and social organisation are important factors in taking the ‘high road’ to competitiveness rather than engaging in a ‘race to the bottom’. Education institutions often become important factors in these strategies (for a recent study of problems of competitiveness in the USA and the need to build coherent ecosystems of innovation, see Augustine 2007). One of the most influential policy paradigms concerned with the geography of competitiveness (including in the higher education field) is that of Michael Porter, who is busy translating these insights into marketable, branded knowledge.",68
4.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,08 November 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-012-0118-3,The Right to University: the Question of Democracy in the Polis at a Time of Crisis,March 2013,Asimina Karavanta,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Athens, January 2011. Three hundred immigrants with no documents traveled from Heraklion, Crete, to Athens to protest against the government for taking no measures to change their status as illegal workers, although they had been working in Greece for over a decade. To make themselves visible in the polis, they occupied the renovated but still empty buildings of the Law School of Athens located in the center of the city, in Sina Street, where they kept their hunger strike going for over a month. Protected by the university asylum law that the new bill on tertiary education was to abolish a few months later in August 2011, they left of their own will when a shelter was provided to them by the owners of the Hypatia Mansion, a short distance away from the university. During their occupation of the public university building, the university became a site of contest and contestation: did they have a right to be there? Is the public university a site where the conflict between citizen and denizen,Footnote 1 the polis and the communities transforming it, and between national laws and human rights should be fought? This event provoked a debate about the role of the public university, the crisis, and the question of democracy; not surprisingly, the foreigner, the university, the polis, and the general role of thinking in society were critically constellated at a time of national and global crisis—a crisis that is clearly not only a crisis of the banking system but also of democracy itself. The event also betrays the fate that the university and polis share within the context of globalization; the economic, political, and cultural effects of globalization on the university and the polis demonstrate how the distance of the university and, especially, the field of the humanities, as its symbolic cultural and educational capital, from the polis is suspended and transformed, especially in the face of the denizen, whose statelessness becomes both a political and an epistemological problem. The anxiety about the university and the role of philosophy and the humanities is not a new phenomenon; it most probably came into being with the inception of the university as a modern institution. What transformed this anxiety in the 1990s, however, as several seminal texts of the decade reveal, was the fate of the humanities in a university that was being transformed into a corporate institution. Texts such as Jacques Derrida's Du
Droit à la Philosophie (1991),Footnote 2 William V. Spanos's The End of Education. Towards Posthumanism (1993), Bill Readings's The University in Ruins (1996), and Peggy Kamuf's The Division of Literature or the University In Deconstruction (1997) delineate the cultural, epistemological, and political stakes of this transformation, which threatens to subject the role and purpose of the university to the market values and political interests of a neoliberal democracy that promotes a corporate culture.Footnote 3 Each of these texts responds to a process of educational reform that contrived to subordinate the mission of the university to the ideology of a “techno-democratic humanism” (Derrida 2004, p. 163), what Spanos in another context calls an “amnesiac” and “violently disinterested” humanism (Spanos 1993). This process of subordination is represented as an irrefutable necessity, at the expense of philosophy, theory, and literary studies and the humanities as a whole. Instigated by the crisis of the university as institution, these texts best represent the corporatization of the university, its transformation into what Readings calls a “bureaucratic corporation” (Readings 1996, p. 20). Walter Mignolo offers a succinct summary of this process with particular reference to the effects of this corporatization on the state universities in ex-Third World countries and the formerly colonized world: What I conceive of as the “corporate” university is the type of university that in industrialized countries has been displacing the Kantian-Humboldtian tradition since the 1970s. Its best model is the U.S. university (see Wallerstein 1997). In ex-Third World countries the “model” began to be imposed in the late 1980s, but more clearly after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The first manifestations of the newly imposed “quality control” of the faculty as well as of departments and special programs, in Argentina or in Mexico, were the demands that professors publish in refereed journals, account for their research and publications periodically, and so on. Another manifestation has been the progressive deterioration of major state universities, and the parallel and complementary divergence between accumulation of money and accumulation of meaning, characteristic of capitalism and Western universities (Mignolo 2003, pp. 101–102). In the second decade of the twenty-first century, it appears that Mignolo's analysis of the corporate university culture as a neo-colonial force in ex-Third World countries whose universities are now modernized according to standards of efficiency and quality control also applies to the “First World,” at least to Europe. The deterioration of the public character of the state university in Europe, the increase of tuition fees, the rapid dwindling of funding for research and teaching in the humanities, the recent closing down of philosophy and classical studies programs in the UK and other European countries, and the threat posed to the humanities in the wake of the implementation of the Bologna ProcessFootnote 4 would seem to point to the exhaustion of the university as an institution founded on the principles of reason and the nation-state, the superstructure and infrastructure of the European Enlightenment. The recent new bill on tertiary education that was voted in by the Greek parliament in August 2011 is a case in point. Passed with a majority of votes (250 out of 300), made up of the socialist party (PASOK), the right wing party of the opposition (Nea Democratia), and a smaller extreme right wing party called LAOS (Populist Orthodox Alert), the bill was celebrated by the government and the media as promising for future political collaborations and parliamentary consent in the midst of a raging economic, political, and democratic crisis. This bill is symptomatic of how a specific implementation of the kind of internationalized education envisaged by the Bologna Process is not always positive, at least not in so far as the humanities and their evaluation according to market values are concerned. The underlying principles of the Bologna Process may not sound so threatening; in fact for some, they set out the unifying principles for the constitution of a European university system defined by excellenceFootnote 5: the promise of mobility, the opening of the university to market values that can secure proper measurement of professorial productivity rates (in terms of peer-reviewed publications, research grants, etc.) as well as of students' professional success in the job market, the implementation of unified evaluation and measurement criteria that safeguard the accountability of the university to the market—but not necessarily to the polis—and, thus, the cash flow from grants and external funding, and, finally, the internationalization of university studies. The Bologna Process represents these principles as survival strategies for the university in a globalized economy, in which the nation-state has become a very weak economic player, especially in the case of small countries like Greece with a decrepit economy made worse since the intervention of the International Monetary Fund and its implementation of austere economic measures that have brought production to a standstill. This last principle, the internationalization of the university, a key term in the Bologna Process and in the recent Greek bill on tertiary education, which calls for its full implementation in the public universities, reveals the agenda for the corporatization of the university. The university is forced to restructure itself by way of answering to the market and its needs. The bill and the Bologna Process require the European university to produce knowledges and prepare experts for the market and limit or even shut down programs that are not productive and useful in this sense. Within this context, certain disciplines within the humanities like philosophy and literature become redundant and begin to haunt the university like the denizens and stateless peoples who live in the polis but belong nowhere and are treated like waste, less than human. It is ironic that the humanities, and especially the disciplines of philosophy and literature that insist on the question of the human, are forced into a position of academic statelessness and are becoming pariahs within the walls of the universities. To acquire funding and remain economically viable, the various university disciplines need to prove their excellence, a term which, in the climate of the corporate university, is equated with marketability. The more money a discipline or a program secures for the university from the market through third party funding, the more economically viable it becomes. A literary project is bound not to get the same funding opportunities as a project from the field of biotechnology, for instance. This has created a vicious circle in which very few fields within the humanities that can prove their economic viability in the market by outsourcing funding can, at the same time, be academically useful in the university. Following Readings's analysis, the “idea of excellence” as a corporate idea that serves the interests of transnational capital understands “internationalization” in strictly economic terms that actually demands the severance of the university's ties with the local—its people, their polis, and the democratic system.Footnote 6 To be international is to be competitive and successful in economic terms: to bring funds from private corporations into the public university in order to save it. At least in Europe, where the public university is still central to the tertiary education sector of most countries, this has so far meant the closing down or shrinking of programs in philosophy and literary studies. But without philosophy and literary studies, without the humanities, can we still talk about the university? In his close reading of Immanuel Kant's The Conflict of the Faculties, Derrida draws on Kant's analysis of philosophy as the founding discipline of the university to emphasize that without a philosophy department in the university, there is no university. The concept of universitas is more than the philosophical concept of a research and teaching institution; it is the concept of philosophy itself, and is Reason, or rather the principle of reason as institution. […] Though inferior in power, philosophy ought “to control” (controlliren) all other faculties in matters arising from truth, which is of “the first order,” while utility in the service of government is of “the second order.” (Derrida 2004, p. 105) The death of philosophy in the university and the subsequent disappearances of theoretical, philosophical, and literary programs and studies can only mean that the university has become something else, a school of instruction for the acquisition of skills and professional expertise. How can we resist this process without reducing the public university to a parochial mentality that refuses to accept the need for accountability at the national and transnational level? How can we define rather than measure this accountability and respond to the local and global transformations that are taking place in the economy and society? How can we reconfigure the role of the humanities without reducing them to techno-democratic humanism (Derrida 2004, p. 163)? And finally, how can we strengthen the role of the university not in the market, but in the public spaces of democracies, which are threatened and debilitated by transnational capitalism, something we need to do not simply for the sake of jobs for students but also to defend their right to democratic forms of labor and, most importantly, their right to form communities? These are, I think, central questions when it comes to the task of thinking the university today. Not very much has changed since Spanos, Readings, Kamuf, and Derrida entered the fray on behalf of the university; but the little which has changed is promising: more so now than then, we are aware of the university's responsibility to respond to the need to rethink community and democracy within the state and beyond the nation in “postnational” and “trans-modern” Footnote 7 terms. In other words, the fundamental challenge is the same, to save the university, but the context has been radically transformed by the waning of democracy in Europe and the urgent calls for democratic reform in Europe and other parts of the world. Recent insurgencies, both within Europe and beyond its borders, attest to the urgent need to rethink community in the wake of the collapse of the nation-state into the global economy and the eruption of other types of community present but not visible in Europe and outside it. Maybe the hope of the university is to be found in (or even founded on) the events of insurgency and their enabling possibilities of creating affiliations between different communities “at loose ends”—another form of enabling the “community of dissensus” (Readings 1996, pp. 180–193) and the politics of “disagreement” as the political prerequisite of democracy (Rancière 1999);Footnote 8 students demonstrating for a new contract of education, citizens and denizens claiming their right to rights and work in the face of an economy of expedience that makes them redundant, immigrants fighting for their right to belong, and undocumented peoples for their right to become visible and appear in the polis. How can the university educate the privileged to do the work of affiliation, and how can it continue to open itself to the non-privileged constituencies who cannot afford to pay their fees? The recent increase of tuition fees in England and now also in Canada is a case in point: working class students, for instance, it seems, will find it impossible to get a university education; in view of the rise of unemployment, only a few will take out student loans and even fewer will afford to pay them off. How can the university educate citizens and non-citizens about new models of citizenship, about being trans-modern actors, about a range of cosmopolitical subjects with responsibility, and an attitude of openness towards radical changes at home and in the wider world? How can it become a trans-modern and postnationalFootnote 9 institution relevant to the polis at a time when democracy is failing or even “hated” to invoke Jacques Rancière's provocative term (Hatred of Democracy)?",

Thus, ancient ideals of citizenship and of the purpose of a liberal education can serve to defamiliarize the contemporary “hegemonic economic imaginary” of the knowledge-based economy.Footnote 2 The term “hegemonic economic imaginary” was originally coined by Bob Jessop. According to Jessop, the purportedly knowledge-based economy, as the “hegemonic economic imaginary” of the contemporary conjuncture, is the discursive frame through which economic (as well as social) activities are viewed (Jessop 2008, p. 18). However, this discursive preponderance of the concept does not necessarily mean that it constitutes an accurate reflection of the economic role played by knowledge production in relation to other economic sectors. While a detailed examination of this economic role goes beyond the scope of this article, Jessop also points out that no “hegemonic economic imaginary” can ever exhaustively describe the whole set of economic activities undertaken by a specific society, which, at the very least, leaves room for doubt as to whether the concept of the knowledge-based economy is actually apposite. In this context, however, it is important to stress that the idea of the knowledge-based economy, which is the governing principle behind much current higher education policy and the reforms of Higher Education Institutions is, in the first instance, a discursive phenomenon. Thus, Benoit Godin calls the knowledge-based economy an umbrella concept, which is, at least in its contemporary incarnation, largely rhetorical in function (Godin 2006, p. 23). Under consideration in this article is, therefore, first of all, the effect that the discursive shift to the knowledge-based economy as the “hegemonic economic imaginary” of the contemporary conjuncture has had on perceptions of the role of the humanities. In using Greek and Roman ideals of citizenship and education to defamiliarize contemporary hegemonic discourse, this article also investigates whether aspects of these ideals can still serve as a template for a more adequate understanding of the importance of the humanities for contemporary democratic societies.Footnote 3

Humanities Versus the Natural and Social Sciences in Modern Germany",March 2013,Roberto Sala,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In the last few years, with major countries such as Great Britain and France cutting higher education funding, voices proclaiming the “crisis of the humanities” have intensified. However, scholars have been warning for decades that the standing of the humanities in the university is in jeopardy. Worried about the future of disciplines such as literature or philosophy, the international academic community has identified two main causes of the crisis (Ermert and Gürtler 1989; Hall 1990; Remak 2004; Gruner 2007). Firstly, universities tend to privilege the natural sciences because of their applicability.Footnote 1 Secondly, the humanities have lost legitimacy as their social value is no longer recognized by politics or society. Both statements form part of a more general critique of higher education policies that are based on an instrumentalist view of knowledge. In this context, scholars stress the need for critical thinking and a sense of cultural heritage, arguing that the humanities contribute to protecting democratic societies from radical economization processes (Nussbaum 2010). At first glance, the history of science would seem to confirm the view of the natural sciences and technology eroding the position of forms of knowledge related to the study of cultural phenomena. Starting in the eighteenth century, close ties between industrialization and the experimental sciences shaped the development of modern societies (Mokyr 2002). Since Weber formulated his theory of capitalism, the natural sciences have been regarded as a core element of Western modernity, having induced the rise of rationalism and the “disenchantment” of the world (Schluchter 2009: 9–13). The common reduction of “modern science” to natural scientific thought reflects the latter’s undisputed successes since the Enlightenment (Rossi 2001). In the past two centuries, disciplines such as physics, chemistry, and medicine have undoubtedly gained increasing legitimacy both in the academic and social fields. By linking the crisis of the humanities to the progress of the natural sciences, however, there is a danger of misrepresenting both of them as monolithic epistemic cultures. From this perspective, one can easily overlook the fact that the “humanities” as well as the “natural sciences” have never represented a coherent ensemble of disciplines. Rather, they have enabled single branches of knowledge to acquire authority by identifying themselves with broader paradigms of scholarly knowledge already well established. Although Germany’s universities have not been subjected to significant cuts, scholars of the humanities feel the crisis of their field of studies even here. In spite of being intensified by the recent international developments mentioned above, the widespread uncertainty within humanistic disciplines does not depend only on short-term higher education policies. Looking at its deep-rooted tradition in the humanities, the German case is symptomatic of the deeper reasons for the “crisis”, whose origins can be traced back to the core phase of industrial modernity. Focusing on the debates which took place among German scholars between the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, this article looks at the discourse surrounding the humanities within the context of the struggle for resources in the academic field. The analysis focuses on the competition with other epistemic categories. On the one hand, the conflict between the “two cultures”—humanities and natural sciences—must be questioned in order to evaluate its real significance. On the other hand, with social sciences having developed an alternative paradigm, a “third culture”, they will need to be taken into account as well. In fact, although the development of the social sciences did not lead to a polarized conflict with the humanities, the social sciences still challenged the status of the humanities as a scientific discourse. Rather than providing an extensive historical overview, the aim here is to clarify some central theoretical issues concerning the relationship between academic disciplines and society. A central assumption of the article’s argument is that macrocategories such as the humanities constitute, to a large extent, the result of the quest for legitimacy in academia, and must therefore be examined in relation to the prestige disputes which deeply characterize universities as institutions (Bourdieu 1988 [1984]). From this perspective, the article argues that the distinction of the humanities and the natural sciences as it is commonly understood—which forms an important basis of contemporary higher education policy—is a historically contingent construct that does not correspond to “ontological features” of knowledge. Discourses on different knowledge cultures shaped the social position of science in part independently from actual epistemic contents and methodological approaches.",
4.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,10 November 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-012-0123-6,Symbiotic Learning Systems: Reorganizing and Integrating Learning Efforts and Responsibilities Between Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) and Work Places,March 2013,Olav Eikeland,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Inherited conventional and linear models of learning, research, knowledge transfer, application, and innovation (cf. Stokes 1997) would seem to presuppose that Research which produces general theories is primarily done in institutions separate from and extraneous to the objects studied, and separate, extraneous, and prior to practice/performance/application. Knowledge is transmitted, embodied, and embedded primarily didactically and theoretically through positive teaching and through explicit design and instruction. People are finished with education in their youth and merely work afterwards. Learning is conceived as the appropriation of knowledge produced by others (preferably researchers, at least research based and “evidence based”). Practice is conceived as the application of knowledge, techniques, inventions, innovations, precepts, and rules made by others (preferably researchers, research and “evidence based”). Organizations are similar to machines (or organisms) where all parts and members (as cog-wheels or organs) perform their niche tasks and where all unoccupied leisure is seen as unproductive “slack” and time wasted. These are modernist ideas, and to a large extent, the institutions of modernity (increasingly since the revolution of natural science in the seventeenth century) have been both based and shaped on more or less implicit or explicit assumptions like these in their divisions of labor and ideas about learning and knowledge transmission or diffusion. These ideas have probably never been quite true. But at least within the emerging socially distributed knowledge management regime (some would say “post-modernist regime”), research is no longer done merely in separate research institutions, knowledge and competence is not merely based on and generated through extraneous research, knowledge is no longer merely transmitted through teaching, and competent practical performance is not (and probably never was) merely the application of separately and externally produced theories or rules. Individual lifelong learning is needed and encouraged, learning is increasingly practice-based, organizations need to learn and change continuously, learning and knowledge transfer happen through widespread networks and ICT, and thinking, reflecting, planning, and controlling are required at all levels in an organization. As a consequence, old ways of coordinating collective practices and work are challenged. Also, as a cumulative consequence of these long-term societal changes, work based learning and organizational learning and research must be upgraded at all levels. When we realize that knowledge and competence are as much (or even primarily) generated in the context of practice, performance, and enactment, not outside, before, or after, the very idea that knowledge should (and actually must) first be produced by externally based researchers and institutions and then transmitted afterwards by equally external educational institutions in order finally to be applied by so-called practitioners (by following precepts, formal instructions, or orders), cannot remain unchallenged.Footnote 7 Concerning the education of professionals, the temporary internship (or so-called practicum) as a limited part of basic education constitutes a too weak link between education and work, and, at the same time, it is too poorly organized with regard to learning.Footnote 8
 As a response to some of these changes, there are many ongoing discussions about collaboration between research and business, and many efforts at closing the gap between academia and external practical contexts. But recent innovation theories about triple helix alliances between HEIs, government, and industry (cf. for example, Etzkowitz 2008), and similar theories tend to focus more on research than on education and learning, and, at the same time, they seem mostly to focus on relations between these parties more or less as they are currently constituted; thus, their relations are envisaged in terms of the commercialization of research ideas through their transformation into products and entrepreneurship. The more or less implicit starting point and model for these theories is natural science and technology. Linear innovation and diffusion models may be appropriate in areas where specialized researchers are true pioneers at frontiers never before visited by human beings and where specialized technology is needed (typically micro- and macro-cosmic fields of exploration and exploitation). Using the same models for areas where researchers normally are the last to arrive (as in all kinds of social research) is considerably more problematic. In addition, most educations for professions (lawyers, psychologists, teachers, social workers, nurses, etc.) are not directly concerned with the inner workings of nature and technology. In their professional practice, they relate to nature and technology mostly as users. In different ways, professional practice concerns relations between people and relates more to the social sciences and humanities as basic disciplines. Yet if and when triple helix approaches and models are transferred to the mostly non-technological professions, they seem to retain a linear model of innovation and diffusion, where knowledge is produced by external research methods and researchers. Slightly differently, however, from the emphasis in most of the literature on innovation and collaboration between universities, business, and government, the reconfiguration of collaboration needed concerns the basis, form, and content of learning, development work, and formal education as much as it concerns specialist research where results are “transferred” and “implemented” afterwards. Although symbiotic learning is not completely incompatible with linear transfer and technical innovation models, their integration is not merely a question of simple combination. It is rather a question of fusion and transformation needing philosophical and methodological attention, as the reconfiguration concerns ways of knowing (gnoseology) and research methodology.Footnote 9
 Symbiotic learning systems must be based on trying to produce, develop, and improve social and professional knowledge as explications of ways of doing things from within professional and organizational practices. They must utilize organizational learning and learning through professional practice, also for academic purposes. Hence, without diminishing the emphasis on research, the idea of a “symbiosis” between work based learning and the graduation system in higher education starts with the way work places are either organized or disorganized with respect to conditions for learning; the way work place organizations either promote or deter systematic, critical, self-evaluative, practice-based learning. By rethinking and integrating both education and research into organizational and work based learning, some of the mismatch and transmission costs can be lowered between academia and work. Immediate relevance and “applicability” is a constant concern of work life, and academic freedom, standards, and values are the concerns of HEIs. If sufficient care is taken, a closer integration does not necessarily endanger any of these. On the contrary, symbiotic learning systems will probably be better both concerning the relevance and implementation of learning and knowledge, and when it comes to generating conceptual understanding and theoretical insight, if not in every field, at least in professional practice, organizational knowledge, and social science.Footnote 10

4.0,2.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,02 February 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-012-0083-x,Special Issue on Smart Cities and the Future Internet in Europe,June 2013,Nicos Komninos,Marc Pallot,Hans Schaffers,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"This Special Issue of the Journal of the Knowledge Economy focuses on how advanced European cities develop strategies towards becoming “smart cities”, based on the many possible innovative usages of network infrastructures and Internet-based applications, through the engagement of open innovation ecosystems. Part of these strategies is to develop new types of innovation approaches in urban areas, which are characterized, firstly, by a high level of citizen involvement in co-creating Internet-based applications in all sectors of the economy and society; secondly, by the emergence of new forms of collaboration among local governments, research institutes, universities, and companies. Such strategies and the resulting “innovation ecosystems” are becoming increasingly relevant given the growing economic and social issues and opportunities that cities are currently facing. This special issue investigates these smart city strategies through four smart city case studies and two papers addressing horizontal issues. The case studies aim to analyze the currently emerging strategies and policies related to identify how the opportunities of the Future Internet are being used for the socio-economic development of urban areas. The four cases also address how cities are redefining their innovation structures and how they started to experiment citizens involvement within the context of open innovation, and present lessons learned that are of interest to smart city stakeholders. The term “smart cities” has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Many cities have initiated smart city initiatives. In its Digital Agenda, the European Commission considers cities as innovation drivers in areas such as health, environment, inclusion and business. The concept of smart cities captures different meanings, and we must look beyond superficial use of the term for the purpose of pure city marketing. We aim to shed more light on this concept of smart cities, in particular focusing on the defining role of the Internet and user-driven innovation. A useful definition is to call a city “smart” when “investments in human and social capital and traditional (transportation) and modern (ICT-based) infrastructure fuel sustainable economic growth and a high quality of life, with a wise management of natural resources, through participatory government” [3]. To this, the notion of empowerment of citizens and “democratic innovation” should be added, which was introduced by Von Hippel [26]. Other definitions have tried to identify key characteristics such as smart economy, smart mobility, smart environment, smart living, smart people, smart governance, and define rankings based on measurable underlying indicators. Smart cities can be also understood as places generating a particular form of spatial intelligence and innovation, based on sensors, embedded devices, large data sets, and real-time information and response. While these definitions are relevant for benchmarking or for placing emphasis on specific development aspects, they are merely based on top down views. There is a need for research on effective strategies of cities to become smarter, taking into account the particular context, strengths and opportunities, and urban development objectives, and on approaches mobilizing the participation and intelligence of citizens, companies and societal organizations. The papers collected in this Special Issue address several aspects that are critical for understanding the smart cities concept and the current progress in this area as well as identifying insights in the related concepts, methodologies and approaches that are useful in this context. First of all, they shed light on how the concept of smart cities is currently adopted by European cities and what the ambitions and expectations are in using this concept. Some of the papers provide examples in describing how the cities started functioning as a “smart city” based on the programs, policies and partnerships in place and the available infrastructures and applications. This leads to investigating the drivers and bottlenecks that influence the transformation towards a “smart city”. Several papers also address the underlying approaches to smart cities in terms of the strategies and planning approaches. From this point of view we are interested in the conditions that must be established to stimulate the transformation towards smart cities, and the resources that are available or should be made available such as investments in broadband networks and in smart applications, and in the capabilities to innovate. This also points to the changing structures and processes of innovation and city development. Increasingly, we see a tendency towards more decentralized and bottom-up approaches to planning and innovation. Innovation ecosystems are characterized by a mix of top down and bottom-up initiatives, leading to networking and collaboration among stakeholders, which eventually are extending to real innovation communities. Increasingly, citizens, advanced companies and local governments act as proactive catalysers of innovation, shaping cities as “agents of change”.",181

A new Economic Development Department was established and work was commissioned to bring together people with new and innovative ideas, from research bodies, business, trade unions, the voluntary sector and the wider community, to advise the City Council leadership on how to tackle economic restructuring and the consequent impacts which were resulting in massive levels of unemployment, poverty and alienation. Out of those discussions, which also included many ‘heated debates’ on priorities, a number of practical proposals emerged in the late 1980s (1987–1989), including: There should be more of a focus on area- and neighbourhood-based working, devolving intervention to local areas and encouraging cross-sector working where the public sector would work on a more proactive basis with local communities, businesses and other public sector bodies, e.g. health. The idea of a ‘creative city’ emerged, demonstrating the economic importance of the ‘arts and cultural industries’, such as the idea that Manchester should look to cities such as Amsterdam and Barcelona as‘24 Hour Cities’ for inspiration and practical ideas for new initiatives. Innovation being identified as another key theme, acknowledging the lack of a coherent collaboration strategy with higher education in particular and the need to address this with some practical initiatives such as the development of Manchester Science Park (MSP) and the recognition that information and communications technologies (ICTs) could play a significant role in creating new infrastructures and services and, consequently, future economic growth. These three themes were at the heart of the new Economic Development Strategy for the city and provided the foundation for the City Council’s new ‘Economic Initiatives Group’ focusing on local (neighbourhood-focused) action, creative industries, and technology and innovation. They are still at the core of Manchester’s neighbourhood regeneration strategy 20 years later, underpinning the two core objectives of the City Council, namely generating sustainable economic growth and reducing dependency through tackling worklessness, inequalities and social exclusion. In 2011, the launch of the EU’s Digital Agenda for Europe [2] provides a high-level strategic framework for supporting the development of “a flourishing digital economy by 2020”…through…“policies and actions to maximise the benefit of the Digital Revolution for all”. As part of this, local action is being encouraged so that cities and regions produce ‘local digital agendas’ to set out their aspirations for change whilst at the same time focusing on practical action and initiatives which will deliver that change supported by user-driven open innovation through the use of digital technologies. This comes at a time when Manchester is reviewing its own ‘Digital Strategy’, originally produced in 2008, and its current digital development priorities focusing on three main issues: 
Digital inclusion: continuing to tackle the ‘digital divide’ because, even though people generally have increasing access to the Internet and digital services, inequalities persist with large sections of excluded communities no longer having or using copper-based landlines (over 50% of households in some parts of Manchester) and, consequently, having limited or no access to the ‘digital world’ and where access to skills and jobs in the digital economy is still a very real challenge 
Digital industries: building on Manchester’s strengths as the largest and most dynamic cluster of digital and creative businesses outside of London to support further sector-based growth, particularly through the independent Manchester Digital trade association (www.manchesterdigital.com); finding ways to overcome barriers to growth, such as the lack of business finance to support new investment and start-ups; and the need for better access to skills and pathways to employment in the sector 
Digital innovation: generating investment for innovation and new infrastructures and working with the research community on Future Internet development to support Manchester as a ‘Smart City’ in areas such as smart energy, cloud computing and very high-speed next-generation access (NGA) digital infrastructures (fibre and wireless), networks and services This review is starting with the production of a Green Paper, entitled “Smart Cities: Creating an Inclusive and Sustainable Knowledge Society: A Local Digital Agenda for Manchester”, the first draft of which was produced for consultation in November 2011. This was the result of 6 months work in consulting with local stakeholders and partners, following a workshop organised by Manchester Knowledge Capital and the Manchester Digital Development Agency (MDDA) in March 2011, together with a range of discussion held with partners in the EUROCITIES Knowledge Society Forum—KSF (www.eurocities.eu), European Smart Cities projects and the European Network of Living Labs—ENoLL (www.openlivinglabs.eu). Following a further 3 months consultation period with stakeholders and partners, local, nationally and internationally, the Local Digital Agenda for Manchester is being published in Spring 2012. It will outline priorities and an action plan for realising a digitally enabled and empowered Smart City, both in the short term and to 2020 and beyond.",32

Organizational creativity refers to “the creation of a valuable, useful new product, service, idea, procedure, or process by individuals working together in a complex social system” (Woodman et al. 1993, p. 293). Innovation and change are processes strongly rooted in creativity (Ford and Ogilvie 1996). Entrepreneurs can change market equilibriums and innovate by their capability of “creative destruction” (Schumpeter 1934). Creativity is critical also to overcome tensions of organizational change (Seo et al. 2004). Organizations are able to change their routines, structures, and knowledge mainly by exploiting the creativity of their members or external partners. A number of papers by scholars in the field of innovation management analyzed the internal and external factors affecting organizational creativity (Sundgren et al. 2005a; Vissers and Dankbaar 2002). Typical internal antecedents of creativity are organizational structure and strategy, resources, employee motivation and involvement, new technology, and research and development (R&D) investments (Alves et al. 2007). Creativity depends on various factors at the individual, group, and organizational levels (Woodman et al. 1993). A type of antecedent to date scarcely analyzed by scholars refers to the unconscious dynamics of organizations and its members (Gabriel 1995). In general, literature reports a psychoanalytical approach to the study of organizations should be a suitable theoretical background for the study of organizational change and the forces driving the change itself (Gabriel and Carr 2002; de Swarte 1998). In particular, various psychoanalysis scholars (e.g., Freud 1962) cite the notion of dream in relation to creativity. Freud (1900) defines dreams as forms of “wish fulfillment,” attempts by the unconscious to resolve a conflict of some sort, whether something recent or something from the recesses of the past. However, no empirical evidences tested the links between dreams and organizational creativity. The present paper contributes to the extant literature on antecedents of organizational creativity by exploring the role played by dreams and the unconscious on the creative process. The research question of the paper, therefore, is: how do dreams improve organizational creativity? The paper reports the cases of two Spanish high-tech companies in order to satisfy this question. The main result of the study refers to evidence that the extent of dreams’ impact on organizational creativity depends on some other antecedents/components, as intrinsic motivation and organizational ideals, of the creative process. Both individual (Freudian) and collective (Jungian) unconscious of the members of organizations are critical in order to manage effectively and improve organizational creativity and innovation. Drawing on the literature and the case studies, the paper advances two research propositions about the impact of dreams and the unconscious on organizational creativity.",3

It is apparent that other developing economies are eager to draw lessons from the East Asian experience. Until recently, developing economies identified with the Western economies as embodiments of their ideal goals and have been trying to borrow and adopt their models of development in their endeavours toward transforming themselves from low- into high-income economies. On a theoretical front, new growth theory predicts that physical investments should have a greater impact on productivity growth than traditional growth accounting would suggest, due to the positive externalities associated with such activities. The relevance of human capital accumulation to the process of economic development stems from its potential beneficial impact on macroeconomic productivity and on the long-run distribution of incomes. The concept of total factor productivity (TFP) growth dates back to Tinbergen’s [21] work which was followed by several others. However, these studies considered a non-frontier approach to calculating TFP growth. The frontier approach was introduced by Farrell [12]. It includes a parametric estimation (stochastic frontier or Bayesian) as well as a non-parametric estimation (data envelopment analysis or DEA). The reference to non-parametric approach in this paper implies the DEA. The non-parametric analysis of TFP will reveal which of TFP’s components, efficiency change or technical change drives TFP for each country. Boskin and Lau [2] find technical progress to be the most important source of growth for the developed world in the post-war period. Others, while accepting technological change as an important factor, attribute capital augmentation as the main force behind growth [13, 25] while authors such as Krugman [14], Young [26] and Collins et al. [7] find little or no evidence of productivity growth playing a role in East Asia’s economic growth. In the last few years, several regional applications of DEA have emerged. Charnes et al. [4] studied the economic performance of China’s 28 cities in 1983 and 1984. In a similar study, Chang et al. [3] used DEA and the Malmquist productivity index approach to study the economic performance of 23 regions in Taiwan from 1983 to 1990. Tong [22, 23] applied DEA to investigate the changes in production efficiency of 29 Chinese provinces meanwhile Bernard and Cantner [1] calculated the efficiency of 21 French provinces from 1978 to 1989. In a recent study, Maudos et al. [16] analysed the relationship between efficiency and production structure in Spain from 1964 to 1993. Some DEA studies have been carried out in the agricultural sector, one of which is Weaver [24] who studied agriculture in the US. In a related study, Mao and Koo [15] studied the performance of agriculture in 29 Chinese provinces during the period 1984 to 1993 whereas Millan and Aldaz [17] analysed the productivity of Spanish provinces from 1977 to 1988. As evident from the studies cited above, most analyses have focused on the comparisons of inter-regional productivity and efficiency measures. This study analyses the cross-country total factor productivity growth to identify the main sources of productivity change in the ASEAN5 region so as to promote appropriate policy formulation, specifically in the area of human capital investment.",7

This paper investigates the networking approach [3] used in international project governance and management [7] for local system development in transition countries and particularly the synergies and conflicts of interest that may be created among units interested in economic, social, cultural, and political progress. The purpose of these projects is to develop the local system, that is a network of public and private organisations within countries in transition from dictatorship to a democratic rule and from centrally planned to market economies. These transition economies require a common framework of interventions by local organisations that can create an effective, efficient, and adequate network that will ensure the results of sustainability over the time. The hypothesis of this paper is that whether there is a state of conflict or synergy depends on connections among units in previous projects. The tension between the two potential outcomes of synergy or conflict in itself not only pushes systems towards increasing complexity within the governance model but also can produce the organisational resources needed for the project. This study focused on the RecoURB project, which involved organisations from Albania, Montenegro, and Serbia, countries that differ from Europe in economic and financial policies, and collaborations between public and private organisations. In addition, government interventions lack coordination and seem more fragmented. The central research question is which situation of interest synergy and conflict can be produced in international project planning from the grant holder perspective. This study looks at the recent use of network and information and communication technologies (ICTs) to coordinate units. Local system development is well recognized in many international programmes of financing, such as, to list some cases, the Seventh Framework Programme,Footnote 1 TEMPUS,Footnote 2 and Adriatic Cross-Border Cooperation Programme IPA.Footnote 3 These programmes aim to support organisations in overcoming obstacles of bureaucracy, tax regulation, financing, and infrastructure, as is frequently stated by Kilic and Keles [20], and prioritize local system development. These obstacles have forced governments to assume the role of manager of relationships among the stakeholders. To this end, governments must focus on upgrading skills and technological capabilities of employees and staff, providing information on market opportunities for SMEs, facilitating their access to financing, empowering networks of public as well as private organisations, creating online platforms for small enterprises branding and marketing, increasing the simplification of accounting systems, improving cooperation with universities and research centres, introducing educational programmes, and promoting ICTs. To support these policies, there is a need for innovation, creativity, openness, diversification of products and services, total quality management, efficient management, and networking so that international project management can support the development of local systems and entrepreneurship [16, 22]. The international projects managed by Bologna University addressed these needs. The university uses a multi-campus structure based on the creation of operative poles as Scientific-Didactical Pole of Forlì and Ser.In.Ar—Integrated Services of Area that operate in Forlì-Cesena province. Other interventions of Bologna University aimed at the modernization of universities based on three-cycle system, ECTS, public services informatization, performance control, and virtual reality used for small businesses development [31]. In these projects, investigators outlined project teams able to offer project planning services to stakeholders and search for the requisite units that would best carry out the initiative. Therefore, it is necessary to look more closely at the dynamics and methodologies of this process with particular regard to the activities of the network in order to obtain the expected results. Although from the standpoint of project management the project may appear stable because the number of participants does not change, from the standpoint of the stakeholders, their relationships are highly dynamic. This analysis focuses on the planning phase of RecoURB project, and excludes the other phases of the project life cycle, which includes the following: coordinating people and other resources to carry out the plan (executing), ensuring that project objectives are met by monitoring and measuring progress and taking corrective action when necessary (controlling), and bringing the project to an orderly end (closing). The investigation looks at the network of stakeholders in project management, considering the case of IPA project, RecoURB ‘Networks of urban knowledge and reconstruction among historical cities in Transition Countries. Albania, Montenegro and Serbia’, submitted in October 2009 by Ser.In.Ar, the society that promotes and develops the activities of Bologna University in Forlì-Cesena province under the first Call for Proposal Priority 3, ‘Accessibility and networks’, Measure 3.3 ‘Networks of communications’. The results of networking activities carried out by units in RecoURB identify the success of the project submission under that call. This research has been realized within PRIN 2008, ‘Governing, managing and developing networks of public administrations and public/private partnerships in labour and knowledge-intensive sectors’ on the subject of organisation analysis, design, simulation on virtual platform, and performance evaluation of public/private networks. The paper begins with the theoretical framework on ‘stakeholder approach’ which combines the networking and project governance theories with the stakeholder analysis. Following the theoretical framework, the paper proceeds with the methodology and develops the hypothesis and then discusses the findings of the case study, RecoURB. The final section presents the theoretical implications, the limitations of this theory, and the potential for future research.",

The information age reminds the world that it is a big market, popular culture, technological, and similar developments, and these aspects influence life. Besides, the relationship between technology and knowledge concepts that causes or accelerates the information age is effective. For this reason, knowledge is one of the most important economic powers through using technology. Thus, the level of knowledge is the greatest challenge against economies. By this challenge, the developments that mostly affected economies can be seen as technological developments. The aim of this study is to argue about competiveness by using knowledge and the effects of technological developments on economies. For this purpose, competitive advantage in the information age was explained, the relationship with economy was set, and the positive and negative effects of technological developments were mentioned. Products such as computer software, media and entertainment content, new pharmaceuticals, and online commerce and banking services belong to the knowledge economy. Despite great diversity of functions and technologies, their common characteristic is that their production requires a relatively high intellectual input (knowledge) and depends less on the traditional production factors of labor and land. However, there is also an increasing knowledge content in the production and marketing of traditional products such as food, textiles, or tourism [48]. According to World [48], the difference between traditional production factors and knowledge as a production factor is that the latter is a systemic factor, a result of interlinked socioeconomic elements. These elements, which comprise the “four pillars” of a knowledge economy, are as follows: The innovation policies, institutions, and incentives necessary for the development and commercialization of domestic and foreign innovations—that is, for the creation of a national innovation system Human resource development—specifically, the development of a national education system generating a pool of knowledge specialists and a technology literate work force Information and communication technologies (ICT) A business environment conducive to the development of a knowledge economy The technological capabilities of a country are critical to its competitive advantage [40]. In other words, a country’s technology level is about the level of development of that country. For this reason, R&D capabilities that define a country’s technology are some of the most important variables [45]. When the R&D investment process has succeeded and created innovation, a patent can be requested that will provide the firm with property rights over knowledge from which it can exclude other countries. At this point, the firm can exploit the innovation by undertaking additional investments that would create a product that can be sold in the market or sell the innovation by granting the rights of exploitation to other countries in exchange for a royalty [6]. Table 1 shows the average of R&D investment data from 1990 to 2009 period. Figure 1 shows countries’ rations of R&D investment for G8, G20, BRICK, and BRICKT from 1990 to 2009 period.

[1–3]). Recently, the new growth literature confirms the significance of both the incidence and the transfer of knowledge at various levels: within firm, between firms, between firms and universities, and within society at large. Knowledge is often defined as decomposed of tacit and codified sources in addition to spillover effect of knowledge transfer. These components can be interrelated to enhance each other and to enhance knowledge process in general. Within this framework, the incidence and transfer of knowledge within society at large might be influenced by many variables such as: skill level (education and training); subsidies and incentives to education, training, R&D; organization and cooperation; information and communication technology (ICT); and other variables such as socio-demographic structure, culture, language, etc. Although, it may be interesting to investigate the incidence and transfer of knowledge within the firm, the transfer of knowledge between firms and between firms and universities, due to practical problems related to availability of micro data, it will not be possible to address these micro questions in the current study, we leave that for more detailed discussion in future studies. Therefore, in this study we would be focusing only on the incidence, transfer, and ways of enhancing knowledge in the Arab society at large. The significance and relevance of this research is that first it investigates the incidence and transfer of knowledge in the Arab states. Second, it may add to the recent empirical studies in the new growth literature aimed at enhancing the incidence and transfer of knowledge, mainly within the Arab states. Third, it may support and stimulate the recent efforts/policies aimed at building the knowledge society in the Arab region. It aims to test the significance of knowledge within the Arab society at large; to test the link between knowledge components; to show the determinants and ways of enhancing the incidence and transfer of knowledge within the Arab society at large. Scheme 1 below summarizes research questions and hypotheses. Questions, expected answers, and hypotheses Regarding the structure of this research, this research summarizes the main findings presented in in Nour [4]. The research of Nour [4] is composed of six chapters that organized in the following way: Chapter 1 presents an introduction and shows the definition of the research problem, aims, hypotheses to be tested, methodology, and structure of the research. Chapter 2 provides the conceptual and theoretical frameworks and the literature that show the definition and the importance of knowledge in the new growth literature. Chapter 3 presents some stylized facts on the status of Arab states in the new knowledge economy, Chapter 4 presents a comparative assessment and overview of knowledge across Arab countries. Chapter 5 defines the variables and method of analysis, reports, and discusses the empirical findings and estimation results.

4.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,01 February 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-012-0090-y,"Business Incubators: Effective Infrastructures or Waste of Public Money? Looking for a Theoretical Framework, Guidelines and Criteria",December 2013,Ernesto Tavoletti,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"According to the National Business Incubation Association (NBIA), the world’s leading association of business incubators (BIs) based in the USA, business incubation is a ‘process’ of business support: ‘Business incubation is a business support process that accelerates the successful development of start-up and fledgling companies by providing entrepreneurs with an array of targeted resources and services’ [33]. The UK Business Incubation has a more traditional approach and identifies business incubation with ‘location’ and ‘services’ provided: ‘Business incubation provides growth SMEs and start-ups with the ideal location to develop and grow their businesses, offering everything from virtual support, rent-a-desk through to state of the art laboratories and everything in between. They provide direct access to hands-on intensive business support, access to finance and expertise and to other entrepreneurs and suppliers to really help businesses and entrepreneurs to grow—faster’ [51]. The Association of German Business Incubators (ADT) and the Asian Association of Business Incubation (AABI) provide similar definitions focused on the kind of provided services. All the different definitions focus on the services and resources provided but with different accents. The main expectation of policy makers that invest public money in business incubation is that incubator graduates have the potential to create jobs, revitalize cities and regions, diversify local economies, commercialize new technologies, transfer technology from universities and major corporations and strengthen local and national economies in general. So they may have many different goals and vary in the way they deliver their services, in their organizational structure and in the types of clients they serve. Different classifications and typologies of business incubation have been identified. The most effective is probably the one that identifies four main categories [3]: public non-profit incubators (Business Innovation Centre from a popular EU policy), private independent profit-oriented incubators, university business incubators, private corporate profit-oriented incubators. Most of the BIs across the world are non-profit organizations focused on regional economic development and even in the USA about 94% of operating BIs belong to such a typology, and only 6% of USA incubators are for-profit entities, usually set up to obtain returns on shareholders investments [25]. That is why the present research focuses on non-profit BIs whose main goal is regional economic development. The increasing focus on knowledge intensive start-up firms and their potential for early international growth in the global economy has increased the attention for BIs as the main public tools to create such ‘international new ventures’ [36] and ‘born global firms’ [39]. As a consequence, the number of BIs has been increasing, as well as their geographical spread across the world. The first BI in history is thought to be the Batavia Industrial Center, opened in Batavia, NY, in 1959, in order to revitalize that neighbourhood after the closure of a large factory. The phenomenon did not become a popular one until the late 1970s, and in 1980, it is estimated that 12 BIs were active in the USA [33]. Starting from the beginning of the 1980s, the number of BIs in the world has been growing rapidly from 200 up to over 3,000 in 2000 ([52], p. 27) and around 3,600 in 2010 [4]. In the USA, even after the dot-com bust of the early 2000s, the number of business incubation programs has continued to increase: In late 2005, NBIA estimated that approximately 1,100 BIs were operating in the USA, up from 950 in 2002; even more impressive is the growth in the number of operating incubation programs since the late 1990s; since 1998, the number of incubators in the USA has nearly doubled [33]. UK Business Incubation reports that there are approximately 300 BIs in the UK today [51], and the Association of German Business Incubators reports 212 such facilities in Germany [5]. The Asian Association of Business Incubators, which includes among its members both incubators and national associations of incubators (from China, India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Philippine, Thailand and Vietnam), estimates 1,000 incubators in Asia (except Middle East), 850 incubators in Western Europe, around 380 in South and Central America, 180 in Eastern Europe and 180 in Africa, Middle East and others [4]. Despite increasing numbers, diffusion and popularity of BIs and related associations, not to speak of related literature, public funding, public policy and promotion, ‘empirical research evidence clearly suggests that they tend to fail in supporting entrepreneurship, innovation, and regional development and, therefore, they do not fulfil their expected role as policy instrument’ ([48], p. 460). There is plenty of literature and data claiming the positive contribution of BIs, with specific reference to the number of companies and jobs created [34, 25], but most of the time such claims from incubators’ associations are not methodologically sound evaluations of effectiveness because they just measure intended effects and do not compare them with unintended ones [6]: They do not consider that some firms would have grown and would have been funded even outside the incubator; some others moved into the incubator at a later stage of their growth, attracted by cheap office space, facility or public funding. As has been very well clarified, suitable methods for analysing the effectiveness of BIs are the before-and-after comparison and the control-group concept [48]: ‘Effectiveness’ is understood as differences in regional and business performance after the use of business incubation (longitudinal analysis); ‘control-group’ concept compares characteristics from a group of firms or regions taking advantage of BIs and a control group not utilising BIs’ facilities (cross-sectional analysis), with both groups selected randomly or according to a set of criteria. The most comprehensive and methodologically sound evaluations of BIs have been undertaken in Europe and in the USA. A multi-level investigation in Germany, including 1,021 businesses and 108 technology-oriented BIs, shows that the potential of technology-oriented start-ups is too small and, overall, decreasing, which fails to promote the sustainable success of the incubation industry in Germany [47]: (1) At least one third of the firms in BIs are active in low-value service sectors or commerce, (2) 19% of the firms were already more than 2 years old when they entered the facilities and thus not newly founded, (3) only 3% of firm founders would not have started their businesses without the existence of incubators and (4) attracting suitable tenants from other regions is unlikely due to the immobility of firm founders. A study conducted among 116 science parks (they can be considered as a specific typology of BIs: close to university or research centres, sell or lease spatially contiguous land and/or buildings at high prices because of prestigious locations, accept subsidiaries of international firms or already established firms and are focused on ‘spatial’ integration) in the USA casts serious doubts about their regional employment effects in comparison to regions without science parks and with similar characteristics [29]: Just a quarter of the 116 analysed science parks are evaluated as successful and success depends on how well equipped is the region in which they are located and on a first mover advantage (the first science parks tend to be more successful than late comers). Extensive studies on the effectiveness of BIs and science parks have been conducted in the UK for many years [32]. In one case, 130 businesses originated from science parks, and 121 from outside such incubators were compared: The businesses in science parks exhibit a higher failure rate of 38% compared with the 32% businesses outside such incubators [53]. Even more striking are some results about employment, as they reveal that the mean employment growth rates of firms located on science parks and those located off science parks are virtually identical [45]. Empirical research also suggests that level of technology in incubated firms is not superior to not incubated ones [12, 54], that there are time-delayed effects because of the science park location on the performance of start-ups [16] and no ‘high incidence of technology transfer despite the fact that many were established with that goal in mind’ ([37], p. 299). On the contrary, there are good reasons to believe that BIs are especially effective in reaching political goals: a tangible real estate investment to be pictured and shown to the public as a piece of evidence of a public policy for innovation, qualified employment and economic growth. A radical solution to avoid wasting public money on ineffective BIs would be ‘that technology-oriented business incubators should be run as private organisations without public funding’ ([48], p. 469) so that it is the market itself that selects the effective ones and not the flow of public funding. In fact, the already quoted empirical evidence suggests that they do not provide significant stimulus for individuals starting a business; they do not increase the likelihood of firm survival, innovativeness or growth and they are a very modest contributor to regional economic development: ‘Using the logic of the NBIA, creating on average 20,000 jobs per year in a nation with a labour force of 147.4 million and an unemployed rate of 5.5% (in 2004) is not really a big push’ ([48], p. 469). Curley, Curley et al. [14] propose a radical critique to the traditional business incubation process that culminates in a business plan, drafted with experts’ advice and suggest an ‘experiment-related decision process’. Along with many other researchers, they agree that the business incubation industry has been artificially fuelled by the provision of subsidies and grants (with mediocre outcomes) and suggest that, despite the failure of incubators, there is ‘the need to expand the incubation process beyond the limits of the business plan, to encompass experimentation and the simulation of new business concepts in an experimental laboratory environment’ ([14], p. 1). Despite significant empirical evidence against its effectiveness, business incubation is still a popular public policy and phenomenon. Many successful cases quoted in the literature and in the public debate suggest that business incubation can be effective under some circumstances.",35

Manimala,K. Raju Thomas,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Technology and its transfer has become the main vehicle of human and economic development in the world today. A particular technology transfer exercise can be considered to have given the desired result only if it is absorbed by and assimilated in the host company/country and is able to provide a springboard for the transferee to move into the next stage of development. Business success and expansion especially in an increasingly globalizing world is also more and more dependent on technology transfer, as it would be beneficial not only to the transferee but also to the transferor. It is a fact that most of the technology transfers are from the developed countries to the developing countries, and hence, the latter are often treated as the beneficiaries. However, it should not be forgotten that technology transfer also helps the developed countries to expand their businesses to other countries and thereby realize better revenues and gain market dominance. This central role and relevance of technology transfer in the economic development of nations has attracted several researchers into this filed. Given the inherent complexity of the subject, it is not surprising that the findings, conclusions, and assertions of what we know about international technology transfer are fragmented along different specializations and disciplines [91]. A survey of the existing literature on technology transfer reveals that most of the studies have focused on broad issues and general factors relating to technology transfer and that studies investigating and analyzing specific issues like training, problems of operatives at the recipient’s end, issues of assimilation, etc, are far fewer (Ouinjan and Crane [83]). Learning in technology transfer is of critical importance, as that is probably the only way in which a system tries to cope with the discontinuities and disruptions necessitating a change in technology and its applications, which in turn cause further disruptions. Even when a tried and tested technology is being transferred to a new user, there will surely be some disruptions at the transferee’s end, on account of the latter’s lack of familiarity with the technology being brought from another system. The transferor too might experience disruptions on account of having to deal with a different culture, to adapt the technology to a new environment, and so on. Coping with such changes is indeed a learning process. In fact, even the decision to transfer technology may be a strategy to cope with some other changes happening in the transferor’s as well as the transferee’s business environment.",1
4.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,26 May 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-012-0096-5,The Impact of ICT on East Asian Economic Growth: Panel Estimation Approach,December 2013,Elsadig Musa Ahmed,Rahim Ridzuan,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The importance of technology to economic development has long been recognized. This may be especially true in information and communications technology (ICT), in which they offer the potential for increasing availability of information, new means of communications, re-organization of productive processes and improving efficiency in many different economic activities [26]. The importance of ICT use is becoming amplified by the process of economic globalization, which puts a premium on information and communications systems as the means to achieve linkages to international markets and global production networks [29]. ICT has been an important drive of growth and productivity since 1990s. Recent improvements in growth and productivity performance in developed countries such as Japan, South Korea and Singapore has been linked to the expansion of the production of ICT goods. Of course, ASEAN countries which mostly consist of developing countries do not want to miss this golden opportunity in producing more related ICT product for exports. This rapid development in ICT industries has led to a big bubble in the world economy especially in the US economy. In 2001, the bubble burst and the world economy turned its face back to “brick-and-mortar” economy. The ICT revolution has indeed created huge changes on the real economy. According to Hornik [24], telecommunications can be considered as a complement to development. Using telecommunications, the benefits from the development policies can be rapidly facilitated and distributed throughout economy. Many economists consider ICT as a general-purpose technology due to its all-encompassing character in which it has already become an indispensable part of production of goods and services in various industries. According to Erdil et al. [19], there are two important channels by which ICT can have real effect on real economy: production of ICT and the use of ICT from various industries. Firstly, the ICT sector itself has quickly become an important industry at global level that coincided with the growth of the service industries. Since our scope of studies is base on ASEAN5+3 countries, the best example that can explain the above scenario is that ICT industries in Singapore, Malaysia, Japan, China and Korea have shown significant benefits towards their economy. These countries have been producing and exporting various ICT-related products such as processors, RAMs, hard discs, motherboards, desktops, notebook and super computer for other ASEAN countries. Secondly, the ICT revolution has contributed significantly to the whole economy by rising productivity. First, ICT increases labour productivity in ICT-using industries by simply making labour to produce more or work more efficiently (cf. van Ark et al. [57] and Matteucci et al. [36]). ICT makes physical capital to be more productive (cf. Roller and Waverman [50]). There is a great deal of debate among leaders in developing countries as well as in international development community about the potential of ICT in improving productivity growth. Countries worldwide are investing their resources into their ICT infrastructure despite the widely acknowledged ‘productivity paradox’, which states that there is no correlation between ICT spending and productivity growth. Evaluating the contribution of ICT investments has become an elusive but important goal of researchers and economists. While the literature on ICT and economic growth is abundant, much of the work is based on the experience of the developed countries. There have not been many studies conducted on countries in ASEAN. In our studies, we have included Japan, Korea and China to the group of original ASEAN5 in order to see and compare any linkages between ICT and economic growth. Besides, previous studies that used dynamic panel data estimation are also known as generalised method of moments since they were running the test for a large group of countries. Only few journals have adopted generalised least squares (GLS) method that has been taken into account to none effect, fixed effect and random effect model for this studies. Therefore, another contribution of this paper is to fill this gap by applying generalised least squares method. The organization of the paper is as follows: “Literature Review” section is filling in with literature review of the studies. “The Standard Production Function Model” section introduces the model used for this paper and proceeds with empirical methodology. The sources of data are presented in “Sources of Data” section. “Results and Analysis” section will be describing the results and analysis. “Conclusion” section will be providing the conclusion of this paper.",36

Enhancing competitiveness through “Smart Growth” is in focus of the EU2020 strategy that emphasizes the need to strengthen research performance, improve the conditions for private R&D, and promote innovation and knowledge transfer throughout the European Union (European Commission 2010). Member states and their regions are encouraged to reform their innovation systems to foster cooperation between industry and academia, ensure sufficient supply of science and engineering graduates, adjust national funding procedures to support cross-border cooperation, and prioritize business investments in innovation. Particularly old industrial regions have been forced to look for new solutions to regain competitiveness. Industrial regions were at the forefront of early industrialization and of capitalist development in the period from 1840 to the 1920s. They were main drivers of the capitalist economy based on such industries as iron, steel, shipbuilding, heavy engineering, and railway engineering. However, such regions become increasingly marginal with the shift of the economy into Fordist mass consumption sectors throughout the twentieth century and then towards electronic and information technology sectors. Various types of regional policy, including innovation policy, have been pursued to support diversification and modernization activities of existing firms and the formation of new ones (Cooke 1995; Rehfeld 1999). The objective of this study is to learn about the types of policy initiatives that are used by the post-industrial regions of the British West Midlands and the Spanish Basque Country to foster cooperation between the regional knowledge base and the private sector.",3

But innovation may be conducted in many ways, by combining knowledge from diverse sources, with different productivity in terms of the firm performance (Fagerberg et al. 2004). Some of this knowledge is inside of the firm, while other elements need to be obtained externally (Nelson 1962; Richardson 1972; Lundvall 1988). Arrangements to cooperate on innovation with other organizations facilitate access to the external sources (Miotti and Sachwald 2003). But how much difference does this really make? Are cooperative firms more productive in selling innovated products? And what kind of linkages, at home or abroad, are more rewarding? Over the last two decades, the so-called Community Innovation Survey (CIS) has been conducted in many countries offering new evidence on the innovative behaviour of firms. Availability of micro data from these surveys triggered a bourgeoning body of empirical literature, including research on the impact of cooperation on firm performance (Klomp and van Leeuwen 2001; Lööf and Heshmati 2002; Cincera et al. 2003; Janz et al. 2003; Miotti and Sachwald 2003; Okamuro 2007; Lööf 2009; Simonen and McCann 2008; Aschhoff and Schmidt 2008; Arvanitis and Bolli 2009), which is increasingly conducted by econometric methods. So far, this research has predominantly relied on cross-sectional data; however, evidence based on longitudinal datasets remains thin (Belderbos et al. 2004, 2006; Raymond et al. 2009; Arvanitis 2012). The aim of the paper is to help in filling this gap. Using an unbalanced panel of micro data from several waves of CIS in the Czech Republic, Norway and the UK, we estimate dynamic random effects Tobit model, in which the innovation output of firms given by innovative sales is the function of cooperation and other observed characteristics of firms, while accounting for unobserved individual heterogeneity. The paper contributes to this line of research in four ways. First and foremost, we present new evidence in the dynamic panel design. Second, and a related point, is that using lagged predictors, including the lagged dependent variable, allows us to be more confident about causality. Third, we estimate the same model for multiple countries, which has been done before, but there is a need for more comparative research of this kind. Finally, the distinction between domestic and foreign cooperation is essential but seldom considered in literature on this topic. The paper proceeds as follows. Section “Theory” discusses the theoretical background, derives the hypotheses to be tested and surveys the existing empirical evidence. Section “Data” presents the longitudinal panel datasets. Section “Econometric Model” outlines the dynamic Tobit model and explains the specification. Section “Econometric Results” gives results of the econometric estimates. Section “Conclusions” pulls the strands together.",8
5.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,23 January 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-014-0180-0,Research Driven Clusters at the Heart of (Trans-)Regional Learning and Priority-Setting Processes,March 2014,Günter Clar,Björn Sautter,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Research and Innovation Strategies for Smart Specialisation (RIS3) are widely seen as a promising approach to leverage regional dynamism in knowledge creation and application, and thus leading to comparative advantages in a globalised knowledge economy. An ex ante conditionality for the EU’s Structural and Investments Fund Programmes in the framework of the Europe 2020 Strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, and analysed by the OECD as a politically important conceptual framework for science, technology and innovation (STI) policies promoting innovation-driven growth (OECD 2012), the smart specialisation approach refers to ‘entrepreneurial discovery’ and priority-setting processes to ensure that the public and private resources are invested with an optimal impact. The focus is more on mobilising the unique regional innovation capacities than a ‘picking winners’ approach (cf. Foray et al. 2009, 2012). Referring to the concept of regional innovation systems (Autio 1998; Braczyk et al. 1998; Cooke et al. 2000), RIS3 are promoted as “integrated, place-based economic transformation agendas” (Foray et al. 2012, p. 8) with the aim “to discover the domains of R&D and innovation in which a region is likely to excel” (Foray 2012, p. 5). This accompanies the trend to put the grand societal challenges of the twenty-first century—e.g. global climate change, ensuring clean energy and food security, preserving scarce resources or handling an ageing population—high on the agenda for Research, Technological Development and Innovation (RTDI) policies. For example, the “Strategy for American Innovation” (The White House 2011), the “High-Tech Strategy 2020 for Germany” (BMBF 2010) and the “Europe 2020” strategy (European Commission 2010) all aim at tackling these global challenges in order to contribute to territorial growth, jobs and prosperity. 
Capitalising on unique local assets of specialised AND smartly interlinked regional innovation systems within a global perspective, allows two seemingly contradictory goals to be achieved: promoting regional specialisation on the one hand, and contributing to solutions of global challenges on the other. With regard to the European Research and Innovation Area, the EU Council highlighted in its conclusions on the Innovation Union, a flagship initiative of the Europe 2020 strategy, the role of the smart specialisation concept being “to guide priority-setting in national and regional innovation strategies, as well as cross-border cooperation where appropriate” (EU Council 2010). When the learning and priority-setting processes in the multitude of European regions are set in a common framework, ‘smart’ trans-regional cooperation and priority ‘harmonisation’ can increase the impact of public and private RTDI investments within, but also, in the bigger economic and societal context, across regions in Europe. Analysing in chapter 2 examples of ‘new’ innovation policy programmes in the larger context of a systemic understanding of innovation in the knowledge-based economy, we argue that research driven clusters as local nodes of global knowledge flows and ‘innovative hot-spots’ in globalised value chains (cf. Cooke 2001; Bathelt et al. 2004) provide a solid base for entrepreneurial discovery and priority-setting processes with a view to regionally developed answers to societal problems, and also to trans-regionally aligned RTDI strategies for smart specialisation. As ‘microcosms’ in a complex world of cross-cutting regional and sector innovation systems, research driven clusters (focusing on a specific ‘sector’ in a specific territory) are seen as promising targets for multi-level and multi-sector strategic policy support. We underline our arguments by introducing in chapter 3 the German “Spitzen” (Leading-Edge) Cluster Competition as the flagship of the national “High-Tech Strategy 2020” and cornerstone of the national “Strategy for the Internationalisation of Science and Research”. In chapter 4, we depict the process and outcome of the participative learning and priority-setting in one “Spitzen” cluster, MicroTEC Südwest with its approx. 350 actors spanning an area of about 5 million population, and we highlight its specific sector/technological as well as its regional context in Europe’s Innovation Region no. 1—Baden-Württemberg. Closing the loop in chapter 5, we relate this case to aspects of the knowledge-economy-related concepts analysed in chapter 2, and of the European and German strategic innovation policy-related programmes. We then draw conclusions, in chapter 6, for taking steps forward to smart, sustainable and inclusive growth by supporting research driven clusters with their (trans) regional learning and priority-setting processes applying strategic policy intelligence (SPI)Footnote 1 tools in an integrative way, and aiming at global competitiveness through more strategic forward-looking and better-informed outward-looking.",12

The issue of networking for innovations is not new. In policymaking, innovation systems have changed structure several times, starting from models that emphasize cooperation between universities and companies in a Double Helix mode and followed by the Triple Helix structure introduced by Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (2000) that includes the government as a third party to the innovation system. This model has been criticized for consolidating old structures (Lindberg et al. 2012b) and for working less successfully in weaker regions (Jensen and Trädgårdh 2004) owing to “simplistic solutions, ill-defined problems and blurred actor roles” (Lindberg et al. 2012a, p. 5). Brännback et al. (2008) add to this by noting that the Triple Helix model does not favor entrepreneurial ventures. Therefore, a further broadening of the innovation system is emphasized to also include civil society. The Quadruple Helix approach has since been proposed by Carayannis and Campbell (2009), who stress the importance of also including a helix of active consumers in line with discussions on open innovation systems (Von Hippel 2005). Discourse on a Quadruple Helix innovation system is emerging, as theorizing about its fundamental concepts is ongoing (Carayannis and Campbell 2011). Research findings linked to projects such as Quadruple Helix Central Baltic and Creating Local Innovation through Quadruple Helix, presented in the academic press by Lindberg et al. (2012a, b), provide ample proof of the benefits of applying a Quadruple Helix approach to innovation systems. Lindberg et al. (2012b), by studying women resource centers, conclude that the fourth helix adds to the range of actors involved and is thus important for their innovative processes. Linked to the tourism sector, Lindberg et al. (2012a) prove how these resource centers fill four roles in bridging the gender gap. Their Quadruple helix approach offers a collaborative platform (for women-led small and medium enterprises (SMEs)) and legitimate activities, facilitates knowledge transfer, and carries individual and societal aspects of entrepreneurship. In the research by Lindberg et al. (2012a), women resource centers are presented as a non-governmental organization (NGO) that consists of (female) entrepreneurs. The fourth helix, civil society, can be substantiated in many ways, such as by consumer interest groups (i.e., citizens) or by other types of NGOs (Carayannis and Campbell 2010). It is not wrong for Lindberg et al. (2012a) to position SMEs in the fourth helix, but they could have detailed the discussion of how this network of SMEs differs from the helix of industry. Furthermore, their discussion gives reason to believe that these NGOs act as an intermediator in between the other three resource centers only and thus they are not a helix on their own. Consumer and citizen organizations are actors that represent the fourth helix. The influence of consumers (Matthing et al. 2004) and citizens (Angelopoulus et al. 2010) on new service development (NSD) (e-governance projects) and innovations is well documented in the literature. Less studied are consumer organizations and how they influence business development and management linked to service innovation. A void in the academic literature is the influence of citizen organizations on creative environments. Accepting the basic logic of innovation systems (Sundbo and Gallaouj 1999) that innovations are created in networks (Hjalager 2010) and that it is beneficial to include more actors and perspectives in creative processes (Carayannis and Campbell 2010), it becomes essential to explore when and how representatives from different helixes should be involved in service innovation processes. The aim of this article is to add to the emerging discussion on managing Quadruple Helix pertaining to tourism service innovation. This is accomplished by briefly presenting the Quadruple Helix model as a platform for service innovation illustrated with data from the Finnish tourism development project Travel and Relax in “Quadruple Helix: A Platform for Tourism Service Innovations.” Tourism development, also presented as destination development and management, has been described as being complex because of the number of actors involved and the varying interests and resources. Even the multilayer, vertical structure of tourism management has been presented as complicating innovation processes (Björk and Virtanen 2005). The nature of tourism innovation processes is presented in “Tourism Development and Innovation Systems” with a focus on development models. The DNA of tourism development is presented as a model with two central components, resource centers and intermediators, reflected in resource constellations presented as interlinked helixes. The DNA model presented extends the Quadruple Helix model, even going beyond the Quintuple Helix framework presented by Carayannis and Campbell (2010). The findings in “Innovation Systems and Destination Development” are based on a participatory research approach (Whyte 1991), which is presented next in this exploratory study (Stebbins 2001).",20

Carayannis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"'Zum sehen geboren; Zum schauen bestellt.'  {Born to see; Meant to look}  [Faust, Goethe] Change is the essence of life—in both business and society—and the heart of change is creative destruction as coined by Schumpeter (1942). In this sense, merger and acquisition (M&A) processes and events are at the heart of evolutionary and sometimes revolutionary change in business. How that occurs, that is, in more or less intelligent, effective, and efficient ways, is determined by both chance and necessity (Monod 1971) and in this context lies the concepts of strategic knowledge arbitrage and strategic knowledge serendipity (SKARSE™; Carayannis 1998, 2008; Carayannis and Alexander 2002, 2008; Carayannis et al. 2011). Adam Smith defined Land, Labor and Capital as the key input factors of the economy in the eighteenth century. Joseph Schumpeter added Technology and Entrepreneurship as two more key input factors in the early twentieth century. He thus recognized the role and dynamic nature of technological change and innovation as well as path dependencies in shaping the health and future of the economy and moving away from the static approach of Neoclassical Economics. In the late twentieth and the beginning of the twenty-first century, numerous scholars and practitioners such as Peter Drucker, have identified knowledge as perhaps the sixth and most important key input and output factor of economic activity. We would like to also emphasize the role and significance of technological and economic learning as a driver of productivity gains and an accelerator of economic growth and prosperity (Carayannis, ibid). In Greek, the word for creator also denoting God, is the word poet. This underlines the dynamic underlying creativity, in that it encompasses both a structured, disciplined, scientific, as well as an artistic element: one could say that creativity emerges from the interplay and interfacing of science and art—in a way, it could be conceived of as being the art of science and the science of art (Carayannis 1998). This perhaps may be the way to synthesize the apparent conflicting Schumpeterian perspectives (Schumpeter I and II; see also Fig. 1). Innovation ecosystem Does the growth of economic and technical knowledge in fact imply that innovation is becoming predictable and routine? This is a matter of some dispute. It is certainly true that innovation—or R&D, at any rate—is more organized today than it was in the nineteenth century. This is a manifestation of the growing division of labor, one that would not have surprised Adam Smith and the classical. But for Smith, the increasing division of labor did not generate innovation because it made the future predictable; rather, the division of labor heightened innovation because it increased the diversity of ideas in society. Innovation remained a matter of empirical trial and error (ibid). According to Heracleitus, “everything flows” in life—that is, change is the only constant. Herodotus stated that “war is the father of everything”, thus in a sense anticipating Schumpeter’s work on creative destruction and the nature and dynamics of the lifecycle of the firm discussed later in this paper. We witness these phenomena daily in the context of the sociotechnical change that creates substantial challenges and opportunities for individuals, societies and companies. At the heart of sociotechnical change, as both an antecedent and a consequence, lies the phenomenon of creative destruction (ibid) which illuminates the nature and dynamics of change in the context of unknown unknowns (uncertainty) and known unknowns (risk). Creative destruction drives and shapes the lifecycle of technological paradigms and trajectories (such as the Fisher–Pry or logistical S-curve; ibid) and helps to foster more sustainable entrepreneurship and robust competitiveness (see the definitions offered below). Creative destruction is thus the force “which incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one. The process of creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism” (Schumpeter, ibid). Moreover, we see creative destruction as a fundamentally knowledge-based and knowledge-driven phenomenon especially as it manifests itself in the knowledge economy and society (see Fig. 1). This term refers to the unintended benefits of enabling knowledge to “spill over” between employees, groups and functional domains (“happy accidents” in learning). More specifically, it describes the capacity to identify, recognize, access, and integrate knowledge assets more effectively and efficiently to derive, develop and capture non-appropriable, defensible, sustainable, and scalable pecuniary benefits (Carayannis, GWU Lectures, 2000–2005; 2008; Carayannis et al. 2011). This refers to the ability to distribute and use specific knowledge for applications other than the intended topic area. More specifically, it refers to the capacity to create, identify, reallocate, and recombine knowledge assets more effectively and efficiently to derive, develop, and capture non-appropriable, defensible, sustainable, and scalable pecuniary benefits (Carayannis, GWU Lectures, 2000–2005; 2008; Carayannis et al. 2011). We have attempted to assess conceptually and integrates empirically three fundamental aspects of the process of creative destruction: 
strategic knowledge serendipity and arbitrage as means of unlocking and capturing the value added by creative destruction 
real options as a methodology to assess and maximize the value added by creative destruction multilayered, multimodal, and multinodal technological learning as a mechanism that internalizes and leverages the value added by creative destruction and, especially, by lessons from the previous stages of a technological lifecycle and from evolving, successive, or overlapping technological lifecycles. To empirically validate SKARSE™, we have started formulating and simulating the lifecycle of knowledge-driven (that would include technology driven) ventures that can be viewed as the exercise of real options under regimes of risk and uncertainty that is modeled in the form of “happy accidents” namely, strategic knowledge serendipity, arbitrage, and acquisition events that punctuate the process of the venture’s lifecycle (see Figs. 2 and 3; Carayannis et al. 2011). Adapted from Carayannis et al. (2011) Adapted from Carayannis et al. (2011) In practical terms, we find that the timing, selection, and sequencing of key decisions pertaining to new venture formation and evolution are contingent in a nonlinear manner to the breadth and depth as well as the quality and density of the network structure of the business and technology ecosystem within which a venture is situated. We find that up to a certain point of cultivating and nurturing the new firm’s “socio-economic” network, the costs outweigh the benefits but with an abrupt about face once a critical mass in the scale, scope and quality of this “socio-economic” network or business and technology ecosystem is attained when the benefits start outweighing and exponentially exceeding the costs. The implications are clear for current and aspiring technology entrepreneurs and regional economic development managers and policy-makers alike: figure out what is the nature and dynamics of your regional business and technology ecosystem (including global and local connections and extensions to it) and aim to enter the market (as an entrepreneur) when the ecosystem appears to be close to its critical mass of maximum likelihood knowledge serendipity and arbitrage (“happy accidents”) events as well as aim to help the ecosystem reach its maximum “happy accident” likelihood state (as a regional economic development manager and policy maker) as sustainably and fast as possible. In this context, strategic public–private partnerships and networks as well as risk capital may serve as key pillars of sustainable and accelerated economic development.",8

Carayannis,Ruslan Rakhmatullin,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The financial crisis that announced itself to the world with the demise of Lehman Brothers on September 15, 2008 and then morphed into a social, political and economic challenge to the world and in particular the European Union (EU) and its core institutions and principles exposed essential problems and unsustainable developments in many European countries. It also made clear just how inter-dependent and inter-linked the EU’s economies are. Greater economic policy coordinationFootnote 1 across the EU will help Member States to address these problems and boost growth and job creation in the future. The Europe 2020 strategyFootnote 2 is a comprehensive economic policy agenda focusing on three priorities: smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. This new EU strategy is about delivering growth that is (a) smart, through more effective investments in education, research and innovation; (b) sustainable, thanks to a decisive move towards a low-carbon economy; and (c) inclusive, with a strong emphasis on job creation and poverty reduction. Based on these three mutually reinforcing priorities, European Member States (and regions) are encouraged to identify their own assets and R&I strengths so that they could then focus their efforts on a limited number of justified priorities. By focusing on these three priorities, the European Union is planning to move decisively beyond the crisis and to create conditions required for a more competitive economy. Such an approach aims to help Member States and their regions to deliver higher levels of employment, productivity and social cohesion in a manner that would be globally competitive and thus not only environmentally but also financially and socially sustainable. EU Cohesion PolicyFootnote 3 has to date contributed to improving economic, social and environmental conditions within the European Union, as indicated by a number of evaluations carried out by the European Commission. However, the same ex post evaluations concluded that focusing on a few key priorities (especially in the more developed regions) could be more effective (European Commission 2010). Such concentration of resources will allow Member States and regions to build up a critical mass and make a tangible impact. The Fifth Report on Economic, Social and Territorial Cohesion prepared by the European Commission (2010) suggested the EU regions and Member States to start with programmes identifying a limited number of policy priorities (concentration). Any such priorities should also be developed with a clear understanding as to how these will be achieved and how their achievement would contribute to the economic, social and territorial development of the EU regions and Member States. In line with this understanding and the overall EU 2020 strategy, the European Commission recognised the importance of the Smart Specialisation Strategies (S3) principle. The principle of smart specialisation requires each region to build on its own strengths and to manage a priority-setting process in the context of national and regional innovation strategies (European Commission 2012). This principle was initially outlined by the Expert Group ‘Knowledge for Growth’ in 2008. The point of departure for the Knowledge for Growth Expert Group was the innovation system research and theory applied at the level of regional systems of innovation (RIS). Following the earlier RIS tradition, research and innovation strategies for smart specialisation (RIS3) calls for the design and implementation of research and innovation strategies and has been placed at the core of the new European cohesion policy as the main driver for the achievement of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives from a regional perspective. In order to facilitate the participation of small European nation states, the acronym RIS has been further extended to refer to both national and regional systems of innovation. Moreover, and within the RIS3 context, one could envision both regional and sectoral innovation systems as constituting elements of a regional innovation ecosystem. The S3 concept is now recognised by the EU policymakers as an important logical step to reaching the Europe 2020 goals set by the European Union in the field of research and innovation. Moreover, the European Commission introducedFootnote 4 smart specialisation as a pre-condition (ex ante conditionalityFootnote 5 for using the European Regional Development Fund (ERDFFootnote 6) in the new funding period (2014–2020). As a result, national and regional authorities across the European Union are required to prepare their RIS3, so that the Structural Funds are used more efficiently with the aim of increasing synergies between different EU, national and regional policies, as well as public and private investments. While some regions are quickly advancing with the development of an original RIS3, other regions are finding it more difficult to focus on clear priorities or tend to reproduce other regions’ strategies without necessarily finding an optimal fit between conditions in the regions in question and the replicated RIS3. In June 2011, the European Commission launched the Smart Specialisation Platform (S3 Platform) to support its regions and Member States. This new EU facility is there to help European regions (and Member States) to define their research and innovation (R&I) strategies based on the S3 principle. The concept recommends that each Member State and region focus its efforts and resources on a limited number of ambitious yet realistic priorities (niches) where it would be able to develop excellence and compete in the global economy in a sustainable (financially as well as environmentally and socially) manner following the smart, sustainable and inclusive growth priority. The S3 principle further requires uniting national and regional stakeholders and resources around an excellence-driven vision of their future. These vital changes are then expected to allow Member States and regions to strengthen their innovation systems, maximise knowledge flows, absorption and utilisation as well as spread the benefits of innovation throughout the entire national/regional economy via market, network and knowledge spill-over effects locally and regionally.",223

Evangelatos,Elias G. Carayannis,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Epidemiology is defined as “the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to the prevention and control of health problems” (Last 2001). Being a fundamental science of public health, epidemiology uses quantitative methods and has largely contributed to the improvement of global population health. Although primarily classified as a biomedical science, epidemiology is in reality an interdisciplinary science with significant contributions to other academic disciplines, such as biostatistics, social and behavioral sciences, demography, and geography. This evolving conception of epidemiology as a liberal art has also found practice-altering applications in emerging fields of studies (Fraser 1987). The use of biological analogies in the field of computer science has led to the instigation of various predictive theoretical models for the study of the rate and extent of propagation of computer virus infections (Piqueira José et al. 2005). Moreover, in an era of high-grade interconnectivity through internet-based social networks, there is a growing need for a better understanding of the processes that determine how networks form and operate, especially with respect to the spread of behaviors that affect public health. This unmet need has triggered the use of epidemiological investigations and interventions focusing on social networks (Christakis and Fowler 2009). The recent global economic developments have revealed the existence of clear rhetorical analogies between medicine and economic science, underlined by the usage of numerous relevant expressions by economists, journalists and politicians in scientific papers, the media, even the parliamentary and legislative space. Expressions such as “economic recovery”, “economic health”, and “financial health and contagion” are common part of the contemporary rhetoric. The metaphor of the economic crisis as a “financial disease” that “spreads” throughout the financial markets has been used in numerous articles by many economists in their attempt to describe the complex phenomenon of chain reactions between economic interconnected entities. Traditional empirical and theoretical frameworks have failed to incorporate the effects of these types of “social contagion” in their predictive models, and the need for new approaches is now obvious. Historically, a plethora of theoretical concepts and approaches from other scientific disciplines have migrated to enrich the armamentarium of economic science in its attempt to study the production, distribution, and consumption of wealth in human society (Bannock et al. 1998). Epidemiological tools and methods have already been incorporated in economics-related fields of study such as Epidemiology Economics and Pharma-Economics. The intuition-based perception, that empirical observations in the field of economics could be explained within theoretical frameworks already applied in the biomedical sciences, has triggered the need for a further investigation of this possibility. Hackney et al. have already recognized the need for financial epidemiology, arguing that epidemiological models have already been implemented in the assessment and prediction of public health crises (Hackney et al. 2012). Scope of this paper is to explore whether the abovementioned analogies between medical and economic terms are merely rhetorical or if they could be used as the basis for a new conceptual framework that links these metaphors to economic science concepts. Development of relevant models could theoretically lead, through real time identification of early “signs and symptoms”, to the adoption of appropriate measures and control of a possible “contagion”.",2
5.0,2.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,17 January 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-012-0146-z,"Fuzzy Front End and Commercialization: Cross-Cultural Differences, Similarities, and Paradoxes in Innovation Strategies and Practices",June 2014,Helge Godoe,John Vigrestad,Roger Miller,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Increasingly, research on innovation processes and activities suggests that the most critical activities and decisions are made in the initiation phase, i.e., as “fuzzy front-end” (FFE) of innovation, and at the finalization phase, i.e., commercialization, or what is colloquially characterize as “getting the prototype out of the lab and into the markets.” If these assumptions are valid, one would expect that the success of Asian companies during recent decades would somehow reflect these factors. In this paper, this will be explored by comparing and analyzing data obtained from a survey of three categories of firms, which have two characteristics in common: (a) all firms have a good track record in terms of business success due to innovation performance, and (b) all companies belong to the same sector, i.e., they are all in the NACEFootnote 1 group CFootnote 2—manufacturing. Hence, one may assume that the firms are participants in similar types of globalized “games of innovation” (Miller and Floricel 2004, 2007). The three categories of firms, defined below, are Asian, Nordic, and Euro-American. The influx and growth of successful Asian companies in global markets has fuelled public awareness and debates on globalization and competition. An intriguing topic is which factors make Asian companies competitive and innovative. In the 1970s and 1980s, the focus was set on Japanese industry because these were emerging as competitive and threatened the traditional hegemony of USA and European firms in many product markets. At that time, the notion of National Systems of Innovation focused on why nations differ in terms of their innovation capability and dynamics (Freeman 1995; Kline and Rosenberg 1986; Lundvall 1993; Nelson and Rosenberg 1993). Since the mid-1980s, the focus has increasingly been set on other Asian countries, such as the People’s Republic of China, South Korea, and Taiwan, since these are now in the lead in terms of competitiveness. They are even outperforming the Japanese in many product markets: Samsung of South Korea has now taken the lead from Japan’s Sony in a number of product categories related to consumer electronics; Huawei of People’s Republic of China has successfully gained market shares from Japanese companies such as NEC; South Korean shipyards, car manufacturers, and heavy engineering companies have surpassed their Japanese rivals. The companies Acer (Taiwan) and Lenovo (People’s Republic of China) have gained a dominant position in the PC market where they successfully compete with Toshiba and other Japanese companies. There are numerous other, similar cases. The focus of this paper is a comparison of Asian manufacturing firms from these three countries, typical of what is often referred to as “Asian tigers” or “Asian dragons,” with Nordic and “Euro-American” manufacturing firms, asking to what extent these firms differ with respect to their innovation practices, and hence, also innovation strategies. The paper focuses on two important topics related to this: exploration practices or what is often called the “fuzzy front-end” of innovation and the commercialization practice of firms. These topics are explored using a comparative analysis based on empirical material provided by a survey done in a project, Managing Innovation in the New Economy (MINE),Footnote 3 in which firms from all over the world have participated. Of these, 473 firms belonged to the category “Manufacturing,” i.e., NACE group “C.” One part of the MINE survey (Part VI) describes innovation strategies and practices. Data obtained from this part of the survey is presented and analyzed in this paper. Asian firms have become competitive in global markets; their goods are competitive not only in price but also in quality and in terms of innovation. The common explanation of Asian superiority has long been low labor costsFootnote 4 and the diligence, discipline, and “work ethics” of its labor force. However, the high quality and innovativeness of Asian firms indicate that other factors may be more relevant. Hence, a comparative approach may provide an insight into possible differences and how these materialize as innovation strategies and practices. As will be shown, what has emerged from the comparative analyses is that Asian, Nordic, and Euro-American manufacturing firms differ in many aspects related to practice in innovation processes, and, by implication, their innovation strategies. However, these differences are not systematic. On the contrary, the picture that emerged is complex, indicating that the notion of a universal “best practice” is not congruent with the way manufacturing firms innovate. The most clear-cut and profound difference between the three categories of firms may be seen in “exploration practices.” In this, i.e., the “fuzzy front-end” of innovation, Asian manufacturing firms can be characterized as extrovert. In commercialization, the similarities and differences are more diverse. In this article, analyses and comparison of these two topics are presented in separate sections. In the final section, the findings are discussed and put in a policy perspective. The first section commences with an explanation of the comparative and analytical approach used in the analyses.",1

Link,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The public reaction to the 2008–2009 economic slowdown in the USA signaled a renewed era of both public accountability for government policies and demands for innovative means to stimulate economic growth and development. A primary US policy response with regard to growth and development was to focus on job creation and investments in innovation. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), also known as The Recovery Act, was signed by newly inaugurated President Barack Obama in February 2009. The premise of this fiscal stimulus was that government spending would quickly lead to business investments and subsequent consumer spending, thus mitigating the current recession. One of the stated purposes of ARRA is to “preserve and create jobs and promote economic recovery.” Another stated purpose of the Act is to “provide investments needed to increase economic efficiency by spurring technological advances…”Footnote 1
 In September 2009, the National Economic Council (2009) released A Strategy for American Innovation: Driving Towards Sustainable Growth and Quality Jobs. This Executive Office of the President report lays “the foundation for the innovation economy of the future.” The initiative “seeks to harness the inherent ingenuity of the American people and a dynamic private sector to ensure that the next [economic] expansion is more solid, broad-based, and beneficial than previous ones” (p. i). Under the heading “A Vision for Innovation, Growth, and Jobs,” the report stated (p. 4): Innovation is essential for creating new jobs in both high-tech and traditional sectors. … A more innovative economy is a more productive and faster growing economy, with higher returns to workers and increases in living standards. … Innovation is the key to global competitiveness, new and better jobs, a resilient economy, and the attainment of essential national goals. To accomplish this, A Strategy for American Innovation emphasized that the economy must invest in the building blocks of American innovation by, among other things, restoring American leadership in fundamental research. Such building blocks will promote competitive markets that spur productive entrepreneurship, and that in turn will catalyze breakthroughs for national priorities. This theme was reemphasized in February 2011 with an updated version of this report. In A Strategy for American Innovation: Securing Our Economic Growth and Prosperity (National Economic Council 2011), the Administration argued that through innovation we will “ensure that our economic growth is rapid, broad-based, and sustained” (p. 1). While a near-term focus on job creation is understandable, the Administration's emphasis on innovation is also important if we are to sustain longer term growth. Indeed, Powell and Snellman's (2004, p. 199) definition of a knowledge economy as one “based on knowledge-intensive activities that contribute to an accelerated pace of technical and scientific advance” suggests that this issue is at the core of what it means to be a knowledge economy. But if longer term growth is crucial to a knowledge economy, the question is which institutions within our, or any nation's, national innovation system will leverage economic growth in the greatest amount for a given investment in innovation (e.g., in R&D), that is, how do we make efficient use of the economy's intellectual capabilities?Footnote 2
 In this paper, we compare and contrast the behavior of two types of research institutions: government research laboratories (hereafter, labs) and university research labs. Because of a unique blend of institutional structures and rewards, we argue that universities are in a better position than government labs to provide the research necessary to stimulate economic growth. The essential reason for this argument is that the institutional structures of government labs and university labs differ. For government labs, this structure results in risk-averse behavior that increases the cost of conducting research and slows the research process down. By contrast, university research takes place in a highly competitive environment that results in risk-neutral (or even risk-taking) behavior that therefore avoids the inefficiencies associated with government labs and results in more efficient research that is more responsive to broad national, as well as more targeted (e.g., regional), needs. In “A Model of Risky Research in Government Versus University Labs” section, we set forth a model of research activity in which the risk of engaging in research, and the associated reward structure for engaging in such research, is the essential element, and we examine the implications of our model for government labs and university labs. In “Summary and Implications” section, we summarize our findings and discuss the implications of our paper for future research.",3

The importance of international cooperation in science and technology is further recognized in the European Union’s Innovation Union flagship initiative and the proposals for Horizon 2020, the next EU funding programme for research and innovation. In September 2012, the European Commission presented its new approach to international cooperation under Horizon 2020 in a Communication entitled ‘Enhancing and focusing EU international cooperation in research and innovation: a strategic approach’ (European Commission 2012). In line with this approach, international cooperation activities developed under Horizon 2020 will aim to contribute to three specific objectives of (a) strengthening the Union’s excellence and attractiveness in research and innovation and its economic and industrial competitiveness, (b) tackling global societal challenges and (c) supporting the Union’s external policies. In reality, however, such collaborative research projects are often viewed primarily as a means to acquiring professional opportunities and extrinsic rewards (such as additional funding), and not as a means to producing knowledge (Ynalvez and Shrum 2011). As the European Commission aims to ensure a strategic and coherent approach to international cooperation through its new strategy, there is an ever-greater need to verify whether its existing funding instruments supporting international scientific cooperation are able to meet these objectives and the needs of European researchers. Given the restructuring to be introduced under Horizon 2020 compared with Framework 7 and the inclusion of mission-oriented research under the grand challenges, more attention is expected to be paid to evaluation of individual science and research policy instruments (Greenhalgh 2013). Until recently, serious discussions regarding funded scientific cooperation were generally discussed in the context of fully funded research projects. Historically, researchers fully relied on government funding to support their research (Bozeman and Gaughan 2007). Many governments and other funding sponsors tend to fund fully research activities within the scope of approved projects. The researchers in such fully funded research projects avail of general research funding support, which often covers the costs of the project (including the cost of managing the project, the cost of equipment and all project-related personnel costs, including their travel and subsistence etc.). Yet, there is another type of funding—networking research funding. This type of funding is more limited as researchers participating in such formal networking research (FNR) projects do not receive any general funding for conducting research, as they receive only funds for facilitating research networking (meetings, exchanges, training schools etc.). The oldest EU-funded mechanism that covers only researchers’ networking related activities is known as European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST). The core activity of this intergovernmental framework is facilitation of pre-competitive scientific networking projects across all scientific domains. COST networks (Actions) allow researchers both within Europe and from outside to cooperate on specific research issues in the field of science and technology. Such formal networking research projects are expected to bring together researchers working on the same research issue and whose research has already attracted national funding. Yet, research collaboration can sometimes have a negative impact on the level of research (Réjean Landry et al. 1996). One issue is that research collaborations unavoidably take additional time and resources of participating collaborators (Rejean Landry and Nabil 1998). Despite the additional burden that participation in FNR projects can bring to participating researchers, the response to COST Open Calls has repeatedly confirmed a strong interest on the part of the European scientific community in COST activities. A persistently strong response to its Open Calls suggests a need for an effective and efficient system to network and coordinate research activities at project level, bringing scientists together under light strategic guidance and letting them work out their ideas, thus contributing to reducing fragmentation in research investments in Europe. While there is strong support in the research community for funding of such scientific cooperation, the existing literature on collaborative research is highly fragmented and limited in its understanding of what motivates researchers to participate in additional research activities, which can also result in additional administrative burden. This paper is one of the few empirical attempts to understand the motives behind researchers’ decision to participate in formal networking research projects, taking the case of projects funded by the European Union (COST Actions) as an example of such formal projects. This analysis utilizes data collected in a survey of potential participants who submitted proposals for new FNR projects. Based on the empirical findings, this research further examines whether there are any differences in the motivation of researchers without and with FNR experience. The implications for future research will also be considered.",

Despite a recently growing interest for nontechnological innovations, the research focus has been mostly on technological product and process innovations. One reason may be the long dominance of the linear innovation model where research and development activities constitute the first phase of a process leading eventually to the introduction of new products on the market. Although the linear innovation model has largely been replaced by more interactive and reflexive forms (Kline and Rosenberg 1986; Lundvall 1992; Edquist 1997; Hakansson et al. 1999; Manley 2003; Graf 2006; Porter 2008; Giuliani 2012), much of the literature still relates mainly to technological product and process innovations. An important reason for this is that a number of indicators have become customary to measure different stages of a “technology driven” innovation process, including indicators for research and development and patent activities, or indicators, such as the introduction of new processes and new products, and related market shares. More policy oriented research activities such as those of the OECD and EC have only recently included other forms of innovation, such as organizational and marketing innovations in their methodology and highlight that a better understanding is needed in particular on the role of nontechnological innovation (OECD 2009). It has been argued in the literature that different innovation types rely on particular kinds of knowledge and knowledge sources (Freel and de Jong 2009; Tödtling et al. 2009; Varis and Littunen 2010). However, there are only few studies that compare “hard” (technological product and process) and “soft” (organizational, strategic, and marketing) innovations considering sector and regional contexts. This paper addresses this research gap drawing mainly on the conceptual framework of knowledge bases (Laestadius 1998; Asheim and Coenen 2005; Asheim and Gertler 2005; Asheim et al. 2007; Martin and Moodysson 2011a, b). The following research questions will be analyzed: Do different types of innovation rely on specific kinds of internal knowledge and of external knowledge sources? To what extent do innovation and knowledge sourcing patterns differ between the investigated sectors and regions? Controlling for sector and regional specificities, are certain types of innovation related to specific factors or sources of internal and external knowledge? As regards the first two research questions, we will use different kinds of cross-tabulations exploiting a rich data set collected in seven European countries. In relation to the third research question, we aim at identifying factors associated with different types of innovation applying binomial logistic regressions. Our findings are partly in line with the knowledge base concept. Whereas this applies in particular for sectors based on analytical and synthetic knowledge, and for technological product and process innovations, we found the concept to be less accurate for analyzing innovation in sectors based on symbolic knowledge and for investigating strategic and organizational innovations. In the following section, we will elaborate on the conceptual and theoretical background underlying this research paper. In “Methodology,” we will provide details about the methodology, the selection of sectors and regions as well as the applied methods of analysis. In the empirical section we will first analyze the innovation activities of the investigated firms as well as the firms’ competencies and knowledge sourcing pattern for each sector and region. Then we will present the results of multivariate models for different types of innovation and connect these with the descriptive results. Finally, in the last section we will draw relevant conclusions.",23

After the Triple Helix model of university–industry–government relations for explaining structural development in a knowledge-based economy was proposed (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 1995, 2000), there were attempts to introduce additional dimensions into the model. The very word “triple” invites for further generalization and implies that there also may be quadruple, quintuple, and other kinds of helixes. Baber (2001) explored the TH of Singapore in the 1980s and described a quadruple helix, formed by a TH and external scientific experts who advised the Singaporean government during the early 1980s on science and industrial policy. According to another view, the growth of certain scientific and technical areas (e.g., biotechnology and nanotechnology) contributes to a reconfiguration of Triple Helix institutions, so that the Triple Helix of university–industry–government obtains an essential fourth helix, the public. Triple Helix institutional actors and individuals from this fourth helix component are supposed to form an “extended peer community,” which is referred to in a work on post-normal science (Mehta 2003). In response to this view, Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz (2003) mentioned that “society” or “public” can hardly be considered as a fourth dimension, because the Triple Helix model represents three specialized functional spheres that interact among variously coded communications and evolve within civil society. Therefore, civil society itself cannot be regarded as an additional institutional sphere. Carayannis and Campbell proposed another conceptualization of the Quadruple Helix innovation system, composed of a media-based and culture-based public (Carayannis and Campbell 2009) and a Quintuple Helix, which frames knowledge and innovation in the context of the natural environments of society and the economy, so that it can be explained as an approach that accords sustainable development and social ecology (Carayannis and Campbell 2010). The authors treated the Triple, Quadruple, and Quintuple Innovation Helices as topologically equivalent modalities with varying degrees of complexity and dimensionality. The argumentation was that the public becomes more integrated into innovation system by using and applying knowledge; therefore, public users should also be considered as part of the innovation system. They underline that sciences and arts should not be considered separately. An interrelation of a scientific and artistic research adds to the productivity of an innovation system. As a reply, Leydesdorff (2012) suggested that even N-tuple helices can be envisioned, in order to gradually extend model in accordance to the needed explanatory power. Regarding the example of Japan, he permits the addition of a fourth helix dimension to the TH model, due to an important role of internationalization. Also, globalization containing the international–national dimension and the private versus public dimension may be considered as yet another extension of the model. But both the international–national dimension and the public–private dimension do not comply with the statement that a fourth dimension should also represent an appropriate institutional sphere. At the same time, Leydesdorff warned against the attempt to move beyond three relevant selection environments. Though theoretically it is possible to move beyond TH model limits, the higher dimensions would be supposed to require separate specification and operationalization in terms of potentially relevant data. Another reason is that other dimensions at present stage may not yet be sufficiently significant but can perhaps arise in future stages of cultural evolution. Moreover, if to suppose that the Triple Helix model of innovations, which is currently in practical use, should be subject to modification, then the questions arise: what higher dimensions should be added to the Triple Helix model, and in what way should they be added? The present paper deals with the above two questions. Though evidence for QH existence is formed by isolated facts, these facts are worthy of consideration, at the very least, in order to prepare ourselves for the future development of events. And I try to express this theoretical perspective for the fourth helix in terms with sufficient policy relevance. This theme paper is an attempt to shed light on the problem: if the TH model at the present time needs to be expanded into the additional dimensions, and in the case of positive answer, in what way can this be done, i.e., what selection environment should serve for the fourth subdynamics, and what can this add to sustainable competitive advantage?",40

Einstein) Innovation is a relatively modern concept associated with the industrial revolution. To gain historical perspective, we could define it more broadly to include the social, commercial, and artistic transformations that, for example, made China a leader in technology for many centuries and later made Italy and Netherlands great innovators in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. We could also view innovation more narrowly as the commercialization of inventions. Such a definition encompasses incremental as well as breakthrough type innovations—the latter leading to the emergence of entirely new products and industries. Both kinds of innovation can lead to economic success. However, it has been a nation’s ability to consistently achieve breakthrough innovations that constituted “innovation leadership.” Innovation leadership is associated with economic, political, and military power. Consistent breakthrough innovation cannot occur without major strengths in education and science. While it was Britain that introduced the industrial revolution in the eighteenth century and became a global superpower in the nineteenth, in the twentieth century, it was first Germany and then the USA that became world leaders in science and innovation. Germany lost that leadership as a result of Nazi policies ultimately leading to complete defeat in World War 2. In this paper, we introduce the concept of the innovation leadership pyramid, which integrates the different components of the innovation process in a logical progression. The model posits an essential link between the excellence of basic science and education and breakthrough innovation. Using a comparative historical approach, we then analyze the rise and fall of Germany as science and innovation leader of the early part of the twentieth century. Our analysis adopts the perspective of such contemporary concepts as national innovation systems, the triple helix, and university–business collaboration (“third mission” of the university). We find that in fact Germany was an important precursor and successful practitioner of these concepts well before they became regarded as best practice after 1980. We then pose the question of why modern Germany, in spite of its economic success, was not able to restore its preeminence in science and breakthrough innovations. In our conclusions, we propose to draw important lessons from the successes and failures of Germany especially for countries that aspire to innovation leadership today. We argue that although many conditions have changed, key rules of maintaining innovation leadership remain valid.",6

Should I start a new business? Should I invest in new machinery or technologies? Should I spend more money on research and development? But unlike entrepreneurs in countries such as the USA, where rules and regulations governing business activities tend to be stable and predictable, entrepreneurs in Russia are confronted with an often shifting and unpredictable set of government directives and priorities. In such a situation, with all its dynamic change, complexity, risk, and uncertainty, how should creators, inventors, innovators, and entrepreneurs in Russia as well as other transitioning and emerging economies make business decisions? More particularly, how should they decide whether, when and how to develop, produce, and commercialize new products, new services, new technologies, new models to ensure best possible results across a triple bottom line set of considerations (social, financial, and environmental)? In short, how should they decide whether, when and how to innovate in the face of a policy environment that is prone to abrupt, inconsistent and unpredictable changes driven by both endogenous and exogenous factors and dynamics? On the other hand, there are policymakers who often are not at all certain about which innovation policy could be best in terms of maximizing social welfare or according to other criteria or priorities. And they are also confronted by challenges about their best possible strategies as well as how they should go about creating, evaluating, and piloting an array of alternatives for their policy options horizon. In other words, what may be the more efficacious incentives for creators, inventors, innovators, and entrepreneurs?

Carayannis,Evangelos Grigoroudis,Christian Walter,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Organizations are open systems operating under conditions of substantial turbulence, risk (known unknowns), and uncertainty (unknown unknowns) and seeking to balance stability and coherence with flexibility and change in pursuit of higher levels of efficacy and routine excellence. In addition, organizations exist, survive, and prosper on the basis of a sound value proposition and functional business model that helps unlock, capture, and redistribute in an efficacious manner the value added by the organization in question. Reinmoeller and Van Baardwijk (2005) identified four primary enterprise innovation strategies: knowledge management, exploration, cooperation, and entrepreneurship. Briefly, knowledge management is reusing of tacit and explicit enterprise knowledge, exploration refers to experimentation for the purpose of finding meaningful recombinations of enterprise knowledge, cooperation refers to assessing and reusing complementary knowledge of supply chain and other enterprise ecosystem partners, and entrepreneurship may be characterized as experimentation aimed and identification of new meaning in the enterprise landscape. Business Model Innovation (BMI) is a concept based on the premise that firms can innovate leveraging their internal capabilities and resources (Amit and Zott 2010) and therefore relates to several of the aforementioned enterprise innovation strategies. It has been argued that the innovation of a business model can be a response to environmental changes, since an organizations business models might be victim to a shelf life, due to technological advancements (Chesbrough 2010). Despite the increasing amount of literature on BMI, a sound theoretical foundation is still missing, which is also true for the concept of business models itself (Schneider and Spieth 2013). Like the BMI literature, the Business Model (BM) existing literature is not very well structured, but despite Porter’s (2000) early doubt in the BM concept, many scholars argue that a business model can provide a concise framework that explains how firms create and capture value, and clarify how enterprises monetize their innovations (De Reuver et al. 2013). One of the strengths of BMs is that it provides a narrative that lays out the activities and structure of the business, which can improve execution (Magretta 2002). Indeed, the reason for becoming and then being a sustainable, profitable, and scalable entity for a new firm (and for that matter for a nonprofit but value-adding and value-maximizing new organization) is centered around the value proposition and BM concepts and especially in a knowledge-based and knowledge-driven context (Carayannis 2008; Carayannis et al. 2011, 2012, 2013a). Therefore, developing a grounded theory of an organic typology and adaptive taxonomy of BMs with the capacity to evolve into more effective and efficient mechanisms of value creation, as well as value unlocking, capturing, and leveraging, may indeed be a core element of the current and emerging state of the art in related organization science, theory, policy, and practice matters. This could be especially the case concerning cocreation, coopetition, coevolution, and cospecialization competences driven by higher order learning processes (Carayannis 2008; Carayannis and Provance 2008; Carayannis and Campbell 2009, 2010, 2012; Carayannis et al. 2013a). This has particular significance in the emerging and increasingly influential open innovation ecosystems approach to the study of the nature and dynamics of competitive strategy in knowledge-driven environments. Indeed, we consider targeted open innovation to be the core operationalization context of the emerging grounded theory, typology, and taxonomy of BMI and within this context the case of smart specialization strategies as an enabler of sustainable differentiation via focusing on financially, socially as well as environmentally sustainable technology and market niches (Carayannis et al. 2013b). Velamuri et al. (2013) note that BMI is particularly interesting for enterprises facing commoditization, such as manufacturing firms. This is because of increasing cost-pressure, difficulties in differentiation, and threats of easy substitution. This is mainly true for organizations in developed countries, but it is also a reality that is faced by manufacturers in developing countries. When developing countries move towards the level of developed countries, labor cost and labor expectations increase and their competitive advantage is vanishing. The main aim of the paper is to demonstrate how organization sustainability and resilience can be achieved with BMI. The role and importance of several factors in the process is also studied (e.g., the importance and influence of organization design on the development of innovation). The present case study shows also how BMI can be used to overcome commoditization challenges partly by moving from a BM focused on the trade of goods to a BM focused on the trade of tasks (Carayannis et al. 2011). In addition, the results provide insights to manufacturers in developing countries in overcoming their dependence on commoditized products and OEM manufacturing while maintaining a sustainable ecosystem. It should be emphasized that the present study may contribute to the current research examining the role of the main BMI competences (i.e., resources, dynamic capabilities, and corporate entrepreneurship) to develop such competitive advantages and explore new business opportunities so that firms may achieve sustainable enterprise excellence. The following sections will briefly discuss the existing literature on BMs and BMI, before the different elements of the BM are set into the context of organizational sustainability and resilience, which will set the stage for the empirical analysis. Subsequently, the paper will outline the research approach taken before the cases will be described in detail and findings will be evaluated, as well as comprehensively discussed. Finally, implications for theory, policy and practice, and future research will be outlined.",81

Does the economic structure affect the regional systems of innovation in the Arab region? What are the major implications? We examine three hypotheses; the first hypothesis is that the regional systems of innovation exist but characterized by serious weaknesses in the Arab region compared with other world regions. This hypothesis implies that the Arab region has manifestly lagged far behind other world regions in terms of science and technology (S&T), innovation, knowledge, technological capabilities, spending on information and communication technology (ICT), competitiveness and integration in the world economy. We examine the second hypothesis that the structure of the economy has significant effect in the performance of innovation system in the Arab region. This hypothesis implies that the Arab region shows remarkable diversity not only regarding economic growth (per capita income/income level), structure of the economy, but also concerning systems of innovation, mainly, subsystems of education, S&T, ICT and networking. We examine the third hypothesis that apart from the remarkable diversity in the Arab region, the poor Arab systems of innovation has serious implications. These serious implications appear in terms of poor competitiveness, integration in the global economy, knowledge economy index, share of high-technology export, technology infrastructure, technology achievement index and capacity to create knowledge in the Arab region. Several studies in the literature use different classifications of Arab countries according to the structure of the economy, geographical location and income level based on the World Bank classification of economies according to income level. Our analysis using the classification of Arab countries according to the structure of the economy is interesting to add new aspects and differs from the existing studies covering the Arab region. Particularly, our study differs from the existing studies in the Arab literature that use different classifications of the Arab countries according to income level (Nour 2011) and geographical location in Asia and Africa (cf. UNDP (United Nations Development Programme) 2004) in the Gulf or Mediterranean (cf. Nour 2003; 2005). Moreover, different from the existing studies in the Arab literature that use the classification of Arab countries according to the structure of the economy to discuss the economic and development issues in the Arab region (cf. Ali 2004; Economic Research Forum (ERF) 1998), our study use the same classification to discuss the regional systems of innovation in the Arab region. Particularly, we examine the poor performance of the regional systems of innovation in the Arab region according to certain criterion, mainly the classification of Arab countries according to the structure of the economy. We believe that the selection of this criterion seems quite consistent with the well-known stylized facts and widely used standard classification of Arab countries according to their reliance on natural resources. Moreover, since, the level of income is closely related to economic structure, so the selection of this criterion is quite consistent with the conventional view concerning the positive relationship between knowledge necessary for building efficient systems of innovation and development/income level, since knowledge and innovative capabilities are concentrated in high-income and developed countries as indicated in numerous studies (cf. UNESCO-UIS 2004; The World Bank 1999; OECD 1997).Footnote 2 Moreover, we use recent and updated data and provide more comprehensive study compared to few studies on the systems of innovation in the Arab region (cf. Djeflat 1999). We fill the gap in the Arab literature by explaining the relationship between the regional systems of innovation and structure of the economy in the Arab region and the implications of the weak systems of innovation in the Arab region. Moreover, we support the efforts aim to enhance Arab innovation systems by improving understanding about the importance of enhancing institutions necessary for building innovation systems in the Arab region. The paper also refers to relevant literature on the regional systems of innovation in the following section. Hence, this paper is interesting as it integrates the most widely used indicators of the systems of innovation with the economic structure and presents a new and more comprehensive analysis for the Arab region. Similar to the studies in the literature, we define the system of innovation by subsystems including education institutions, S&T institutions defined by S&T input-output indicators (research and development (R&D), patent and publications) and information (ICT)Footnote 3 institutions. Moreover, we use other indicators such as competitiveness, high-technology export and knowledge economy index. Regarding the research method, we use the descriptive and comparative methods of analysis. We are aware of the fact that it would be useful to use as a research method Linstone’s multiple perspectives approach that includes three types of technical, organizational and personal perspectives. However, our analysis will not use Linstone’s multiple perspectives approach; due to practical problems related to scarcity of necessary data on the three types of technical, organizational and personal perspectives, we leave that for more in-depth analysis in the future based on data availability.Footnote 4
 One major limitation of our analysis in this paper is related to the relevance and implications of the systems of innovation described in the literature to the analysis of Arab region as part of developing countries (cf. Shulin 1999). We are aware of the conceptual and methodological difficulties of applying the systems of innovation approach of the developed countries to the developing countries. We believe that due to limited studies focusing on the developing countries (cf. Shulin 1999; Muchie et al. 2003), the available literature still provides useful insights for our purpose and analysis in this paper, mainly because of special emphasis on institutional settings for enhancing efficient systems of innovation. The second limitation is related to the limited scope of our analysis since our aim is to explain only the characteristics and implications of Arab regional innovation systems by investigating the subsystems of educational institutions, S&T and R&D institutions and information (ICT) institutions. While we admit that it is also essential to investigate the linkage and interaction between these institutions, however, due to scarcity of necessary information, our analysis will not cover the interaction between these institutions; we leave that for more in-depth analysis in the future. Apart from these limitations, our paper is useful to improve understanding of the characteristics and implications of Arab regional systems of innovation. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: “Conceptual Framework and Literature Review” presents the conceptual framework and literature review. “General Socioeconomic Characteristics of the Arab Region” shows the general socioeconomic characteristics of Arab region. “The Existence and Characteristics of Arab Regional Systems of Innovation” discusses the characteristics of Arab regional systems of innovation. “Implications of Poor Arab Regional Systems of Innovation” explains the major implications of the systems of innovation in the Arab region. Finally, “Conclusions” provides the conclusions and policy recommendations.",4

Earlier findings in Nour (2005) indicate that the transfer of knowledge is successful within firms, but is somewhat doubtful between firms and universities and within society at large. Our analysis shows that within society at large, the transfer of knowledge is hindered by low-skill levels, deficient educational and training systems, lack of incentives and an imbalanced structure of the population. The transfer of knowledge between universities and firms is hindered by the lack of incentives such as subsidies, and the lack of networks, information systems, cooperation and interest in conducting joint research between universities and firms and matching the relevance of universities’ research to firms needs. One implication of our earlier analysis is that the Gulf countries need to stimulate the incidence and transfer of knowledge at the aggregate level by providing more incentives, for example through subsidies, to education and training to upgrade skill levels, and also by raising spending on research and development (R&D) and information and communication technologies (ICT), organisation, coordination and cooperation. Further incentives, such as subsidies, should be provided to stimulate the transfer of knowledge between universities and firms that requires a good knowledge base within firms and incentives, for example, subsidies to education and training to enhance skill levels, and subsidies to R&D, networks organisation, information, coordination and cooperation. In this paper, we extend our earlier analysis and explain the importance (impacts) of knowledge at both micro and macro levels in the Gulf countries in more detail. In addition, we show the factors contributing to improve the tacit knowledge within firms. Due to the lack of relevant data to assess the transfer of knowledge amongst firms and between firms and universities, we focus only on the impacts of knowledge within the firms and at the aggregate/macro level. The rest of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 briefly shows the importance and sources of knowledge in the growth literature; Section 3 presents our hypothesis to test some stylized facts about the importance of knowledge and explains the data used to test them; Section 4 discusses the main findings and Section 5 provides the conclusions.",2

A great deal of a Higher Education Institution’s (HEI’s) status is assessed mainly by referring to those two missions; although, in spite of apparent semantic clearness, a great variety of practices falls under the terms that designate them. There is definitively much less consensus about the so-called third mission (Gleeson 2010) which is an expression generally used to refer to an even wider horizon of strategies and practices which engage universities beyond the campus gates. The expression “third mission” refers to the social role of universities and can be therefore declined in different ways, ranging from dispassionate analyses and teaching to active engagement and public participation. Social engagement can be actively pursued by an institution through the most diverse activities and according to varying degrees of public involvement, such as outreach, consultation, collaboration or shared leadership. Also, the geographical extension of different forms of HEIs-society relations may insist upon local communities or extend to regional, national or international contexts. The UK’s Government White Paper on Science and Innovation assigns a central role to universities in acting as “dynamos of growth” in the knowledge economy: “not just creators of knowledge, trainers of minds and transmitters of culture, but […] also major agents of economic growth” (Department of Trade and Industry 2000, p. 27). That is the position of other national governments that are presently reconsidering the role of universities, notably as to their position within the knowledge economy. The widespread emphasis on the growing relevance of a knowledge-driven economy is a powerful lever for Higher Education Systems’ (HES’) change, but it often tends to reduce the role of universities to the economic dimension or even simply to the market. That attitude is reflected in policies and academic debates that are inclined to relegate third stream activities to their commercial relevance. Both the European Commission (Polt et al. 2001) and the Oecd (1997, 2001a and 2001b) have promoted inquiries aimed at benchmarking interactions between industries and science, particularly insisting on the economic aspects of knowledge production and transfer. Many national governments are presently reorienting their policies and reconsidering their attitudes as to the role of HEIs. For instance, Molas-Gallart et al. (2002, pp. iii–iv) observe that “The UK government is committed to harnessing the economic potential of universities and to this end, it has launched a series of programmes to increase Third Stream activities in UK universities”. But, authors point out, such programmes mainly focus on commercial activities and are thus “likely to miss large and important parts of the picture” as “universities perform a wide range of roles, responsibilities and activities. They cut across different economic, political and social networks.” Conversely, many authors tend to identify third mission with a service mission and prefer emphasizing community engagement and impactFootnote 1 on policies, rather than other forms of university-society interactions. Higher education is built on a theory… (H)igher education is a stool, and the stool has three legs: research, teaching, and service. There is a reason it has three legs. The service is there because it keeps the teaching and research honest. It keeps them connected to everyday problems that people have to address. And that is part of what the role of an institution of higher education ought to be (Mason, cited in Schuetze 2010, p. 17). The stool metaphor emphasizes the interdependences between research, education and service: three legs of the same length and strength. But agreement on that kind of view is far from being acquired: practices and approaches to public engagement differ considerably. The variety of approaches is reflected by the diversity of terms employed. Expressions like public engagement, service mission, community engagement, community service and the like are often used as synonymous of third mission, whereas more cautious sources make opportune distinctions, notably considering public engagement as part of the wider notion of third mission. Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Learning (2007, p. 1) defines community engagement as follows: Community engagement describes the collaboration between institutions of higher education and their larger community (local, regional/state, national, global) for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources in a context of partnership and reciprocity. Such a definition is sufficiently unambiguous but at the same time very extensive. In fact, it clearly identifies the ambit of community engagement, thus avoiding improper confusion with other third mission activities, notably whereas it dwells on some key issues: collaboration and partnership, mutual benefit, exchange and reciprocity. Nonetheless, it remains vague as it may embrace activities ranging from technology transfer to outreach and to service. Notwithstanding policy discussion (Oecd 1983, 1999, 2001c and 2007) and frequent advocacy by academics and institutions (Checkoway 2001; Simon 2009; Commission 1999; Walshok 1995; Boyte and Hollander 1999), attitudes towards public engagement vary significantly. Some critics point out that universities may not be efficient in assuring community service, while others assert that benefits deriving from HEI’s engagement for society can be less relevant than the ones resulting from traditional educational and research practices. On the other side, community engagement partisans reply that benefits for society are far from being irrelevant and that, furthermore, HEIs might gain in public trust and diffused confidence in science. Others point out that recent transformations demand for a different social role of universities (Gleeson 2010; see also Aranguren and Larrea 2011; Chessa and Vargiu 2011). All in all, it can be observed that the varying meanings that different authors attach to the expression “third mission” actually reflect the diverse visions of higher education and therefore the changing attitudes about its role and functions within society which are attached to varying normative discourses. A difficulty arises then in disentangling prescriptive and descriptive uses of the terms employed to refer to third mission at large. Hence, attitudes and practices vary significantly among HEIs, but also within a single university, between departments or disciplines, for instance. As Mohrman (2010) points out, various levels of public engagement may be observed about a great variety of activities and operational spheres of an institution, for instance concerning mission, leadership, hiring policies, organization, funding, student, faculty or community involvement and communication (see also Furco and Miller 2009; Holland 2009). University engagement may concern a variety of activities that imply different approaches, methodologies and results. Schuetze (2010) discusses three exemplary kinds of activity areas that may be brought back to different declinations of the term third mission: (1) academic knowledge transfer, (2) university continuing education and (3) community-based research and service-learning. Academic knowledge transfer is probably the most diffused form of university-community relationship (Bozeman 2000). It is mainly, although not exclusively, valued for its economic benefits and commercial relevance. According to Varga (2009), it may take place via formal or informal networks of professionals connected to universities, through formalized business relations or thanks to access to HEI’s facilities like laboratories or libraries. Schuetze (2010) points out that the concept of technology transfer is too narrow, as it suggests the idea that knowledge can be produced in one place and then passed on to the rest of society through a downstream process. Extensive literature underlines the fact that the generation and uses of knowledge cannot be reduced to such a simplistic view (Jasanoff 2004). Co-creation of knowledge and knowledge flows follow paths that are much more complex than that (Carayannis and Campbell 2009; Schoonmaker and Carayannis 2012). University continuing education concerns outreach activities that are provided for by universities beyond traditional curricular study courses and may thus include public seminars and lectures, professional education and short-term courses. Emphasis on continuing education is growing within HEIs, notably related to the increased demand for life-long learning activities which represents an interesting possibility of income for the institution. Depending on educational forms and strategies adopted, it may tend more towards simple knowledge transfer rather than community engagement. Community-based research (CBR) and service-learning are two forms of intense engagement and connection with communities that can be put into practice separately or in mixed forms (Strand et al. 2003). CBR is a kind of research that is generally done with communities and people, instead of on or about them. It can be run by recurring to different degrees and ways of participation of community members, but always aims at redefining the asymmetric relations that characterize traditional research practices (Vargiu 2008). Likewise, service-learning is a kind of educational activity that goes beyond normal study visits or apprenticeships, as it aims at forms of collaboration which benefit not only both the student and the community but also the researcher and the institution as a whole. Service-learning is particularly diffused in Northern America. In the European context, a peculiar form of educational service activity has been developed building on experiences carried out in Holland in the 1970s, which aims at serving communities and civil society organizations by means of the so-called science shops (Wachelder 2003). Both service-learning and science shops aim at increasing social capital and community capacity through participation and the circulation of diverse knowledge and savoir-faire, hence generating trust in university (Ellis et al. 2008). The guiding principles of CBR and service-learning/science shops profoundly differ from those that animate knowledge transfer and continuing education, as they focus on a peculiar possible kind of science-society relationship. Such a distinction has a heuristic value, rather than a prescriptive one. In fact, it can turn useful in order to identify a specific dimension of public engagement and thus help clearing some of the conceptual fog that often shroud the notions of third mission and public engagement. Both CBR and service-learning/science shops are based on strict interaction and partnership with community members and organizations and are strongly based on reciprocity principles. According to Polanyi (1944), reciprocity is the main regulatory principle of the community and is facilitated on symmetry of relationships. It differs from redistribution and exchange which are the forms of regulation that are more typical respectively of the state and of the market. On such premises, the Carnegie Foundation’s definition of community engagement previously recalled becomes more clear. Reciprocity and symmetry of relationships amongst actors (normally spatially close) can be pointed out as the two distinctive elements to identify community engagement as a subset of public engagement. The exemplary tripartition of third mission activities discussed in Schuetze (2010) can be, to a certain degree, superimposed to Polanyi’s tripartition among primary regulatory principles. Three dimensions of the wide notion of third mission can thus be identified, respectively mainly oriented by exchange (market), redistribution (state) or reciprocity principles (community). Of course, like in Polanyi’s idea, those principles are to be intended as primarily but not exclusively marking each distinct ambit. Therefore, spheres often overlap. Notably, as known, in Polanyi’s view, redistribution and reciprocity can feed on each other, as centricity and symmetry on which they respectively rest can “meet halfway” (1944, p. 49). In our case, that makes the distinction between redistributive engagement and reciprocal engagement rather blurred. In fact, literature often tends to subsume those two spheres of action under the wide public engagement notion, notably distinguishing them from more market-driven kinds of third stream activities. Nonetheless, reciprocity and symmetry of relationships can be retained as distinguishing features of community engagement as a specific and more circumscribed subarea of public engagement of universities. As said above, different terms employed and their attached meanings are often related to different normative discourses. For instance, two main driving factors usually underpinning community engagement are often recalled as the following: (a) a significant portion of academic goals can be best achieved through local and regional cooperation and partnership for knowledge building and sharing and (b) universities have the responsibility to contribute to community well-being, notably through the fortification of human capital, diffused knowledge and active citizenship (Garlick and Langworthy 2008). Such factors can be thus related to specific prevailing interests. To that respect, the above proposed tripartition based on the reference to Schuetze and Polanyi can be usefully related to the three main knowledge constitutive interests which, according to Habermas (1968), can be attached to different epistemologies. The connections that in Habermas’ view can be established between interests, knowledge production and communicative and participative options can show useful to identify different attitudes towards third mission activities and thus help to better specify the semantics of the terms hereby considered. Table 1 resumes the overall tripartite scheme hereby proposed. As it can be deduced from the table, third stream activities that are mainly market, state or community oriented not only respond to different regulatory principles and serve distinct prevailing interests but are also generally oriented to diverse stakeholders, which therefore ask for often dissimilar accountability measures and criteria and respond to different evaluation principles and parameters. In the following pages, those aspects will be discussed firstly addressing the issue of the need for evaluation of public engagement vis-à-vis the most diffused assessment practices of market-oriented third stream activities. An overview of possible approaches to such evaluation will be dealt with. Finally, on the basis of three reports that were chosen after wide literature screening, a set of possible indicators for public engagement at institutional level will be presented, confronted and shortly discussed in order to identify a shortlist based on validity and feasibility. Some integration will also be proposed in the light of critical aspects that will emerge from discussion. Most pertinent indicators for community engagement will also be pointed out.",23

Previous studies have focused on knowledge creation within the firm, with analysis pioneered by Nonaka (1994) and Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) of the organizational characteristics of knowledge creation mechanisms. Their model of the knowledge creation mechanism in organizations is a spiral of socialization, externalization, combination, and internalization, which they called the “SECI” process. At the core of the spiral process is a continual dialog between explicit and tacit knowledge which drives the creation of new ideas and concepts. They clarify the conditions which enable knowledge creation and explain the process of creating tacit knowledge. Nonaka’s model gained much attention and was well regarded as a practical theory of organizational knowledge creation, but some recent critics of the theory, for example, Bereiter (2002, pp. 175–9) and Gourlay (2006), argue that the model does not fit the reality of the contemporary business world, in which research and development and innovation occur due to interactions of actors both inside and outside the firm. A typical example is the open innovation model, in which research and development outputs of venture companies are purchased and become new research and development inputs of major companies. Complementing the organizational mechanism of knowledge creation is the economic analysis of knowledge creation, as pioneered by Berliant and Fujita (2008, 2009, 2011, 2012), who studied the knowledge creation process by identifying diversity as a key factor. Melnikas (2010) observes that the creation and development processes in a knowledge-based society and the knowledge economy are determined by the economic system, which transforms the global movements of the economy into sustainable development processes. Gunn and Johri (2011) model the endogenous production of knowledge capital through a learning-by-doing process and describe the situation where the value of knowledge capital rises when firms are induced to invest more staff time in the development of knowledge capital. The questions we pose here are twofold. First, how is new knowledge created through the collaboration of producers and consumers? Second, how is the market value of new knowledge determined? The importance of knowledge creation through collaboration with consumers in designing products has been recognized in the modern economy as discussed by Esper et al. (2010). A typical example is the Genius Bar located in Apple stores. Formally, the Genius Bar is designed to provide support to customers. Apple, however, utilizes this support system as a knowledge creation system by collaborating with innovative or cyber consumers who are sophisticated and informed consumers, influencers and potential advocates for the brand. Rogers (1995) classified consumer attitudes toward purchasing products into five categories in his book Diffusion of Innovations. These categories include innovators (2.5 % of consumers), opinion leaders or early adopters (13.5 %), early majority adopters (34 %), late majority adopters (34 %), and laggards or very late adopters (16 %). For more information on the concept of the cyber consumer, see the RealBusiness websiteFootnote 1. By employing these types of consumers as support staff in the Genius Bar, Apple creates knowledge on the real-time needs of consumers and provides proactive opinions on the products from interacting with mass customers. Consumer-focused knowledge creation systems are gaining in importance as social networking services have gained a larger role in society and the economy. Even before the internet was prevalent in society, knowledge creation systems that incorporate outside knowledge attracted considerable attention. Cohen and Levinthal (1990) propose an “absorption theory” and argue that the ability to evaluate and utilize outside knowledge depends on the management systems available for prior knowledge, which includes both basic skills and the most recent scientific and technological developments in a given field. As pioneering work on knowledge creation through social networking services (SNSs), Cross et al. (2001) examine the effectiveness of social networking in problem solving. By analyzing how consumers use social media, it becomes possible to track the competitive landscape and monitor consumer feedback. Questions and complaints can be analyzed to identify trends and build brand affinity. Cropanzano and Mitchell (2005) review social exchange theory, which aims to explain the state of knowledge exchange in society, and examine the conditions that would indicate good explanatory power of the theory. In a series of research works on “open innovation,” Chesbrough studies the superiority of open innovation in research and development (see Chesbrough 2003, 2006, 2007, 2010). Quigley et al. (2007) examine the incentive structure of knowledge sharing and conclude that self-set goals and knowledge sharing have direct and interactive effects on individual performance. Swift et al. (2010) develop a model of knowledge sharing that considers both personal and contextual factors in explaining individual motivation. Kotler et al. (2010) argues that the concept of knowledge creation in the consumer market has moved from mere customer satisfaction to attaining higher affirmation of the human spirit. In their book, they argue that today’s customers choose products and companies which satisfy deeper needs for creativity, community, and idealism. That is, the knowledge creation system incorporates the essence of humanity in creating value in the market. Meeting these needs of consumers is one reason why collaboration between producers and consumers is deemed to be important. The purposes of this paper are to describe the behaviors of consumers and producers in the knowledge creation process and derive the optimal strategy for increasing the value of creativity in the market. We mathematically model the incentives that consumers have to contribute to knowledge creation. This analysis complements the previous studies listed above and elucidates the system of knowledge creation through collaboration among consumers. Unlike in previous studies, the price setting strategy of producers is examined by relating it to knowledge creation activities of consumers. The analysis in this paper reveals that the value of a product to the consumer depends on the amount of knowledge creation by consumers, which is affected by the amount of public infrastructure, which, in turn, affects the price of the product. The composition of this paper is as follows: the second section describes the model of consumer behavior in knowledge creation, the third section examines the best response function and discusses its properties, the fourth section describes producer behavior and examines the properties of market equilibrium and the fifth section concludes this paper.",3

A Case Study of Israeli Colleges,September 2014,Yoav Gal,Adiv Gal,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Decision-making processes in accelerated knowledge economics have become convoluted and difficult to manage. Feedback processes and external factors play central roles in managerial considerations and decisions at every level of organizations. This problem is also encountered in quintessential knowledge organizations like academic institutions, which also need to make managerial decisions based on data collected from organizational processes. This article shall explicate the direct link between students’ ratings of teaching quality and their expectations of the personal grades they will receive in those courses. This article is the sequel to a previous one entitled, Knowledge Bias by Utilizing the Wording on Feedback Questionnaires (Gal and Gal 2013). A large number of studies dealing with student feedback have been written, and the corpus of studies on the subject continues to expand. Therefore, from the outset, it cannot be argued that this article includes all aspects of the subject of student feedback. Although great efforts were made to find and identify as many sources as possible, in order to cover all of the germane theories, there is a great deal of interest in this field of study, and it is likely that some references will not be mentioned here. The phenomenon of biased behavior of students is perceived as a world-wide problem (Bar-Yehuda 2006). It can be found in a range of institutions, from the leading universities to the smallest community colleges, from the USA, through Europe, to the Far East. During the last 30 years, an increase in biased behavior of students has been observed and the most important factor that affects it has been the desire of students to improve their grades (Nath and Lovaglia 2009). Students tend to differentiate between intangible ethics and their real behavior. That is, if a student does not identify a situation as one has ethical characteristics, the student might, instead, use another consideration, i.e., relying on social norms or cost/benefit considerations (Eisenberg 2004). One reason for the phenomenon is the deterioration in societal ethics and mores generally, and the competition between students striving for higher grades. Two types of factors in biased behavior of students can be distinguished: one relies on the students’ behavior and the other on the academic institution’s culture and the messages it promulgates. The factors that were found to affect it that were associated with the students depended on such variables as demographic variables, academic ability, and psychological, ethnic, social, and environmental variables. The factors associated with the institution’s messages are characteristics of the institution, like the behavior of the academic staff, the institution’s policies, and the institution’s perception of cheating and enforcement of its rules. Thinking bias in the direction of personal benefit leads a person to erroneous conclusions, according to which an act which is not in fact ethical is perceived as ethically legitimate. A widespread opinion in society holds that “If everyone can then I can too, since I want to be like everyone else.” It can thus be said that students’ values have changed over the years, and the desire to succeed at any cost and by any means has become the most important factor (Sharon et al. 2007). Two types of motivation can be distinguished among students: internal and external. Internal motivation is what inspires study in order to acquire knowledge. External motivation prompts students to learn so as to prove their ability and display their diplomas. One view, therefore, holds that as early as elementary school, students can be distinguished by what motivates them to study. Furthermore, it is external motivation that is linked to dishonest behavior. A student who is motivated by performance and thus by external factors was found to have a higher probability of biased behavior (Rettinger and Kramer 2009). This article addresses the students’ perceptions of the relationship between the rating scores they give to the lecturer and the personal grade (see definition below) that the student will receive later for the course. The motivation for examining the relationship between the ratings given on the feedback forms and the personal grades that the students receive for the course is related to an animated discussion on the subject of the perception of teaching and learning, as well as to the status of the lecturer and paths to advancement in academia. A great deal of criticism has been leveled against using feedback questionnaires to assess teaching, because it misses the principal goal, which is to continually improve the level of teaching. There are those who think that student feedback is not used to improve the quality of teaching but in fact is used to improve/harm the personal status of the lecturer, particularly the conditions of the employment, salary, and advancement. Conditioned by TV reality talent shows in which viewers “vote” for or against a candidate, students may be “voting” for or against a lecturer. Others think that the students’ ratings of a lecturer have an effect on the personal grades that the lecturer gives the students, which might be higher than they deserve. From the lecturers’ point of view, evidence based on the literature shows that surveys of teaching constitute a source of anxiety and might cause a negative counter-reaction to the students by some of the lecturers. These negative attitudes can stem from the lecturers’ belief that the students’ evaluations are frequently biased and are affected by things that are not necessarily germane and to the point, like the grade that the students are hoping to get. These beliefs in turn lead the lecturers to doubt the validity as well as fairness of the surveys and to worry that the survey will be used against them in the future when the academic institution’s administration makes its decisions about their continued employment and about promotions. On the students’ part, studies show that students perceive the process of filling out the feedback as something that is very important and they believe that the feedback reflects the quality of teaching. They also believe that they themselves are in a special position that enables them to evaluate aspects of teaching the course in a way that others, like colleagues or administrative supervisors, cannot. Nevertheless, a fair number of studies indicate that for the most part, the students do not believe that the administration even looks at their feedback questionnaires seriously or places any importance whatsoever on their opinions. A huge disparity exists in the way in which lecturers and students relate to feedback, and apparently, these disparities cause tension between the expectations and goals of the two groups. Nevertheless, several questions arise: based on that same tension between the lecturers and students, can the lecturers manipulate the feedback questionnaires to get higher scores from the students? And do the students use their power over the lecturers to receive higher personal grades? The relationship between the course personal grade that the student receives and the ratings on the feedback forms are problematic when they do not correlate with the quality of the student’s learning. Therefore, the first part of the article once again addresses the question of whether the students perceive a relationship between the feedback scores and the personal grades they receive in the course. The analysis will be based on the question of gender differences in these perceptions. The study was conducted at Tel-Hai College (THC), located in the extreme north of Israel. Although THC is considered to be a peripheral college, it has an excellent reputation. The study was done as part of an effort undertaken in 2012 to improve the learning process and was designed to identify potential problems. The second part of the paper summarizes efforts to improve the learning systems that were conducted during the 2011–2012 academic year in two colleges: THC and Kinneret-College (KC). The two colleges are approximately 50 miles (80 km.) distant from each other and attract the same target populations of students. They are both considered to be peripheral colleges but are administered differently. At THC, great emphasis is placed on academic excellence and community involvement, while at KC, the emphasis is on providing opportunities for a broad range of students by setting acceptance requirements low. The different policies taken by the administrations of the two colleges result in different outcomes and different importance placed on student feedback as part of the decision-making process. Both colleges tested new, quite similar systems of learning during the 2011–2012 academic year. At THC, they emphasized excellence, and student feedback was only used as an aid in making decisions. By contrast, KC accorded primary importance to student feedback in making its academic and personnel decisions. The results were that at THC, the experiment continued to the second stage, with adjustments that took into account the students’ feedback, while at KC, it was decided to cease the initiative, since the students “disliked” the entire process.",5

Researchers have been conducted that measure the knowledge growth in organizations to capitalize the benefits of identifying such growth for strategic advantage. Knowledge management has become progressively more important as organizations realize that valuable use of their huge and different knowledge assets and resources provides them with the capability to innovate and respond to rapid changing customer prospects. In order to develop organizational effectiveness, learning must continue to take place for it enables knowledge to grow. Serrat (2009) observed that both individuals and groups are the units of knowledge creation and production. He added that when knowledge and awareness are created in the minds of individuals, the growth of knowledge thrives in a web of social communication between individuals, groups, and organization. Generally, most organizations experience the pressure of global competition and the significant technological developments that are taking place have a different sort of impact on organizations. Moreover, customer demands require that organizations are able to create and deliver value in the form of products and services (Carlucci & Lerro, 2010). Knowledge must constantly evolve to meet organizational challenges. Moreover, the ever knowledge increasing needs to share, capture, distribute, and protect tacit knowledge. Innovation is one of the top priorities to generate more revenue (Alstete, 2007). For this to happen, managers must have the ability to supervise and protect their organizational knowledge advantage (Awad & Ghaziri, 2004). As Alstete (2007) puts it, it has become extremely important for organizations to know just how much they know. Because of these phenomena, many researchers have proposed some frameworks for mapping and assessing levels of knowledge in organizations. Such model was suggested by Bohn (1994) who proposed an eight-stage model; started by stage 1, complete ignorance, it does not exist (nowhere), and finished by stage 8, completed knowledge (it never happens). Additionally, organizations that have achieved a certain level of knowledge growth are able to capitalize the knowledge they gained to automate their business processes and exploit such advantage to other knowledge management components in generating effective results (Tiwana, 2002). Knowledge growth enhances the management and delivery practices of organizations, which tantamount to helping these organizations to better prepare themselves for the future. Consequently, this paper proposes to model the growth of organizational knowledge and its relation with the knowledge capital in organizations. In doing so, it identifies and assesses the component features for modeling knowledge growth. Further, there seems to be ample opportunities to study the unique issue related to knowledge growth. For example, it would be interesting to examine how employees in an organization seek to capitalize on new ideas and insights for specific purposes. Whereas research in knowledge management continues, very few have been found to study the significance and importance of knowledge growth in organizations. One study in this regard clearly evaluates eight stages of growth of knowledge in organizations (Bohn, 1994; Tiwana, 2002). Bohn (1994) described his eight-stage model (knowledge growth model) as a framework that highlights “… how knowledge increases through organizational learning, and/or the use of technology.....” The literature suggests that knowledge growth is associated with evolutionary theories which involve continuous learning by organizations (Barron, 2003). In this context, growth means change or development that is governed by three distinct mechanisms: variation, selection, and retention. The variation mechanism suggests that there is a certain process by which ideas are introduced within an organization. These variations include new technologies, new products or services, or the adoption of best practices. Selection entails a process that distinguishes useful ideas from the useless ones to reduce the risk of failure. The retention mechanism dictates the way in which ideas are spread and disseminated across the entire organization (Barron, 2003). In this regards, Miller (1983) described the notion of knowledge growth that is related to innovation. In entrepreneurial settings, knowledge plays a very essential role and that knowledge grows through some sort of innovation. He added that before innovation can occur, four factors play an important part: an environment that must yield changes, information (or idea) generation, the ability to innovate, and appropriate methods for management’s decision to innovative projects. Lindelöf and Löfsten (2006) argued that generally, the literature on entrepreneurship—a field related to constant knowledge growth and innovation—was very much tied to technological development and innovation. They explained new technology-based firms (NTBFs) operate in a dynamic working environment of competition. Such an environment is usually characterized by three predominant components: innovativeness, risk taking, and pro-activeness. The three components relate to the behavior of companies and are deduced from the individual and collective activities of their employees. These activities dominate the variation phase—as a first step in the process of knowledge growth.",16

The last decades have shown an increasing interest by researchers in firms that exhibit early and rapid international development. This phenomenon has become an object of research, most often referred to as born global (Rennie 1993; Knight and Cavusgil 1996), but also as international new ventures (Oviatt and McDougall 1994), global start-up, or early internationalizing firms (Rialp et al. 2005). This type of firm and the ability of its entrepreneur(s) to create and develop an international firm are definitely an increasingly important research topic (Cesinger et al. 2012). It is obvious that the dynamics of these firms are different from those of traditional exporters (Madsen 2013). Such questions are of great theoretical and practical importance. Today, the content of “born global” strategies remains poorly described, causing both terminological and theoretical confusions. The importance of research into the issue is also emphasized the increasing number of start-up companies, particularly in high-technology sectors, which attempt to implement early and rapid internationalization strategies (Kuemmerle 2002). These firms are in urgent need of vocabulary and frameworks that they can draw on when drafting strategies for early and rapid internationalization. In a review study, Rialp et al. (2005) note that a greater and more robust empirical base should be established in order to confirm or reject previous findings. Therefore, this paper is intended to contribute to filling this gap by focusing on firms that rapidly expand on international markets. The objective of this study is to identify the determinants of early and rapid internationalization applied by born globals from Tunisia through drawing their collective cognitive map. Understanding the mechanisms that lead to internationalization of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) as well as those governing its development is a key factor in the extent SMEs participate actively in globalization, and this has a positive impact on their performance. Our paper extends the international entrepreneurship literature by proposing a new approach to building an average cognitive map for the explanation of the determinants of early and rapidly internationalizing firms.

From an evolutionary perspective of the industrial system, recombination of knowledge is a central process in innovation and in the evolution of technologies (Schumpeter 1934; Nelson and Winter 1982), which depend on a complex interplay between economic actors, artefacts and ideas (Arthur 2009; Antonelli et al. 2010). As it is used in this article, recombination refers either to the combination of elements which were previously unconnected or finding new ways of combining elements which were already associated (Nahapiet and Ghoshal 1997). Recombination rests on the ability to maintain variety (Weitzman 1998). In particular, recombinative capabilities are related with the internal capabilities of the firm to organise knowledge, measuring the extent to which firms can creatively combine different domains of knowledge in the innovation process. As far as external capabilities of the firm are concerned, local and distant knowledge search mechanisms are important aspects of accessing different knowledge domains (Stuart and Podolny 1996) which happen mainly through collaboration with other actors. Although these collaborative relations have been studied from a variety of perspectives in innovation studies, one of the questions which received relatively less attention is how recombinative capabilities of firms and the nature of their alliance portfolios shape innovative competences jointly. Distant search is usually associated with exploratory activities, which are risky, yet they can bring very high returns. For sure, these returns depend on the firm’s existing capabilities of recombination and how it can integrate new domains into its existing competences. Do high recombinative capabilities complement or substitute distant knowledge domains? How can firms design effective knowledge search strategies, depending on their recombinative capabilities? The effect of recombinative capabilities in innovation activities is extremely important in highly innovative sectors where there are rapid technological changes characterised by different knowledge base. To explore these issues empirically, we focus on the Information Communication Technologies (ICT) sector. Firstly, ICT sector is characterised by rapid technological and structural change. In addition, the complexity of the technological base implies the critical role of complementarities between firms and the importance of technological diversity to ensure competitive advantage (Rao et al. 2004). In order to estimate how recombination and alliance portfolios influence innovative competences, we analyse panel data of patents granted to 71 ICT firms between the years 1995 and 2003. We collect data from different sources including the European Patent Office (EPO), the DTI Department for Business Innovation and Skills (BIS) research and development (R&D) and the Cooperative Agreements and Technology Indicators (CATI) databases. In this way, we construct an original database of worldwide ICT firms which have highest levels of R&D spending. The sample includes firms such as Ericsson, Oracle and IBM. The article is organised as follows. “Theoretical Background” section presents the background literature and the hypothesis. It relies on the Schumpeterian notion of innovation to explain the role of recombination in the innovation process. Additionally, we explore the literature on the strategic alliances and learning in order to present the article’s hypotheses on the ways in which external alliance strategies of firms interact with their internal recombinative capabilities. “Method and Data” section explains the data and measures used in the empirical investigation. The empirical results are discussed in “Results” section. Some concluding remarks follow.",19

Kwakkel,Gönenç Yücel,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The concept of “transition”, which can briefly be defined as long-term structural change processes spreading over several aspects of a societal system, such as, culture, technology, institutions, and environment, has been attracting significant attention during the last couple of decades (Geels 2002; Geels 2005; Kemp et al. 1998; Loorbach 2007; Rotmans et al. 2001; Timmermans et al. 2008; Grin et al. 2010). This may be attributed to the growing need for shifting to more sustainable modes of functioning in various important socio-technical systems, e.g., energy, transport, water, etc. Electricity generation and distribution systems have been the primary examples of large-scale socio-technical systems with interwoven social and techno-physical components (Hughes 1983), and understanding the complex dynamics of change of these systems is of primary importance due to their sheer importance for economy and also due to their impact on environment. As a national example of such systems, the Dutch electricity systems have been going through a significant institutional transformation since 1998 (van Damme 2005). This transformation will influence the way the infrastructure will evolve over time (de Vries 2004). It is an open question exactly how the infrastructure will evolve over time because of the long delays typical to large-scale socio-technical systems. However, a survey of the current generator park reveals that roughly 20 % of the park is expected to be decommissioned in the coming decade. Thus, there is a window of opportunity to significantly alter the generation portfolio. There are various forces that affect the decision making by generator companies with respect to their investment decisions. Among others, technological developments in generator technology, fluctuations in fuel prices, environmental policies by governments, and potential shifts in end-user preferences play an important role. The co-existence of aforementioned developments makes the current era a climate in which a transition may emerge. However, whether the system will shift to a newly emerging trajectory or not, is not apparent. The development trajectory will be shaped by the internal dynamics of the system under the influence of the aforementioned contextual developments. This dynamic puzzle constitutes the main motivation behind this study, which aims to develop insights about plausible development paths for the Dutch electricity system. In order to develop insight into plausible development paths for the Dutch electricity system, one approach would be to try and reduce the uncertainty about the various forces that affect the investment decisions. This is implicitly what is done through various forecasting and foresight techniques such as forecasting, trend extrapolation, Delphi studies, and scenario approaches (Goodwin and Wright 2010). In this paper, we follow the opposite approach: we explicate the major uncertainties and assess their influence on the development path. This approach is known as exploratory modeling and analysis (EMA) (Bankes 1993; Agusdinata 2008). An agent-based model of the Dutch energy system is presented and its behavior across 13 different uncertainties is explored. In this way, interaction affects between these uncertainties are explicitly accounted for. Moreover, the emphasis is on the real issue of interest, the emerging pathway, and not on factors that could affect this issue. The structure of this paper is as follows: “Exploratory Modeling and Analysis” section provides more background on EMA. “Application” section contains the application of EMA to studying possible future transitions pathways in the Dutch energy market. The last section contains the “Concluding Remarks”.",10

Cunningham,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Liberalization in networked infrastructures is ongoing throughout the world as well as in Europe. Towards the end of 1980s, liberalization has become a major topic for the European Commission. Since then, Europe has been embracing the change. Various networked infrastructures, which are traditionally state monopolies, have been considered for liberalization for the last two decades. These comprise telecommunications, air transport, postal services, electricity, gas, water, rail, and transport sectors. Unlike many other industries, liberalization in networked industries does not conform to a classical framework of economics due to its complex technical and social characteristics. Each of the networked infrastructures needs to be treated in light of their particular technical critical functionalities as well as associated social and political concerns. The electricity system is no different in this regard. The system is widely applied, affecting three quarters of all humans on Earth (Gronewold et al. 2009). The fundamental importance of the network presents a set of very complex challenges. Being the main source of modern life, electricity has to be safeguarded even in expense of economic considerations with regard to the efficiency of electricity. The cost of even momentary blackout is considered to be exceedingly high as compared to the gains to be achieved from efficiency considerations. One particular challenge is keeping an inventory of electricity, a problem which durable goods producers and suppliers do not face (Künneke & Finger 2007). By nature, the storage of electricity is limited and yet still has to be made available on demand. This means that the electricity market must be cleared at all times. Furthermore, demand and supply can be highly volatile. For instance, during large social events, there can be greater than usual demand, which in turn may greatly disturb the daily supply routine considerably. This results in system management challenges for the transmission system operators (TSO) (Künneke & Finger 2007; Oruc et al. 2010; Sugianto & Lu 2002). When a mismatch exists between supply and demand, the generators are speeded up or down by frequency control (Kundur et al. 1994). Although this technique can make up for the gap between supply and demand to some extent, usually additional generation capacity is required since the frequency has to be kept in some frequency range according to the electricity line specifications. As for electricity capacity storage, electricity systems benefit from technologies such as pumped-storage hydroelectricity generation, which can provide storage functionality by consuming power during nonpeak hours and providing it back to the grip during peak hours (Deb 2000). However, their usage is limited by expensive investments as well as by environmental and political costs. Moreover the active control of the flow of electricity is difficult because of the physics of electricity. According to Kirchhoff laws, the electricity flows through the transmission lines based upon least resistance on the lines, making it possible to flow in parallel through the lines. This phenomenon is widely referred as loop flows in the electric power transmission literature (Bialek 1998; Cardell et al. 1997; Chao & Peck 1996; Chao et al. 2000; Hogan 1992). Since the flow cannot be directed deliberately, the system operates in a state of equilibrium. A sudden disruption on this equilibrium, such as a cut on a transmission line, can jeopardize the whole system. For an account of the critical technical functionalities in electricity system to be safeguarded at all cost, one may refer to (Finger et al. 2005) and (Hirst et al. 1997). The purpose of this paper is threefold. Firstly, the paper describes the principal strategic management issues in the electrical transmission grid. Next, the principal policy options are highlighted in conjunction with the described strategic management issues. Lastly, reflections on European progress on mitigating the strategic management issues are given. Transmission rights are either physical or financial; we discuss the distinction between these two in “Transmission Rights” section. The current status of liberalization in Europe is discussed in “Current Situation in Europe” section. Conclusions and reflections are presented in the last section. We begin with the major strategic management issues.",

Bers,John P. Dismukes,Christopher Rowe,Male,Male,Male,Male,"From the dawn of humankind, we have tried to tame the forces of nature through our ingenuity, innovation, and the development and continued refinement of processes. One of the processes we have tamed—with spectacular effect—is the management of technological innovation, particularly the gradual improvement of technology as it is put into practice. It has been estimated that over 80 % of the improvement in a technology occurs during the extended period of incremental innovation that follows upon the emergence of a dominant design. But what about that other 20 %—the initial technological breakthrough innovations that set the long path of incremental innovation in motion in the first place? Those initial breakthroughs—the radical innovations that disrupt existing business models and strategies and render incumbent technologies and established industries obsolete—perplex and repel the successful businesses and investors that should be best positioned to exploit them. Radical innovation is one of the last bears still wandering around out there that we have yet to tame. In 2003, while attending the PICMET international conference, I happened to meet an extraordinary gentleman, Dr. John Dismukes, who challenged me to join him in pursuing a mutual passion, building a methodology that would guide the management of the radical innovation process—what we now call the Accelerated Radical Innovation or ARI model—in the way that the well-known Stage-Gate model supports new product development. We have spent the last 8 years building this model and have reported our results at the last four PICMET conferences and in a number of journals. In this article, we will be reporting the results of our latest effort—to develop an explicit extension of the Stage-Gate model into the ARI model. Our hope is that those organizations that have been using Stage-Gate for new product development can now extend that process to the greater challenge of radical innovation. I am honored to be joined by John and our two other coauthors, my Vanderbilt colleague Prof. Chris Rowe and Ms. Diana Mehserle, a brilliant undergraduate student who spent countless hours collaborating on the research to be reported here. - John Bers",8

It was next analyzed in a societal dynamics framework in [4]. What we will do here is extend the analysis to focus upon “control issues” about the event. To prevent such societal events from recurring, we need to know how to improve societal control over such basic and important socio-technical systems. An article in The New York Times then summarized the crisis: “The first shoe (of the global financial implosion) to drop was the collapse in July 2007 of two hedge funds, owned by Bear Stearns, that had invested heavily in the subprime market” (NY Times, Nov 2008) [1]. Banks, such as Bear Stearns had been making up bonds to be sold as a Collateralized Debt Object (CDO). These CDOs contained some good, low-risk “prime” mortgages but often also as much as 60 % bad and risky “sub-prime” mortgages. The bank's funds had deliberately mixed prime with sub-prime mortgages in their bonds to increase the size and number of bonds. This resulted in the CDOs being contaminated with high risk. The buyers of the bonds did know this, instead they had been told the CDO derivatives were low risk, based upon AAA bonds. The fund managers said that the mixture of sub-primes “spread the risk”, but this was misleading as they really only increased risk—so much so that Bear Sterns would collapse when the CDO market collapsed. It would take 8 months, from July 2007 to March 2008, for the “financial dominoes” to begin falling: “Bear Sterns kept reporting larger and larger losses on mortgage bonds. Bear Sterns was on the verge of bankruptcy, because it did not have sufficient reserve funds to satisfy Federal regulations to continue being chartered as a bank. Then in March 2008, the Fed staved off a Bear Stearns bankruptcy by assuming $30 billion of Bear Sterns' liabilities and arranging its sale to JPMorgan Chase. The price of that sale was at $10 dollars a share, when only months earlier shares had been in the $100 dollar range; so that Chase acquired Bear Stearns ‘for a price that was less than the worth of Bear's Manhattan skyscraper’” (NY Times, Dec 2008). This was only the first bank that would fail to meet its banking-reserve requirements. Several more were to follow in the U.S.A. and around the world. Next, the two giant semi-public mortgage companies in the U.S.A., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, failed. “In August, government officials began to become concerned as the stock prices of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, government-sponsored entities that were linchpins of the housing market, slid sharply” (NY Times, Dec 2008). Earlier, the Federal government had guaranteed their bonds, but then the government nationalized both companies: “On Sept. 7, the Treasury Department announced it was taking over (nationalizing) Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac” (NY Times, Dec 2008). In the same month, a second major investment bank fell: “On Sept. 12, top government and finance officials gathered for talks to fend off bankruptcy for Lehman Brothers. The talks broke down, and the government refused to step in and salvage Lehman as it had for Bear Sterns. Lehman's failure sent shock waves through the global banking system. . . . ” (NY Times, Dec 2008). Lehman Brothers could not meet bank-reserve requirements, having borrowed too much to buy mortgages, which they assembled into Collateralized Debt Objects—a CDO was a financial derivative, consisting only of interest payment without any collateral. Then that mortgage bond behind a CDO was not saleable, as then the bond no longer paid interest. Also a stock brokerage firm, Merrill Lynch, had also been buying large numbers of sub-prime mortgages to make up mortgage bonds for CDOs; Merrill Lynch was forced to sell itself to the Bank of America. “On Sept. 16, American International Group (AIG), an insurance giant on the verge of failure because of its exposure to exotic securities known as credit default swaps (CDS as insurance on a CDO derivative), was bailed out by the Fed in an $85 billion deal” (NY Times, Dec 2008). AIG had been issuing insurance on all those CDOs, all of which AIG could not pay if the CDOs failed. Then all the stock exchanges in the world imploded, such as: “. . . Stocks plunged, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index losing nearly 9 percent, its worst day since Oct. 19, 1987” (NY Times, Dec 2008). Governments began to intervene in the collapsing economies: “The U.S. Treasury Secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., publicly announced a three-page, $700 billion proposal that would allow the government to buy toxic assets from the nation's biggest banks, a move aimed at shoring up their balance-sheets and restoring confidence within the financial system. . . .Many Americans were angered by the idea of a proposal that provided billions of dollars in taxpayer money to Wall Street banks, which many believed had caused the crisis in the first place. U.S. government intervention to save the U.S. banking industry was underway. . . (but) it was still unclear how effective the bailout plan would be in resolving the credit crisis” (NY Times, Dec 2008). The banking crisis spread around the world: “Banks in England and Europe had invested heavily in mortgage-backed securities offered by Wall Street. . . . Over the weekend that followed the (U.S.A.) bailout's passage, the German government moved to guarantee all private savings accounts in the country, and bailouts were arranged for a large German lender and a major European financial company” (NY Times, Dec 2008). But stock markets around the world continued to plunge. The central banks of many nations cut their prime interest rates to lower lending costs. Still, the credit crises had not ended. The government investments in their banks increased: “. . . after a week in which stocks declined almost 20 percent on Wall Street, European and American officials announced coordinated actions that included taking equity stakes in major banks, including $250 billion in investments in the United States” (NY Times, Dec 2008). The impact of the credit crisis spread from banks to stock markets to exchange rates and even the price of oil: “The volatility in the stock markets was matched by upheaval in currency trading as investors sought shelter in the yen and the dollar, driving down the currencies of developing countries and even the euro and the British pound. Oil-producing countries were hit by a sudden reversal of fortune, as the record oil prices reached over the summer were cut in half by October because of the world economic outlook” (NY Times, Dec 2008). A global recession was anticipated: “But as the prospect of a severe global had begun, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, said ‘there would be no quick economic turnaround even with the government’s intervention’, and the Dow plunged 733 points” (NY Times, Dec 2008). In November 2008, the U.S. government elections were held; and a new President, Barack Obama, was elected: “The credit crisis emerged as the dominant issue of the presidential campaign in the last 2 months before the (U.S. presidential) election. The weakening stock market and growing credit crisis appeared to benefit Mr. Obama, who tied Mr. McCain to what he called the failed economic policies of President Bush and a Republican culture of deregulation of the financial markets. Polls showed that Mr. Obama's election on Nov. 4 was partly the fruit of the economic crisis and the belief among many voters that he was more capable of handling the economy than Mr. McCain” (NY Times, Dec 2008).",4

Daim,Nuri Basoglu,Kenny Phan,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"New value-added services such as mobile TV, video, and other data services have changed the landscape of the mobile industry. Prior studies by Kargin et al. [32, 33] indicated that emerging mobile technologies are enabling new mobile applications, which have a huge influence on consumers' usage patterns, and they have become a significant differentiator across operators. Non-voice technology now represents a significant portion of operator service revenue, depending on the market. The future of the mobile telephone is reported to depend on mobile services as the market sees a saturation in voice. This situation is creating new opportunities in the innovation of differentiating services. As a result, mobile services have become new revenue sources for operators, and mobile services are perceived as the next opportunity to continue growth in these markets. However, adoption of these services has been slow. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the factors impacting the adoption of such services is called for [32, 33]. While product innovation has been heavily researched and defined, the same effort has not been seen for mobile services [15, 66]. Spohrer et al. [67] defined service as a kind of action, performance, or promise exchanging for value between provider and client. Bygstad and Lanestedt [9] found that current innovation studies do not have consensus if service innovation is fundamentally different from traditional product innovation. Because of information and communication technologies, more consumers are moving to knowledge-intensive service industries [12]. And this calls for attention to this industry. Prior research has started to explore service innovation or what impacts service innovation. Hanna and Daim [24, 25] explored software development as a service. Daim et al. [14] explored telemedicine service innovation. Rao and Daim [60] and Lin and Daim [45] explored different approaches to service development. Finally, Daim et al. [15] identified several research gaps in this area as a result of a symposium held with experts around the world. One of the areas identified referred to the exploration of consumer behavior in adopting different service innovations. A value-added service is a key telecommunications industry term for non-core services or all services beyond standard voice calls. On a conceptual level, value-added services add value to the standard service offering and allow the operator to expand the customer base and drive up his or her average revenue per user. Value-added services are the key to generating new revenues or to creating differentiation in the market to attract more consumers. For mobile phones, while technologies like short message service (SMS), multimedia messaging service, and general packet radio service are usually considered value-added services, a distinction may also be made between standard (peer-to-peer) content and premium-charged content. The objective of this study is therefore to explore the adoption of mobile service adoption",5

But research completely within the narrow bounds of a single discipline rarely results in valid theory, which realistically reflected the complexity of a whole society. The Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2008 was a dramatic case of this, wherein mainstream economic policy failed to anticipate the crisis, while it had been used to justify deregulation preceding the crisis. Policy failure in deregulation of the banking industry had been based upon an economic assumption that financial markets operated perfectly. Earlier, we analyzed this case in a cross-disciplinary framework—seeing how that failure of the knowledge economy went beyond simple explanation by economic ideas—also requiring ideas from other disciplines, such as sociology, management science, and management of technology (Betz 2012). The question we address here is not about the failure of a financial system but the failure of economic theory.",
5.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,01 November 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-013-0167-2,Modeling a Layered Financial Structure in a Knowledge Economy,December 2014,Frederick Betz,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Much of the problem of financial instability in the twenty-first century occurred because of the extensive, but inappropriate, use of information technologies in banking. Changes in both structures and processes of financial systems were enabled by technology; and a complete collapse of a layered and technological financial structure of the USA occurred in 2007–2008 (Betz and Khalil, 2011). However, instabilities due to technology and layering have continued, particularly seen in large trading losses by banks from 2010 to 2012. The regulatory issue is whether or not the Dodd–Frank reform act of 2009 is adequate to protect the public good in the era of casino banking. In 2009, the US Congress established an inquiry to investigate the Global Financial Crisis of 2008, and Phil Angelides was appointed Chairman of the US Congress Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission. In 2011, Angelides talked about his experience: I came into my position as chairman of the commission with what I thought was a reasonable understanding of the American financial system, and I had this quaint notion that it was a system designed to allocate capital to the economy for the purposes of creating jobs in enterprise and long-term sustained wealth for our society. I must tell you that over the course of the last year and half, I, along with my fellow commissioners, undertook a journey of revelation. As we did our investigation, we were surprised, we were shocked, we were fascinated, and often appalled at what we found. I often felt as if I had entered my local community bank, had opened a door that I wasn’t suppose to open, and when I opened it, I saw a casino floor as big as New York, New York. And, I may add, that unlike Claude Raines in Casablanca, I was truly shocked at the level of gambling that was going on in Wall Street. (Angelides, 2011) Phil Angelides had practiced in real estate investment for two decades. In addition, he served as Treasurer of the State of California, and he participated on the boards of two large pension funds. From his experience with investment and development, he had assumed that the US financial system was principally funding investments in production and development in its economic system. He had not realized how the US banking system after the 1990s had turned from this economic function toward casino banking—“truly shocked at the level of gambling that was going on in Wall Street.” From the 1980s through the 1990s, what happened in the US economic system was a vast outsourcing of manufacturing to Asia. By 1990, labor costs in manufacturing were less than 10 % of direct costs on average or less than 5 % of overall costs. Outsourcing of manufacturing from the USA to Asia was less about labor costs than about capital costs of investment in manufacturing. When manufacturing left, there were few opportunities in the USA for traditional investment in economic production. Yet, money kept flowing in the USA, particularly from oil-rich producers. Sovereign oil companies (owned by governments) controlled 70 % of the world’s oil in Russia, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Kuwait, Iran, Libya, Nigeria, Venezuela, etc. In the economies of these sovereign companies, large wealth was being accumulated by individuals, needing places for investment. Ben S. Bernanke wrote: Large and growing amounts of foreign funds flowed into the USA. This created a demand for various types of financial assets … Foreign investors had these funds to lend, either because they had a very high personal savings rate or because of high oil prices … A “flood” of funds reached the USA financial markets. (Bernanke, 2007) Meanwhile in the 1980s, the US financial system turned away from investment in production and toward trading, particularly trading ownership of corporations. This trading occurred as “leveraged buy-outs,” leveraged, and financed by junk-bonds. Michael Millikan helped develop this casino market through Drexel (Buck, 1988). From 1981 to 1985, one quarter of US corporations changed ownership, with “junk-bond” financing. Corporations were taken private and loaded with new debt from the leveraged buy-outs. They could not invest in new products and improved manufacturing because they had to focus on paying off the enormous debt to buy them out—transferred from the hedge funds to the corporations’ books. This accelerated the outsourcing of US manufacturing to Asia. This 1980s financial movement created the new trading firms, which evolved into hedge funds by the 1990s. Then in 1999, trading was integrated into commercial banking. Investment and commercial banks were allowed to merge in the repeal of the Glass–Steagle separation in the USA. This had created the US banks too big to fail, which Angelides observed in 2008. Angelides focused on the conclusions of the Commission: But I want to talk now, briefly about our six major conclusions. The first of those conclusions, central to all our conclusions and one that runs counter to the narrative that is spun by many on Wall Street and in Washington, was that this crisis was avoidable. It was not an act of Mother Nature; it was not a matter of computer models going haywire. It was a result of deliberate policy decisions, human action, inaction, and misjudgment … what happened at the Federal Reserve is, starting in the 1990s, there is growing evidence about widespread unfair lending practices, predatory lending practices, fraudulent lending practices. (Angelides, 2011) Federal regulators had not curbed risk and fraud because they acted under a policy of “deregulation”: Secondly, we found widespread failures in financial regulation, there was a new ideology, driven by Greenspan and others, that we had now entered an era of “great moderation,” that human behavior had been fundamentally tamed by mathematical models, and that the markets had become wonderfully efficient in such a way that the major financial institutions were capable of self policing themselves. The light hand of regulation was all that was needed; and, in fact, what came to be the governing ethos of our policymakers was that somehow the self-preservation instincts of private institutions would cumulatively add up to a protection of the self, of the public interest … How wrong that ideology was. (Angelides, 2011) Angelides found a “slowness to regulate” and “ideologically slanted-economic-theory-for-deregulation.” However, the commission found there had been reasons to regulate: Thirdly, our report describes dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance fueled by compensation systems that rewarded the quick deal, the big transaction, the big bet, without any consequence for the long term. So if you look at our report, you’ll be astounded at what you see—both what CEOs knew and, even more disturbingly, what they claimed not to know. You’ll see how at AIG they wrote $79 billion of credit protection on subprime securities, contracts that require that they post collateral if there’s a market decline in the value of securities. But neither the CEO, the CFO, the Chief Risk Officer, nor any other senior official of that company had any awareness that they had to place collateral up if market values declined. So when Goldman Sachs came knocking in July 2007 with the first $1.8 billion collateral call, they were stunned. By September 2008, the collateral calls from the various counterparties had grown to $30 billion, AIG was in full collapse, and the taxpayers of the United States had to come forward with $180 billion. (Angelides, 2011) The “quick-deal-without-regard-for-long-term” is what Hyman Minisky had called Ponzi finance, and depends upon excessive leverage. Fourth, … we witnessed excessive borrowing, risky investments that, coupled with a lack of transparency in the end put our financial system on a collision course with catastrophe. By 2008, the shadow banking system, the lightly regulated if regulated at all nonbank financial system, had grown to $13 trillion in assets—bigger than the regulated financial system, commercial bank, and thrift system, with $11 trillion in assets … We saw an explosion in derivatives following the conscious decision to deregulate that market and create an enormous dark market. But we also saw enormous risk at individual firms, leverage ratios of 40-to-1, and, often, true leverage ratios that were hidden. At all the major investment banks, the leverage ratios were 40-to-1 or so … A good example of this is Bear Stearns itself. Bear Stearns, $11 billion in equity at the end of 2007, $390 billion in liabilities, and borrowing $70 billion each and every night in the overnight markets, each and every day, like a small business that has $50,000 in equity borrowing $1.6 million and having to renew a loan of $300,000 each day. All it takes is a market devaluation of assets of 2 to 3 percent or any kind of liquidity disruption for the system to unravel. And it did. (Angelides, 2011) Earlier, Hyman Minsky had described how excessive leverage created financial bubbles. Where was leadership who understood this? Not to be found, according to Angelides: Fifth, and perhaps most disturbingly, we found that the key policymakers, the people we depended on to protect the public and our economy—the Department of Treasury led by Hank Paulson, the New York Federal Reserve led by Mr. Geithner, and the Federal Reserve led by Mr. Bernanke—that when this crisis hits in 2007, they were wholly unprepared for the crisis, because they no longer understand the financial system they are overseeing. They don’t have a window on the $2.8 trillion repo-market; they have no sense of it because there’s no information on the $600 trillion derivatives markets. As I said, the shadow banking system had outraced and outrun our regulators, so when the crisis hit, there was no plan for containment because there was and is very little understanding of the inner connections that now define our current system. (Angelides, 2011) This was the puzzle. It was not that bubbles were new or misunderstood. In 1933, Irving Fisher had described financial bubbles as a form of debt deflation. (Fisher, 1933) In 1975, Hyman Minsky described financial instability as arising from layering in the financial structure (Minsky, 1975). Why had not the Federal regulators read Fisher and Minsky, and also the economic history on financial panics (Kindleberger, 1978)? So—failure of action, failure of theory, failure of sensible business practices, and failure of leadership—what more? And finally, in our report we document widespread and systemic breaches and breakdowns in ethics and accountability at all levels … One study that we reviewed in our report indicated that between 2005 and 2007 there was $1 trillion worth of mortgage loans made with proven fraud that resulted in $112 billion in loses. But all of this happened in a non-regulated, crime-facilitative environment. And finally, we catalogue striking new evidence of financial firms that bought and packaged securities, sold them to investors around the world, and knew the defective nature of those mortgage loans and never revealed them. In our report, we attribute responsibility … Minsky was right: systemic forces were at work. (Angelides, 2011) Angelides had read Minsky: I want to start by saying what an honor it is to be here today at this esteemed conference that makes such a contribution to our understanding of our financial system, and, of course, a conference that honors the great work and contributions of Hyman Minsky, who taught us so much, and presciently so, about the systems, the stages, and the cycles of financial booms and busts; a man whose work turned out to be extraordinarily foresighted in terms of what this country has endured over the past several years.

Kassicieh,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The quantity and quality of university entrepreneurial spinouts have been linked to attitudes as well as to macroeconomic factors of the region where the university is located and to microeconomic dynamics of the inventors. On the attitude dimension, Robinson et al. (1991) established the entrepreneurial attitude orientation to distinguish between entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs. For the economic situational factors, Kassicieh et al. (1996) used attitudes as defined by Robinson et al. but added a set of situational variables that describe the environment in which the individual operates to discern their entrepreneurial likelihood. Perkmann et al. (2013) highlighted the research streams that explore the engagement between industry and academia and concluded that engagement is more aligned with traditional research than commercialization. Although both contribute to economic activity based on research results, the spin-off activities contribute directly as opposed to the indirect contribution of academic engagement. Shane and Venkataraman (2000) point out that decisions to engage in entrepreneurial activities are driven by profitable opportunities and that individuals have to examine their alternatives to seek the one that is most beneficial. That is why many university researchers and patent holders around the world decide as a result of this evaluation of opportunities to stay in academia but the question stills remains: can local policy makers in regions and universities contribute to these opportunities by making it comparatively beneficial for inventors to engage in entrepreneurship? Technological innovation is viewed as a driving force behind national economic growth, the globalization of markets, firm competitiveness, and a nation’s standard of living through its effect on increasing productivity and establishing new products, services, and markets (Kuznets 1973; Teece 1998). Academic entrepreneurship is an important conduit for technological innovation to raise social and economic welfare. There have been multiple studies that have examined the issues in the area, but to a major extent, the studies have focused mostly on the USA and parts of Europe (Rothaermel et al. 2007; Zahra 2007; Martinez et al. 2011; Wiklund et al. 2011; Johns 2006 and Welter 2011). The use of entrepreneurial spin-offs from public research organizations (PROs) merits serious consideration as a preferred mode of technology transfer (Patzelt and Shepherd 2009). Indeed, the spin-off activity is likely to do more than commercialize a specific publicly sponsored invention; it may create a technical entrepreneur who then commercializes additional public or private technology, or serve as model for other academics to adapt their role identity (Ambos, et al. 2008; Jain, et al. 2009) and create a culture with role models that is more favorably disposed to seeking commercial outcomes from research. According to Ronstadt (2007), in fact, an entrepreneur is likely to initiate multiple ventures over their career. Shane and Khurana (2003) argue for the need to examine individual entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs in the same setting to be able to discern differences in decisions to engage in entrepreneurial activity or stay with current employment. In this paper, we examine university professors who hold patents and thus have the potential for profitable activities based on knowledge and these patents to determine what prompts some of them to exploit these opportunities and for some to forgo the founding of new firms. Unger et al. (2011) examine the relationship between human capital and entrepreneurial success. They find that skills and knowledge lead to more success. University researchers, by definition, have higher skills in very specific scientific discovery areas that could be used for success in high-technology ventures. The importance of this topic underlies many initiatives in many regions where high-technology start-ups are essential for economic vitality. So, are there attitudes and/or economic situations that encourage more high-technology startups in a region? Can university officials and regional economic development directors enhance the founding of new firms by their inventors? And what are the basic drivers of such activity? The literature suggests that several factors affect the entrepreneurial endeavor. Di Gregorio and Shane (2003) offer four factors that influence university performance in technology start-ups. These are external such as availability of venture capital and internal such as university policies that affect the formation of new firms. They, however, do not go into the specifics of these university policies. Markman et al. (2005) indicate that the involvement of faculty in the new firm formation is critical for the success of the new venture. In this article, we study the behavior and thinking of professors who produce patents that could be used to solve some of the world’s problems while at the same time help universities and local economies with entrepreneurial spinouts (Rothaermel et al. 2007; Van de Ven 2007 and Strom 2011). If we are able to identify situations or attitudes associated with entrepreneurial actions as well as moderation effect of some of these variables, we should be able to improve the efficacy of programs developed by the research institutions designed to commercialize technological innovations (Di Gregorio and Shane 2003; Lerner 2004) as well as provide policy recommendations that amplify the benefits of new small high-technology firms that add to the wealth and jobs in a region. In particular, we report on a survey of researchers who are listed as inventors on at least one patent, to test theory-based hypotheses of what determines the likelihood that they will join a spin-off company to commercialize their inventions. We call them entrepreneur inventors. Kassicieh et al. (1996) used situational variables, attitudes, and personal characteristics to answer this question, though they focused only on spinout activity focused on US federally owned research laboratories rather than universities. Since then, several researchers have studied academic entrepreneurship, in the context of technology commercialization, with the individual as unit of analysis in the context of patenting activity (Kor and Sundaramurthy 2009), invention disclosures (Bercovitz and Feldman 2008), embeddedness in internal or external networks (Nicolaou and Birley 2003), or willingness to collaborate with private firms (Krabel, et al. 2010). This study’s contribution to theory is twofold. First, we apply the multilevel thinking to the individual as a unit of analysis, using a primary database (Hoye and Pries 2009). Second, we begin to determine the attitudinal and situational parameters that are more likely to produce entrepreneurial activities in inventors. A practical benefit (Van de Ven 2007) is an analysis of the areas that could be used by policy makers to increase the incidence of entrepreneurship in their regions or institutions. The significant resources being deployed to promote spinout technology commercialization could be focused upon groups of individuals who have the characteristics that imply a relatively higher probability of becoming entrepreneurs as was proposed by Sarasvathy (2004).",1

Daim,Dilek Ozdemir,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"The world economy experiences an economic crisis with an almost periodic regularity. Each time, an innovation overcomes the crisis. While we have come to rely on innovation as a phenomenon that can rise above such economic difficulties, products and processes are also becoming more complex as technology improves and innovation can no longer be constrained within organizational boundaries. Currently, any organization that desires to be innovative has to collaborate with other organizations (Autio et al. 1996; Buono 1997; Cagliano et al. 2000; Carayannis and Alexander 1999; Chakrabati and Weisenfeld 1991; Fichman 1999; Frenken et al. 2005; Santoro and Gopalakrishnan 2000; Stock and Tatikonda 2004). Several sources of external technologies exist (Daim and Kocaoglu 2008a, b), and universities are reported to be one of the most important. Universities can be a source for workforce, knowledge, and sometimes innovation itself. Therefore, universities impact innovation both directly and indirectly (Anselin 1997; Gibson and Smilor 1991; Kim et al. 2008; Nagata 2007; Rebentisch and Ferretti 1995; Siegel et al. 2004; Van den Berghe and Guild 2007). On the other hand, an economic crisis can impact innovative activities in different ways. In some cases, it prompts organizations to be more innovative leading them to increase innovation activities and the subsequent budgets. But it can also cause a decrease in innovation investments (Chipman 2009). Economic crises, R&D collaborations, and universities’ missions concerning innovation activities are thoroughly discussed in the literature. Yet the literature is lacking studies that examine the effects of economic crises on US universities’ R&D funding. With this objective, we propose models to explore the impacts of economic crises on such funding decisions.",5

Halal,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The strategic impact of technology is seen in the rushing change of everyday products. When digital photography became feasible a few years ago, the entire film industry was overturned by simply moving around digital bits instead. Nikon, Kodak, and other famous names that once dominated photography are still struggling to adjust, laying off thousands of employees and replacing product lines. In place of film, new industries soon sprung up as digital cameras unleashed floods of photos and videos to populate Web 2.0—Facebook, YouTube, blogs, wikis, and more sure to come. This cycle then repeated as smart phones, in turn, replaced digital cameras. Sales of stand-alone cameras started to decline with the landmark introduction of Apple’s iPhone with built-in digital cameras and video recorders. The Flip camcorder, for instance, was widely popular because it was simple and easy to use. But the market dried up after a flood of smart phones with good digital cameras and video appeared in 2008, and the Flip was soon sold to a gentle death [1]. Kodak invented the digital camera years ago, but had to abandon the market to smart phones [2]. The same disruptive force of technological change is at work as alternative energy replaces oil, genetic medicine extends lives, artificial intelligence automates jobs, robots serve as helpers, and other innovations reach the take-off point. These examples highlight the threats managers face if they fail to adapt to strategic technological change, as well as the opportunities available at the leading edge. And shorter technology life cycles require that they act quickly or lose product lines. The only safe haven is to remain at the forefront of change. The accelerating power of ever more sophisticated information systems is the central force driving this “Technology Revolution” that is destroying old markets and creating new ones. The decoding of the human genome, for instance, was only possible using supercomputers to decipher the three gigabits of information in DNA. For the first time in history, knowledge—the very heart of science—is being harnessed systematically on a massive scale [3]. Think of it as a “virtuous cycle” of continually increasing scientific knowledge driven by the accelerating development of Information Technology (IT). Figure 1 illustrates how IT improves our ability to acquire knowledge → which then encourages more widespread commercial innovation → which in turn improves IT systems again → on and on in a spiral of transformation. The virtuous cycle of knowledge. Copyright W. Halal 2003 This is not simply a rush of technological advances, but a breakthrough in the way science, product development, and entrepreneurship are conducted. The system of scientific research and commercial innovation is growing in power and speed as the novel ability to amass knowledge drives progress as never before. Some scientists, like Ray Kurzweil, think we are approaching a “singularity” in which the pace of technological change leaps dramatically during the next 20–30 years [4]. A telling indicator is the popular success of the Singularity University sponsored by Ray Kurzweil, Peter Diamandis, Google, and NASA to prepare business leaders for the Technological Revolution. Several classes have completed studies at Ames Research Park in Silicon Valley, and they are developing strategic projects that leverage the power of these accelerating advances [5]. The power of technology can be seen in the fact that the dot-com collapse of 2000 did not faze the Internet, which went on shortly to develop a wave of booming Web 2.0 sites. Technological progress is insulated from economic cycles because R&D projects often have long-term support from governments, foundations, and universities. Entrepreneurs may delay product launches during recessions, but they also tend to discount downturns in favor of long-term prospects fueled by pent-up demand. In the depths of the Great Recession of 2008, we saw the exploding success of Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Groupon, Netflix, cloud, and mobile everything. Andy Grove, Chairman of Intel, put it best: “Technology always wins in the end.” The challenge of planning for this wave of disruption is not limited to technology companies. All organizations are affected as the forces of creative destruction erode core business sectors and open up new sources of value creation. The Internet continues to transform government, the newspaper industry, book publishing, entertainment, banking, education, health care, and other sectors. As consumption patterns, lifestyles, and even the rules of competition shift, all managers face this common challenge of redefining their goals, cultivating new markets, launching new products and services, and changing how their organizations work. Technology has usually been considered one of many factors in corporate strategy. The unusual magnitude of these far-reaching changes suggests that decision-makers should elevate technology to the top levels of strategy, a major force to be reckoned with in their strategic planning. This article draws on a state-of-the-art forecasting system to outline strategic advances that are likely to enter mainstream use soon. To navigate this sea of change, we examine three exemplars that have thrived by surfing the leading edge of the technology tsunami—Netflix, Apple, and Toyota. Then we integrate lessons from these cases into guidelines for technological change.",3

This process allowed increasing the economic interactions among nations reflected in a growing of world trade, financial capital, labor, and investments, among others. Actually, each nation competes within itself and with other nations in order to absorb new technologies and processes that increase the value added and competitiveness. This process should also be present in the regional scope where the absorptive capacity to access technological innovations and attract new investments is crucial to reinforce the accumulation factors and thus to affect the economic growth. Countries as regions use their absorptive capacity through several factors such as patents, foreign investments, knowledge capital, and investment in research activities, among others. In particular, Mexico has increasingly been more integrated to the world economy from 1994—with the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement—and the transfer of technology has grown considerably as consequence of the great increase in the number of patents and the foreign direct investment. One way to take advantage of the trade liberalization is reflected in the capacity of patenting of the economies. But, what are the factors contributing to improve the capacity of patenting of any economy? In reality, some economies achieve more number of patents than other and as a consequence, they also experience greater rates of growth of per capita income than others. Those economies more ready to face the world competence regularly tend to register more number of patents, while the economies less prepared have a minor number of patents. While patents are considered as an important piece for the innovation and growth process of the economies, the purpose of this work is to study some factors determining patent production across Mexican states. What is the relative importance of the factors accounting for the number of patents? Answering this question can be considered as crucial to attend such problems as the lack of innovation and finally, it can help us to understand the lack of progress and/or growth. We could conduct the analysis in other different level to the state level, as the national one, for example, but we prefer to take advantage of the richness contained in panel data, moreover, in this way we can shed light to questions as why some economies register more number of patents than other? Mainly, if there are marked differences for the same set of economies, which share the characteristic of being under the same macroeconomic policies. Our hypothesis assumes that such variables as education, research by public universities, and the concentration of high-tech industries are key elements for absorbing the transfer of technology from abroad, which is shown by the number of patents. However, absolute value data about patent applications are not suitable for comparative purposes due to cross-regional dimensional differences, in this sense data need to be somehow normalized. With this purpose, we implement a standardized coefficient model that allows us to capture the relative importance of these factors on patenting at federal entity level and along the 1997–2006 periods. Patents are an incentive function to innovate. Jones and Williams [24], Acs et al. [1], Wilson [38], McAleer et al. [28], and an extensive literature, considered patents as strategic instruments for innovative activity. They usually examine patents models in the context of a production function, although other different ways to introduce such relationship start to arise. For instance, McAleer et al. [28] and German-Soto and Gutiérrez [11] explore the time series properties of patent activity, while Archontakis and Varsakelis [3] use a gravity model to explore the factors that influence the flow of patents. Another recent work that uses patents as dependent variable in a regression equation is Akin [2], although the author interest is to test the venture capital and patenting hypothesis at state level for the USA. In the Mexican case, German-Soto and Gutiérrez Flores [11] found the existence of a strong link among patenting and trade liberalization using time series techniques. They found up to two structural breaks after 1994 suggesting an important increase of patent activity with the trade openness. Other studies have reported that a set of Mexican states’ economies is increasingly accumulating innovation through patents, while others remain lagged (see, for instance, [22, 29, 34], among others). German-Soto et al. [12] explore the geographical concentration hypothesis and demonstrate that patenting process experienced among federal entities is highly dependent on the geographical location of the multinationals in the most recent stage. They also highlight that education has a positive effect on patents. Our results indicate that growth of high-tech industries is the most significant domestic variable for patents, while education expenditure is assessed as the most outstanding educative variable. Foreign direct investment is estimated as negative and not significant, in line with the hypothesis that there is limited economic integration or a vertical linkage in terms of foreign investment—this result also was obtained in China regions (see Liao et al. [25]). We also find that agglomeration—concentration of high-tech industries—and spatial effects index are estimated negative and highly significant. Other results indicate that patenting function has remained constant along the period—time effects are not significant. Evidence on patenting activities on the state (regional) level from other countries supports the findings of the current work. For instance, Gonçalves and Almeida [13] analyze the determinants of regional innovative capacity, measured by patents per capita, for Brazil and they highlight a set of factors that have a distinctive role in providing local technological change. They conclude that the industrial and regional policies should be integrated to tackle Brazilian regional disparity problems. In the Italian regional case, evidence about data on patent applications and its changes in the economic structure suggest that advanced regions are sustained by the diffusion of innovation capabilities [31]. On the other hand, Fischer and Griffith [9] use patent citation data to capture the knowledge flows across 112 European regions, although their objective is to compare alternative approaches that could be used to account for spatial autocorrelation. We start reviewing the importance of patents for innovation and economic growth. Next, we describe the model and the implementation of the empirical methodology in the second section. The third section comments on the database and also describes the variables. The regression results and the analysis of economic policy implications are detailed in the fourth section. Finally, concluding remarks are exposed.",8

In developing countries, policies in favor of FDI have been introduced since the early 1980s. Among them, Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt exhibited similarities in economic structure and policies. For example, all three economies had followed export oriented, development strategy and had accumulated significant foreign reserves from trade surplus and experienced higher rates of domestic investment over the past two decades. In addition, liberalization of the domestic financial system and financial reform has been undergone in these nations recently. This offers a superb sample to be examined the role of the foreign direct investment in economic growth processes. That is, it is interesting to investigate the relationship between FDI inflows and economic growth in Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt. In the early 1980s, research on the determinants of economic growth has attracted new interest among economic researchers. Theories of endogenous growth have stimulated research that aimed to identify the main factors explaining differences in economic growth rates between economies.Footnote 1
 There is a large literature on international investments effects on economic growth. Detailed in surveys of the literature by Edwards (1998) and Baldwin (2003) suggest that there is a broad consensus that investment is good for economic growth. Such research has shown that the accumulation of foreign capital is one of the main determinants of economic growth.Footnote 2 Some empirical studies confirm positive economic growth from FDI inflows (e.g., Borensztein et al. 1998; Chakrabarti 2001; Schiff and Wang 2008), but others find negative or no impacts (e.g., Duasa 2007; Pradhan 2009). In the case of the three selected countries, studies focus on analyzing the linkage between FDI inflows and economic growth are limited (e.g., Abu-Bader and Abu-Qarn 2008; Haddad and Harrison 1993; Soltani and Ochi 2012). The majority of these researches have used a single-equation model treating the relationship between economic growth and FDI inflows (see Soltani and Ochi 2012). Then, in most cases, one has to look at separate works to find out if or not there is a significant link between FDI inflows and economic growth. The main objective of this paper is to study the nexus between FDI inflows and economic growth in three North African countries, namely, Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt during 1995–2012. To this end, we used, as an investigate technique, the simultaneous equations based on structural modeling. The model allows examining at the sometime the interrelationship between economic growth and FDI inflows. Specifically, this study employed a simultaneous system of equations to test two-way linkages between FDI and economic growth. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the literature review that focuses on the link between FDI inflows and economic growth. This section also contains an overview of selected countries experiences with FDI and economic growth. Section 3 describes the used data and the model specification. Section 4 presents the main results. Lastly, the concluding remarks are presented in Section 5.",18

Although there are several reasons for this evolution, there is a certain academic consensus which places responsibility for this change on a triple feedback interaction (Kranzberg 1985; David 1990; Mokyr 1990, 2002; Castells 1996, 2004; Vilaseca and Torrent-Sellens 2005): first of all, a process of technological revolution led by investment and the massive use of information and communication technologies (ICTs); secondly, by virtue of the dynamics of the space–time extension of the market for factors and products, or process of globalisation, which assume the capacity to situate the economic sphere on a planet-wide scale in real time; and thirdly, because of a new pattern in the process of demand from economic agents, which can be characterised through the increased importance of intangibles in both the family and corporate expenditure and investment structures. From the perspective of the interaction between technology, economy and society, we might say that ICTs—which, broadly speaking, include the converging array of items of equipment and digital applications in the areas of microelectronics, information technologies, telecommunications, optoelectronics and the recent advances made in nanotechnology and biotechnology—have become one of the main foundations of the current process of radical change in economic activity and social structure. We can characterise this process of disruptive change induced by ICTs with three basic affirmations. Firstly, ICTs are fast becoming general-purpose technologies, that is, technologies which can be used on a massive scale and applied systematically by economic and social agents (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg 1995; Jovanovic and Rousseau 2006; Albers 2006). Secondly, ICTs are becoming the building blocks of a new technical and economical paradigm, that is, they are the basis of a new and innovative substrate which radically transforms the structure of basic inputs and relative costs of production (Dosi et al. 1988; Torrent-Sellens 2004). And thirdly, ICTs are the basic infrastructure of a new process of industrial revolution, that is, they are a series of disruptive changes in technique and production, interconnected with social and cultural changes on an enormous scale (DeLong 2001; Atkeson and Kehoe 2001; Baily and Lawrence 2001, 2002; Gordon 2004). This process of disruptive change is, in fact, characterised by: (a) interconnection over a network, (b) investment, falling prices and the persistent and innovative use of ICTs and (c) the increasing presence of information, communication and knowledge streams in the area of economics, within a context dominated by the globalisation of economic relations. There has been a consensus to identify this process of transition from an industrial economy towards a knowledge-based economy (Pérez 2002; Rodrigues 2002; Foray 2004; Rooney et al. 2005; Dolsfma and Soete 2006). Thus, the knowledge-based economy becomes consolidated through a new technical property: the symbiotic relationship between ICTs and knowledge. ICTs are technologies which, as such, are knowledge and also expand and prolong the human mind in its knowledge-generation process. In other words, what we have here is a social stock of know-how which uses knowledge as an input and which contributes directly to the generation of knowledge as an output. In short, and using a wide perspective of technological processes, understood as man's dominion over nature and his social environment (McClellan and Dorn 1999), ICTs not only affect the capacity for reproduction and control of the environment but also, more than ever, as a technological apparatus, act directly on man's dominion over himself or, more correctly, over the generation of his own knowledge. Contrary to manufacturing-based technologies, which affected manual labour, the application of ICTs to the apparatus of production extends and replaces mental labour (Autor et al. 2003). So what is the most relevant conclusion we can reach from analysing this intrinsic feature of digital technologies? It seems evident that the productive application of ICTs is associated, to a great extent, with the stock and dynamics of knowledge within an economy. In this sense, if we want to conduct research into the main features of the process of transition towards a knowledge-based economy, we cannot obviate the important link between its material basis and the knowledge input and output products, which has the most weight in this explanation of economic change. And, bearing in mind the symbiotic relationship between ICTs and knowledge, this article is designed to analyse the impact of network externalities on the economic structure from a conceptual perspective and within an analytical context. To do so, and after this brief introduction, we shall follow an analytical process to discuss the most general aspects to the most specific ones. First of all, and once we have explained the general context of the knowledge-based economy, we shall cover the microeconomic foundations, i.e. provide our analysis of the particular transformations that using knowledge as an input and product subject to market transactions means. Secondly, after discussing the microeconomics of knowledge, we shall be in a position to study one of its basic components: network externalities. At this point, we shall ask what impact the network effects have on economic functions and market structure. The article will end with the main conclusions of our analysis and the references used in the text.",18

Petrosyan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The opposition to new ideas and their slighting and neglecting never were a secret for both scientists and other creative thinkers themselves and historians of science and culture. As early as in nineteenth century, the prominent Italian anthropologist Cesare Lombroso had coined the term “misoneism” (otherwise “neophobia”) that denoted the “fear of the new,” the aversion determined by the difficulty in replacing an impression by another. He considered this phenomenon a kind of inertia prevailing in the spiritual life, which is so widespread in the animal kingdom and in children that may be recognized as “a physiological feature” (Lombroso and Laschi 1890, p. 8). On adducing a number of facts from many areas of human life and activity, confirming his assertion, Lombroso comes to the conclusion that “when an innovation is too drastic the overwhelming majority of people is afraid of it because the misoneism is a law of nature” (ibid., p. 10). But, having declared that the fear of the new is innate in human being, Lombroso, unfortunately, gave it a purely superficial explanation. According to him, “the scientists of genius heatedly persecute and oppose to the new,” wasting “an enormous amount of energy to refute the discoveries by the others” because “the overcrowdedness of their brains allow” nothing in excess of the existing or because “their own ideas make them insensitive to those of the others” (ibid., p. 20). To boot, Lombroso himself attributed to human beings also “philoneism,” believing that it constitutes, along with the “misoneism,” the dual (complementary) driving force of the progress. Not to mention that if the fear of the new springs from the overcrowdedness of mind then it becomes utterly unintelligible why the ignoramus is much more afraid of something new than highly learned persons. After all, his mind is very “fresh” and “loose” and contains not so much deeply rooted ideas. Regrettably, the interest in this phenomenon remained sporadic and episodic until the middle of the past century when it began to acquire a thorough and systematical character. Among the first thinkers who featured the problem and devoted to it a special place was William Beveridge, an animal pathologist. Proceeding from that in every person there is a psychological tendency to resist new ideas he tried to look into its grounds. On one hand, he referred to an “inborn impulse” named by him “the herd instinct” that “drives man to conform within certain limits to conventional customs and to oppose any considerable deviation from prevailing behavior or ideas by other members of the herd” (Beveridge 1957, p. 109). On the other hand, it was stated that “innovations are often opposed because they are too disturbing to entrenched authority and vested interests” (ibid., p. 111). If to take into account that the discoverers have, normally, little skill in diplomacy and demonstrate, as a rule, no appropriate tact in respect of their less innovative colleagues, it will become evident that not all they must obtain recognition even when the ground on which the innovation rests is quite firm and steady. Therefore, the resistance to the new is determined, according to Beveridge, by both personal (an inner bias) and social (human relations) factors. But, anyway, it is of a particularly individual nature. Even if the general public in science gibes at a novelty or disregards it, not rarely those are met who goes against the predominant attitude. Hence, the disposition to turning down what is not similar to customary roots in individuals and depends on the degree of their preparedness to accepting something unwonted. Next, the baton had been taken by Bernard Barber. He continued, on the whole, the line traced by Beveridge but added to it his own touches. Without repudiating the role of personal factors in averting from novelties, he placed the emphasis on its “cultural and social dimensions—those shared and patterned idea systems and those patterns of social interaction that also contribute to resistance.” Moreover, his “cultural” focus carried the problem, at least partly, to the mental plain. Among the numerous determinants of the opposition to fresh insights, including religious ideas, professional standing, societies, “schools,” seniority, and so on, Barber pointed out two kinds of more subtle influences shaping the attitude to knowledge. They were “substantive concepts and theories held by scientists at any given time” as well as “the methodological conceptions guiding them in their researches” (Barber 1961, pp. 597–598). Thus, Barber drew attention to another vector in treating the phenomenon. The search of its causes was conducted by him not only among outward circumstances (scientist’s personality, human relations, etc.) but also in the knowledge itself and in its “refraction” through the prism of human mentality. However it must be admitted that Barber’s consideration of the problem did not reach a profundity. To make sure of that, it is enough to advert to his conclusion as regards the possibility of governing the resistance to innovations. Barber maintains that “the powerful norm of open-mindedness in science, the objective tests by which concepts and theories often can be validated, and the social mechanisms for ensuring competition among ideas—new and old—all this make up a social system in which objectivity is greater than it is in other social areas, resistance less.” True, he has not excluded the opposition to novelties completely; “some resistance remains.” Nevertheless, in his opinion, it is quite feasible “to understand and thus perhaps to reduce” that obstacle (ibid., pp. 601–602). Yet, the arguments advanced by Barber are far from being persuasive. They produce an impression of almightiness of so-called norms of science. It needs only to order the scientists to “open” their minds—and that will do. However, they scarcely will suppress their passions and predilections and evince the marvels of perspicacity and astuteness. As to the objective tests, they work for tasks implying a scrutiny of the idea suggested and for examination of its advantages and drawbacks. But when it is dismissed out of hand, no tools of validation can help. And, finally, the competition itself is unable to compel, from scientists, opening their eyes wide. To the contrary, it only reinforces the unwillingness to consider rival ideas. And the higher is the latter’s potential, the stronger the opposition to them. That’s why the measures Barber had been reckoning on as protecting new ideas from cavils or plots of silence should be recognized illusory. And one hardly will succeed in putting a bridle on that phenomenon in such a way.",6

Seddighi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In a pioneering work, Robert Solow (1957) identifies technical change as the key factor driving the economic growth process. Paul Romer (1990) contributes further to better understanding of this process. Within the framework of the endogenous growth theory, he uses “Knowledge” as an input of production to show that the key to explaining the growth process is knowledge accumulation and human capital and therefore ultimately education, training and R&D activities. Within this dynamic framework, knowledge has increasing returns to scale, that is incremental increases in knowledge accumulation results in greater output and growth over time. Tacit or codified knowledge is created via education and training; it is based on scientific discoveries and on the job learning, it is embedded in people, it is closely related to technology, and it is the cause of technical change and hence innovation and growth. An economy which uses knowledge as an input of production to produce knowledge-intensive products and services is popularly referred to as a “knowledge economy” (Brinkley 2006). Such an economy relies on knowledge accumulation and on human capital to achieve sustained growth (Romer 1990). There is plenty of recent empirical evidence supporting this theoretical contribution (Comin 2004). Switzerland and the Nordic countries are good examples of small knowledge-based economies, and their recent experiences in achieving sustained economic growth are good examples of growth process in knowledge-based economies (Brinkley 2006). The results of the theoretical growth models outlined briefly above are equally applicable at a micro framework at the level of firms and organisations (Grant 1996). At this level, knowledge accumulation, technological change and the resulting innovative activities play crucial roles in the growth process and are the key drivers of a sustained growth (Brnysonsson and Hitt 2003). Furthermore, the innovation activities and the growth process are continuous and dynamically implying that a firm needs to build a “learning capacity” within its organisation developing and continuously refining its core competencies to achieve sustained growth (Collis 1996; Malerba 1992). Although there are many contributions on various aspects of a firm’s innovation and growth process (see for example, the seminal work of Grossmann and Helpman 1991), there seems to be relatively little focus on directly developing a model of a firm’s growth process on the basis of the above-mentioned key drivers and their interactions. This paper aims to go some way towards closing this gap. In particular, the paper focuses on a firm’s core competence and its development over time, and on a firm’s R&D strategy, in order to model their interactions and to explain a firm’s growth process in a knowledge-based economy. To provide an empirical content to this model, the key relationship of this framework will be subject to estimation and evaluation via a pilot study, consisting of a data set from a manufacturing cluster of 128 firms operating in the North East England. The plan of the paper is as follows. “Innovation and Growth via a Firm’s Core Competence and R&D Strategy” section provides a brief review of key literature explaining some of the issues outlined briefly above. Based on this literature, “A Conceptual Model of a Firm’s Innovation and Growth in a Knowledge-Based Economy” section presents a model of firm’s innovation and growth in a knowledge-based economy. “Empirical Methodology” section explains the empirical methodology of the study and presents key estimation results. “Implications for the Conduct of Innovation Policy” section explores the implications of the model for the conduct of innovation policy, and finally, “A Summary and Conclusion” section.",14

Smart specialisation seeks the involvement of all European regions to identify their particular niche in European value chains based on their diversity, their unique assets and competitive advantages. Regional authorities are expected to develop innovation strategies that support spillover effects of key enabling technologies (KETs), or KETs-based solutions that strengthen existing and develop new European industrial value chains, thus enabling smart, sustainable and inclusive growth (European Commission 2012). The S3 platform assumes that regional clusters are ‘policy-led agglomerations’, where investment strategies and interactions between industry and university are shaped by policy incentives and government strategic initiatives. Although it is recognised that the process of smart specialisation is driven by investors, the agency issues around investment strategies remain unresolved as investors do not require co-alignment with general public innovation policies, or with university academic development strategies and funding arrangements for the public sector. The S3 platform is nested in the Triple Helix model which proposes an overall framework that prescribes effective industry–university–government interactions for the purpose of knowledge creation and diffusion of innovation in the society and the economy. An extension to the Triple Helix model is the Quadruple Helix which envisages an active role of the public and the civil societies. From our empirical investigation and the literature on regional and industrial clusters, we concluded that there is little evidence that the public as an agent can be a driving force for change. Active stakeholders are important agents for change. Their role, however, is often indirect, which makes it difficult to measure. An agency requires some form of concerted effort, coordinated behaviour and feedback learning and adaptation, and these are attributes only of organised and institutionalised stakeholders and members of the society, such as owners and shareholders. The other three helices (Academia-Business-Government) have a stronger agency presence and can be considered as driving the specialisation process in turns (Todeva 2013). The government and the public administration agencies are projected to take a leadership role in developing smart specialisation strategies for accelerated growth at regional and national level (European Commission 2012). Government policy frameworks, however, require active implementation intervention which often is not very effective; hence, envisaged policy incentives never materialise in full as stakeholder benefits. The Triple Helix model does not discriminate thoroughly between projected stakeholder engagement and the outcomes from Triple Helix interactions. In addition, the outcomes are rarely measured and attributed to specific policy frameworks. This paper attempts to contribute in this direction by demonstrating how the multistage methodology that we have developed for cluster mapping (Todeva 2006) has contributed for the collection of empirical evidence related to the impact of UK innovation policy context. In the case of UK, it has been very clear that government although creating a positive climate for investment and innovation, has rarely played active role in stirring business growth beyond the support to small firms and foreign trade missions. The UK Triple Helix and Quadruple Helix environment characterises the government mostly intervening to protect market competition. In the context of distant dyadic relationships between industry, university and government, the question remains—what are the evidences for market-led clusters, and what is their potential for growth (Carayannis and Campbell 2012). Our research aims to provide evidence for the scale and scope of concentration of industry-led R&D and university-led innovation in the context of hands-off government and open market forces. The literature on business clusters and industry agglomerations acknowledges that co-location strategies pursue capturing of location advantages by businesses (Delgado et al. 2013; Moulaert and Sekia 2003; Hertog and Bergman 2001). The smart specialisation concept suggests that existing industrial capabilities in regions should serve as carrying location advantages for new investors and hence should attract investment and business growth. This conceptualisation ignores the fact that strategies for smart specialisation from an industry perspective emerge out of business efforts to minimise costs and maximise benefits. Business clusters, hence, are agglomerations of firms, universities and public institutions that are interconnected to reduce costs and enhance benefits in a self-perpetuating cycle. Business clusters are associated with policy initiatives, government assistance/procurement, localised inter-firm operations and undifferentiated supply of labour and knowledge from universities all of which offer input and output markets. To this extent, all clusters exhibit some form of market relationships, even though the driving force may be coming from a specific agency. The concept of market-driven business clusters that we develop in this paper introduces an alternative logic to explain how input and output markets and supply chains drive regional economic growth and determine interactions between governments, university and industry. Business clusters represent agglomerations of firms co-located in selected geographic areas and technology fields. Each technology field corresponds with specific industry segments and specific product value chains. Firms with operations in one specific technology field build capabilities that enable them to produce unique categories of products and services, measured by industry classification codes. Firms’ capabilities in technology fields, hence, directly correspond with the product categories, measured by industry classification codes. Neither the geographic nor the technology boundaries of business clusters are known and analysis of the agglomeration of firms usually proceeds as simple counting of firms and case illustrations. This paper exploits an alternative methodology for cluster mapping (i.e. multistage cluster methodology) that enables a scientific investigation of the concentration of firm’s capabilities in value chains and input and output markets. Analysis of cluster agglomerations has been dominated by the neo-institutional model, which has focused on the institutional arrangements that support innovation and production within each selected geographic area and a bundle of related industry segments (Audretsch and Feldman 1996; Simmie and Sennett 1999). Qualitative research has been used to elaborate on observations of Triple Helix interactions which are expressed as specific institutional arrangements, governance of production activities and knowledge transfer across university boundaries (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000). This paper adopts a different approach to analysis of Triple Helix in business cluster by mapping the existing capabilities both within the industry and the university sectors in the context of the health technology cluster activities in the three bordering regions of the Greater South East in the UK (South East of England, East of England and Greater London). Our approach is based on two distinctive databases for the selected regions—one with firms and data on their industry scope of activities and their performance (based on Amadeus data for 2005–2007, or the last available year), and the other database with research projects hosted by regional research establishments (universities) during the period 2000–2008 (a proprietary database assembled from a combination of data sources). We interpret the concentration of capabilities in the industry and the university sectors as evidence of accomplished level of smart specialisation. We measure the cluster capabilities with the number of firms that generate output in related industry sectors and the number of University Centres of Excellence that generate innovation outputs from government-funded research. This paper aims to fill the gaps in the Triple Helix literature on innovation within and across cluster boundaries, on university–firm linkages and collaborations (Bozeman, et.al., 2013), technology transfer and supply chain linkages between cluster members or on other localised knowledge and resource connections. The results from our new cluster mapping and analysis based on the multistage cluster methodology enabled us to identify regional concentration of industry and university capabilities as a measurement of the innovation potential within the regional Triple Helix. Our empirical analysis brings evidence in context of relationships between firms, universities and public funding bodies with the focus on the bio-medical and health technology sector in the Greater South East (UK). The paper bares little discussion of the UK policy framework for smart specialisation, as this is virtually missing. However, we demonstrate that healthy market conditions generate incentives to firms to co-locate in areas where there are no additional policy incentives. The leading questions for our theoretical and empirical investigations are the following: (1) how can we measure and map the concentration of private sector capabilities in a high-tech industry, such as bio-medical and health technologies, (2) to investigate the co-alignment between industry concentration and university specialisation as a driver for regional growth and (3) to investigate the impact of public funding on the innovation capabilities and specialisation within the university sector.",8

It gained its political and economic significance in 2011 when it was established by the European Commission’s proposal for cohesion policy in 2014–2020Footnote 2 as a precondition for using the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). Since the ERDF represents a significant financial input for all the EU member states, especially for those less developed such as Croatia, the national/regional research and innovation strategy for smart specialisation (S3) has become a first rank policy issue. Smart specialisation means, by definition “identifying the unique characteristics and assets of each country and region, highlighting each region’s competitive advantages, and rallying regional stakeholders and resources around an excellence-driven vision of their future” (European Commission 2011). From a broader perspective, smart specialisation is perceived as an explicit new industrial policy which assumes integration of research and innovation policies focused on improving performance of particular sectors, industries or technologies. During the 1990s and early 2000s, when neoliberalism dominated political economy, industrial policy was considered as an economic vulnerability, and policies were focused on horizontal non-selective measures that had a role of implicit or hidden industrial policy. Smart specialisation in the EU is driven by the need to use scientific and production resources in a more rational and smarter way to overcome “eurosclerosis”, whose origins can be traced back to the 1980s when the EU started to face rising unemployment and high inflation (Owen 2012: 23). Today, it is propelled by the need to compete with rivals such as US, BRICs and other emerging economies (e.g. Korea) and to aid recovery from the global financial and economic crisis. Recovery from the previous crisis of the 1980s caused by the oil shock was driven by technological innovation and new concepts of linking knowledge, innovation and economic growth through the national system of innovation (NSI) (Filippetti and Archibugi 2011), a concept pioneered by evolutionary and institutional economics (Lundvall 1992; Nelson 1993; Freeman 1988). The related concepts such as the endogenous nature of innovation (Mytelka and Smith 2002), interactive innovation model (Kline and Rosenberg 1986) and research triangle (European Commission 2000) have provided the conceptual framework of the Lisbon strategic agenda for the European Union to “become the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world” (Lisbon agenda 2000 and 2005). The concept of smart specialisation follows the similar theoretical foundations (e.g. trichotomy of research, business and government sectors) (Etzkowitz 1996) but unlike the previous concepts it is faced, paradoxically, with the growing uncertainty of the role of technological innovation in globalised knowledge economies. Innovation as the engine of progress is in a crisis (OECD, 2012) due to the changes in the global socioeconomic circumstances. The world economy is in the midst of global restructuring which is characterised by moving production to the far east, loss of millions of jobs in the manufacturing sectorFootnote 3 (European Commission 2012a; Owen 2012:40) coupled with, since 2008, global economic and financial crisis. The service and creative sectors are favoured as a platform for future economic growth (OECD, 2000), although it cannot be said with certainty to what extent this is based on their real impact on economic growth and how much it is just a reflection of uncertainty how the world and national economy will sustain progress. The standard concept of technical change and technological progress based on industrial technological innovation is challenged by various soft kinds of innovation such as organisational, social or market innovation that increasingly blurs the boundaries between the industrial and service sectors. There is a common perception that “future trends in innovation in most developed countries are uncertain” (OECD, 2012). The global economic restructuring threatens technology leaders like the USA, France, Germany and UK who risk losing production and industrial competences by relinquishing companies that can “make things” (MIT 2013; Owen, 201:41; European Commission 2012b). Similar fears are shared by the entire EU which is aware that it is losing competitive advantage in generic technologies and high-tech sectors. This can lead to the loss of jobs and growth on the one hand, while on the other, there may also be a loss of knowledge generation, because R & D and manufacturing are intrinsically linked, mutually reinforcing and, thus, often take place in close proximity to each other (European commission 2012a:5). Therefore, there are broad initiatives for rebuilding the industrial ecosystem and renewing the production and industrial policy in order to gain full value from innovation in both USA (MIT 2013) and Europe (European Commission 2012a, b) as well as in developing countries (Rodrik 2004:21). Unlike European industrial policies in the 1980s and 1990s which were focused on a broad range of horizontal measures to improve the framework conditions for European industrial competitiveness and fostering innovation, the recent industrial policy, from the 2000s, is more focused on sectors and production specialisation (Owen 2012). The beginning of sectoral orientation is reflected in the more integrated industrial policy and recognised as “matrix approach” (Aiginger and Sieber 2006; European Commission 2005) since it combines horizontal measures and sectoral differentiation. Sectoral differentiation is driven by the recognition that the effects of broad horizontal policies can vary significantly from industry to industry and that measures for some sectors are not relevant for the others (Aiginger and Sieber 2006) (e.g. deregulation has a high impact on pharmaceuticals and telecom sector while much less on the apparel industry or public transport). We believe that this “specialisation” of policy mix is an additional impetus for deploying the concept of smart specialisation alongside its chief mission: to identify the best directions of technological shift and comparative advantages at the sectoral and regional levels. The most recent concepts of European development such as an “Integrated industrial policy for the globalisation era” and “Innovation Union” which makes two of seven “flagship initiatives” of the Europe 2020 (European Commission 2010a, b) are still dominated by the horizontal measures to “improve the framework conditions”. However, these flagship initiatives as well as the whole strategy for Europe 2020 cannot be considered alone but in combination with another parallel strategy known as the “Key Enabling Technologies” (KET) which includes six technological areas—micro-and nano-electronics, nano-technology, photonics, advanced materials, industrial biotechnology and advanced manufacturing technologies (European Commission 2012b). The concept of KETs is introduced relatively late in the policy and strategic documents, in 2009 (European Commission 2009). As stated by the European Commission itself (European Commission 2012b), the reason why the EU has not taken sufficient and timely commercial advantage of its excellent research base in KETs was the absence of a common definition and understanding. Besides, they are very capital intensive and require some preconditions that are not met in the EU, like developed risk capital markets, coordination of national activities for more productive allocation of resources, etc. This is why the appropriate policy mix which would accelerate industrial deployment of KETs is also deficient or absent. In our opinion, the orientation of smart specialisation on entrepreneurship and the business cluster was also driven by the wish to avoid further investments in public R & D, which is not sufficiently business driven. Today, KETs are acknowledged as a key element for Europe to achieving a world-class competitive industry, sustainable competitiveness and growth (European Commission 2012b). For the new financial period which addresses revised programme for European Regional Development Fund (ERDF), regions are encouraged to identify their particular technological niches with regard to KETs development (European Commission 2012b). Similarly, Horizon 2020 pays particular attention to the development and application of KETs and earmarked significant budget for strategic and operational targets for each of the six KETs. It opens up wider opportunities for EU regions to support not only competitive clusters and businesses which are the standard targets of regional development (European Commission 2010b) but also technologies and applied research, which make, in essence, a basis for development and progress of any clusters and industry branches and their cross-fertilisation.",12

A dual economy has emerged in Europe, where more competitive economies export manufactured goods and relatively less competitive (cohesion) economies export unemployed. The lack of attractive jobs and business opportunities in cohesion economies has affected the younger generation especially badly. As a response to this, significant numbers of people have started to look for greater economic fortunes elsewhere, outside their home countries. Qualified labour is one of the key assets for any economy. Especially so for one that is part of a larger pan-European economy, which is characterised by free movement of labour, goods, services and capital and simultaneously challenged by an ageing population. The obvious question in this context is, what policy options are there for the different European regions and member states to sustain and increase their living standards as well as the living standard of Europe as a whole? This raises a further question on the proper higher education specialisation, R&D, innovation, and economic development policies and strategies in propelling learning and structural change in industry that would lead to an increase in living standards. The current paper reviews comprehensively the main trends in higher education, research and innovation and economic development in European cohesion economies as compared to Europe’s best-performing economies. Thereafter, two more successful and two challenged cohesion economies are compared in relation to their achievements so far and the future policy challenges for the year 2020 and beyond. Our main research questions are in this context, if and how are the European, national and regional higher education and R&D policies actually contributing to cohesion economies. In this research, both the existing demand for qualified labour and the policy aims for achievement of the Lisbon 3 % R&D investment target will be taken into account. We embark on case studies that compare the developments in highly science-intensive economies (Finland and Sweden) and relatively less science-intensive ‘catching up’ economies (Estonia and Lithuania). We also identify, based on existing policy documents, research and public data, the main sources of the economic growth experienced in our case study economies. While doing so, we are interested in the fit between the existing industrial specialisation, higher education, R&D, innovation and economic development policies in particular. In doing this, we see modern innovation policy as a broad horizontal policy ( European Commission 2002) that deals with a variety of different policy areas that influence the successful introduction of new and significantly improved products, services and processes to the market. This involves a variety of education, knowledge and capability creation and entrepreneurship policies above and beyond R&D policy alone. The current research reviews both the existing situation as well as the policy objectives and actual policy measures that the case study economies have initiated during the last decades. We are interested in learning what role has been played by various local considerations as well as EU policies in shaping the higher education and R&D policies in the regions in question. While doing so, we are particularly interested in learning how well the supply of higher education meets the current and anticipated demand, i.e. industrial specialisation. The smart specialisation (Foray et al. 2009, 2011, 2012) concept was introduced to the R&D and innovation policies and cohesion policies for the next planning period of years 2014–2020 in the European Union. Even though the Lisbon 3 % R&D intensity target is maintained, this new concept was introduced to prevent European regions seeking to become market leaders in the same R&D-intensive industries, such as ICTs, biotechnology, etc. Instead, the individual EU regions should take their existing economic specialisation strongly into account, concentrate knowledge resources and link them to a limited number of priority economic activities. Taking this into account, we draw lessons for the development and implementation of future higher education, R&D and innovation, and economic development policies and especially smart specialisation strategies in Europe. In ‘Knowledge Economy Literature and Specialisation’ section, we proceed with analysing the concept in the light of modern innovation theories. We hypothesise that EU member states are profoundly different as far as the role of knowledge, technology and innovation, and related specialisation are concerned. We address these differences in ‘Main Trends in R&D, Innovation and Higher Education in Europe’ section, followed by in-depth country analyses on the role of higher education and R&DI policies in the Baltic Sea region economies since the 1990s in ‘Higher Education, R&D and Innovation Policies Since the 1990s’ section. We also discuss the specialisation and R&D intensity of industry, higher education and the supply of qualified work force and lessons for smart specialisation strategies in ‘Discussion’ section.",20

P. Thapa,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The European Union incentivizes the prioritization of specific policy fields by regional governments, especially with its 2014–2020 framework for the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). To this end, the European Commission revised the relevant regulation and introduced a new legal framework for the allocation of ERDF by requiring regional and national authorities to develop dedicated regional strategies and focus their ERDF investment on existing strengths and promising economic activities like ICT development (EU Regulation 1303/2013/EU). This poses questions about the effectiveness of policy prioritization: Do regions with strategies for specific policy fields perform better in these policy fields? Does focused investment of ERDF in specific policy fields yield better performance? To answer these questions, we examine regional policy prioritization and performance during the ERDF framework 2007–2013. Although the concern for policy prioritization was less pronounced in the previous ERDF framework, the Council of the EU already stressed greater ownership at local and regional level for the Lisbon competitiveness agenda and in its 2006 strategic guidelines for Cohesion Policy (Council Decision 2006/702/EC). We focus our inquiry on ICT policy and performance, since a number of regions had developed dedicated ICT strategies despite the absence of an explicit conditionality or legal obligation in the ERDF regulations. As ICT is one of the nine priority fields for the ERDF, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund, the EU implicitly recommended this policy field for regional policy prioritization (Council Regulation 1083/2006/EC). ICT as a prioritized policy area at EU level goes to the 1990s when the paradigm of ‘information society’ was increasingly streamlined into EU regional development policies (Dabinett 2001). Using data from the ERDF framework 2007–2013, we take the opportunity to study the effects of regional political prioritization of ICT even before the new incentives for policy prioritization of the 2014–2020 framework took hold. Therefore, our findings can possibly anticipate some effects of the new framework ex ante. The overarching goal of this article is to analyse the effect of policy prioritization of ICT by regional governments in the EU on their ICT performance as an example of policy prioritization by regional governments. For this, we first conduct a quantitative analysis of the effects of ICT strategies and ERDF expenditure on regional ICT performance for the period 2008 to 2012. Based on this analysis, we map EU regions according to their ICT prioritization and performance to identify interesting cases for future investigation. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for the current work on the new generation of smart specialization strategies and policy frameworks for digital growth.",16

In other words, the heterogeneity of European regions should be the basis of innovation rather than the promotion of R&D intensive industries (Smart Specialization Platform 2012; see also Asheim et al. 2011b:1134). As such, regional advantage should originate from the uniqueness of the region and the firms through interactive innovation, i.e. a combination of science and technology and work-place experience. By mobilizing their resources and connecting to national or global knowledge networks, and thereby, accessing enabling technologies, the hope is raised that even peripheral regions may survive global competition. These are features of a view placing innovation at the centre of regional development, which is decisive for the survival of a region in the globalized world. This article attempts to depict the possibilities available for peripheral non-university regions to engage in innovative development by presenting a case study of the technology centre KETEK situated in the Kokkola–Jakobstad region in Finland. The European Commission established an S3 Platform to assist EU member states and regions with professional advice concerning the design of innovation strategies. This platform has produced a Smart Specialization Guide (Smart Specialization Platform 2012) offering a step by step description of how to produce a smart regional innovation strategy, entitled RIS3. By analysing the context and potential for innovation, every region should produce a shared vision of the future of the region by setting up an inclusive governance structure. S3 adopts scientific concepts such as the Mode 3 Knowledge Production System, Quadruple Helix Innovation system and related variety. Accordingly, the Smart Specialization guide recommends four principles for the regional vision, which are as follows: Selection of a limited number of priorities on the basis of regional strengths, features and resources Matching R&D and innovation capacities to business needs Development of world-class clusters and providing arenas for related variety/cross-sector links both within the regions and externally Implementation of an innovation system as a collective endeavour based on the Quadruple Helix concept The intended purpose of the S3 platform is to offer assistance in terms of establishing and maintaining connections to enabling technologies, as well as to identify regional lock-ins or disconnections between universities and regional businesses. Along the lines of the S3 strategy, a theoretical framework will be constructed in this article, consisting of the concepts of Mode 3, the Quadruple Helix and related variety, in order to investigate the co-evolution of the economic, the political, the knowledge and the innovation systems in the case study at hand. The article continues as follows. The next section defines the position of an innovation system in general regional development. The third section discusses the theories of innovation modes and related variety as well as Mode 3 and the Quadruple Helix, of which the definition of Quadruple Helix has been somewhat confused in academic literature. These are all vital concepts for S3 and for aiding the construction of an inclusive governance structure, which are also used for interpreting the case study. In the fourth section, the case study is presented, and in the fifth, the case study is evaluated against the theoretical assumptions. In the last section, conclusions are drawn of the overarching question of this article, i.e. whether a non-university town is able to withstand global competition by setting up an intermediate organization. Based on theoretical assumptions developed in the second and third sections, a secondary question concerns whether the alteration of the fourth helix may open up the Triple Helix actors towards each other, thereby attuning a region to creativity and innovation. Through the theoretical framework, the co-evolution of the political and the knowledge systems in the case region will be examined over two decades. It is worth noting that the technology centre of KETEK evolved to become the centre of the innovation process during this period. Looking at a case situated within the framework of the ”Nordic welfare model”, which according to Kristensen & Lilja allow for “experimentalism” and “bottom-up renewal processes” (2009:2), should raise the expectancy of locating the impact of a fourth helix. Additionally, Goddard et al. (2012:613–614) describe technology centres as being more proficient than universities in terms of initiating bottom-up innovation processes in underdeveloped innovation systems, since technology centres are “capable of identifying and “federating” local business demand for innovation …and channelling it towards regional/national/international sources of innovation …which may give response to these demands” (Landabaso 1997: 11). A small peripheral region, lacking large companies and universities setting the agenda for knowledge creation might as well be more sensitive to the fourth helix, and in such a region, the impact of an intermediate organization might be greater than in metropolitan regions.",24

The Case of Poland,June 2015,Krzysztof Mieszkowski,Marcin Kardas,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Interactions and collaboration between different groups of actors, especially entrepreneurs, researchers and users, are one of the key characteristics of entrepreneurship and innovation activities. The requirement to involve a great range of stakeholders in major policy decisions is one of the important implications for innovation policy (Martin 2010a). The role of different actors (agents from research, environmental and health policy) is of particular importance in the process of identifying and selecting research priorities. In recent years, these processes have become much more decentralised than the centralised decision-making processes of the older paradigms (Gassler et al. 2008). According to the OECD, diverse stakeholder involvement in priority setting is a salient trend in most countries and is undertaken in the interests of increasing transparency and to better respond to societal needs. The new approaches to decision-making processes include broad consultation with scientific experts with policy, business and community representatives (OECD 2003). At the economic policymaking level, there is a need to have a strategic collaboration between the government and private sector in order to overcome development obstacles and make use of existing opportunities. This strategic collaboration should constitute the fundaments to a discovery process (Rodrik 2004). Stakeholder involvement within entrepreneurial discovery process is at the very centre of the smart specialisation concept. The goal of this concept is to focus limited financial and human resources on certain domains in order to develop distinctive and original areas of specialisation. These domains should be defined in studies on economic structure and on the discovery processes undertaken by enterprises and other organisations operating within this economy (Foray et al. 2011). The entrepreneurial discovery processes became particularly important for all EU Member States. The CPR regulation for financial perspective 2014–2020 imposed on them the preconditions regarding all research and innovation investments co-financed with structural funds (in the case of Poland, it is planned to allocate about 10 billion euro for research and innovation). According to the ex-ante conditionalities for Thematic Objective 1, Member States should possess strategies for smart specialisation at national or regional level. The strategy is expected to show their vision and ways to spend the structural funds on research and innovation projects. Besides focusing national or regional resources on the limited number of priorities, this strategic framework should also strongly consider stimulation of private research and development (R&D) investment in these fields. The documents should be developed in the process which involve a broad number of research and innovation actors like universities (and other higher education institutions), industry and social partners in an entrepreneurial discovery process (EU Regulation 1303/2013/EU). These preconditions are adjective stimulus for policymakers to organise decision-making processes in a more open, transparent and inclusive way. The task of authorities is to facilitate the processes of entrepreneurial discovery. Despite the rich literature on the engagement of stakeholders including foresight and the growing number of publication on the smart specialisation concept, this topic still seems to be very attractive for research. This particularly concerns less advanced economies in terms of research and innovation, such as Poland. The economic and research systems in Poland have substantially evolved over the last 30 years. During this time, the governance structure and research funding system moved from the highly centralised model typical of communist countries to a model based on capitalist and market-driven rules. These changes were accompanied by the growing role of a different group of actors in research and innovation policies, especially the scientific community. In Poland, in recent years, there have been implemented many activities involving different stakeholders in these processes. Foresight programmes, strategic research and development programmes, and sectoral research programmes are particularly interesting for the purpose of this article. Taking into account the above, the article examines the following question: 
To what extent do the chosen initiatives facilitate the entrepreneurial discovery process for smart specialisation in Poland?
 This paper reviews the literature on entrepreneurial discovery and the smart specialisation concept, priority setting and foresight exercises. Next, it presents the research settings and results from studies on the evolution of the research system in Poland and three initiatives: the foresight programmes, strategic research and development programme, and sectoral research programmes. In conclusion, the issues related to the engagement of stakeholders in priority setting are discussed, particularly from the perspective of the evolution of research systems and requirements of the smart specialisation strategy.",23

Recent research and policy have emphasised university-industry collaboration as a way to develop and exchange competencies in universities and in firms, rather than seeing university-industry partnerships only as a form of knowledge or technology transfer. Attention has shifted towards mechanisms to facilitate interaction and knowledge exchange, such as research partnerships, inter-sector mobility and networks (Abreu et al. 2009; Gulbrandsen et al 2011; Ramos-Vielba and Fernandez-Esquinas 2011; Freitas et al 2013; Perkmann et al 2013). Prior research on university-industry partnerships has investigated a range of industry and firm level characteristics that influence firms’ propensity to collaborate with universities (Laursen and Salter 2004; Cohen et al. 2003) as well as their motives and goals when participating in partnerships with universities (Bercovitz and Feldman 2007). Factors such as firm size, R&D intensity and industrial maturity are factors that have been found to influence firm’s dependence on university resources (knowledge, infrastructure or staff) which influences firms’ orientation towards university partnerships (Laursen and Salter 2004; Bekkers and Bodas-Freitas 2008; Schartinger et al 2002). However, for many of these variables, and particularly firm size and technological maturity, the empirical evidence does not point to a clear picture (Revilla and Fernandez 2012; Kafouros and Buckely 2008). One reason for this is that firm level research has focused on partnerships with universities in terms of firms’ external knowledge sourcing. There has been little emphasis on whether or not partnerships with universities are a strategy taken by firms to develop firm-specific resources or competencies. At the same time, research indicates that for many firms accessing particular technologies or scientific insights are not the main motivation behind university partnerships. Rather, the motivation is often expressed by firms as developing complementary competencies, keeping abreast of the scientific frontier, developing competencies of own staff and recruiting qualified personnel. Particularly for large firms, collaborating with universities seem to be motivated by developing broader competencies (Zidorn and Wagner 2012), rather than gaining access to research results and infrastructure, which is more important for small firms (Thune et al 2012; Santoro and Chakrabarti 2002). With these observations in mind, this paper addresses the question of whether firms see university partnerships as a way of developing innovation-related competencies and whether firm characteristics, including firm size and R&D capacity, influence how firms use university partnerships in this respect. To address this question empirically, we investigate firms who participate in university-industry partnerships where competence development for innovative firms is an explicit goal. One policy instrument intended to support competence development and capacity for R&D and innovation is so-called industry PhD schemes or collaborative PhD schemes. In many respects, this is the closest kind of collaborative relationship between universities and firms that we are likely to find and is therefore a good empirical case for exploring the questions of interest. Several European countries have implemented such schemes, open to applicants from all areas of science or restricted to science and engineering subjects. In France, the CIFRE (Conventions Industrielles de Formation par la REcherche) programme has been in operation for about 30 years. In the UK, the iCASE programme run by the Engineering and Physical Science Research Council provides support to firms who support and employ a PhD student. Similar schemes operate in many other European regions and countries, including Ireland, Spain, Belgium, Germany and all of the Nordic countries.Footnote 1 Denmark implemented the Ervervs-PhD scheme in the 1970s, and more recently Sweden and Norway started similar programmes, labelled Industry PhD projects in Sweden and Nærings-PhD in Norway. The program we investigate in this study is the Norwegian scheme Nærings-ph.d. The scheme was implemented in 2008 and is modelled on the Danish scheme. The schemes operate on a relatively similar basis, in which a funding agency covers some of the costs of a PhD fellowship, and where the PhD student is affiliated to both a university and a firm. The firm applies for the funding, and the grant is awarded to the firm, but based on a formal agreement with a degree awarding institutions. The PhD students are enrolled in regular PhD programmes and usually have both a university supervisor and a supervisor in the firm, and there is usually a requirement that the student spends prolonged periods both in the firm and at the university. The goals of such programmes are quite similar as well; they aim to support high quality research, to promote transfer of knowledge between universities and industry and to promote development of research skills of relevance for industry and academia. A basic principle is that the projects should be anchored to the research needs and strategies of the firms, but that the support from the funding agency should enable the firm to undertake research of a more general and longer-term type that what firms usually fund themselves. The schemes’ contribution to innovation at the firm-level is twofold; by extending and complementing company R&D activities and by increasing the research skills of (existing or prospective) company employees. Towards national innovation policy goals, the schemes aim to promote better links between universities and industry and more efficient transfer of knowledge and competencies, and by increasing the skill base both in industry and universities in science and engineering.",7

It has also been examined as a process within organisations, dependent on the active participation in working and learning processes of employees, with a focus on the role of changes in work process knowledge and practices: innovation strategies mainly based on learning by doing, using and interacting (DUI mode) (Jensen et al. 2007). Cyert and March (1963) had highlighted how the drive to solve problems with organisational routines within organisations, which they considered to be ‘adaptive learning systems’, could be a driver of innovation at the level of the firm, as changes are made in routines and procedures through a process of incremental learning. Nelson and Winter (1982) considered that a focus on organisational routines could help researchers understand how firms and industries change over time. Huber (1991) emphasised too how different types of organisational learning, including an intentional focus on improving organisational routines, could facilitate innovation and organisational adaptation. Winter (2003) linked the STI and DUI modes by emphasising how if companies have effective routines for carrying out research and development, for finding problems in their organisational routines, and for creating or adapting new knowledge, then they have learning capabilities as well as learning routines in that the latter have a dynamic aspect to them (Winter 2003). O'Reilly and Tushman (2008) extended this argument by arguing that the ability of a firm to be ambidextrous, able simultaneously to explore and exploit, is a dynamic capability that enables a firm to adapt over time. A focus on dynamic capabilities tends to point to the key role of strategic leadership in developing, adapting and reconfiguring organisational skills and resources in the face of changes in the environment (Eisenhardt & Martin 2000; Teece 2007). However, Ambrosini et al. (2009) argue that dynamic capabilities can operate incrementally, as a renewing force or in a regenerative capacity, building on the insight of Winter (2003) that dynamic capabilities may need to be refreshed. Learning is also considered as a dynamic capability itself, rather than an antecedent of it. As such, learning as a dynamic capability has been identified as ‘a process by which repetition and experimentation enable tasks to be performed better and quicker’ (Teece et al. 1997, p. 520). It seems therefore that innovation researchers need to be able to switch between modes of innovation, and between levels relating to strategy and implementation, and across modes and levels, whereby learning within organisations is seen as a key driver of innovative behaviour. Ambrosini et al. (2009) point out that ‘as a dynamic capability, learning allows tasks to be performed more effectively and efficiently, often as an outcome of experimentation, and permits reflection on failure and success’ (p. 8). Argyris (1990) had emphasised how this type of learning involved more than simple problem-solving within the existing way of doing things and required double-loop learning involving the reframing of goals, values and beliefs and looking at the consequences of actions from a wider perspective. It is striking therefore how the language of renewal of dynamic capabilities of organisations, in which they are able to ‘survive and prosper under conditions of change’ (Helfat et al. 2007, p. 1), is so similar to the language applied to individuals when examining how they maintain their career adaptability across contexts and over time (Bimrose et al. 2011a, b). It could prove useful to examine the relationship between individual career adaptability and the development of innovative capabilities as complementary manifestations of the ability to prosper in changing environments. Jensen et al. (2007) have stressed how individuals perform their roles and tasks and learn to improve their performance is always important for the effectiveness of innovation. From that perspective, within the DUI mode, there is a question of whether career adaptable individuals boost the innovative capabilities of the organisations they join or within which they progress by taking on a variety of different roles? Can organisations boost their organisational learning capabilities by introducing individuals into new roles who have demonstrated their career adaptability in other contexts? Does individual adaptability in the wider labour market also provide a stimulus to innovative behaviour in new contexts? These issues can be partly explored by considering evidence from a study of individuals’ working and learning across the life-course in Norway and the UK. The focus in this article is upon the processes of working, learning, innovation and adaptability from an individual perspective, examining how employees develop the knowledge, skills and competences which increase their career adaptability and whether this makes them subsequently likely to be proactive and participate in activities leading to innovation. Wider employee engagement with prospective innovations may be influenced by the reactions of and engagement of ‘change agents’ (Brown et al. 2004) as well as by particular patterns of work organisation and the extent to which the workplace offers a restrictive or expansive learning environment (Fuller and Unwin 2006). In a qualitative study of 64 workers in the UK and Norway,Footnote 1 an investigation was made of career adaptability: the capability of an individual to make a series of successful transitions where the labour market, organisation of work and underlying occupational and organisational knowledge bases may all be subject to considerable change (Brown et al. 2012). Four key dimensions emerged relating to the role of learning in developing career adaptability: learning through challenging work (including mastering the practical, cognitive, relational and emotional demands linked with particular work roles and work processes); updating a substantive knowledge base (or mastering a new additional substantive knowledge base); learning through (and beyond) interactions at work and being self-directed and self-reflexive (Bimrose et al. 2011b). While progress on each of these four dimensions is typically displayed in the strategic career and learning biographies of individuals who have demonstrated adaptability across their careers, the first two of these dimensions will be examined to see if these processes might also play a role in supporting the development of individuals’ innovative capabilities. Initially, however, it is important to provide background on the typical forms of work organisation for Norway and the UK as they differ quite sharply according to EWCS 2005 figures (weighted percent of employees by organisational class) with discretionary learning forms of work organisation much more prevalent in Norway covering 55.6 % of employees, as against 30.3 % in the UK. Lean production patterns are similar, 28.2 and 33.3 %, respectively, but Taylorist forms of work organisation are less prevalent in Norway than the UK, 6.0 and 16.7 %, respectively, as are traditional or simple forms of work organisation 10.2 and 19.7 %, respectively (Holms et al. 2009).",11

This change is reflected in the growing number of publications focusing on ‘workplace innovation’ (Fricke and Totterdill 2004; Kalmi and Kauhanen 2008; Erickson and Jacoby 2003) or on ‘high-involvement innovation’ (Bessant 2013; Alasoini, et al. 2008; Hallgren 2009). At the policy level, this new interest can be seen in the DG Enterprise’s recent sponsorship of an EU network for the promotion of workplace innovationFootnote 1 and in the emphasis placed on the organisational dimension in the OECD (2010a) Innovation Strategy. The OECD’s Ministerial Report on the Innovation Strategy starts by observing that many highly innovative firms do not engage in R&D and that value may be created ‘through a wide range of complementary technological and non-technological changes and innovations’. It continues to argue that ‘the organisational structures and employment policies that shape the workplace are essential for determining how human capital translates into innovation and productivity’ (OECD 2010a, p. 6 and 11). At the level of measurement, the increasing attention given to the organisational dimension can be seen in the revised definitions of innovation in the 2005 version of the Oslo Manual, which abandoned the established definition of technological product and process (TPP) innovation. A major impetus to this was the recognition that the TPP-based measure of innovation poorly captures innovation processes in services, which are typically less technological and R&D intensive compared to manufacturing innovation and are often relational in character, having to do with changes in the organisation of relations between service providers and users (Miles 2005; Tether 2003; Tidd 2003). Acknowledging these differences, the 2005 version of the Oslo Manual developed expanded definitions of innovation covering not only product and process innovation but also organisational and marketing innovation. Organisational innovation is defined broadly to include the implementation of a new organisational method in the firm’s business practices, workplace organisation or external relations (Oslo Manual 2005, p. 50). The use of these new definitions in the design of successive waves of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) after 2005 means that researchers now have access to data measuring for EU member nations the frequency and the amount of expenditure not only on product and process innovations but also on organisational and marketing innovations.Footnote 2
 While these new measures have been useful for estimating the frequency of and correlations between different types of innovations across manufacturing and service sectors (e.g. Schmidt and Rammer 2007), I would argue that they have been less valuable for improving our understanding of the interdependencies between work organisation on the one hand and process and product innovation on the other. One reason for this has to do with the broad and encompassing nature of the definitions. The CIS provides general measures of how much organisational change or innovation has taken place over a three-year period within private sector enterprises. Organisational innovations are defined to include changes in managerial systems, changes in work organisation and changes in the structure of relations with other organisations. From both the research and policy angles, obvious questions are as follows: Changes in what direction? And what are the rates of adoption of specific types of managerial practices and forms of work organisation that correspond to particular organisational designs? In terms of gaining a better understanding of the interdependencies between work organisation and innovation, a key question is: What kinds of organisational designs and forms of work organisation promote product and process innovation? And the policy challenge is how to promote the adoption of these good designs and forms. Getting information relevant to these questions and policy agendas, however, would require a different specialised survey. Arguably, the ideal survey framework for investigating these questions at the EU level would be a harmonised linked employer/employee survey measuring work organisation and its social and economic impacts, including the impact on product and process innovation. A linked survey framework has the advantage of being able to direct questions to the level that is best placed to provide the information. For example, employers in general are best placed to respond to questions about the enterprise’s overall structure and strategy including the introduction and marketing of new products, while employees are better placed to provide information on the nature of their jobs and what they learn at the workplace. The EU MEADOW project has proposed a framework for undertaking linked employer/employee surveys that measure organisational change and its impacts (Greenan and Lorenz 2013 for an overview), and surveys based on the MEADOW framework have now been carried out in Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland.Footnote 3 An extension of this approach to other European nations would create the possibility for an EU-wide analysis of the interconnectedness between work organisation and innovation, including an investigation of the impact of differences in national framework conditions. In the absence of this ideal organisational survey, it is nonetheless possible to advance the analysis of the interrelations between work organisation and innovation at the European level by using the 2010 results from the 5th European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) carried out at the employee-level. The 2010 wave of the survey included a new question that can be used to measure the occurrence of process innovations at the establishment level as seen from the employee’s perspective. The question asks whether over the last three years the employee’s immediate working environment has been affected by the introduction of new processes or technologies.Footnote 4 The survey does not include a measure of product innovation, and this can be explained by the fact that employees are not necessarily well placed to answer questions about the development and marketing of new products by the enterprise. They are, however, in a position to provide reliable information about whether their immediate working environment has been affected by the introduction of new technologies and processes. While the use of a single measure of innovation outcomes across Europe is an important limitation of the analysis, I believe the results presented here provide useful new insights into the interconnections between work organisation and innovation as well as into the role of labour market policies in promoting innovation. The analysis is illustrative of the kinds of research questions that could be addressed more fully with the ideal European organisational survey. The paper is structured as follows. In the ‘Mapping Work Organisation for the EU-27 and Norway’ section, I draw on the results of the 5th European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS) to update the cluster analysis developed in Lorenz and Valeyre (2005) for characterising forms of work organisation and styles of employee learning. After having mapped the different forms of work organisation for the EU-27 and Norway, I present in the ‘The Interconnectedness of Work Organisation and Innovation’ section the results of an aggregate correlation analysis showing the relationship between the national frequencies of different forms of work organisation and the national frequencies of process innovation using the EWCS measure. The aggregate results are compared with those from a logistic regression analysis of the determinants of process innovation using the micro-data from the 5th EWCS. The two analyses arrive at apparently contradictory results. The aggregate correlations show that the frequency of process innovation is higher in nations where a larger share of employees is engaged in what I refer to as the ‘discretionary learning’ (DL) forms of work organisation characterised by high levels of employee learning, problem-solving and discretion in work. The micro-analysis, on the other hand, shows that employees engaged in the ‘Lean’ forms, characterised by less discretion and higher constraints on their pace of work, are more likely to be affected by process innovations. In the ‘Forms of Work Organisation and New Knowledge Creation and Diffusion’ section, I account for this apparent contradiction by arguing that the DL forms provide employees with greater scope for the exploration of new knowledge that can result in new process innovations that diffuse beyond the firm’s boundaries. While the Lean forms of work organisation appear efficient for the exploitation of existing knowledge, they are less adapted to the exploration of new knowledge. An increase in the national share of the DL forms may increase the generation new process-related knowledge that can be shared with the firm’s network of partners and collaborators, increasing the odds that employees in general in a nation are affected by the introduction of new processes and technologies regardless of their form of work organisation. Having developed these arguments in favour of the more extensive use of the DL forms of work organisation, I turn in the section ‘Policies, Institutional Framework Conditions and Innovation Outcomes’ to investigate polices for promoting their adoption. Using multi-level logistic analysis, I up-date and extend the policy analysis presented in Holm et al. (2010) on the relation between labour market structure and forms of work organisation. The analysis identifies a positive relation between the likelihood of process innovations and the development of systems of ‘flexible security’ characterised by high levels of labour market mobility, unemployment protection and active labour market measures. By means of a mediation analysis, I show that this positive relation can be largely explained by the way systems of flexible security promote the use of the DL forms of work organisation.",11

J. Campbell,Elias G. Carayannis,Scheherazade S. Rehman,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This article focuses on analyzing quality of democracy in a comparative approach. Even though comparisons are not the only possible or legitimate method of research, our contribution is based on the opinion that comparisons provide crucial analytical perspectives and learning opportunities. Therefore, our analysis is being guided and governed by the following proposition: national political systems (political systems) are comprehensively understood only by using an international comparative approach. International comparisons (of country-based systems) are common (see the status of comparative politics, for example in Sodaro 2004). Comparisons do not have to be based necessarily on national systems alone but can also be carried out using “within”-comparisons inside (or beyond) subunits or regional subnational systems, for instance the individual provinces in the case of Austria (Campbell 2007, p. 382). The pivotal analytical research question of this article is twofold: To develop (to “proto-type”) a conceptual framework of analysis for a global comparison of quality of democracy. This framework will also reference to the concept of the “Quadruple Helix innovation systems” (Carayannis and Campbell 2014, 2015). Quadruple Helix and Quadruple Helix structures represent here an interdisciplinary (and trans-disciplinary) linkage that connects research in quality of democracy with innovation concepts (see also Bast et al. 2015).Footnote 1 This interdisciplinary perspective should furthermore emphasize the overall importance of knowledge (and of knowledge and innovation) for society, economy, and democracy. This same conceptual framework will be used and will be tested for comparing and measuring quality of democracy in the different Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) and European Union (EU27) countries. First propositions are being formulated about democracy in the USA but clearly need further follow-up inquiry in a later phase and discourse. This comparison is more exploratory in nature and character and wants to provide further evidence about the usefulness of the developed framework. This framework should inspire and inform future research on quality of democracy but also future research in reference to knowledge and innovation systems (see also Campbell 2012; Campbell and Carayannis 2014). In our analysis presented here, quality of democracy should be compared mutually between all member countries to the OECD and all the member countries to the European Union (EU15, EU27),Footnote 2 thus leading to a country-based comparison of democratic quality. Supranational aggregations (like of the whole European Union at the EU level of institutions) or transnational aggregations (global level) shall not be dealt with. The OECD consists primarily of the systems of Western Europe (EU as well as non-EU), North America (USA and Canada), Japan, Australia, and New Zealand. Outside these regions, Israel, Mexico, and Chile are part of the OECD, which highlights the global expansion and reach of OECD. The OECD countries can be majorly determined over the following two features: economically as “advanced economies” (IMF 2011, p. 150), and politically, the majority of the OECD countries are determined as “established democracies” or as “Western democracies.” Furthermore, we may also discuss, how relevant the concepts of “advanced societies” and “advanced democracies” are (Carayannis and Campbell 2011, p. 367; also Carayannis and Campbell 2012). However, in this context, it appears more crucial that the OECD countries (again by the majority) can be seen as an empirical manifestation of liberal democracy, as known in the beginning of the twenty-first century. Ludger Helms (2007, p. 18) pointed out: “For a system to be identified as a liberal democracy, or simply as liberal-democratic, liberal as well as democratic elements have to be realized in adequate volumes.”Footnote 3 Just as decisive is Helms’ (2007, p. 20) statement: “The political systems of Western Europe, North America and Japan examined in this study can be distinguished—despite all the differences—as liberal democracies.” Since the OECD countries are majorly represented by advanced democracies and advanced economies, the OECD countries are very suitable as a Peer Group for the comparisons of different OECD countries, for example, the USA with other OECD countries, in order to carry out a “fair” comparison. For a comparison of the quality of democracy of the USA with other countries (democracies), the “comparative benchmark” must be of the highest possible standard, in order to submit propositions that test the actual quality of a concrete democracy. Concerning quality of democracy, what can the United States learn from other democracies? This same question applies also to all the other democracies. This emphasis of the OECD comparative assessment of quality of democracy will not be based on a time series pattern; instead it will focus on an indicator-specific system using empirical information available from a more recent year (mostly 2010, referring to data publicly accessible as of early 2012).Footnote 4 A broad spectrum of indicators will be considered for this purpose, which appears to be necessary in order to conclude different (underlying) theories and models about quality of democracy. Follow-up studies will certainly be conceivable to integrate this empirically comparative snapshot of the quality of democracy. As of January 2012, the OECD has over 34 member countries. These OECD member countries define the primary reference framework for the international comparison in this analysis. Since not every member state of the current EU27Footnote 5 is a member of the OECD, the decision to include the non-OECD countries of the EU27 countries was made for the country comparison, which therefore results in an expansion of the group of countries to “OECD plus EU27.” These additional countries are Bulgaria, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, and Cyprus. In total, our presented country sample for the comparison of quality of democracy consists of 40 countries. There is naturally not only a single democracy theory (theory about quality of democracy), but the field of democratic theories is rather pluralistic and heterogeneous. Various theories and models co-exist about democracies (Cunningham 2002; Held 2006; Schmidt 2010). Metaphorically, based on these (partly contradictory) different theories, democracy theory could also be constructed as a meta-theory. Theoretically, democracy can be understood as multi-paradigmatic, meaning that there is not only one (dominant) paradigm for democracy. Therefore, we have to state pluralism, competition, co-existence, and co-development of different theories about democracy. Our analysis is based on the additional assumption (which does not have to be shared necessarily) that between democracy theory on the one hand and democracy measurement on the other hand, important (also conceptual) cross-references (and linkages) take place. Within this logic, a further development or improvement of the democracy theory demands a systematic attempt of democracy measurement, regardless of how incomplete or problematic an empirical assessment of democracy is. Just like there is no “perfect” democracy measurement, there is also no “perfect” democracy theory (see for example Campbell and Barth 2009; Lauth et al. 2000; Lauth 2004, 2010, 2011; Munck 2009; Schmidt 2010, pp. 370–398). Theories about the quality of democracy are partly already further developed, than it is often (in popular research) being assumed. One of the most important theory models about the quality of democracy that permits an empirical operationalization comes from O’Donnell (2004a). The field of the quality of democracy is no longer a vague one, especially not for OECD countries Footnote 6. The further structure of this contribution is divided into the following three sections: in Conceptualizing Democracy and the Quality of Democracy: Freedom, Equality, Control and Sustainable Development (Model of Quadruple Helix Structures) section, different conceptualizations of democracy and of quality of democracy are being presented, followed (in The Quality of Democracy in Comparative Perspective: A Comparative Empirical View of the OECD Countries (and EU27 Member Countries) Relating to the Dimensions of Freedom, Equality, Control, and Sustainable Development section) by the concrete empirical comparison of quality of democracy in the OECD countries and the member countries to the European Union. In the conclusion (Conclusion: Comparative Assessment and First Evaluation of Quality of Democracy in OECD Countries and the EU27 Member Countries section), we attempt to assess quality of democracy in the USA, based on the formulation of first propositions. Furthermore, the “Quadruple Helix” is being emphasized as an interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary approach for bringing democracy discourses and innovation discourses closer together.",90

The efficiency of this resource is determined not merely by its creation and production but by the way of its application and use. Traditionally, the centers of knowledge production were the universities, but in terms of the ways of knowledge application earlier—in the case of second-generation universities—only education and the spread of scientific publications were dominant (Wissema 2009). By the end of the twentieth century—primarily as a result of the Bayh-Dole Act adopted in 1980 in the USA—the process of knowledge application altered: the way was opened for the commercialization of research results and technologies produced in universities, the “third-generation” universities emerged, where the commercial application of knowledge became predominant (Wissema 2009). The industrial relationships of universities began to expand, and special institutions and technology transfer offices were established to coordinate them (Buzás 2005). In the knowledge-based economy of the twenty-first century, this process has gained a new impetus; university knowledge has now become the foundation stone of the knowledge-intensive economy of a region, and the “fourth-generation” universities have emerged, which influence their environment including the community and the society of the region in a proactive way (Pawlowski 2009; Zuti and Lukovics 2014). In terms of universities, the application of technologies has thus transformed from a possible source of additional income to a task having a crucial effect on local economy. To meet the requirements of this role, it is no longer sufficient to have an occasional system relying on researcher discretions, supervised by disciplinary peers and bearing academic aspects in mind, but it requires a professional, business-like attitude and a real entrepreneurial university model. In this model, the adequate coordination of the supply realized in university innovations and the demand of the market has an important role. Commercialization is itself a field of science: marketing, thus the situation described above, actually highlights the necessity of connecting innovation and marketing. It is not new that the innovation process is linked to marketing elements, as the concept of innovation itself makes application essential: “innovation leverages knowledge for knowledge application, diffusion and use, and thus translates knowledge into application” (Carayannis and Campbell 2010, p. 44), and marketing as an activity required for the commercialization of innovation already appeared in the early linear models of innovation (Miyata 2003). In our present paper, we review the change in the models of knowledge production and innovation and describe the essence of the marketing concepts related to the particular approaches. In relation to the application of innovation results, marketing was important in the early linear models; however, in today’s knowledge-based economy, a renewed marketing concept is needed for the changing role of universities. We summarize this new marketing mix with the 6P model within the science-to-business marketing concept providing the theoretical framework of university-business relationships (Baaken 2013), highlighting how marketing can serve the social application of innovation within today’s changed innovational context.",3

However, the university’s role in a knowledge economy is more complex than just pushing out inventions to be commercialized. Beside the linear spin-out commercialization track (Clarysse et al. 2005), university knowledge is transferred to the surrounding society in many other even more common ways, namely the interactions constituting the so called academic engagement (Perkmann et al. 2013). The most common transfer channels are publications, conferences and meetings, contract research, informal conversations over organizational boarders, consulting and collaborative research, co-supervising PhD students and industrial PhDs (Salter and Martin 2001; Jacobsson and Perez Vico 2010). The contribution of patents and licenses—the cornerstones of the linear spin-out funnel (Clarysse et al. 2005)—has been assessed to cover only between 7 and 14 % of all knowledge being transferred from universities to society (Cohen et al. 1998; Agrawal and Henderson 2002), with a dominant share being transferred instead through the interactive channels of academic engagement. However, very little attention has been paid to professionalizing the various interactions between academia and external parties which fall outside the linear commercialization funnel. The lack of interest in these interactive and more indirect mechanisms may partly derive from the difficulty in measuring and controlling their results (Baraldi et al. 2014), which may take several years to become visible or remain hidden, embedded in other development processes involving external organizations (Pavitt 2004; Håkansson and Waluszewski 2007). The interactive processes involving universities are complex, including a pluralism of knowledge forms and innovation approaches as pointed out by mode 3 of knowledge production and use (Carayannis and Campbell 2006). Complex and variable interactions between several spheres of society characterize also the quadruple helix and quintuple helix models, stressing the interactions respectively with the civil society and culture and with the physical environment, as a requirement for sustainable development (Carayannis and Campbell 2010; Carayannis and Rakhmatullin 2014). In this context, universities can theoretically play an important role as sources of ideas that industry can use to develop new product and technology within the “open innovation” paradigm (Chesbrough 2003). However, there are still several barriers to interactions between industry and academia, such as diverging motives, cultures and lack of trust (Plewa et al. 2005; Plewa and Quester 2007). Moreover, while the open innovation approach entails new opportunities, in order for these to be concretely turned into actual innovations, more targeted combinations of various actors’ resources need to be created and related in very specific ways to existing network structures (Håkansson and Waluszewski 2007). In other words, open innovation and the triple and the Quadruple helix model’s interactions do not happen automatically but require considerable efforts by the university management, including particular interaction-stimulating tools (Baraldi et al. 2013) allowing a more targeted open innovation approach. While the literature on commercialization via the linear spin-out funnel (Clarysse et al. 2005) analyses the role, and even measures the performance, of both the individual researchers and of the university management (e.g. technology transfer offices (TTOs)), the literature on academic engagement (Perkmann et al. 2013) only focuses on the motivations, personal characteristics, timing, preferred forms of engagement and barriers for the individual researchers, thereby neglecting the role of university management. In the words of Perkmann et al. (2013): “…for organization-level factors, extant research has focused on technology transfer or licensing offices while the role of organizational support in the guise of industrial liaison offices or business relationship offices has been disregarded. Future research should take these structures into account when analyzing engagement, with the possible outcome that organization-level (i.e. university-wide) variables may play a more important role than hitherto thought” (Ibid: 431). Therefore, at a broad level, this paper aims to investigate the role of university management in academic engagement. Moreover, the existing literature covers established university-industry relations or general principles, advantages and barriers for universities engaging in open innovation interactions with industry and society at large (Cf. mode 2/3 and 3-4-5ple helices models). This literature does not penetrate into how university management concretely promotes academic engagement and achieves more “targeted” open innovation interactions, starting from when university-industry relations do not exist yet. Thus, in order to address this literature gap, the specific aim of this paper is to investigate how university management can “target” open innovation interactions and with professional support stimulate the emergence of specific university-industry relations. For this purpose, we conducted a qualitative case study (Yin 1994) of the innovation support organization at Uppsala University, Sweden, analysing how it favours open innovation by supporting academic-engagement interactions with the surrounding society. More specifically, the case study addresses these three research questions: (1) Which mechanisms and tools does the university management apply in order to create targeted open innovation interactions? (2) Which effects, in terms of specific university-industry interactions, emerge? (3) Which challenges does the university management face in these processes when applying these tools? In particular, we delimit our focus to three such mechanisms: (a) Uppsala University’s recruitment of staff with double competence, capable of building trust and bridging the academia-industry cultural gap; (b) “broader” (i.e. less targeted) mechanisms for capturing potential interaction partners at the early end of the process of relation building (the AIMday tool); and (c) more oriented and targeted mechanisms operating at the level of creation of specific university-industry collaborations (the SMURF tool). Thus, the three mechanisms or interaction-stimulating tools present an increasing degree of focus on specific interaction partners. Our analysis shows that innovation support officers with both an academic research and an industrial management experience enable building trust between academic researchers and industrial partners, a crucial step in establishing university-industry interactions. The paper also shows that the following steps in developing these interactions are addressed by the two analysed tools, whose effects include the creation of contacts, participation, cooperation and collaboration, that is, various types of interactions approaching the ultimate goal of creating long-term deep relationships (cf. Baraldi et al. 2013). However, professional innovation support officers with double competence and tools such as those reviewed in this paper do not remove all challenges in stimulating academic engagement. Difficulties in codifying and following up the long-term results of interactions remain a challenge. The paper is organized as follows: After our theoretical background followed by our methods comes a description of the innovation support organization at Uppsala University and findings about the applied tools. Finally, we discuss our findings in terms of effects and challenges related to using these tools. We also provide suggestions for further research.",38

Available data and official reports suggest that global economic growth has consistently been slower than that of the average pace during the dozen or so years before the crisis. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), the failure to achieve a stronger cyclical upswing has had very real costs in terms of foregone employment, stagnant living standards in advanced economies, less vigorous development in some emerging economies and rising inequality nearly everywhere (OECD 2015a: 7). The global financial turmoil has also affected the productive relationships around the world. As pointed out by Breznitz and Murphree (2013), the current world production landscape shows that global value chains, based on very complex productive relationships (mainly driven by China), have been eroding the economic and technological lead of developed nations, especially that of the USA. As a result, several governments are facing harder conditions to meet such important targets as limiting global pollution and improving people’s welfare. No wonder industrial innovation is increasingly seen as an engine for effectively achieving long-term economic growth, especially for emerging nations. In the case of Mexico, although the country has managed to become the 15th largest world merchandise exporter, public policies have not yet been sufficiently effective as to promote competitiveness across all sectors of the economy because the prevailing large disparities in income levels drag productivity performance down in many industries (OECD 2015b). Hence, a key issue for this paper is whether public policy would support the development of Mexico’s innovation system generally, and, if so, could it address the national requirements for high-skilled human resources as well? In trying to answer these questions, a point to bear in mind is the influence of adverse structural conditions such as the persistently weak absorptive capacities of domestic firms. As the OECD has repeatedly pointed it out through the years, Mexico badly needs to improve its technical capabilities in order for productive firms to be able to absorb state-of-the-art technology for their innovation needs (OECD 1994; 2009; 2013; 2015b). Clearly, higher education institutions have a role to play in strengthening technological capabilities. As the extant literature on industrial innovation has long remarked, universities are fundamental pillars of the innovation process by forming and training qualified scientists and engineers, who epitomise the very best definition of human capital (Rosenberg and Nelson 1994; Boulton and Lucas 2008; Philpott et al. 2011; National Research Council 2012). However, higher education institutions around the world are facing critical concerns. For instance, as a result of the 2008 economic crisis, a significant number of OECD countries have cut public spending on education (OECD 2014: 66). United States’ public universities have also experienced a continual erosion of state support in the face of increasing demands for expenditures in other areas (National Research Council 2012: 55); although their financial problems are not new. Since the mid-1980s, a deep economic recession forced the U.S. government to re-evaluate its support to basic and applied research because public budget became severely scrutinized (Cohen and Noll 1994). Because many other nations were facing similar fiscal restrictions, they had to follow suit and started to reduce the level of research funds for their universities and national laboratories (Armstrong 1992; OECD 1999; Litan et al. 2007). It is worth mentioning that continual fiscal restrictions have generally pushed policy makers to re-evaluate governmental support to universities and their contribution to industrial innovation. To put it in other words, limits on public spending, increased competition and globalisation, changes in the drivers of the innovation process and a better understanding of the role played by science and technology in economic performance and societal change have led governments to pay stronger attention to the public universities’ missions. But universities have also been required to improve their administrative efficiency and accountability in response to the demands of different stakeholders like business, industry and labour unions, as well as students and parents (OECD 1999; Connell 2005). In the case of Mexico cyclical economic crises, and their fiscal effects, have not only forced public universities to undertake deep organisational changes in order to raise funds but also to align their traditional missions with the growing academic and professional demands posed by students and industrial firms. In this paper, we argue that Mexican universities are called to play an important role in straightening the technological capabilities of domestic firms amid growing financial and political concerns. Its purpose is, therefore, to examine the antecedents and consequences of policies to promote university-industry partnerships in Mexico, especially in relation with the supply of university graduates in science and technology. In doing so, we identify the type of technological capabilities that define the Mexican industry and what role human capital is playing in this case. In the following section, we describe what roles universities play in the science and technology system and how these roles have evolved in time.",7

Durney,Richard G. Donnelly,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"“It’s like trying to shoot skeet from a moving train. But every time you get ready to pull the trigger, they hand you a new shotgun and say, ‘Here. This one’s better.’ How many times would you hit the target?” A project manager of Project Renew, a large US federal software modernization project, used this image to explain the frustration he experienced as he tried to manage his project to a successful conclusion. “We’re trying to modernize the way we do business,” the project manager explained. “But for every step we take, the technology takes two. So we’re always trying to catch up. It was exciting at first, but now I’m beginning to think we may never get to the end, if there is an end.”Footnote 1
 Failures of large, expensive information technology projects receive a great deal of attention [1–3].Footnote 2 [4] Chaos Report [4] raised concerns about the rate of failure of information technology (IT) projects. Since then, the Standish Group’s methodology has been critiqued and debated [5, 6] but few sources doubt that failures of IT projects are more numerous than they should be. Sources of difficulty for IT projects include the challenge of securing long-term top management support [7], which can be especially uncertain in the public sector where top management leadership is generally politically determined; the timely availability of adequate resources, including funding and personnel [1, 8]; delivery date driven scheduling, which can also have negative effects on staff morale [9]; requirements clarity and scope creep; and lack of active customer involvement and relationship management [10, 11]. An early study of 132 large federal software development projects cited faulty project management as a significant source of difficulties in at least half of them [12]. Although project management as a practice has matured significantly since then, the key role of the project manager in IT project success or failure remains a challenge [1, 10, 13]. But rapid changes in technology—changes that have their source far beyond the reach of any individual project—can create significant uncertainties for IT projects [14–18] and blindside even the most seasoned project manager. Managers of projects that are especially susceptible to the effects of rapid technological change need tools beyond the traditional project management methods to help them deal with the uncertainties that the pace of technological change can create [14, 19]. Since the number of these large, complex projects seems to be increasing in the IT arena [1, 20], effective analysis of the risks, effects, and management responses associated with rapid technological change are urgently required. For more than 30 years, the authors have worked in and around large software development projects. During that time, we have observed the same phenomenon over and over—the pace of technological change often outruns and undermines the best project management planning efforts. Major changes, such as the evolution of mainframes to client–server configurations and again from client–server to architectures of the post-PC world, can create havoc. However, many smaller changes—new product versions that must be constantly incorporated into the developing software, for instance—can also have a cumulative effect on the ability of the project management process to accommodate the changes successfully. Some projects appear to be more susceptible to the effects of technological change than others. In this paper, we identify some of the project characteristics that we think contribute significantly to this susceptibility. We present a series of questions that project managers can ask about their projects that will help them decide whether or not their projects are susceptible to the effects of rapid technological change. We then propose techniques that complement traditional project management approaches to help project managers deal more successfully with these effects. We illustrate our discussion with examples drawn from the experience of Project Renew (see Fig. 1, Overview of project renew), a lengthy information management modernization effort in a US federal agency that experienced many project management challenges arising from rapid technological change.

Matevosyan,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Reproductive health (RH) providers commonly confront complex ethical questions that can be answered only through thoughtful consideration of the values, interests, rights, and obligations of those involved (Adams 2002; Matevosyan 2012a). Ethical principles of public health are distinguishable from the principles applied in modern bioethics. Public health aspects of human reproduction concern to the reduction of unsafe abortion, maternal mortality, and morbidity (Dickens and Cook 2007, 2008). Bioethical principles are developed at the clinical or microethical levels, affecting relations among individuals, whereas public health ethics applies at the population-based, macroethical level. Resolution of issues in public health practice, for instance of consent to healthcare interventions and preservation of privacy, is different from that in clinical medicine (Edwards et al. 2009). Many public health recommendations are based on interdisciplinary commissions that solicit public input in that particular country or region (Cohen 1997). For instance, WHO defines sterility as an illness, but a vast number of countries do not accept this definition (Krones et al. 2006). The role of biotheology is foremost to clarify for the different religious communities the perceived attitudes toward these developments. Judaism and Islam allow the practice of assisted reproduction when the oocyte and sperm originate from the wife and husband, respectively. The practice of assisted reproduction is not accepted by Vatican, but it is allowed by Protestant, Anglican, Lutheran, and other denominations. All Rabbinical rulings permit the use of contraception for medical indications. Judaism forbids abortion on demand but allows therapeutic abortion. Christian tradition views the embryo as a human being since conception, and therefore, abortion and contraception are strictly forbidden (Schenker 2000). Equilibrium can be best achieved by nurturing interdependent relationships that empower and protect the vulnerable women, including those with mental illnesses (Dudzinski 2006). After all, human reproduction cannot be viewed exclusively in its primordial goal—the perpetuation of the species (Dumitrache and Drăghia 1993). WHO defines RH as a state of physical, mental, and social well-being in all matters relating to the reproductive system at all stages of life (WHO 2012). Implicit in this are the rights of men and women to be informed and to have access to safe, effective, affordable, and acceptable methods of family planning of their choice. The endpoint question is whether or not the ethical dilemmas and their definitions impact on RH knowledge economy on systemic, organizational, and individual levels.",

We test the hypothesis that there is a U-shaped relationship between innovation (innovation expenditure as the percentage of sales per year) and firm performance (productivity in terms of sales per employee), in the short-term period. A variety of studies have examined the link between new product innovation and sales growth. Some research supports the claim that innovation is positively associated with rapid growth within small firms (Geroski and Machin 1993; Roper 1997; Wynarczyk and Thwaites 1997; Moore 1995). Geroski (1991a) found a positive link between the rates of entry and innovation. Geroski (1989, 1991b) document a productivity enhancing effect of market entry on the industry level. Market entry is often used as a vehicle for introducing new innovations (Geroski 1995). New innovative firms challenge incumbents that are often more interested in protecting their existing position than in seeking new business opportunities. Incumbents are then forced to increase their R&D investment in order to acquire a lead over their rivals due to a more competitive environment. Thus, more resources are allocated to R&D via growing incentives to innovate. Sterlacchini (1989) suggests that innovation has a significant and positive effect on productivity growth for most of the period, except during between 1973 and 1979. However, since each of Sterlacchini’s regressions contain only 15 observations (the number of industries in the cross-section), the study has very few degrees of freedom, and also imposes the constraint that the innovation to productivity relationship is the same in each industry. Hall and Bagchi-Sen (2002) find a positive relationship between new product introduction and redesigned products and total revenue growth, but only within the biotechnology sector. Some of the inconsistencies in past research can be explained by comparing innovators and non-innovators in different sales turnover growth categories. Furthermore, Hall and Bagchi-Sen (2002) suggest that the lack of employees in marketing functions is a barrier to innovation for firms and also conclude that marketing knowledge has a positive impact on firm’s performance. Mansury and Love (2008) found that the presence of service innovation and its extent has a consistently positive effect on growth, but no effect on productivity and there is evidence that the growth effect of innovation can be attributed, at least in part, to the external linkages maintained by innovators in the process of innovation. External linkages have an overwhelmingly positive effect on (innovator) firm performance, regardless of whether innovation is measured as a discrete or continuous variable, and regardless of the level of innovation considered. Jansen et al. (2006) distinguish between exploratory and exploitative innovation. They suggest that centralization negatively affects exploratory innovation, whereas formalization positively influences exploitative innovation. Interestingly, connectedness within units appears to be an important antecedent of both exploratory and exploitative innovation. Furthermore, their findings reveal that pursuing exploratory innovation is more effective in dynamic environments, whereas pursuing exploitative innovation is more beneficial to a unit’s financial performance in more competitive environments. Drews (1998) questioned the innovative capacity of pharmaceutical companies and suggest that consolidation continues to be a major feature (of the pharmaceutical industry), largely due to the impact of the “innovation deficit”. Damanpour et al. (1989) found that administrative innovations led to technical innovations (in public libraries) and they imply that organizational (re)structuring leading to administrative and structural renewal or improvement is a facilitator for the other types of innovations. The literature provides us with several indicators of the innovation development activity. R&D intensity is used in the literature as measure of intangible assets (e.g., Delios and Beamish 1999; Lu and Beamish 2004; Qian and Li 2003; Chiao and Yang 2011). Traditionally and still the most popular input indicator is the figure on expenditures on R&D (Loof and Heshmati 2002). In these studies, the innovation expenditures are divided by total sales to define the R&D or innovation intensity of a company. Kotabe et al. (2002) indicated that previous studies took intangible assets as control variables. The introduction of the Community Innovation Surveys (now Innovation Surveys) led to an increasing variation in measures (e.g., Griffith et al. 2006; Mairesse and Mohnen 2005; Loof and Heshmati 2002). In measuring firm performance, various concepts are found: sales per employee, export per employee, growth rates of sales, total assets, total employment, operation profit ratio, turnover, and return on investment (Loof and Heshmati 2002). Innovation expenditure, as defined in Oslo Manual (OECD 2005) includes both R&D and non-R&D innovation activities and it is a wider measure and much richer than the classical R&D expenditures data. In the knowledge-based economy (European Commission 2004), innovation has obtain the central role in the business world achievements. In addition to traditional technological innovation, there is innovation through new business models, new ways of organizing work, and innovation in design or marketing. Managing and exploiting to the best effect of all these different kinds of innovation represents a major challenge to businesses (Foray 2000). The emphasis in the literature is clearly on an increasing relevance of knowledge and innovation as an input to production and innovative processes (OECD 2001). The term the “knowledge-based economy” stems from a “fuller recognition of the role of knowledge and technology in economic growth” as well as from the increasing contribution of high-tech sectors (such as computers, electronics, and aerospace) to national output and employment (OECD 1996). The creation of knowledge and its assimilation are part of a complex process. Firms need to absorb, create, and exchange knowledge interdependently. In other words, innovation and diffusion usually emerge as a result of an interactive and collective process within a web of personal and institutional connections which evolve over time (OECD 2009). Knowledge transfer may occur through disembodied or equipment-embodied diffusion. The latter is the process by which innovations spread in the economy through the purchase of technology-intensive machinery, such as computer-assisted equipment, components, and other equipment. Disembodied technology diffusion refers to the process where technology and knowledge spread through other channels not embodied in machinery. The evidence suggests that during the l980s, all advanced countries appear to have been confronted with a reduction and in some cases even a collapse in the demand for unskilled labor. The reduction and/or collapse in the demand for unskilled labor is explained partly as a result of technical change, partly as a result of their opening up to international trade. However, different countries appear to have responded in different ways. In the USA, labor market adjustment has led to a substantial decline in real wages for the least-educated and least-skilled workers: in the European Union, it has led to much higher levels of unemployment in the unskilled labor force. In other countries, such as Canada, most of the adjustment has occurred through adjustments in labor time (OECD 2002a). The overall long-term tendency towards a more strong knowledge-based economy, in terms of both input proportions and the nature of the output, is accelerating. At the firm level, this is reflected in the fact that the shift in the demand for skills is strongest in firms introducing information technology. As to innovation management, the first explicit theory is the “technology push theory or engineering theory of innovation”. According to this theory, basic research and industrial R&D are the sources of new or improved products and processes. The production and uptake of research follows a linear sequence from the research to the definition of a product and specifications of production. An alternative view, in the 1960s, gave birth to the “market pull theory of innovation”. This theory still gives a central role to research as a source of knowledge to develop or improve products and processes. This theory sees the first recognition of organizational factors as contributors in innovation theory; the technical feasibility was still considered as a necessary condition of innovation, but no longer sufficient in itself for successful innovation (Schmookler 1996; Myers and Marquis 1969). A new generation called the “chain-link theories” of innovation then emerged to explain the fact that linkages between knowledge and market are not as automatic as assumed in the engineering and market pull theories of innovation (von Hippel 1994). At the end of the 1980s and during the 1990s, a technological networks theory of innovation management was developed by a new group of experts under the label of “systems of innovation”. This view stressed the importance of sources of information that are external to the firm: clients, suppliers, consultants, government laboratories, government agencies, universities, etc. (Nelson 1993; OECD 1999). Finally, “the social network theory” of innovation management states that knowledge plays a more crucial role in fostering innovation and “open innovation” assumes that “firms can and should use external ideas as well as internal ideas, and internal and external paths to market” (Chesbrough 2003). Recently, it is developed the “Quadruple Innovation Helix concept” (Carayannis and Campbell 2009), according to which, government, university, and industry should work effectively with civil society to support and promote innovation and entrepreneurship. The growing importance of knowledge as a production factor and as a determinant of innovation can be explained by the continuous accumulation of technical knowledge over time, and by the use of communications technologies that makes that knowledge available very rapidly on a worldwide scale (Foray 2000). It is therefore of interest to look at the productivity problems faced by enterprises when trying to carry out innovation.",19

Recent analyses carried out by leading consulting companies confirm the trend toward an urban world, as cities' contributions to the economy and global society—in terms of wealth creation and population concentration—has grown in the last 30 years (McKinsey Global Institute 2011; PWC 2005). The relevance of the phenomenon has therefore attracted the attention of researchers (mainly regional and industrial economists and urban planners) and practitioners, as well as public administrators, who have attempted not only to interpret explanatory factors and the path leading up to this phenomenon, but also to perceive/identify the social and economic effects of urban concentrations. This paper aims to analyze the urbanization phenomenon in the knowledge economy. The knowledge economy is connected to a greater reliance on intangible assets such as intellectual capabilities rather than on physical resources (Levitt 1976; Gershuny and Miles 1983). This change is reflected in the increasing share of intangible capital in the gross domestic product (Abramovitz and David 1996). The literature on knowledge economies focuses heavily on knowledge production and concentrates on some important topics: the role of knowledge as a source of innovation (Bell 1973; Romer 1990), the new features of knowledge-based firms and of their productive processes (Kochan and Barley 1999), and knowledge management and the valorization of knowledge transfer within organizations and between organizations (Drucker 1993; Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995). Furthermore, the knowledge economy also affects consumption patterns, because consumers are spending more and more on intangible goods or information goods and services—e.g., culture, entertainment, software, film, books, CDs, DVDs, etc. (that are knowledge-goods)—rather than only on tangible goods (Rifkin 2000; Powell and Snellman 2004). The percentage of intangible consumption tends to increase the wealthier people's income and/or levels of education. Due to the growth in production and consumption of intangible assets, several studies and statistical data have documented the current transition taking place in advanced nations from an economy based on physical assets and on industry to one based on services and intangible assets (80 % of GDP in the USA, 70 % in Italy) (see OECD 2011; ISTAT 2012). Moreover, the knowledge economy is also linked to the globalization of markets, driven—among other factors—by the diffusion of ICT in business management and social relations. In globalization and in the knowledge era, some cities become “global cities,” a place of intersection between the global and local in the sense that many cities worldwide have developed into transnational markets and have now more features in common with each other than with their regional or national contexts since global cities have similar structural characteristics (Sassen 1991). In light of these considerations, the work aims to answer the following research questions: Which are the developing and important cities in the current knowledge economy? What are the permutations in role and function of the city in the knowledge era? What are the key factors in the development of successful cities in the knowledge economy? The present study is based on the following hypotheses. A preliminary hypothesis is that the development of cities does not affect all urban centers but only those that have structural factors consistent with the features of the knowledge economy (i.e., the important role of intellectual capital in business processes and of intangible consumption). A second hypothesis is that city development is primarily driven by strategic choices and the localization of knowledge-based businesses. The competitiveness of these businesses—for which human factors present important competitive advantages—depends on the ability to attract “talents” that move to places where they can find a better quality of life. This paper aims to provide a conceptual framework to illustrate the key factors (education system and research, development of institutions providing services, and so on) useful to the development and success of the city; in this framework, we distinguish built-in assets and dictated factors.",13

However, there is more to it than evaluating work results. Social structure analysis is defined as characterizing patterns of connections among actors in networks of exchange relations (Blau (1964) in Yoon and Hyun (2010)). Cross et al. (2002) speak about “making invisible work visible” when assessing social networks capability to model social collaboration. Busch (2008) claims that the means for studying knowledge flows between individuals are limited. Social network analysis is one of these tools, linking quality of relationship with quality of the knowledge exchange. Martinez et al. (2003) have applied social network analysis to map classroom interactions. Social network analysis is recently quoted as a tool in organizational communication management. Ugai and Aoyama (2009) design a tool for visualizing communication barriers, treating employees as nodes and relationships as edges. By applying questionnaires at different moments, in time, they assessed the strengthening or weakening of cooperative relationships. The barriers were outlined (for instance, not knowing about the others’ work) and managerial action can be taken. Although not mentioned explicitly in their research, most of the relationship content is tacit. When workers leave the company, they take with them all the tacit knowledge accumulated in time. Professional workers rapidly evolve in scientific and technical fields, obtaining a lot of theoretical and practical knowledge, which is not contained and explained in the organization’s documents (Mandruleanu 2008). The motivation for using social networks analysis in knowledge management studies is that formal structures obviously do not reflect the way knowledge transfer processes actually take place (Chan and Leibowitz 2006). Again, these relationships, either strong or intermediate, as the quoted researchers categorize them, have a “black box” which is made of tacit knowledge. Busch and Richards (2004) have applied SNA to tacit knowledge transfers across the organization, and identified potential experts not being recognized as such, but who may serve the knowledge needs of the organization. Iandoli et al. (2010) take the investigation one step further and analyze cluster formation, between firms, as a result of knowledge needs. They link the strength of relationships with the ability to share tacit knowledge. There is, however, a drawback of strong relationships, as they may promote inertia and resistance to new relationships, as cliques are being formed. The challenge is, then, to determine the optimal strength of the ties, for transferring the needed amount of tacit knowledge. Bernini and Klobas (2008) discuss, as well, the risks of the communities of practice. They used, for evaluating communities of practice and their relationship with organizational commitment, two matrices: one for communication networks, and the other one for professional advice seeking networks (consultancy). Zhu et al. (2007) have already used a four-network model, including the knowing network, the communication network, the consultancy network and the knowledge network. However, we also consider that only the second and the third are relevant, as knowing what the other knows, but not communicating, is ineffective, while assessing how relevant consultancy is for your knowledge is not objective enough. The research of Bernini and Klobas (2008) lead to the conclusion that communities of practice and organizational commitment tend to be competing, as people tend to identify more with their community than with the organization as a whole, which is consistent with the patterns previously noted. Tacit knowledge is created through the interaction among individuals, and shared in social networks. According to, social networks analysis provides metrics for knowledge sharing effectiveness, building on a proved relationship between social capital and tacit knowledge sharing. Social network members both acquire and disseminate knowledge while consulting among them and asking for advice. Universities are often labeled as knowledge-intensive organizations (Alvesson 2004; Bratianu 2011; Greenwood 2009). Issues as inter-organizational learning (Bergh 2007), knowledge transfer (Agrawal 2001; Belenzon and Schankerman 2009; Hagen 2008; Howlett 2010), knowledge transformation (Aronowitz 2001; Enders 2005), knowledge sharing, and knowledge dynamics (Bratianu and Orzea 2010) are currently reviewed in literature. Tsoukas (2003) claims that tacit knowledge in universities cannot be captured, only displayed, through social interaction. Patterns of interaction should, then, be studied. Ozel (2012) discusses knowledge diffusion in the academia, based on a co-authorship network. Thus, knowledge sharing is based not on the subjective perception of the exchange actors, but on bibliographic records. The tacit dimension is, however, lost, as only explicit results of knowledge transfer are analyzed. Liao (2011) assessed the role of social capital in academic research performance. Social relationships are, thus, considered to be the main mechanism of tacit knowledge diffusion, which motivates our choice for social network analysis in assessing tacit knowledge flows in universities. Bozeman and Mangematin (2004) link social capital with research performance, in universities, because much of the skills needed are more social, than cognitive. Landry et al. (2002) discussed, as well, the possibility that social capital determines innovation. Starting from these premises, we consider social capital analysis to be a good indicator of research activity, in as much as its tacit dimension is considered. Tacit knowledge is knowledge residing in the skills and talents of individuals, without them being totally aware of it (Bratianu and Orzea 2010). It becomes transferrable through collaboration, in joint projects. Knowledge management, organizational learning, and social networks are inter-related concepts. The management of knowledge, implicitly collaborative, includes creation and sharing of knowledge, resulting from learning. Learning also involves decision-taking towards future actions, which may, as well, emerge from knowledge management. Social networks represent a clearly cut research area, intersecting organizational behavior, psychology, and communication. Each of us participates, at once, in a number of different social networks, making them a critical resource for team building, as well as for knowledge diffusion and maintenance within organizations. All these processes involve knowledge sharing. “Knowledge networks” are, thus, defined as a special case of social networks, whose links or arcs stay for knowledge flows among the participating nodes. According to Contractor (2000), if social networks illustrate “who knows who”, then knowledge networks illustrate “who knows what”. Jonassen and Land (2000, p. vi), state that knowledge resides in the “discourse among individuals, in the social relationships that bind them, the physical artifacts they use and produce, and the theories, models and methods they use to produce them.” The research methods in knowledge management should, then, be adapted to this new paradigm.",7

Does the economic structure affect the knowledge indicators in the Arab region? How important is the development of knowledge indicators in the Arab region? We examine three hypotheses: The first hypothesis argues that the knowledge economy exists in the Arab region but coincides with substantial knowledge gap compared to other world regions. This hypothesis implies that the Arab region has manifestly lagged far behind other world regions in terms of indicators related to knowledge economy. We examine the second hypothesis concerning the variation in knowledge indicators according to the structure of the economy in the Arab region. We examine the third hypothesis concerning the stagnation or slow development in the trend of the major knowledge indicators in the Arab region. We fill the gap in the Arab literature and present a more comprehensive analysis of the incidence and development of knowledge economy in the Arab region. Different from the conventional view in the literature and earlier studies in the Arab literature (Nour 2011) that use the conventional classification of countries according to income level, an interesting element in our analysis is that we use a different classification based on the structure of the economy to examine the knowledge economy in the Arab region. We believe that the selection of this criterion seems quite consistent with the well-known stylized facts and widely used standard classification of Arab countries according to their reliance on natural resources. The selection of this criterion seems sound since the knowledge economy are often linked to both the resources directly devoted to knowledge development and also to the whole economic structure that supports knowledge development. Moreover, we use recent and update data and provide a more updated study compared to few earlier studies on the knowledge economy in the Arab region (Nour 2011). We fill the gap in the Arab literature by explaining the relationship between knowledge economy and structure of the economy in the Arab region and the observed knowledge gap in the Arab region. Moreover, we support the efforts aim to enhance knowledge economy and institutions necessary for building knowledge economy in the Arab region. Moreover, we investigate the recent development of knowledge indicators and knowledge economy index in the Arab region compared to other world regions. Regarding research method, we use the descriptive and comparative methods of analysis. Similar to the studies in the literature, we define knowledge as decomposed of tacit knowledge and codified knowledge. We define tacit knowledge by the percentage share of high skilled people in total population, and we define tacit knowledge by tacit skills, which we define by both enrollment in tertiary education and the number of researchers or full-time equivalent researchers (FTER). We define codified knowledge by embodied knowledge distributed in many aspects including total spending on education and R&D. Codified knowledge is calculated as a total of the share of public spending on education and R&D spending as percentage of GDP. In addition, we use several variables and many other indicators in relation to the components of knowledge, such as the number of publications and scientific and technical journal articles, patents, and average schooling years across Arab countries. Moreover, we use other indicators such as knowledge index (KI) and knowledge economy index (KEI). The rest of this paper is organized as follows: “Conceptual Framework and Literature Review” presents the conceptual framework and literature review. “General Socioeconomic Characteristics of the Arab Region” shows the general socioeconomic characteristics of Arab region. “The Existence of Knowledge Economy and Development of Knowledge-Related Indicators in the Arab Region” discusses the existence of knowledge economy in the Arab region compared to the other world regions. “Knowledge Index and the Knowledge Economy Index” explains the major development in knowledge economy over the period (1995–2012) in the Arab region. Finally, “Conclusions” provides the conclusions and policy recommendations.",9

Political history, historical continuity and discontinuity in national democratic forms, established notions of social protection and modalities of social “welfare”, with their associated notions of social citizenship, all constitute and subsequently define methodologies with which we may measure the relationship between the citizen and the public administration in a national and, subsequently, supra-national territory. In Greece, the conflict between society (Gesellschaft) and juridical order (Verfassung) has involved a regime since World War II (WWII) which is exceptionally undemocratic, embedded within a quasi-military apparatus of “administrative provision”, operating as real welfare only for those who are “politically correct” (Tsobanoglou 1993, 2001). Welfare (political and social inclusion measures, particularly for employment and social security) meant the right of entry to employment in the state nomenclature. This became the main field in which social protection was provided, through salaried employment which afforded generalised protection including clearly defined pension rights and regularity in work life.",3

Social capital accumulates through networking, i.e. alliances of voluntary cooperation wherein entrepreneurs exchange information and resources that are vital for the operation of their business (Ahuja 2000; Chell and Baines 2000). Networks are thus acknowledged as critical for the successful management of small- and medium-sized businesses (Araujo and Easton 1996; Ahuja 2000; Gulati et al. 2000; Holmen et al. 2007). Nonetheless, defining networking and demonstrating its presence are difficult tasks. As Chell and Baines (2000, p. 195) argue, ‘… to establish any association between networking activity by owner–managers and the performance of their businesses is […] contestable….’ Research findings are contradictory and although there are empirical studies, which tend to support a positive statistical relationship between businesses performance and networking activity (Ostgaard and Birley 1996; Lechner and Dowling 2003; Ahuja et al. 2008), the opposite is also true (De Propris and Wei 2007). These contrasting findings might be attributed to the multiple facets of network alliances that entail both benefits and hazards (Gulati et al. 2000). Gulati et al. (2000) introduce a strategic networks approach to analyse the conduct and performance of firms under the contention that ‘… a firm’s network of relationships is a source of both opportunities and constraints’. Within this framework positive as well as negative network effects on the conduct and profitability of firms ought to be expected. Here, we examine the relationship between networks and the performance of firms under the assumption that both positive and negative effects might be at play. Furthermore, we introduce each firm’s productive efficiency as a means of measuring business performance, a measure that is indicative of industry structure and the positioning of firms within an industry. Productive efficiency is composed of technical and scale efficiency and illustrates entrepreneurial ability with regard to two important decisions that is the combination of available resources and the scale of resources to be deployed (Jovanovich 1982; Audretsch 1997). Empirical research refers to tourism enterprises in the urban centre of Patras, Greece. Cross-sectional data are used referring to hotels, restaurants and tourism agents. The applied methodology involves a two-stage Data Envelopment Analysis model based on which a non-parametric production function is estimated in order to measure each firm’s technical and scale efficiency level, at the first stage, while at the second stage, various Tobit models are estimated in order to identify the role of networks as determinants of differential levels of technical and scale efficiency. Results provide support to the hypothesis that there is a largely positive association between networking activity and the productive efficiency levels of firms. However, there are important differences as regards the effect of networking upon an entrepreneur’s decision regarding how to combine available resources (technical efficiency level) and on his/her decision regarding the scale of resources to be employed (scale efficiency level). The paper is organised as follows: Following the introductory section, ‘Social capital and networks’ briefly reviews the literature concerning networks and the creation of social capital. ‘Empirical model’ describes the empirical model used for the measurement of productive efficiency and for the analysis of the factors affecting its level. ‘Study area and data’ presents the study area and the data used. ‘Results’ presents the results, and ‘Discussion and conclusion’ concludes with a discussion of the main findings and conclusions.",6

Networks have been on the socio-scientific research agenda for a long time, and the lion’s share of this research has focused on questions such as why networks exist, how they emerge, and what characterises successful innovative networks. Small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) networks have typically been conceived as the result of unanticipated and unplanned coordination between firms with complementary resources and mutual objectives. As Porter (1990, p. 151) puts it: ‘Interconnections (…) often unanticipated, lead to entirely new opportunities. People and ideas combine in new ways’. Another debate in the network literature revolves around the question of whether networks might be developed through planned intervention from the outside or not. Several scholars (e.g. Swan et al. 2002; Wenger et al. 2002) argue that network systems cannot be created directly from the outside, but that it is possible to support their emergence and development. However, ‘The idea of directly creating institutional structures or innovation-inducing networks without taking historically formed specific conditions into account, may be an important reason for the failure of many attempts to deliberately create regional innovation systems’ (Miettinen 2002, p. 97). Moreover, inside–out development seems to be important to achieve organic growth and internal legitimacy in networks (Human and Provan 2000). Hence, it is a challenge to identify relationship-building methods that can be facilitated from the outside in utilising the participant’s historical knowledge and building the network from the inside. A network is not a static phenomenon and its development may undergo different stages. A network’s lifecycle consists, according to Menzel and Fornahl (2009), of the four stages of emergence, growth, sustainment, and decline. Since the mid-1990s, a few action research projects have been conducted with the purpose of facilitating the development of learning-oriented networks by using dialog-based methods (e.g. Ennals and Gustavsen 1999; Gausdal 2008; Qvale 2008). These methods are developed as hybrid forms of the original search and dialog conferences (Emery and Emery 1974; Gustavsen 1992). Although these studies have offered valuable knowledge about researcher-facilitated network development, they constitute a small amount of studies. As pointed out above, the overwhelming majority of studies on networks direct primary attention to the properties of existing SME networks, disregarding the question of whether and how to facilitate the creation of new ones. Moreover, there is a need for more longitudinal, qualitative, process-oriented, and outcome-oriented research on networks (Hoang and Antoncic 2003). This paper aims to fill these gaps by asking the following research question: In what way is Network IGP a method for developing innovative SME networks? To answer this question, a longitudinal action-oriented research project to develop a network of water cleansing SMEs has been conducted. The network, CWN (Clean Water Norway), was initiated in 2007. During the emergence stage, especially, Network IGP interventions have been used systematically to build the network from the inside, to build trust-based relationships and to facilitate learning processes between the firms. In the spring of 2013, CWN can be characterised as an innovative network with three active teams, joint technological development projects and increasing interaction and collaboration among its members. The paper is organised according to the following structure: First, a conceptualising of the problem and a presentation of the selected case. Second, a discussion of the selection of methods for developing the network and a description of Network IGP. Third, the research methods, the findings, and finally, the discussion and the concluding remarks.",9

The term service innovation has been used in the literature to describe both the new or improved services as well as the process that generates new service products using new knowledge, processes, and technologies (Porter 1990). Successful new services also need a well-designed and a carefully coordinated process in order to be developed (de Brentani 1993; Edgett 1994; Edvardsson et al. 1995). Much of the research into the development of new services has shown that the service innovation process involves the stages carried out from the moment an idea about a new service is generated, up to its launch in the market (Alam 2006; Avlonitis et al. 2001; Johne and Storey 1998). Corporate entrepreneurship, on the other hand, focuses on newness, as the primary catalyst for innovation, generating wealth creation by offering new products, developing new processes, or expanding into new markets (e.g. Ireland et al. 2003; Smith and Di Gregorio 2002; McFadzean et al. 2005). Johnson (2001) argues that corporate entrepreneurship converts ideas into products or services and then builds a venture to take the outcome to the market. Contrarily, Shane and Venkataraman (2000) support the opinion that the groundwork for wealth creation through entrepreneurship comes by discovering and utilising profitable opportunities. However, Churchill (1992) combines the two viewpoints stating that entrepreneurship creates value through innovation and seizes business opportunities. Likewise, Blumentritt et al. (2005), whose study concentrates on how entrepreneurs develop internal cultures that may inspire and impel innovation, argue that continuous innovation requires organisational systems and procedures that are embedded, so as to ensure growth. From an entrepreneurial point of view, Simmons et al. (2009) state that corporate entrepreneurship creates value through innovation, seizing business opportunities. Similarly, Johnson (2001), who conducted research on entrepreneurship and innovation, contends that entrepreneurship is the conversion of ideas into marketable products or services. Therefore, as Dubina et al. (2012) points out, economic growth boosts innovation through investments that drive creativity and novelty. However, this might create challenges for established structures, leading to a need for developing new structures. On the other hand, little research has been conducted about new service development in the health service industry, with only a select number of notable works available emphasizing on the involvement of customers: Duncan and Breslin 2009; Windrum and Garcia-Coni 2008; Bowers 1987. Especially in the highly competitive health-care market, corporations need to develop successful new outcomes that meet the needs of the customers. The patient–clinician relationship has been recognized as being a key aspect in whether service users experience and react on their treatment (Ong et al. 1995). Elsewhere, the study by Nambisan (2002, p. 394) argues that in many different markets and situations, customers are an excellent source of innovation (a view supported by Veryzer and de Mozota (2005)). Tobin et al. (2002, p. 93) also stress the importance of communication and building a relationship with patients, stating: “the opportunities for consumer participation occur first at this clinical interface in terms of what information is transferred, in what direction, and in how the communication takes place. Nurturing participation at this level has a fundamental role in consumer empowerment.” Despite the importance of both entrepreneurship and customer orientation in the health-care market, little has been written on either subject. Little has been written about how new health services are developed and to what extent should patients be involved in the development process. What is more, no in depth research has been made about how health-care organisations choose to exploit the entrepreneurial opportunities that emerge from the development of patient-oriented services. The focus of the present study is, therefore, to investigate the influence of service user involvement on new service development and how the outcome can enhance a firm's entrepreneurial activity. On the one hand, the aim of this study is to advance previous service innovation theory by associating with the entrepreneurship theory, whilst on the other, seeks to extend previous knowledge regarding the benefits of customer participation in new health service development. This paper is pioneering as it adopts propositions that arise from the review of the literature and develops a framework that can be used to identify, firstly, how and to what extent should patients participate in their therapy in order the firm to develop new services that satisfy their needs profitably. Secondly, to investigate how these new services could be the competitive advantage of the company to further expansion, investing and establishing new mental health hospitals in other geographic regions. This framework represents a step forward in innovation and entrepreneurship research as it provides a new insight into the identification of entrepreneurial opportunities through customer-oriented new service development in a more integrated and systematic way than has been implemented in the past.",5

Asongu,Voxi Amavilah,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The importance of a knowledge economy (KE) has emerged as a key theme in the late 1990s as OECD and World Bank reports illustrate (OECD 2002; The World Bank 2007; Peters 2008; Weber 2011). It is now well established that technological knowledge and innovation are long-run drivers of economic growth (Lerner 2009). Already following the example set by Japan, the governments of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and China are moving rapidly towards “knowledge-based” economies from “product-based” economies (Chandra and Yokoyama 2011). This is happening because knowledge creation and diffusion processes depend on appropriate governance policies that are themselves outcomes of good governance—a self-reinforcing and endogenous process. To determine the relevance of the Asian experience to other developing and emerging economies, and the current excitement with the KE, it is important to identify the institutional factors that promote the creation and diffusion of knowledge, and to ensure that economies not at the technological frontier have access to new technologies developed by technology leaders. Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) and Sub-Saharan African (SSA) states have remained feeble, and according to their governance indicators as measures of institutional performance have similarly fared poorly in the last 10 years or so. The effect of this poor institutional performance on the development, and the main components of the knowledge society, of these nations, while not a secret (UNDP 2009), has not been quantified as far as we are aware. With respect to the MENA region, we know from a World Bank report that these nations were not investing in key areas that are fundamental to KEs, and specifically that “to date, related investments in education, information infrastructure, research and development (R&D), and innovation have been insufficient or inappropriate in most MENA countries. Moreover, inadequate economic and institutional frameworks prevent these investments from yielding desired results” (Aubert and Reiffers 2003, p. 1). Similarly, Aubert (2005) shows that SSA countries in general have not done well in this regard either, mainly because of the weak linkages between institutions and appropriate technologies that are capable of fostering both foreign and domestic investment. These arguments are not hard to understand; the institutional framework is crucial for gaining an adequate flow of knowledge between scientific research and technological applications, as well as for a good information flow between knowledge users and researchers. Governments play a key role; the creation of knowledge cannot be left to imperfect market mechanisms. Good governance is critical to attracting foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows and to motivating domestic investment, both of which contribute to the development of the infrastructure of a KEFootnote 1. Along the strong interest in the KE themselves has come growing emphases on Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs), and hence the acknowledgement that the enforcements of IPR laws (treaties) by governments have a critical bearing on how developing economies are tilting towards KEs. Based on the situation, the prime objective of this paper is to assess the instrumentality of IPR laws (treaties) in various KE dimensions through good governance channelsFootnote 2. In other words, the paper examines how government enforcement of IPR laws is affecting the progress of 22 SSA and MENA countries towards KEs. The examination is important because while much emphasis in the literature have gone to developed and emerging economies of Latin America and East Asia, there has been little scholarly attention paid to the SSA-MENA region. This paper is a modest attempt to fill some of that information gap. We rationalize this focus with the fact that one of the key pillars of the KE is a favorable institutional framework. The importance of this pillar has been covered in the literature on good governance and the knowledge-based economic development in Latin America (Dahlan 2007) and in East Asia (Chandra and Yokoyama 2011). From the coverage, a positive relationship between good governance and the creation of KE is discernible. Except in ChinaFootnote 3, formal institutions have played an important role in attracting FDI, and thereby helped in developing the knowledge-based economic infrastructures necessary for the KEs. Unfortunately, this same literature is not as clear for the SSA and MENA region. The few papers that have focused on the KE of this region have been limited to the impact of knowledge on economic growth using cross-sectional data (Chavula 2010). While such a nexus is important, the current debate has centered around how and whether SSA and MENA countries can replicate the “East Asian miracle.” Thus, integrating IPRs and governance structures into the equation is badly needed to provide an updated account of the debate regarding the SSA-MENA countries. This paper contributes to existing literature in six different ways. Firstly, unlike previous research, it incorporates all dimensions of government quality in its analysis, and hence it provides an exhaustive assessment of six institutional quality indicators. Secondly, the paper puts an investigating lens on the SSA-MENA region. A great chunk of research on the KE focuses on developed and emerging economies of Latin America and East Asia, unfortunately leaving behind only scanty evidence of the nexus in SSA and MENA countries. Thirdly, in contrast to the mainstream approach which is premised mostly on one or two dimensions of the KE, this paper employs all of the four components in the World Bank’s Knowledge Economy Index: economic incentive, innovation, education, and information infrastructure. Fourthly, the significant trends in the KE development witnessed worldwide over the last decade have brought to clear light the growing relevance of IPR treaties, and therefore assessing how the enforcement of these laws affects various dimensions of KE via good governance in developing countries could provide the needed guidance to policy makers. Fifthly, while some aspects of KE might have been investigated before good governance indicators for developing countries were available, this paper uses recent data to update the account of the nexus, and it does so with focused policy implications. Sixthly, one motivation of this work is the ongoing debate on the “East Asian miracle,” which has been either based on concepts like “soft authoritarian character” and/or “governing the market.” Such a debate is premised on certain political and economic conditions that were somehow judged propitious for development. However, some other evidence suggests to the contrary that the “East Asian miracle” could have been caused instead by low enforcement of IPR regimes at the early stages of these nations’ development, e.g., gains from trade distortions like undervalued rates of currency exchange and even innovation copying (imitations), in addition to the accumulation of human and physical capital (Bezmen and Depken 2004). Still other evidence Lucas argues that there was not anything miraculous about the East Asian miracle (1988, 1993). Hence, examining this debate in the context of SSA and MENA countries could result in relevant policy and further research recommendations. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. “Theory and Empirical Evidence” reviews the relevant theory and its empirical evidence. Data and methodology issues are discussed in “Data and Methodology”. “Empirical Analysis” presents and discusses the empirical results, while “Conclusion” concludes the paper.",142

Thus, highly developed Western economies are characterized by large investments in physical capital, large-scale production, and by the identification of increased productivity in large firms. In the 1980s and at the beginning of a globalized economy, the concentration of natural capital into high-cost countries proved to be an economically non-sustainable option, and gradually, it led to the search for new, inexpensive cost regions—countries with significant job losses in developed economies of the West. The comparative advantage of developed Western economies moves in this new economic environment from an economy of “physical capital” to an economy of “knowledge capital.” In the modern economic environment, the role of small firms is almost nonexistent since the high accumulation of physical capital and knowledge capital (innovation) is identified only by large companies. However, the so-called European Paradox (originally known as Swedish Paradox), i.e., high investments in knowledge, human capital, research and development (R & D) with unpredictable results in terms of growth and employment, and the search for a solution through a reformulation of the basic (linear) innovation model, led to new and in many cases non-expected results as regards the role of small firms in knowledge and innovation and in the reconsideration, in general, of the importance of entrepreneurship for the increase in employment and economic growth (Acs and Audretsch 1988, 1990). During the past two decades, a series of empirical studies in America and Europe, which analyze the main sources of knowledge creation, and knowledge diffusion mechanisms show that the stock of knowledge economy can contribute positively to the growth rate of economic growth, only if there are sufficient mechanisms for disseminating this knowledge and innovation throughout the production system. Under the new theory of Business Knowledge Society (Audretsch 2009), entrepreneurship is one of the key mechanisms of transfers in the process of diffusion of knowledge. In other words, entrepreneurship is a key driver of endogenous growth, or else, it represents the link between capital stock of knowledge and technological opportunities since it turns the stock of knowledge into economic knowledge (the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship). The importance of fostering innovation, knowledge capital, and venture capital as a key growth driver of modern economies is now commonly accepted, not only theoretically but also in policy. A series of institutional, economic, and social regulations and policies, both at EU level and at national level, have a key development goal for the creation of the modern knowledge economy. The role of innovation and knowledge as regards the effectiveness and competitiveness of modern production systems proves to be more and more important, explaining a large proportion of differences in growth rates worldwide. In Greece, despite the recognition of the role of innovation, knowledge and entrepreneurship as key drivers of growth are marked by the lack of systematic recording and measuring their impact on modern production process. Measuring quantitatively and qualitatively the impact of these important parameters in terms of economic growth and productivity in interregional, intersectoral level, is a prerequisite for the necessary institutional interventions and formulation of policies tailored to the specific requirements and conditions of the Greek economy. Furthermore, it is a prerequisite for assessing and evaluating a range of existing support measures for SMEs, the new knowledge-intensive businesses and investment in innovation, research, and development and enhancing human capital. In this paper, the key question to be addressed is “Does the model of the Enterprise Knowledge Society holds in Greece,” i.e., “How do the stocks of physical capital and labor, human capital, knowledge capital, and business capital affect production in each region?” The significance of the results of this paper is twofold. At the research level, the study is particularly important in order to model and empirically investigate a contemporary model of economic development which will involve the analysis of the relationship between output and the stock of physical capital and labor, human capital, knowledge capital, and business capital in each region. On the other hand, the results of the paper are of particular importance for policy makers who seek to enhance the level of economic development and increase competitiveness and therefore the wealth of each region of the country. Finally, the realization of the analysis at the sectoral level will allow conclusions concerning the development and the role of individual sectors. The next section of the paper provides a theoretical and empirical discussion, while “Data and Methodology” describes the data and the methodology. “Empirical Results” presents the empirical results and finally, “Conclusions” provides some concluding remarks.",7

Studies related to FDI have contributed towards understanding of the economic process and the behaviour of economic agents, both at micro and macro level (Vu and Noy 2009). This has led to the opening of new areas of studies in economic theory (Denisia 2010). In the last two decades, international investment worldwide has become a distinctive component of development strategy. It has not only contributed to the strong economic growth in the developed and developing countries but has also provided a medium for their integration into the global economy. In the developing countries, considerable attraction of foreign capital as the means for their economic growth provides benefits to the recipient countries (Crespo and Fontuura 2007; Sidhu and Dhingra 2009). The rapidly changing investment environment has given required landscape which provides new opportunities for foreign investment. This has proven to be of immense benefit in providing the developing countries with an important source of productive capacities. Developing countries and their economies in transition are now primary FDI destinations, and their importance as FDI recipients continues to increase. According to United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) World Investment Report 2011, Asian countries currently receive maximum FDI globally and East Asian countries particularly China are the major contributories to the overall regional FDI inflows. FDI inflows to South, East and South-East Asian countries have picked up markedly, outperforming other developing regions. Recently, various issues related to foreign direct investments are being paid more attention, both at regional and international level. Numerous theoretical papers have examined foreign direct investments issues, while significant research on the motivations underlying FDI was reported by Dunning (1977, 2001, 2009) and Vernon (1977, 1991, 1998). Economists believe that FDI is an important element of a country’s economic development, especially the one which is developing. It has thus becomes one of the essential areas of research in International Business. This study is an attempt to investigate the linkage of FDI inflows between India and four other economies, viz. China, Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia. The study investigates the existence of a long run relationship between FDI inflows among different countries sharing a common region, and whether FDI inflows of a country are affected by the FDI inflows of other countries. This hypothesis has been examined by the co-integration technique, and to investigate this five emerging Asian countries receiving highest amount of FDI inflows have been selected.",5
6.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,14 March 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-013-0178-z,"The Overuse of Cesarean Section: Medical, Legal, Research, and Economical Pitfalls",December 2015,Naira R. Matevosyan,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Cesarean section (CS) has been part of human culture from the ancient times. Since CS is introduced in clinical obstetrics as a life or lives-saving procedure, its global use follows the health-care inequity pattern: underused in low income settings, and unnecessary use in middle- and high-income settings (Althabe et al. 2006; Betran et al. 2007a, b; Ronsmans et al. 2006). In its full intricacy, CS has no advantage over emergency CS in terms of neonatal mortality. Neonatal morbidities are lower after elective CS than emergency CS only with the term births (De Luca et al. 2009). Some authors suggest, that more than 50 % of the elective CS are applied at <39 weeks, thus jeopardizing neonatal outcome (Wilmink et al. 2010). Infants born by elective CS at term after uneventful pregnancy are at increased risk for developing respiratory disorders compared with those born by vaginal delivery (Zanardo et al. 2004). Potentially increased risks of neonatal mortality with elective CS at term may be counterbalanced by the risks for fetal demise in ongoing pregnancies. Patients and physicians considering planned CS should review competing risks and benefits (Signore and Klebanoff 2008). Neonates to elective CS mothers show poorer adaptation skills. Mean umbilical plasma concentrations of thyroxine and triiodothyronine are significantly higher, and cortisol concentration are lower after elective CS compared with the emergency CS and vaginal delivery groups. Mean umbilical plasma thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration is significantly lower after vaginal delivery compared with elective CS. Thus, the labor reduces plasma thyroid hormone concentrations at birth in association with a rise in cortisol. These adaptations may be the stimulus for the subsequent surge in triiodothyronine to occur over the first few hours after birth in vaginally delivered infants (Bird et al. 1996). Compared with planned vaginal deliveries, planned CS increases transfer rates to the neonatal intensive care unit from 5.2 to 9.8 % (P < 0.001). The risk for pulmonary disorders (transient tachypnoea of the newborn and respiratory distress syndrome) rise from 0.8 to 1.6 % (P = 0.01). Yet, there are no significant differences in the risks for low Apgar score and neurologic symptoms (Kolas et al. 2006). When comparing neonatal outcomes in both modes of CS, we have to consider that women undergoing CS already have increased risk of severe maternal morbidity compared with women undergoing vaginal delivery (OR, 2.0; CI, 1.6–2.5) for intrapartum CS and elective CS (OR, 2.3; CI, 1.7–3.1) (Howard Minkoff and Chervenak 2003). With cephalic presentation, there is a trend towards a reduced odds ratio for fetal death with elective CS, after adjustment for possible confounding variables and gestational age. Inevitably, fatal or life-threatening postoperative outcomes occur when contraindications to CS are present and poorly recognized. Rarely indeed, it becomes necessary for the competent obstetrician to set aside these considerations. Most of the exceptions to this statement are based on an undue regard for the interest of the child as opposed to the interests of the mother. A guiding principle is “what is best for the fetus is what is best for the mother.” If the mother is medically unstable and the fetus is nonviable, then the maternal condition should be stabilized regardless of the fetal consideration. If the fetus is viable by gestation age, then the maternal condition should also be stabilized and delivery considered only for the obstetric indications. The exception to this dictum is perimortem CS. The decision of the obstetrician as to the choice and timing of any intervention must involve consideration of the risks of the potential techniques, skills of the surgeon, capacity and resources of the clinical setting, and the urgency of the need to expedite the birth process. In some cases, CS is performed because the obstetrician lacks in skills in surgical alternatives of vaginal birth, technically upscale than CS, such as the manual rotation of fetus, application of the obstetrical forceps, vacuum-assisted extraction, or symphysiotomy (Matevosyan 2013). The unsettled research forum around CS includes prospective randomized trials designed to compare the outcomes (NIH 2010; Johanson and Menon 2003; Johanson et al. 1999). These trials do not use the same inclusion criteria, the same instruments, or the same outcome measures, making the comparisons quite challenging. Whereas, neonatal and maternal mortality rates related to spontaneous vaginal birth, vacuum, forceps, or CS are mostly reviewed in retrospective studies (Johanson et al. 1993; Sachs et al. 1987; Frigoletto et al. 1980; Atrash et al. 1987; Lubchenco et al. 1972). None of the prospective or retrospective case–control studies discuss specifics of the technique used for vacuum or forceps procedures, the time required, or the criteria for abandonment of the procedure. Concerns over liability risk have a major impact on the willingness of physicians and health-care institutions to offer trial of labor (TOL). These concerns derive from the perception that catastrophic events associated with TOL could lead to compensable claims with large verdicts or settlements for fetal/maternal injury—regardless of the adequacy of informed consent. Clearly, these medical malpractice issues affect practice patterns among health-care providers and they play a role in the genesis of the “immediately available” guideline (Murphy et al. 2012). Studies have attempted to model the impact of tort reform on primary and repeat CS rates and have shown that modest improvements in the medical–legal climate may result in reductions in CS. It is concluded that both caps on noneconomic damages and reductions in physician malpractice premiums would result in fewer CS (NIH 2010). Many health-care providers incorrectly assume that performing CS helps avoiding malpractice litigation. Refusal by a woman to undergo CS is seen as a challenge to medical authority that may be overruled by legal orders supporting the practice of medicine and further legitimating medical knowledge (Krauss 1991). Nevertheless, performance of CS offers no protection against allegations of malpractice if a less-than-perfect infant is born. The plaintiff's legal team may shift to other issues, such as the CS not being performed sooner, or a perceived lack of antenatal testing or prenatal care (Dickens and Cook 2003). Legal grounds for coerced obstetrical interventions vary in the USA, Canada, and the UK (Thampapillai 2005). In Britain, a competent adult has the right to refuse treatment. Surgery without consent is an assault or battery in English law (RCOG 2006). Axiomatic to the patient's right to consent to treatment is the right to refuse treatment. Pursuant to the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists regulations, doctors, however, have to be satisfied that at the time of the refusal (a) the patient's decisive capacity has not been diminished by illness or medication, or given on the basis of false assumptions or misinformation; (b) the patient's will has not been unduly influenced by another person; and (c) any refusal has been directed to the relevant situation. The advanced directives in British law are controlled by the Mental Capacity Act 2005 §§4, 26, 37, Mental Health Act 1983, The Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000, and other instruments (ACOG 2005). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists strongly opposes the criminal prosecution of pregnant women whose activities may appear to cause harm to their fetuses Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (2006). The American Medical Association Board of Trustees recommends that: “(1) judicial intervention is inappropriate if the woman has made an informed refusal of a treatment; (2) the physician should not be liable for honoring woman's informed refusal of treatment; (3) criminal sanctions for harmful antenatal behavior are not appropriate; and (4) pregnant substance abusers should undergo rehabilitative treatment” (AMA 1990). Recognition that fetus has legitimate interests, rather than rights, is common and opens a way to balancing various competing interests without compromising patients' rights to decide on their medical care. Courts of law generally favor this approach, and tend to allow few limits on women's choice of indicated medical care while pregnant (Dickens and Cook 2003). In Canada, fetal rights are not judicially recognized and any claim against a woman's body on behalf of a fetus would have to be base on the power of the state. Pursuant to Chapter 30 of the Royal Commission of New Reproductive Technologies at the Society of Obstetrician and Gynecologists of Canada, “medical treatment never be imposed upon a pregnant woman against her wishes, and the conduct of a pregnant woman in relation to her fetus not be criminalized” (Martin and Coleman 1995). Another legislative difference is that in Canada, the attempts to mandate the medical treatment of pregnant women are treated under child protection legislation, whereas in the USA coerced medical treatment is usually effected by court orders (Matevosyan 2012a, b). Accurate documentation of the operative procedure can prevent confusions, complications, and litigations. In particular, the surgeon should take meticulous care in describing the uterine incision. For example, “repeat low-transverse cesarean delivery” can be ambiguous to some. It could mean that (1) the prior incision was a classical or low vertical, and the current procedure was a “repeat” cesarean performed via a low-transverse incision, or (2) the previous operation was a low-transverse incision and the same procedure was used in the current procedure. In the first example, the patient should never undergo TOL after CS (TOLAC), while in the second, she is a TOLAC candidate. A better description of the procedure would be “Low-transverse uterine incision: Repeat cesarean delivery.” It is crucial to properly document the extent of active uterine segment involved in a low-vertical incision, the extent of an inverted “T” incision, and the nature of any uterine lacerations. The dictation should also contain a brief description of the ovaries, tubes, and surrounding structures. Several studies have shown an inverse association between CS rates and maternal/infant mortality at population level in low-income countries, where large sectors of population lack access to basic obstetric care (Betran et al. 2007a, b; Althabe et al. 2006). On the other hand, CS rates above a certain limit have not shown additional benefit for mother and child (Belizan et al. 2007; Hall and Bewley 1999). The WHO states: “There is no justification for any region to have CS rates higher than 10–15 %” (WHO 1985, 2005). Approximately 18.5 million CS are performed yearly worldwide. About 40 % of the countries have CS rates below 10 %, about 10 % have CS rates between 10 and 15 %, and approximately 50 % have CS rates above 15 % (Gibbons et al. 2010). Every year, in the world, there is an additional need for 0.8–3.2 million CS in low-income countries where 60 % of the world's births occur. Simultaneously, 4.0–6.2 million CS in excess are performed in middle- and high-income countries where 37.5 % of the births occur. The maternal mortality rate for elective repeat CS against the TOL is 13.4 per 100,000 births (Adam et al. 2003). From a population-based approach, those CS in excess are likely to be medically unjustified. This study aims to (1) estimate the use as overuse of indicated and elective CS in countries with reported lower and higher rates of CS and (2) understand the resource-use implications of the indicated and elective CS in countries with lower and higher rates of CS. In order to run an accurate cost analysis, this report follows the WHO definitions of perinatal, maternal, neonatal mortality, as well as the indications and contraindications for CS summarized via numbers of published sources: 
Neonatal mortality rate is the number of neonatal deaths per 1,000 live births in a specific geographical area per calendar year. Neonatal death is defined as the death during the first 27 days of life. Neonatal mortality rate is often stratified for early and late mortality rates. Early neonatal mortality rate is the number of deaths of 0- to 6-day-old neonates times 1,000 divided by the total number of live births. Late neonatal mortality rate is the number of deaths of 7- to 27-day-old neonates times 1,000 divided by the total number of live births. Corrected neonatal mortality rate is the neonatal mortality rate excluding deaths due to congenital malformations. 
Maternal mortality rate is the annual number of female deaths per 100,000 live births from any cause related to or aggravated by pregnancy or its management (excluding accidental or incidental causes). 
Perinatal mortality rate is the sum of the number of residential fetal deaths of 22 gestational weeks (stillbirths) plus the number of resident newborns dying under 7 days of age in a specified geographic area (country, state, and county) divided by the sum of the number of resident live births for the same geographic area (for a calendar year) and multiplied by 1,000. An example: if we have 700 registered fetal deaths of 22 or more weeks gestation, 300 newborn deaths under 7 days of age, and 150,000 live births in a calendar year among the X county state residents, PMR will be equal to (700 + 300)/(150,000 + 700)] × 1,000 = 6.6. Indications for CS may be divided into absolute and relative. 
Absolute are those indicators the presence of which requires the undisputed performance of C section. These are five pathological conditions that exclude the vaginal delivery: Anatomically narrow pelvis (the III and IV degree narrowing, when the true obstetrical conjugate is 7.5–8.0 cm or less) The deformed pelvis with a sharply reduced size due to fractures, exostosis, or pelvic bone tumors (osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and Ewing's sarcoma) Obstructed pelvis (urinary bladder stones, uterine fibroids, and ovarian tumors blocking the small pelvis) Expressed cicatricial stenosis of the cervix and vagina Complete placenta praevia. 
Relative indications are those pathological conditions where C section is the method of choice. These are grouped as maternal indications, fetal indications, and dual indications (Matevosyan 2013). 
Indications for C section are deemed necessary for fetus (fetal indications): Malpresentations: breech, brow, face, mentum posterior, transverse lie Fetal distress (category III fetal heart rate tracing) Maternal active genital herpes and HIV Premature or small for gestational age fetus weighting 1,500 g or less Prolapsed, pinched, or compressed umbilical cord Rhesus conflict Twins, triplets, or multiple Vasa praevia 
Indications for C section deemed necessary for mother (maternal indications): Myopia and glaucoma Cerebral vascular malformations (aneurysm); cranial trauma Congestive heart failure Thrombocytopenia Amniotic fluid embolism Intramural and subserous uterine fibroids Carcinoma of cervix, vagina, rectum, and urinary bladder Obstructive tumors Contracted pelvis (congenital, fracture) Inadequate uterine scar(s) after C section, uterine plastic-reconstructive surgeries, and myomectomy Bicornuate uterus Reconstructive vaginal surgery. 
Indications for C section deemed necessary for both, mother and fetus (dual indications): Partial placenta praevia in the presence of bleeding Premature detachment of normally situated placenta in the absence of conditions for the immediate vaginal delivery Prolonged labor or failure to progress—cervical dystocia (30 % of C sections), arrest of descent, arrest of dilation. Failed labor induction or augmentation Failed obstetrical forceps and vacuum extraction, when the living and viable fetus Transverse and oblique sustained fetal position History of transverse lie Collision in twin pregnancy Conjoint twins Multiple births Abdominal pregnancy Fibroids of the isthmian and cervical locations Clinically narrow pelvis (size discrepancy between maternal pelvis and fetal skull; android pelvis, anthropoid pelvis) Macrosomia (fetus weighting more than 4,000 g) Threatening uterine rupture Uterine rupture History of uterine rupture History of placenta accreta Preeclampsia, eclampsia Hypertension Varicose veins of the vagina and external genitalia Primipara aged 35 and over Perimortem The state of maternal agony or death when the living and viable fetus (posthumous birth) Iatrogenic causes (lack of obstetrical skills, inappropriate use of technology for the assisted vaginal delivery) Maternal choice and consent for elective CS. All contradictions to CS are relative and rare. They, however, exist (Matevosyan 2013): Elective (planned) CS cannot be performed before the 37th week of gestation with uneventful pregnancy and with the absence of maternal and fetal indications When both intratracheal and epidural anesthesias are contraindicated Trophoblastic disease, choriocarcinoma, and hydatiform mole. In addition, emergency CS must be the last choice after 12 h following the rupture of the amniotic sac, with evident laboratory signs of the ascending infection and chorionamnionitis. The better alternatives include: labor augmentation in the first phase, tocolysis and medicamental arrest of the second phase, and vaginal delivery with obstetrical forceps (under general anesthesia) or assisted vacuum extraction (without general anesthesia). Forceps are contraindicated in breech presentation, in cephalic presentation when the vertex to occiput is above +2, and in perimortem. In dead and mature fetus craniotomia, brain evacuation, decompression, and extraction are preferred. In transverse presentation, when CS is contraindicated, the labor is concluded with internal fetal version and breech extraction.",1

On the other hand, economic growth implies some mechanisms which lead to the increase of energy use. The relationship between energy and economic growth has been debated by several empirical works, namely those which were interested to explain the structural breaks of their relative series. Generally, the common sources of structural breaks are exogenous shocks, such as international conflicts, changes in global oil production, changes in the oil price at the pump, or regime changes in economic events, such as changes in energy policy (variations in domestic oil price, oil subsidies and oil production, and energy conservation strategy) and development modes. Empirical studies on the relationship between economic growth and energy consumption have led to widely varying results. The results can be presented as follows: causality from energy consumption to gross domestic product (GDP), so energy is seen as a support for economic growth. Causality from GDP to energy consumption, so energy does not have a main influence on economic growth, and so, energy control should be adopted with more caution. The absence of a causality relationship in both directions and any policies to control energy does not slow economic growth. The relationship between energy and economic growth can be affected by the instability of the economic system. Taking into account this instability in the estimation of the models makes more realistic forecasts. To this end, this paper proposes to study the existence of structural breaks in the model in order to integer the impacts of a possible instability in the analysis of the relationship between energy and GDP. In this section, we discuss the literature review on the cointegration and causality relationship between energy consumption and economic growth. In addition, we make attention to the effect of structural breaks because of the sensibility of economic systems to exogenous shock such as the change in energy consumptions which in turn depend on the world’s energy consumption market. It is interesting to note that the results concerning the direction of the energy-GDP relationship are different. Ozturk (2010) shows that according to the variety of countries, study period, and applied methods, results of analysis are different and so policy recommendations should be appropriated to each context (see Menyah and Wolde-Rufael 2010; Chen et al. 2012). Several existing studies have been elaborated and different results have been found concerning the causality types. Then, in addition to the results about the short or long run and unidirectional or bidirectional sense of causality, we distinguish other results, such as the general causality between energy consumption and all economic sectors (Chontanawat et al. 2008), dependence of the causality on the sensibility of economic growth to domestic energy demand (Huang et al. 2008), causality between energy consumption and specific economic sector (Bowden and Payne 2009), and causality between different energy types and GDP (Baranzini et al. 2013). Other studies are interested in the stability of the relationship between energy consumption and GDP through discussion of structural breaks in energy use and GDP series. Taking into account structural breaks in energy consumption and economic system becomes more important in empirical studies on energy-GDP causality and cointegration relationship. They play a main role in the estimation and prediction of the evolution of both GDP and energy demand. Moreover, they are considered as good tools for policy makers to construct energy and economic policies when the two macroeconomic series may be affected by some exogenous shocks. Lee and Chang (2005) study the cointegration and causality relationship by taking into account structural breaks in Taiwan during 1954–2013. To this end, the authors apply unit root and cointegration tests on aggregate and disaggregate energy use and determine the structural breakpoints. In addition to the causality from energy use to GDP, they find an unstable cointegration between energy consumption and GDP which can be caused by important economic events. Crompton and Wu (2005) forecast a slower Chinese economic growth caused especially by the predicted slower increase of energy use in 2010. The decline of energy consumption will lead to technical and structural changes in the Chinese economy, which will decrease the economic growth speed. Economists have been interested to the modeling of nonlinear relationship between energy consumption and growth of the GDP. For example, Hamilton (2003) studied the possible nonlinear relationship between oil price changes and the GDP growth and found that GDP is more sensible to oil price increases than oil price decreases. Aloui and Jammazi (2009) investigated, in the case of the UK, Japan, and France, the relationship between oil shocks and stock markets. They found that the responses of the real stock market return volatilities to oil shocks are regime dependent in all three markets. Rahman and Serletis (2010) studied for the USA the asymmetric effects of two shocks: oil price shocks and monetary shocks on real macroeconomic activity. They found that GDP is nonlinearly affected by both oil prices and oil price volatility. Altinaya and Karagolb (2004) investigated in the case of Turkey the causality relationship between the GDP and energy consumption. They found that the two series are stationary process around a structural break and the several applied causality tests have shown a unidirectional causality from electricity consumption to the GDP growth. For the African countries, several empirical studies have been realized such as Ambapour and Massamba (2005), Tehranchian (2006), and Olusegun (2008). In the case of Tunisia, Belloumi (2009) examined the cointegration and causality relationship between energy consumption and the GDP growth during the period 1971–2004. He found a cointegration and bidirectional causal relationship. Chouaibi and Abdessalem (2011) examined the causal relationship between electricity consumption and economic growth in Tunisia during 1971–2007. They found a unidirectional causality running from electricity consumption to economic growth. Shahbaz and Lean (2012) examined the causal relationship between energy consumption, financial development, economic growth, industrialization, and urbanization in Tunisia from 1971 to 2008. They found bidirectional causality between financial development and energy consumption, financial development and industrialization, and industrialization and energy consumption. Abid and Sebri (2012) and Sebri and Abid (2012) studied the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth, which can be analyzed more effectively if the disaggregated energy is taken into account with specific economic indicators such as economic growth. Economic activities in Tunisia are based on energy consumption. However, in recent years, the price of oil has increased significantly and public subsidies pose problems for the state budget. The government has decided to reduce these subsidies in 2014. This energy conservation policy could reduce the competitiveness of companies, namely, those exporters. These decisions were the cause of many criticisms that provide negative impacts on economic growth. This paper is defined in this context and aims to study the relationship between energy consumption and GDP in Tunisia by taking into account the structural peaks from 1980 to 2012. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: section 2 introduces the data and the econometric methodology framework. Section 3 presents and evaluates the results of the causality analysis. Section 4 discusses the results of the empirical analysis. Conclusions and Policy Implications are outlined in section 5.",4
6.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,04 March 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-014-0190-y,Energy Consumption and Industrial Production: Evidence from Tunisia at Both Aggregated and Disaggregated Levels,December 2015,Mehdi Abid,Rafaa Mraihi,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Tunisia is a middle-income country and one of the most industrialized countries in North Africa. Energy plays a very important role in the supply chain as it is both a final good for end users as well as an input in the production processes of businesses (Sebri and Abid 2012). We use disaggregate forms of energy following Yang (2000), who argued that the use of aggregate energy data does not capture the degree or extent to which countries depend on various energy resources. Further, the use of aggregate energy data may not be able to identify the impact of a specific energy type on industrial output. The use of disaggregate data allows for comparisons of the strengths of causal relationships by energy source (Abid and Sebri 2012). The relationship between energy consumption and industrial output at aggregate and disaggregate level has been studied extensively by (e.g., Thoma 2004; Wolde-Rufael 2004; Jobert and Karanfil 2007; Zamani 2007; Zachariadis 2007; Ziramba 2009; Kouakou 2011). Although these studies contribute to the study of the relationship between energy consumption and industry GDP, they are not sufficiently informed by the advantage of aggregation in this relationship. It should be noted that the findings of these empirical studies have been rather mixed and synthesized into four hypotheses for energy policy (Jumbe 2004; Shiu and Lam 2004; Yoo 2005; Chen et al. 2007; Mozumder and Marathe 2007; Squalli 2007; Apergis and Payne 2009; Belloumi 2009). (1) The growth hypothesis suggests a unidirectional causality running from industrial energy consumption to industrial production; a policy that aims to reduce energy consumption can be considered as a limiting factor to industrial production. (2) The conservation hypothesis indicates the industrial production rate would be unaffected if, say, the rate of energy consumption is increased because of a causal relationship running from industrial production to energy consumption. (3) The feedback hypothesis asserts a bidirectional causal relationship, so that there is a feedback interaction between industrial production and energy consumption. (4) Finally, the neutrality hypothesis shows that the impact of policy aimed at any of the variables is not transferred to the other. In this context, our chief concern is to know in the case of Tunisia, the policy implications regarding the relationship between industry GDP and the total energy consumption, on the one hand, and industrial energy consumption per type, on the other hand. According to Gross (2012); Abid and Sebri (2012) and Sebri and Abid (2012), the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth can be analyzed more effectively if the disaggregated energy is taken into account with specific economic indicators such as economic growth. Motivated by the importance of this subject in the existing literature and policymaking, this study has as its goal the investigation of the relationship between energy consumption in the industrial sector and economic growth in Tunisia at the aggregated and disaggregated levels from 1980 to 2007. This allows building prudent energy policies offering specific instruments for each type of energy that can promote industrial production and its contribution to economic growth. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives a literature overview on the causal relationship between energy consumption and industrial added value (IAV) focusing on the disaggregation aspect. Section 3 describes and analyses the series of Tunisian economic growth, industrial production and energy consumption. Section 4, presents the methodology applied in this study. The estimation results at both aggregated and disaggregated levels of energy consumption are presented in Section 5. Discussions about the results are shown in Section 6. Finally, conclusions and policy implications are illustrated in Section 7.",12

Sami Hammami,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The information and communication technology (ICT) has played an important role in the social and economic development over the last 20 years. It substituted typewriting, telegraph, and many other traditional jobs. For some people, it began, according to some, to eliminate labor. We cannot easily imagine a world without cell phones, TV, or internet. Yet, there is little effort made today to identify the impact of the ICT on the economic growth. The impact of the ICT on development and economic growth, however, attracted the attention of many researchers. Studies have been conducted on Taiwan (Wang 1999), China (Meng and Li 2002), USA and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) (Colecchia and Schreyer 2002), Britain (Dolton and Makepeace 2004), and Asia (Jussawalla 1999), to determine the impact of the ICT on economic growth. In this article, we examine the relationship between the ICT and the GDP per capita in Tunisia. Although many researchers have provided empirical evidence of the correlation between ICT investment and economic growth, the ICT is still an unexplored area. Therefore, this article helps to fill the gap in the literature about the impact of the ICT on economic growth. In this section, we will try to identify the econometric relationship between the ICT and economic growth in Tunisia. The article is divided into three parts. The first part describes the ICT sector in Tunisia. The second part presents a review of the literature. The third part presents the research methodology adopted.",10

On the other hand, there are universities and other HEIs that are purely aiming at international or even global approaches to research and education, resulting in neglecting their own home base, namely the city or the region in which they are located. The regional and global views are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but even globally oriented universities and HEIs can have a huge impact on economic development and business innovation locally and regionally (see, e.g. Goddard and Vallance 2013). EU, national and regional strategies and policies on innovation have been prioritised and innovation is now core to most EU economic and regional development funding programmes. The EU-wide and EU-led smart specialisation agenda is a good example of that trend. However, many of the strategies aimed at developing innovation emanate from policymakers in centrally located urban conurbations, based on specific policy models which are in many case assumed to be universally applicable. There are several earlier studies on knowledge-based development, innovation systems and innovation policies in rural and peripheral regions (e.g. Alarinta 1998; Wiig and Isaksen 1998; Doloreux 2003; Sotarauta and Kosonen 2004; Doloreux and Dionne 2008; Karlsen et al. 2011; Suutari and Rantanen 2011; Pelkonen and Nieminen 2015). It can be stated that all of these studies examine certain aspects of the specific nature of innovation and innovation policy in the context of rural, peripheral and less-favoured regions. However, it quickly becomes obvious that all regions are not alike in terms of innovation and innovation policy. This paper aims to contribute to the academic debate on the knowledge-based development of rural, peripheral and less-favoured regions by introducing the “double-coin model of knowledge-based regional development” which places the quadruple helix model at the very heart of that process. The key question of this paper is, how can businesses, higher education institutions, governmental organisations and different community groups contribute to the economic growth and social development in regions with underperforming economies, turning peripheral or otherwise less-developed regions onto the path of sustainable knowledge-based development? Having feasible answers to that question and understanding the dynamics of knowledge-based regional development is increasingly important in Europe and beyond. From the European point of view, the “double-coin model of knowledge-based regional development” is related to the key ideas of the smart specialisation agenda mentioned above (see, e.g. McCann and Ortega-Argilés 2013; Foray 2015). For example, our point of departure is that the knowledge-based regional development should not be seen as a set of traditional top-down policies, but as a complex, place-based, multi-actor discovery process. The approach of the paper is practical and policy-oriented, as it is based on case studies from Finland, Hungary, Scotland and Sweden. The above-mentioned conceptual framework has been sketched, and empirical case studies have been mainly conducted within the UNICREDS project (UNICREDS 2010), which was an EU INTERREG IVC funded project made up of partners from remote, rural and less-favoured regions from across the EU including the UK, Nordic countries and central Europe. UNICREDS included various assessments, a survey and reviews of best practice. All of these measures produced a large number of case studies and a wealth of insightful data on how knowledge-based development and innovation take place in the case regions. The paper is organised as follows: first, the concepts of triple helix and quadruple helix are introduced briefly and the “double-coin model of knowledge-based regional development” is established to set the scene for the case studies. Shared conceptual framework is illustrated by case studies from different angles. Respectively, they illustrate the key points of this article from different angles. The first, Finnish case is a summary of how a rural region has waded its way to the “knowledge economy” by adding new, knowledge-based layers to its natural strengths. The second, Swedish case deals with multi-institutional learning environments and suggests them to be a future solution that can also be applied beyond remote and sparsely populated communities. The third, Hungarian case illustrates the ways in which a research-intensive university has intensified its regional engagement in terms of innovation by involving civil society actors and potential innovation users in various ways. And finally, the fourth, Scottish case describes how one of Europe’s most peripheral regions has achieved excellence in healthcare provision by intense collaboration among triple helix actors and by involving new actors in the development of health service provision.",65

A Study of the Value of Innovation from a Sectoral Perspective,March 2016,Talya Ponchek,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The philosopher and scientist Michael Polanyi stated that acquiring and discovering knowledge is both a deeply collective and a deeply individual endeavor (Polanyi 1958). This notion describes the two approaches towards the process of generating innovation. In recent years, much hype is evident in the literature on the establishment of collaborations in order to generate more innovations (e.g., Lee and Bozeman 2005; Sonnenwald 2007). This vast literature somehow obscures other opinions, namely that collaboration hinders innovation, so if more innovation is sought by a research organization it should be done in a silo structure manner (Beyerlein et al. 2006; Lane and Lubatkin 1998; de Man and Duysters 2005). The link between collaboration and innovation might seem obvious and “off the top of one’s head,” but the sparse empirical literature on this link focuses on the firm level of analysis, not taking into account the bigger picture of the innovation process and has produced equivocal result (see, e.g., Katila 2000; Wuchty et al. 2007a, b; Jones et al. 2008; Singh and Fleming 2010). Moreover, this literature mainly utilizes paper bibliometrics, but neglects the method of patents bibliometrics (Perkmann and Walsh 2009). Thus, the benefits of collaboration are more often assumed than investigated. The emphasis on the need to generate innovations stems from an understanding of their vitally important role. Innovation drives economic, employment, and income growth; quality of life improvements; and the competitiveness of nations (Teece 1992; Atkinson and Ezell 2012: 128). Economists have always recognized the central importance of technological innovation for economic growth and welfare (Teece 1992). Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and Joseph Schumpeter explicitly incorporated innovation as a central variable in economic analysis (Cassiolato et al. 2014).Footnote 1 Innovation is the engine of the economy, but how is innovation generated? This paper draws on the notion that the technological impact of a patent can indicate the value of innovation (Trajtenberg 1990). It does so to investigate the controversy, discussed below in Part 2, regarding the place collaboration has in the innovation process, and provides empirical evidence. The data collected and analyzed are from the stem cell industry in Israel. These data are unique as they provide the opportunity to subject an entire industry to the analysis, not only a sample. This is also the first time that the data from stem cell industry in Israel have been subjected to an analysis of patent-based indicators of innovation. This study’s innovative strength lies in the examination of the link between innovation and collaboration on the sectoral level for the first time. The relation among different sectors in the Israeli stem cell industry is analyzed through the lens of Quadruple Helix (QH) theory. Previous literature mainly focused on firms and inter-firm relations. Part 2 discusses the theoretical background and the hypotheses, more especially recent innovation theories which emphasize collaboration. It reviews the different meanings given to the term collaboration in the literature and proposes a definition of collaboration for the purpose of this study. It presents the debate over how innovation is generated: through collaborative endeavors or by the lone research organization. In Part 3, I discuss the data and method on analysis. This part begins with the question of why the data analyzed are collected on the stem cell industry in Israel. It then continues to discuss why QH is the appropriate framework. Lastly, it explains how the data were collected and the method of analysis.

However, due to vast external knowledge development in globalised information networks, it has become difficult for companies to keep pace with the fast-changing trends and developments solely through their own resources. For this reason, the concept of Open Innovation (Chesbrough 2003) introduces to companies the possibility of generating new ideas in collaboration with external innovation sources within multilateral multidisciplinary R&D networks. Chesbrough, Vanhaverbeke and West (2006, p. vii) define Open Innovation as “the use of purposive inflows and outflows of knowledge to accelerate internal innovation, and expand the markets for external use of innovation (…). Open Innovation is a paradigm that assumes that firms can and should use external ideas as well as internal and external paths to market, as they look to advance their technology.” This concept challenges the boundaries of a company’s identity and has a high risk to overcharge corporate resources. If an innovation process is opened up to much, the failure rate to successfully co-develop and introduce new products in the market is very high (Lichtenthaler and Lichtenthaler 2009). Questioning the openness of innovation in practice, Carayannis introduces the term Targeted Open Innovation: “We don’t have OI 2.0, we have TOI 2.0 … TARGETED Open Innovation … We have co-opetition, co-evolution, and co-specialisation” (Carayannis 2013). According to the Quintuple Innovation Helix (Carayannis et al. 2012, Fig. 1), the key actors of innovation development include representatives of the (1) university and higher education system, (2) industry and economic system, (3) government and political system, (4) the media-based and culture-based public and (5) the social and natural environment. The subsystems of the Quintuple Innovation Helix Model, modified from Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000 and Carayannis and Campbell 2010
 To “target” innovation means to align and co-ordinate top-down innovation development from R&D with assets of bottom-up creativity of the media-based and culture-based civil society and to integrate user-oriented knowledge in the context of application and problem solution. The Quadruple and Quintuple Innovation Helix models (Carayannis and Campbell 2010) include the requirements of civil society and natural and social environments within a transdisciplinary R&D surrounding of co-evolution, co-specialisation and co-opetition interrelating socio-political, socio-economic and technological input and output sources. To put into practice such a dynamic conceptual framework as the Quintuple Helix requires a collaborative planning infrastructure to integrate and match communication content (Erbach 2014). To facilitate Targeted Open Innovation (TOI) in companies and organisations means to meet conceptual requirements of innovation development and reality-based requirements of a company’s given conditions and corporate identity. 
The Conceptual Challenge of TOI Can Be Understood from Its Genesis: The concept of the Triple Innovation Helix (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000) of (1) university, (2) industry and (3) government as the key actors of innovation describes structural developments in knowledge-based economies. This model gives a top-down view on mainly regional and national systems of innovation. Adding another dimension of the (4) public as media-based and culture-based civil society with its bottom-up creativity and needs, the Quadruple Innovation Helix (Carayannis and Campbell 2010) introduces a complementary element to top-down innovation development from R&D: It “puts innovation users at its heart and encourages the development of innovations that are pertinent for users (civil society). (…) New innovative products, services, and solutions are developed with the involvement of users in their role as lead-users, co-developers and co-creators” (Carayannis and Rakhmatullin 2014, p. 219). Finally, the Quintuple Innovation Helix includes the requirements of (5) natural and social environments as a driver for innovation framed as the will of a political system (Carayannis et al. 2012). The dimensions of sustainability and responsibility define the laws and future-oriented plans and preconditions for innovation development of all participants in all levels. Knowledge society and knowledge economy enforce creativity within a context of application and problem solution. To empower the Quintuple Helix as a conceptual approach for reality-based application of “targeted” Open Innovation, the key actors need to specify their relations and functions as communicating partners of a mutual targeted innovation development within a feasible process design. This demand becomes clear considering the reality of an innovation development process of a company. 
The reality-based challenge for innovation development in a company is to interpret and put into practice the corporate innovation targets according to its own corporate identity, based on the company’s history and given conditions in its specific market segments. Corporate objectives and marketing targets rectify the coordination of a company’s skills and resources in relation to market opportunities and specific customer needs (Becker 2009). Customer integration is today’s paradigm in planned communication. In collaborative production processes of Mass Customisation, the consumer becomes a “prosumer”, merging the attributes of producer and consumer (Piller et al 2004). Integrated marketing communication aims at interrelating all internal and external aspects of a company’s structures and communications (Bruhn 2009). “A particular challenge for many companies will be the holistic integration of the customer benefit approach within the business management” (Wirtz and Schilke 2004, p. 48). In this nodal point, the theories of business economics confirm the Quintuple Innovation Helix: The requirement to integrate and match the needs of specific target audiences in a planned manner is essential to every interest group and communicating representative of education, economy, government, civil society and environment. In consequence, the communicating partners of a “targeted” Open Innovation development must be reciprocally considered as “customers” at eye level in their identity-based knowledge exchange and learning processes. Each participant in a TOI development needs to build on its own identity and preconditions to distinguish relevant from non-relevant information, to avoid wasting resources, to stick to corporate principles and to pursue plans without deviation. “The interface existing between internal and external commercial interests must be systematically coordinated” (Bruhn and Ahlers 2013, p. 139). 
Bringing innovation concepts and corporate reality together: Each TOI development is a unique process. The key to successfully interrelate different participants is to define and emphasise their specific identity, explicit targets and determined roles for one another in a transparent way. “Mutual” efforts in a co-development only make “sense” if they do not overcharge given conditions or demand too little from participating key actors such as a company or organisation which wants to develop and profit from TOI as initiator or as co-developer. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate how to include the identity characteristics of multidisciplinary participants and communication planning in a TOI development by applying a universal identity scheme (“Identity Matrix”). This information structuring approach allows for the integration of different development partners in varying roles and the systematic coordination and management of internal and external knowledge flows. The idea is to conceptualise the structure and interrelation of any included knowledge itself. The aim is to be able to handle any amount, complexity and dynamics of information in a TOI development and to avoid getting stuck in one-dimensional and non-related processes. Pragmatic Identity Matching closes a research gap in planned content integration in integrated communication as described by Bruhn (2009). The Identity Matrix (Erbach 2011) is the central element of the Pragmatic Identity Matching concept. It provides a customisable infrastructure for integrating and matching transdisciplinary content in a planned manner. The focus of this paper is to adopt the Identity Matrix for TOI conceptually to the Quintuple Helix Concept (see Figs. 1 and 8) and to put into practice the Quintuple Helix as the framework for all contributions and relations of the key actors in TOI development (Carayannis and Campbell 2010). Demonstrating the integrative force of Pragmatic Identity Matching, the paper explains with a case study and examples the Matrix for Identity Matching as a participative infrastructure for integrative thinking and cooperative action (Erbach 2014). This infrastructure allows for the co-ordination of all internal and external knowledge flows in a TOI development as a process design structure and database for human resources, technologies and interfaces accomplishing customer-oriented innovation targets.",3

It does not just happen by chance and involves decisions in both private and public sectors, related to the investment of effort, money and time in exploring new ideas.

 Within the changing global business landscape, emerging countries are increasingly reaching economic power and visibility, while developed economies need to face several challenges to renovate themselves, as particularly arises from latest foreign domestic investment (FDI) trends. Those challenges can be addressed by focusing the effort not only on innovation but also on open innovation. However, to keep high competition levels, it is necessary to assess the determinants and prospects of the most powerful leverages (by country) able to empower economic growth through innovation. Furthermore, the ongoing globalization process is spreading interconnections between all markets within and outside the boundaries of a country. In so doing, it exposes firms to review their business strategy from an internationalization perspective leading to international engagement as a significant growth driver. As stated by the OECD (1997), when dealing with national innovation systems, international dynamics are playing a role in facilitating or not the flows of knowledge from and to a specific national system. In particular, a significant process of redistribution of production is occurring within the global economy. Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC countries) have been proving to be the major engine of the global growth since they have been far less impacted by the crisis or recovered faster compared to more developed economies. These four countries are driving most of the growth of the world’s gross domestic product (GDP), accounting for a significant share of it. This is why they will be the focus of our empirical analysis. They may also represent a significant sample of current economy due to their different attributes, such as endowment and comparative advantages. As far as internationalization is concerned, BRIC countries are among the top 20 FDI inflow sources (UNCTAD, 2014). At the same time, they are increasingly becoming not only important knowledge and innovation sources but also drivers. Knowledge and innovation are internationalizing. Following a quadruple helix model approach as the best approximation of an open innovation-based economy, we propose a double ‘I’ environment, which puts together the two mentioned key factors (innovation and internationalization) in one equation system, to be applied to a nation or a region. In particular, the two I components are expected to influence each other and together generate an exponential path of growth for the economies able to implement them. The idea is that innovation and internationalization are able to foster each other, if properly promoted and supported. For instance, companies from a given country starting to engage internationally with other companies abroad, due to their international engagement, are likely to benefit from innovation and knowledge spillovers from the counterpart. Conversely, investing heavily in innovation, will lead to international engagement concerning research and development (R&D). Leydesdorff (2010) suggested that researchers could extend models to gain explanatory power. Moreover, the globalization process already cited above could make the international-national dimension increasingly relevant. We do not want to be so conceited in this paper to propose a new helix model with international relations as a dimension. However, if future studies will provide significant results, we can consider the idea of a quintuple helix model where the international dimension is included and the natural environment is considered as global. Starting from this idea, we first present a background on innovation, open innovation and a small debate over responsible research and innovation as framework for targeted open innovation, in order to explore the innovation landscape with a strong conceptual framework. Then, we try to answer the question whether a quadruple helix model could represent an open innovation system. The fourth paragraph introduces the double I environment itself, while the fifth one presents a regression study over the relation of internationalization and R&D investment in the BRIC countries. Finally, we will try to summarize all our effort in the last paragraph with concluding remarks. Waiting for more complete data, consensus about statistic methods and best practices, we focus on the conceptual framework, aiming to foster further research, and run a simple empirical case.",4

Throughout the evolution of wine making, most innovations were shared through the institutionalization of practices. Wine producers and other participants of this industry, such as individuals from diverse religious orders, collaborated to establish their legitimacy as a means to foster the quality of their wine. Although open innovation was not involved in the establishment of different wine regions, producers from other regions either used a closed innovation approach or used open innovation for other purposes. In the present study, we address the concept of open innovation in the context of traditional industries. From an open innovation perspective, ideas that originate outside the firm’s boundaries are brought inside for commercialization. Wine appellations are of particular interest because firms decide to engage in open innovation networks as a means to benefit from the innovations that are created by other participants in this industry. Bridging the gap between (1) closed/open innovation and (2) legitimacy processes redefines the boundary between the firm and its surrounding environment. As mentioned by Kostova and Zaheer (1999), the “different types of legitimacy reflect the different types of institutions operating in the environment.” The link between legitimacy and open innovation has not previously been studied. Therefore, the aim of this article is to explain how firms gain and manage their legitimacy through open innovation processes. From a theoretical perspective, this article aims to answer the following question: How do French wine producers use open innovation as a means to gain and manage their legitimacy? On the closed innovation/open innovation continuum, we show that wine regions display different patterns. Based on their historical trajectory, wine regions will use open innovation to identify the legitimation processes set by firms in their own region. This study contributes to the discussion on the boundaries of open innovation and their influence on organizational legitimacy. First, we review the literature on organizational open innovation and legitimacy. Then, we continue with the empirical setting. We explain the methodology, and we present the results. The article concludes with the implications of our findings, their limits, and avenues for future research.",4

People are concentrating because communities offer creativity and innovation to drive the economy, the enabling infrastructure and the appropriate governance and public services to provide prosperity and sustainable competitiveness (Asheim and Isaksen 1997). On the other hand, globalization, the Internet and the digital economy are fragmenting and flattening the industrial world towards a collaboration service paradigm in which even manufacturing is a service. The emerging focus of governments and businesses is value creation in intelligent communities or regional innovation systems—be they geographic, industry-based or even virtual across the world. “Culture is Key” was the conclusion of the Booz and Co recent studies on innovation and competitiveness in industry (Jaruzelski et al. 2011), with the corollary that a culture of innovation and the alignment of business goals with the right innovation strategies are more determinant factors than the amount of investments in research and development programs. This is equally true for business corporations (i.e. communities of interest) as for geographic proximity corporate communities—urban or rural municipalities. Indeed, like business firms, cities throughout the world are competing for prosperity, to attract profitable businesses and valuable residents for an enhanced quality of life (Wolfe and Bramwell 2008). Communication networks have a significant impact on culture—as both a potential brake and accelerator, depending on ease of access, speed and value of content available. Many businesses, communities and rapidly developing countries understand that broadband Internet—with fixed and mobile access—is directly connected to economic growth—a fact recognized by UN as a fundamental human right and demonstrated by the rapid creation of “gigabit communities” (Kansas City is an early American example) and the build-up of gigabit access networks throughout the world. Alas, Canada, which was the pioneer of the communication age (the 1st phone, 1st digital exchanges, 1st domestic communication satellite), has fallen behind European and Asian countries, dropping from 5th place as an Internet-using country to 14th place according to the Akamai data network (Tencer 2012). i-CANADA Alliance is a not-for-profit pioneering movement dedicated to building Canada as a competitive innovation nation using broadband connectivity, collaboration ecosystems and intelligent services anytime anywhere. i-Canada has determined from its inception the need to address both the hard aspects of city infrastructure and public service developments as well as the soft aspects of an entrepreneurial culture dedicated to innovation and rapid adoption of knowledge economy and the intense utilization of digital services. To do so, it used public-private alliances towards the development of methodologies and tools for helping community leaders understand the situation, enrol the business and residential constituents and plan efficiently effective development programs in the areas of most needed. The concept of a “Smart City” has been discussed in the past decades (Hollands 2008; Schaffers et al. 2011) with a focus on the enhancement of their infrastructure and equipping the cities with better controls of their transportation systems, energy networks, water systems and, lately, information communication systems. Examples of Smart Cities can be seen in most developed countries around the world as governments and organizations strive to be competitive in a global marketplace (Graham 2002; Hollands 2008; Florida 2012). For the purpose of this analysis, we will use Komninos’ (2002) definition of Smart City as “a spatial territory or region that brings information communications technology (ICT) and people together to enhance innovation, learning, knowledge and problem solving”. This definition includes aspects of technology, innovation, human capital and knowledge translation that have been shown to be important drivers of economic growth. To remain viable and maintain their competitive position, communities need to evolve by adapting to changing economic, social and political environments. “If you cannot measure it, you cannot improve it” was rightly said by Lord Kelvin more than a century ago. To determine how to become a Smart City, or the competitive advantage that a particular Smart City can offer, requires the analysis of a diverse range of variables including the following: information technology, community orientation, governance structures, business innovation, human capital and community knowledge infrastructure. To manage their competitive progress, community leaders need to understand their community’s competitive position on a map that (i) reveals the community’s factors of strength, (ii) pinpoints the weak aspects for remedial action, and (iii) determines the path for progress. As a culture of innovation and the active enrolment of key community members are determinant factors for success, it is necessary to measure and manage not only the hard data about a community’s infrastructure, its business components and its investments. It is also necessary to measure the spirit of the community and its capabilities of energizing itself in the right directions of evolution. For that, one needs appropriate tools and maps capable of providing at a glance the understanding of the community status across all key domains of competitiveness and the areas where more work needs to be done for meaningful progress. Although there have been a few frameworks for analyzing innovation-type (Rowley et al. 2011) or innovation orientation (Siguaw et al. 2006), little has been done to provide tools to understand the external environmental factors that support innovation and create regional innovation systems. This is the rational for the intelligent community assessment tools (i-CAT) and the associated methodology described in this paper. These tools lead to a dynamic dashboard that reveals at a glance the critical progress being made (or not!) towards the development of an intelligent community and levers the results thereof.",2
7.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,27 June 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-014-0210-y,Graduate Employment in the Knowledge Society Norwegian Master's Level Graduates,March 2016,Terje Næss,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The aims of this article are to describe how the knowledge society has changed the labour market for graduates with a master's degree and so also to increase understanding of the knowledge society. From descriptions of the knowledge society in the literature, we would expect several changes. First, we would expect that graduates are more dispersed throughout all economic activities, as in the knowledge society, there is believed to be a general increase in the use of knowledge in most areas of production. Paul (2007) for example has the following interpretation: “the term knowledge society has been coined to indicate not only the expansion in higher education or of knowledge-intensive or high-technology sectors of the economy, but rather a situation in which the characteristics of work organisations across the board change under the influence of the increasing importance of knowledge”. From this interpretation, we would also expect increased recruitment to education and research and other knowledge-intensive and technologically advanced economic activities. From the analysis, we can get a better picture of how relevant these descriptions are regarding education at master's degree level. Studies of the development of the educational level of workers in general typically find that the increase in skill level has been greatest in branches that traditionally have been knowledge-intensive. Kim (2002), in a meta-analysis, and Haskel and Slaughter (2002) found that the demand for workers with high skills has significantly increased in the branches that already have a high skill level. Barth et al. (2004) and Børing et al. (2007) observe similar results in the case of Norway. Børing et al. (2007) also found an increase in the percentage of workers with a master's level education in all economic activities. Still, there is also some empirical evidence that some economic activities with a relatively low skill level have experienced relatively high growth in skill levels. Kim (2002) refers to several studies in the '90s that found that skill demand has increased more for manufacturing than for the service sector, even though the skill level in manufacturing in general traditionally has been lower than in the service sector. These results do not, however, necessarily apply to master's level graduates in Norway. The analysis will proceed by comparing the employment of graduates in 2005/07 with that of graduates in 1989/91 regarding the economic activity (industrial sector) and sector (public, semi-public or business), and also to some extent occupation (information-related work), of their employment. We only look at graduates who are in jobs with some relevance to their education. Furthermore, we investigate the competence level in the various work areas by looking at the wage level. If the wage levels in new work areas that have absorbed the increased supply of graduates are as high as in the traditional academic work areas, we will interpret this as an indication that the competence levels in these new work areas are as high as in the more traditional academic work areas. By sector, we mean a broader three-group categorisation based on ownership and financing/market behaviour, specifically business, semi-public and public. Also, this is an interesting dimension to look at, as there seems to be a trend in many countries that the business sector is recruiting an increasing share of graduates, and it is possible that this dimension has effects on the increase in the use of knowledge. While there is a close relationship between this variable and economic activity, there is also, for most economic activities, a mix of organisations from all these three sectors. Thus, according to this definition, sector does not overlap with economic activity. As for economic activity, we will look at the wage level in the different sectors as an indicator of the skill level. The modern economically advanced knowledge society is also often called the information society, which can be defined as the phase in the technological development where communication and information production have become the dominating economic activities (Store Norske Leksikon http://snl.no/informasjonssamfunn). We therefore also examine recruitment related to information production, either through working in the information sector or through working with information production in other types of organisations, using occupational codes. Further, we will analyse if there are differences between the different work areas regarding the relevance of different types of competence by looking at four different fields of study as follows: humanities, law, economics and science and technology (S&T). Most of the results in this paper have been published in Næss (2010). The “Data and Methodology and Definitions” section presents the data; “Economic Activity” section looks at recruitment in different economic activities; “Distribution by Sector” section examines recruitment patterns categorised by sector; “The Information Society” section discusses the importance of information services; and “Summary” section summarises the results.",1
7.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,26 June 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-014-0211-x,Energy Consumption-Informal Economic Growth Analysis: What Policy Options Do We Have?,March 2016,Mehdi Abid,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"What are the crucial implications we could deduce from the relationship between energy consumption and economic growth in the presence of informal economy? This is the principal recurrent question that has featured for many years in the debate on economic and energy consumption. The first empirical studies were stimulated by the 1970 energy crisis (Kraft and Kraft 1978; Akarca and Long 1980). Most of those studies are different with regard their methodologies and the data used. Certain studies are specific to each country (time series); others noted (cross section data) and at the same time reported the values considered relevant to a group of individuals over a series of time periods (panel data). Even in the recent literatures, empirical studies of panel data are still used. And, if energy consumption causes economic growth or the contrary, then this conclusion should still be considered. The absence of causality between energy and production can exist because the different economies of countries have different scenarios of energy consumption. As well, different energy resources aggregation levels can have effects on economic growth. In fact, the aggregation level plays a critical role in the identification of the political implication between energy consumption and economic growth (Gross 2012). Certain studies draw upon the relation between sectoral energy consumption and total GDP (Bowden and Payne 2009; Tsani 2010; Cheng-Lang et al. 2011). Some studies focus principally on the relation between overall energy consumption and sectoral GDP (Yu and Jin 1992; Thoma 2004 and Sebri and Abid 2012). And, while other studies concentrate on the relation between disaggregated energy consumption and GDP (Sari and Soytas 2004; Erbaykal 2008; Ighodaro 2010; Abid and Mraihi 2014a; and Abid and Mraihi 2014c), other studies have put the accent on the relation between sectoral energy consumption and the sectoral GDP (Zachariadis 2007; Costantini and Martini 2010; Gross 2012 and Abid and Sebri 2012). It should be pointed out that the empirical studies mentioned above have similar political implications within the same country. Yet, such implications remain to be further revisited since they do not actually take into account the size of the informal economy in the calculation of the GDP. Bowden and Payne (2009) have studied the causality relation between sectoral energy consumption and total GDP during the 1949–2006 period in the USA. The authors have found different political implications, but have concluded that we should be careful when we study the causality relation between sectorial energy consumption and the GDP. Tsani (2010) has studied this relation in the case of Greece for the 1960–2006 period. He has reached different results between the aggregate level and the disaggregated level per sector (industrial, residential and transport). Thus, different political implications have been attached to different sectors. Cheng-Lang et al. (2011) have studied the causality relation between the GDP and electricity consumption in the industrial and residential sectors in Taiwan using quarterly data covering the 1982–2008 period. The authors have used linear and non-linear causality. Different results for the different sectors are obtained through the use of an econometric method. Sari and Soytas (2004), utilising a small sample of disaggregate energy consumption and GDP (31-year period from 1969 to 1999), pointed out that 21 % of the forecast error variance of GDP is explained by total energy consumption. This result is obtained through the generalised forecast error variance decomposition developed by Koop et al. (1996) and Pesaran and Shin (1998). Consequently, political decision makers might be interested in the identification of energy dependency in relation to economic growth within the framework of the allocation of the investment budget for energy. Erbaykal (2008) has studied the relation between economic growth and disaggregated energy consumption, including oil and electricity in 1970–2003 period in Turkey. Using the testing procedure for cointegration developed by Pesaran et al. (2001), results demonstrate that electricity, in the short term, has effects on economic growth. The coefficients linked, respectively, to oil consumption and electricity consumption have positive and statistically significant effects on economic growth. However, in the long term, oil consumption has a positive effect on economic growth while electricity consumption has a negative effect. Ighodaro (2010) studied the relation of causality between economic growth and the aggregate and disaggregated energy consumption (oil, gas and electricity) during the 1970–2005 period in Nigeria. Using the cointegration technique developed by Johansen (1988), he shows that the policy of the conservation of electricity consumption and gas consumption conservation policy stimulate economic growth while the oil consumption conservation policy cannot be considered as a factor which is limited to economic growth. Zachariadis (2007) employs aggregate data (overall energy consumption and GDP) and disaggregated data (sectoral energy consumption) for the G7 countries during 1949–2004 period. On the aggregate level, results indicate that there is no causality relation whatsoever. On the contrary, at the disaggregated level, the service sector and the transportation sector energy consumption cause economic growth. Zachariadis (2007) concludes that we should be careful in the elaboration of the political implications with the help of the bivariate causality test on reduced sample size. Costantini and Martini (2010) employ data for the OECD and non-OECD countries in order to verify the relation of causality between sectoral economic growth and sectoral energy consumption. For the industrial sector, the two groups of countries demonstrate similar tendencies in the short term, while they behave differently towards energy consumption in the long term. For the transportation sector, the results obtained are different for the two groups of countries, but similar political implications are drawn on the level of the residential sector. These implications reveal that no causality relation in both groups of countries, whether developed or developing, is detected. Within the same problematic, Gross (2012) studies the relation of causality at the aggregate level (between overall energy consumption and the GDP) and on the disaggregate level between sectoral energy consumption and value-added sectors (commerce, transportation and industry). Using the cointegration bound testing approach (ARDL) introduced by Pesaran and Shin (1999) and Pesaran et al. (2001), empirical results affirm that the hypothesis of neutrality is supported on the aggregate and disaggregated level in the short term. In the long term, Gross (2012) found that there was a unidirectional causality going from energy consumption to value added in the commercial sector as well as bidirectional causality for the transportation sector. Nevertheless, the work of Zachariadis (2007) is criticised by Gross (2012). The latter demonstrates that the choice of the GDP variable in the transportation sector is appropriately chosen, since the share of the total value added of the transportation sector in GDP is almost negligible. Thus, the share of economic activity covered by the GDP does not correspond to the share of economic activity covered by the energy consumption in the transportation sector. A more technical reason for the inappropriate choice of GDP in the transportation sector can determine that the GDP price index does not match the price index of value-added transportation. We must equally emphasise that the empirical studies mentioned above do not take into consideration the size of the unregistered economic activity in the energy-economy relation. If the informal economy has an important weight in the overall economic activity of a given country, then an important part of energy consumption does not seem to create added value in the formal GDP. This is certainly the case for most developing countries. So, the study of the relation between energy consumption and the formal GDP cannot provide us with reliable results relevant to those countries. Karanfil’s seminal article (2008) studies the relation between energy consumption and real GDP, taking into account the size of informal economy, during the 1970–2005 period in Turkey. In this study, empirical results suggest that there exists in the long term an equilibrium relation between the formal GDP and energy consumption. Moreover, using the vector error correction model (VECM), empirical results demonstrate that there is a unidirectional causality going from registered GDP to energy consumption in the short and the long-run. However, when we take into account the size of informal economy in the calculation of the formal GDP as in Karanfil’s work (2008), results demonstrate that there is neither a cointegration relation nor a relation of causality between energy consumption and the total GDP (formal and informal). These empirical results imply that the energy conservation policy cannot be a limiting factor for the growth of informal economic activity. All these empirical studies, except Karanfil’s work (2008), have not integrated the size of the informal economy in the calculation of the GDP. These studies use formal GDP and energy consumption as a pair of variables. In our view, this choice is not appropriate, because the share of informal economy in total GDP is not negligible in some countries. Thus, the scope of economic activity covered by formal GDP does not correspond to the scope of economic activity covered by the energy consumption in the absence of the informal economy. A more technical reason for the mismatch of both variables is the fact that the price index of total GDP does not correspond to the price index of formal GDP. However, if the results for Granger causality tests between energy consumption and economic growth are found to be dependent on the level of formal economy and not on the total economy, it is necessary to analyse the causal relationship at the ‘correct’ level of total GDP. Otherwise, the results are spurious and policy advice should be given with much caution. Concomitant with the sharp rise in the energy consumption, Tunisia has achieved a remarkable average informal GDP growth rate of 4 % per year from 1980 to 2009. In fact, since 1987, informal GDP growth rates have always been at least 5.8 % per year (Abid and Ben Salha 2013). The objective of this paper is to re-examine empirically the relation of causality between the GDP and energy consumption by including the size of the informal economy in the calculation of the formal GDP. In Tunisia, there is no study that takes into consideration the size of informal economy in the energy-economy relation. The results of this study will enhance our understanding of the relation between energy consumption and economic activity. Consequently, these results have important political implications for Tunisia. The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by addressing these questions: (1) Does the energy consumption have any significant impact on the informal GDP of Tunisia? (2) What kind of causality is there between energy consumption and informal economic growth in this country? (3) Should policies related to reducing the informal economy be implemented in Tunisia? The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: the next section studies an ‘Econometric Framework’ and the third section presents the data and the results of the empirical study (‘Data and Empirical Results’), while the last section describes the ‘Conclusion and Political Implications’.",6

In 1888, Edwin Cannan noted, with regard to knowledge and production, that, The first, and perhaps the most important, of the three causes which have led to the increase of the productiveness of industry is increase of knowledge. As regards this cause it is scarcely necessary to say anything. Everyone can see how enormously the productiveness of industry has been increased by the growth of men’s knowledge of mechanics, chemistry, electricity, and other departments of science. In consequence of the growth of knowledge a few men can now do not only what it used to require many men to do, but also what could not formerly have been done by any number of men in any length of time (Cannan 1903: 12–3). while Alfred Marshall wrote 2 years later, with regard to knowledge and organisation, that Capital consists in a great part of knowledge and organization: and of this some part is private property and other part is not. Knowledge is our most powerful engine of production; it enables us to subdue Nature and force her to satisfy our wants. Organization aids knowledge; it has many forms, e.g. that of a single business, that of various businesses in the same trade, that of various trades relatively to one another, and that of the State providing security for all and help for many. The distinction between public and private property in knowledge and organization is of great and growing importance: in some respects of more importance than that between public and private property in material things; and partly for that reason it seems best sometimes to reckon Organization apart as a distinct agent of production (Marshall (1920) Book IV Chapter 1 page 115). Yet, despite this early recognition, the relationship between knowledge and organisation has received little attention in the contemporary theory of the firm. A range of issues related to the knowledge firm and entrepreneurship in the knowledge economy have been examined empirically and operationally—see for example Klein et al. (2010); Lin et al. (2012); Vliamos and Tzeremes (2012); Petrakis and Kostis (forthcoming) and Al-Omariet al. (forthcoming)—but consideration of the theory of the knowledge firm has been much less. The aim of this paper is to provide a theoretical foundation to enable the analysis of some of the claims that have been made about the effects that the increasing importance of knowledge, and the knowledge worker, to the production process will have on the organisation of the firm. To illustrate how having a firm based on knowledge workers—human capital—rather than physical capital can change the structure of the firm, consider the example of pirates (a human-capital-based firm) versus privateers (a more physical-capital-based firm). Lesson (2009) argued that given the economic environment and incentives faced by pirates a “worker cooperative” type organisational form was found to be viable for “pirate firms” (ships), but as he also notes one size does not fit all and thus worker-owned firms are unlikely to be an exploitable organisational form for all firms, in all situations.Footnote 1 Leeson’s point about different economic contexts resulting in different organisational forms for firms can be illustrated by comparing the organisational form of the privateers with that of pirates and considering the role that non-human capital (or the lack of it) plays in determining that form. An important difference between privateers and pirates is that although they both practised maritime plunder, privateers were state-sanctioned. That is governments would commission privateers to attack and seize enemy nations’ merchant shipping during times of war. The most obvious piece of non-human (physical in this case) capital for both pirates and privateers was their ship. The role of investors in providing this capital was important to the organisational form that the pirates and privateers developed. Pirates had no investors; they simply stole the capital they needed. Privateers, on the other hand, as legal enterprises could not just go out and steal the capital they required; they needed external financiers to supply their capital requirements. This difference in capital supply resulted in very different organisational forms, the privateers having a more autocratic management system than pirates. Pirate crews were equal contributors and part owners of the firm they worked for.Footnote 2 Having no need for investors, pirates did not need to develop mechanisms to protect the interests of the firm’s financiers as the privateers needed to do. This meant that incentive problems could be dealt with by developing a worker-owned firm with the crew (usually) sharing equally in “profit” and electing their leaders and having power dispersed among multiple members of the crew such as the captain and the quartermaster. In contrast, the privateer had investors and a management system designed to protect their investments. The investors appointed privateer captains and developed an organisational scheme that in some important respects mirrored the managerial organisation of (also investor backed) merchant ships. If, as the above argument would suggest, the amount and financing of the non-human capital required by the firm are important determinants of a firm’s organisational form, are firms going to resemble pirates, at least as far as they will be worker-owned, as human-capital becomes the dominate input to production?Footnote 3 or to put it more generally, what determines the organisational form of the human-capital-based firm? In the following sections, we utilise simple versions of models developed from the reference point theory of Hart and Moore (2008) to study these questions.Footnote 4
 The models considered below differ from the standard theories of the firm in that the emphasis here is on human capital, important in the knowledge economy, rather than non-human capital which is central to the established approaches to the firm, developed with a more non-human-capital-based economy in mind. An obvious example of the non-human capital emphasis of the orthodox theories is the Grossman-Hart-Moore (GHM) approach in which the firm “is defined as a collection of assets over which certain agents have property rights” (Moore 1992: 494). But this concentration on non-human capital means that none of the standard theories deals satisfactorily with human capital. Walker (2010: 27) argues that “[r]elationship-specific investment-induced hold-up arguments for vertical integration are at their weakest when dealing with human capital. Human capital cannot be owned in the same way as physical capital and so the investor in human capital can act opportunistically whether an employee or not. The incentive-system theory assumes the use of a physical asset rather than a human capital asset in the production process. Neither the ownership nor the value of a human asset can be transferred and so such an asset cannot determine where the boundaries of the firm lie within the model. The extensions of the GHM framework offered by Brynjolfsson (1994) and Rabin (1993) inherits the implicit owner-manager restriction of the original GHM framework and thus are of limited use when modelling the knowledge firm. [ . . . ] The knowledge-based theory of the firm deals no better with the increasing importance of knowledge in the economy” (Walker 2010: 27). Thus, the need for a new theory of the human-capital-based firm for the knowledge economy. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In the section “types of human capital and firm structure” we examine how the “type” of human capital matters for the structure of the firm. We show that the organisation of the firm can depend on the nature of the human capital utilised by the firm. Having shown this, the section “a simple model of a human-capital based firm” puts forward a simple model of a human-capital-based firm based on the reference point approach to the theory of the firm. Questions considered in this section include: Does the size and/or scope of the firm matter for the firm’s organisational form and why are there conversions to investor ownership? The last section is the conclusion.",

Jane Jacobs (1961) puts the social capital at the base of the self-organizing ability of the society. Mark Granovetter underlies the “strength of weak ties” for the access to the labor market (1973) and the relevance of social networks and trust in influencing the behavior of productive organizations (Granovetter 1985) reducing transaction costs (Williamson 1975). Glenn Loury refers to social capital trying to explain the success of young people in increasing their human capital (1977). Bourdieu (1980, 1986) focuses on cultural capital and distinguishes it from the economic and social ones. As Trigilia (2001) observes the roots of this concept found in the study of economic activities and are bound to the attempt to show that social structures and dynamics affect the functioning of the economy and that the availability of social resources can influence the economic choices. In this perspective, James Coleman (1988, 1990) adopts this concept as a tool to develop a social theory that includes the principle of rationality of action, trying to show how this principle, in specific social contexts, can explain not only individual actions but also the development of social organization. Putnam’s works (1993, 1995a, b) analyze the relation between civicness and institutional performance, identifying the social capital with trust, norms, and networks of coexistence of civic associations that improve the effectiveness of social organization. Fukuyama (1995) defines the concept as the ability of people to work together to achieve common goals within groups and organizations: it does coincides with mutual trust. Putnam’s and Coleman’s works have both considerable resonance, even if the first uses the concept of social capital in a culturalist perspective developed at macro level, while the second inserts it in a sociological version of a rational choice theory grounded at micro level but extensible at macro level (Coleman boat). In Coleman perspective, social capital “is defined by its function”, that is, following Weber’s lesson, it is defined by the considered social action in relation to the meaning that the social actor attributes to it. Social capital consists in some aspect of social structures, and it facilitates some actions of both individual and collective actors within the structure. Unlike the physical one, social capital increases its consistency with the use, such as human capital, but if unused, it deteriorates easily (Coleman 1988, 1990). It is a situational and dynamic concept characterized by productivity and reciprocity inherent in its relational foundation (Piselli 2001). On this basis, Trigilia defines it as the set of relationships that an individual or a collective actor has at a given time (2002). This definition is interesting, because it moves the argument to the case of collective action and collective actor (Lochner et al. 1999; Winter 2000; Stone 2001) as clearly stated in World Bank definition, where social capital “refers to the norms and networks that enable collective action”.Footnote 1 It’is particularly interesting in this sense, to adopt a meso-level social perspective, sensible to the generation and operation of mesolevel networks (Hedstrom et al. 2000). This is the most appropriate level of analysis according to a relational approach, which looks at social capital as a quality of social relations, characterized by social exchanges of reciprocity based on trust and willingness to cooperate (Donati 2007). Social capital is a multidimensional concept. Some authors distinguish between individual and collective social capital (Bertolini and Bravo 2001; Bertolini 2001), while others argue that it is both individual and collective, because it belongs to a network of actors (Burt 2000). But, if social capital is a situational and dynamic concept (Piselli 2001) defined by its function (Coleman 1988) maybe, we should not look to the actor, whether individual or collective, who uses it, but the individual or collective action that is enabled/disabled by the presence/absence of social capital in the considered network (Torrigiani 2004, 2010). This first distinction is particularly important, because it allows extending the application of the concept to public policies and their evaluation. The different aspects of social capital can be brought together into five categories or dimensions (Bertolini and Bravo 2001): Relational dimension: relationship and exchange that bind individuals in the context (Lin 1999, 2001a, b; Paldam 2000; Stone 2001; Palloni et al. 2001; Buchan et al. 2002) Normative dimension: norms of behavior and values internalized by the actors (Stone 2001; Barbieri 2003) Cognitive dimension: set of shared knowledge and information possessed about the problems that the actor or group must deal with, including heuristics owned by individuals and the sharing of common meanings (Stigliz 2000; Barbieri 2003; Zucchetti 2003) Environmental reliability: relates to the trust in the behavior of individuals in a given system, reducing uncertainty on the willingness to cooperate of the other actors and transaction costs (Fukuyama 1995; Mutti 1998; Paldam 2000; Stradi 2003; Zucchetti 2003) Institutions: includes formal and informal institutions, complexes of informal structures, formal rules, and their mechanisms that constitute the rules of human action (Paldam 2000) The relational, normative, and cognitive dimensions are elements of social capital near to the individual actor, that constitute the first level social capital; environmental reliability and institutions represent a problem of collective action, and constitute the second level social capital. There can be a relation of reciprocal reinforcement, or contrarily, a reciprocal weakening between the two levels, depending on the specific configuration observed in the considered context between these elements. At the same time, there is a logical and conditioning relation between the social capital elements. In particular, the relational one is a structural dimension of social capital (Stone 2001; Barbieri 2003): on this base, the actors’ knowledge—the cognitive dimension—can circulate between actors (Stigliz 2000; Lombardo 2003), resulting in norms sharing, environmental reliability, and, at the end, institutional strengthening or transformation. Consider now the case of collective actions, which require the cooperation of many social actors to reach common goals, as the case of public policies implemented in governance systems: evaluation can configure an analysis and learning process (Scriven 1967) that acting properly on relation and knowledge production and sharing—first level social capital—can help in achieving policies objectives. This, in turn, can result in norm sharing, trust, and formal and informal institutions, that is, increase the endowment of second level social capital in the considered context. Evaluation processes are then tools for knowledge sharing and management and they enable organizational learning processes (Rist 1994; Gabbay and Leenders 2001). In the following paragraphs, I analyze the interplay between participatory evaluation and relational dimension of social capital, on one hand and, on the other hand, theory-driven evaluation and social capital.",3

The quality of intra and inter-organizational informational processes are the inputs into the sensemaking process that transforms simple information into knowledge. For Spiegler (2003) and Bhatt (2001), data are raw facts, information is an organized set of data derived from the judgment of an individual or a group, and knowledge is meaningful information that makes it possible to act effectively in a given field. Appropriate conversion of data into knowledge in an organization (or between two organizations) requires introduction of a knowledge management (KM) strategy. The main problem facing a company engaged in such a strategy is making sure that the knowledge created by a team from one of the organization’s departments or by individuals is reusable by other actors in other contexts, contributing to an overall improvement in performance. If information is to travel from one point to another in the organization (or between several organizations), the company cannot afford to ignore the need for reflection on the location of knowledge creation processes, the process of knowledge conversion depending on its nature (explicit or tacit), its level (individual or organizational), and ultimately on its final use. The object of this research is to value creation generated by a company’s information process, and it focuses on the following questions: Can we identify the different phases of the information process that turns operational data into knowledge that is applicable for management? Which activities or stages in the process contribute to value creation? Does a value chain exist in the information process? These questions will be analyzed from a theoretical standpoint and illustrated by a study of an IT service company that specializes in processing commercial information. This company was engaged by a supermarket group to set up management control for jewelry kiosk-style sales outlets, using analysis of commercial data for all its national and international sales outlets. Through this study, we observe a process by which raw data is turned into strategic information for management of the client company (a supermarket retailer) and enhance the models used.",2

The aim of this paper is to analyze how financial risks are disclosed in the balance sheets and related legally required documents used by investors, banks, employees, owners, and other stakeholders to gather information (Bodnar et al. 2013; Bonetti et al. 2012; Campbell et al. 2014; Campbell and Chen 2011; Elshandidy et al. 2013; Miihkinen 2013). This is especially important in the light of the recent economic and financial crisis that started in 2007–2008 in Italy and other European countries. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the existing literature on corporate disclosure by examining a sample of non-financial companies listed on the Italian Stock Exchange in order to explore the quality and degree of information about financial risks contained in their annual reports. To achieve this, in our research, we used a manual content analysis (Guthrie et al. 2004) to measure the amount of financial risk information contained within the annual reports of 50 companies, with the purpose of establishing what the current method is for presenting these financial risks. In selecting our sample, we used a mixed method which included secondary sources such as the Thomson Reuters Datastream and focused on companies listed continuously between 2008 and 2013. Companies, operating in several different business sectors, were extrapolated from this database according to their “net sales or revenues.” For each company, we took their Management Report and analyzed the part covering “information on risks and uncertainties,” and we examined their Notes to the Financial Statements specifically on “risk management.” We also examined any Notes on the Financial Instruments held for to cover risk for the period 2008–2013. We then focused in particular on the sections covering financial risk disclosure for 2013 to verify whether this information had been reported, to what degree, and how it evolved. On the basis of existing literature on risks (Beretta and Bozzolan 2004, 2008; Deumes 2008; Dobler et al. 2011; Hill and Short 2009; Linsley and Shrives 2006; Miihkinen 2013) and the companies’ accounting documents, we first developed a suitable coding scheme or “Grid Risk Report (GRR)” that lists broad content categories and different financial risk items concerning the information related to these categories. Secondly, we matched the words and sentences in the risk sections of the documents with the coding scheme (GRR) and, for each, identified whether or not the risk item was mentioned. One advantage of a manual content analysis is that people are more able to evaluate the meaning of words and phrases within a specific context. One of the disadvantages is that a manual approach is less cost-effective and less flexible. In addition, human raters can make mistakes and are prone to researcher bias. Thirdly, we built a risk disclosure scoring system consisting of one or more indices, and an index of financial disclosure. The findings of this paper reveal the level of disclosure about financial risks and also what is actually disclosed by companies in terms of financial risk indices in their annual reports, over a period marked by financial instability and market turbulence. With the perspective of fully disclosing a company’s performance, the objective of this paper is to present a measure of the quality of the disclosure of financial risks, so that all information presented to investors and managers fully overlaps. Moreover, this empirical research can also identify the most important indices of financial disclosure used by the contemporary companies (Del Giudice et al. 2012, 2013) to integrate the disclosure of their financial risks, with the perspective of extending the analysis to the international field. The paper’s findings have practical implications for both stakeholders and managers and, in particular, will inform investors the features associated to Italian companies that disclose financial risk information in their annual reports in the section on risk information, and managers about the degree of disclosure about financial risks that will satisfy the stakeholders’ demands for disclosure. We can, therefore, formulate our research question as: What is the level of disclosure about financial risks for the sample companies? Does the “Grid Report Risk” fill in any gaps and guide the management in their disclosure about companies’ risks? The article is structured as follows: after the introduction, Literature Review section provides a literary analysis on corporate disclosure and risks. Data and Methodology section describes the research approach. Evidence from Italian Listed Companies section proposes the findings of the research. Discussion and Implications of the Research section provides the discussion and implications of the analysis. Conclusions, Limitations, and Proposal for Future Research section presents the conclusions, limitations, and suggestions for further research.",12

Let Us First Understand the Atoms!,June 2016,Alois Paulin,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Born and raised as a marketing term in mid-‘90s (and in a second wave in the late ‘00s) (Söderström et al. 2014), the “Smart City” remains a reference to a set of broad concepts referring to trends and transformations in the context of modern urban spaces. It partly, but not exclusively (Söderström et al. 2014; Anthopoulos 2015), refers to the utilization of ICT to introduce transformations and enable new value chains on the government to citizen (G → C) relation between the city as a public sphere and the citizens as its customers. Amongst the manifold dimensions of the Smart City concept (Anthopoulos and Fitsilis 2013), the provision of e-governance and e-democracy features on city-level are relevant objectives. As such, Smart City research and development (R&D) activities overlap with the broader domain of e-governance research, whose objective is the computerization and informatization of governance to an extent where latter is hoped to become transformed by means of ICT. R&D and marketing activities of Smart Cities assume cities as homogeneous entities, which provide services to their citizens; based on this premise, IBM’s Smarter Cites campaign (a prominent and potent driver of the Smart City concept) projects the city as a coherent system-of-systems, whose social functions can be automated and orchestrated through a central information system, like e.g. IBM’s Intelligent Operations Center (Söderström et al. 2014). The assumption of a coherent provider of urban social functions however is not aligned with the inherently participative and evolutive nature of the democratic public sphere (the res publica), where heterogeneous stakeholders dynamically interact and participatively shape their habitat. While one may model “the city” as a coherent entity for sake of political or empirical rhetoric, or see the municipal government as a business client respectively, the assumption of a monolithic entity does not serve as a feasible basis for sustainable technological progress. Rather, public domain action (i.e. the provision of social services, public policy making, collaborative decision-making, etc.) is realized by a constantly evolving landscape of heterogeneous stakeholders with often competing ambitions (cf. Downs 1967). The evolutionary and multi-stakeholder nature of public domain action impacts the ability to use traditional software engineering approaches in creating artefacts to automate, or informate, respectively, public domain action that would be able to sustain for future generations (Paulin 2015). In search for a generation-spanning base for informating public domain action, this article aims to find which atomic “nuts and bolts” of governance can be abstracted into the digital world of informatics to serve as a foundation for a generic (i.e. not constrained to a set of predefined use-cases or use-case categories) communicational platform for empowering, steering and supervising public domain action. Leaving visionary ideas of the use of artificial intelligence/government automation or machine-moderated policy-making deliberately aside, this article aims to contribute to following research questions: What are the atomic factors of governance? Can the atomic factors from R1 be informated? To address R1, we shall deploy the instrument of an informed argument to elaborate an overview of knowledge on how public domain empowerment, action, and control are established. We shall restrict the exploration to timeless features of public domain action, rather than focusing on a particular epoch or government system. Question R2 shall be explored by discussing if, and how, respectively, the results from R1 can be abstracted into the digital realm by means of know technology. This article is structured as follows: section 2 provides a general overview over the problem domain of governance informatability and defines the theoretical constraints. As part of this section, the paper aims to drill towards the core principles and constraints of governance, addressing question R1 in section 2.1. Section 3 addresses R2 by analysing and discussing the informatability of the outcome from R1. Section 4 offers a vision of the informated Smart City as a co-productive habitat; section 5 concludes. This paper’s main aim is to open up a novel discussion on the informatability of governance, as a basic prerequisite to enable research and development towards sustainable information systems, standards, and approaches to governance informatization. Considering this, it deliberately avoids any discussion on the effects ICT had so far on urban spaces, city/town-level public administration, and other systems/functions of modern cities. From avoiding such discussion and deliberately assuming a (not necessarily, but potentially, blank-slate) context in which informated governance is introduced to society without the constraints of the legacy of an existing institutional/administrative framework, the expected gain is knowledge on how to “reinvent government” (O’Reilly in (2010)) for the digital age. Likewise, in the context of this discussion any speculation about potential benefit/detriment of governance informatization on humanity shall be avoided, in order not to lose the focus of the treatise. As such, this paper does not aim to contribute to improving/transforming the performance or working conditions of modern government agencies, but rather aims exclusively on providing a theoretical contribution for further research towards digital era governance. The relevance for the Smart City context of these questions lies in the ability to provide a basic understanding for research towards a generic, common platform on top of which modular systems of governance technologies can build. Modular, generic technology can then be bundled to technology stacks (existing examples are e.g. the Web, or Java), which allow for the emergence of virtual ecosystems in which scholars, engineers, and consumer-edge stakeholders can share applied knowledge, co-create and naturally evolve informated governance.

Smart governance is indeed one of the smart city dimensions according to the Giffinger’s model (Giffinger et al. 2007). The use of this term is still quite ambiguous, and in this respect, it must be differentiated by the approach defined in Gil-Garcia et al. (2014), according to which smart governments implement smart governance initiatives. Information gathering, dialogue enablement, decision-making, and assessment are four main participatory process phases included in smart governance platforms. Giving the lack of standardization, a common smart city architecture that serves government purposes for innovation and sustainability has been defined in Anthopoulos (2015). Smart city projects and initiatives have a big impact on the quality of life of citizens. Citizens are the heart of a city and the main actors in a multitude of city challenges faced through ongoing urbanization and demographic growth, consumption habits, and increasing expectations. Therefore, they have to be at the heart of the solution. Citizens have often been insufficiently engaged, motivated, and empowered to contribute. Besides, often cities have not had deep knowledge of their citizens to actively engage them. With a better understanding of their motivations, cities can define effective strategies and tools to push citizens to be actors in smart city systems. The goals should be to stimulate, inform, and educate citizens so that they can act responsibly and proactively. When smartly mobilized, the effect of citizens’ behavior, choices, creativity, and entrepreneurship might be enormous and have a deep impact. Therefore, by increasing innovation capabilities of the social system and by injecting advanced information technologies into it, cities become more open, innovative, efficient, and manageable. The following two factors play a key role in this scenario: (i) ICT, particularly as Internet becomes pervasive (not only through smart phones), and (ii) the willingness to be open towards new citizen-driven initiatives that might not fit with the current administrative system. In this context, the application of Semantic Web technologies on smart cities has an extremely high potential and impact (Bischof et al. 2014) and might provide a tool for the unification and facilitation of data integration from multiple heterogeneous sources. In particular, recently, the linked open data (LOD) initiative has been widely adopted and is now considered the reference practice for sharing and publishing structured data on the Web (Bizer et al. 2009). Since cities usually have large amount of heterogeneous data, Semantic Web best practices are key drivers in the definition of data reengineering, linking, formalization, and use. In Consoli et al. (2015A), we have presented a methodology used to collect, enrich, and publish LOD for the municipality of Catania in the context of the project PlatfoRms Interoperable cloud for SMArt-Government (PRISMA). The city data collection procedure has been illustrated, and the process and issues to create a semantic data model have been analyzed and reported. In more detail, the employed procedures, the ontology design patterns, and the tools used for ensuring the semantic interoperability during the transformation process have been described. The work in Consoli et al. (2015A) is included as one of the components of the smart city framework presented in this paper. The huge amount and variety of data, applications, and projects can be responsible for the creation of high entropy within the smart city domain. It often happens that several actors within a city independently start to develop their own smart initiatives and projects using technological solutions. As an example, a public hospital may develop an online health website and database, a company may supply electric cars to its employers, a municipality might replace old buses with new ones with lower CO2 emission, a public administration (PA) might develop a website for chuckholes reporting, and so on. This example shows four different smart actions performed by four different entities that use ICT solutions to improve quality of life in urban spaces; reduce pollution, CO2 emission, and energy consumption; and to stimulate the reporting of uneven road surface preventing or decreasing chances of accidents. However, the four actions are not embedded within a unique framework whose results can list/collect/stimulate such initiatives, synergistically cooperate towards common goals, and communicate to the citizens the improved smartness of their city. The use of cloud-computing technologies can increase and improve the final outcome of smart city solutions. International Telecommunication Union (ITU) (ITU 2015) has collected a broad theoretical background in order to provide a smart sustainable city ICT meta-architecture that can offer several benefits: (i) lower software development, support, and maintenance costs; (ii) provide more application portability and (iii) interoperability; (iv) enhance smart services; and (v) shorten time-to-market for them. The cloud offers significant computational powerFootnote 1 for decision-making and policy development systems and for the management of data coming from heterogeneous sources and from different domains. However, the cloud-computing paradigm presents some technical challenges due to the interoperability of the cloud systems and to the adoption of reference standards. In this paper, we present an innovative, open, and interoperable cloud-computing citizen engagement platform for smart government that responds to the three questions written above. Our platform enables the construction of models and software involving the urban and metropolitan dimension of PAs and vertical scalable applications accessible through self-service models. The platform simplifies and encourages the promotion and use of ICT technologies by citizens, industries, and PAs. Moreover, it ensures interoperability in terms of possibility of interactions with other systems either cloud or not (it is a cloud-to-cloud infrastructure). To this purpose, the platform exposes a set of standard application programming interfaces (APIs) that enable moving automatically resources and data from and to other platforms. As other cloud-computing platforms, it includes the following three layers: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Whereas the IaaS layer is the backbone concerning the cloud architecture, PaaS and SaaS layers deal directly with the knowledge that can be exploited to improve productivity and to create new products, services, systems, and processes. The development of the platform has been conducted according to the principles of the open source paradigm, and each component has been developed using open source solutions that this paper will detail. We provide information of each layer in the following sections. The produced platform is an outcome of the PRISMA project, a 3-year Italian research project whose goal is to develop an “Italian cloud” for the needs of the PA that can be sustainable over time. The project aims at supporting the definition and adoption of new business models that allow PAs to (i) acquire and port immediately to the cloud every application and service and (ii) let LOD be exploited by small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in order to create new applications capable of delivering services tailored to the specific needs of the citizens. This paper is organized as follows: “Background” section includes background and related work. “The proposed case study” section presents the case study we propose in this paper. It includes the general architecture of the platform developed in PRISMA, the IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS layers, the four applications developed within the SaaS layer and the quality, importance, and impact of the presented platform with its applications and services. Finally, “Concluding remarks” section ends the paper with discussions, limitations of the platform, and future directions where we are headed.",25

Marmaras,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The coasts of the Mediterranean always constituted a melting bowl of cultures emanating from Asia, Africa, and Europe. From the beginning of human existence and through the centuries, different ethnic groups had settled here, exchanging experiences and attitudes, but also creating their own heritage (Braudel 1993:11). The Aegean archipelago constitutes such a cultural Mediterranean “archive”, and specifically the island complex of the Cyclades, situated in its geographic center (Fig. 1). This concerns a total of approximately thirty islands and much more islets, covering an area of 2,571.69 km2, scattered between the Greek and Asia Minor mainland in the northeast edge of the Mediterranean. Particularly, the urban development constitutes, due to the singular historic course of this geographic space, a characteristic example of creative social mixture of endogenous and external factors. In this procedure, a central issue was the need for defensive measures and the creation of a local “customary law”. Satellite view of the Cyclades (Google Earth) Under the term “customary law” is understood the entire legal rules and customs surviving from antiquity till recently that determine the relations between members of a social group. The fact that common customary rules existed in all the Cycladic islands allows us to use, perhaps unduly—since this did not constitute a legal text—the term “customary law of the Cyclades”. With the introduction of any rules of customary law, a new operative framework is installed, that in turn contributes to the “production” of relations and activities, apart from covering needs, are influenced by valid legal rules. With these general thoughts as an introduction, the focus of our research on the relation of the traditional-built environment in the Cyclades with the customary rules in effect during the time it was created, naturally poses the following question: In what degree and in which way the endogenous rules, which were introduced and legalized by the customary law, contributed to the formation of the Cycladic settlements, the sculptured building shapes, and in general the human scale regulating them and finally to what degree they were influenced by outside factors.",

Matevosyan,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Obstetrics is a heavy cost to the U.S. healthcare system. Nationally, childbirth expenditures remain in the top five for condition-related costs. In addition, approaching the needs of two biologically viable patients (mother and fetus) makes obstetrics one of the most litigated health practice in terms of the negligence tort suits. Figure 1 illustrates the National Practitioner Data Bank’s (NRDB) estimates on the increased judgment settlements from 1991 to 2003, involving a physician-defendant in the 50 states. All dollar values are converted to year 2003 currency weight using the implicit Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Price Deflater and are rounded to the nearest dollar (Fig. 1). Average malpractice payments per three time-periods and by area of alleged malpractice As shown in the figure, obstetric is the leading practice visiting the courtroom both by the actual number of legal counts and by increased rate of claims over the last decade. Concerns for liability risk have a major impact on the willingness of the obstetricians and health care institutions to offer the trial of labor (TOL). Many obstetricians act defensively, incorrectly assuming that performing cesarean sections (CS) would help avoiding malpractice litigation. This fear dramatically increases the health expenditures. At the same time, the neonatal and perinatal morbidity or mortality rates remain alarming. Data from Fig. 2 illustrate increased obstetrical costs in billions of dollars (adjusted for inflation) at a rate similar to that of the CS rate increase (Fig. 2). Total hospital cost for the liveborn infants among the top five in 2008 The increased cost of childbirth has a lot to do with the increased number of defensive CS. The United States is the leading country in childbirth expenditures and for cesarean section / vaginal birth (CS/VB) ratio. Exhibit 3 illustrates the International Federation of Health Plans’ report on an average amount in dollars paid for the childbirth in several countries. Amounts paid and presented in the figure are the actual payments agreed by the insurance companies or the payers for services and are lower than billed charges. Amounts shown include routine prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum obstetric care. Some care provided by practitioners other than obstetrician (such as payments for the blood test, X-ray, or ultrasound), are not included in this tally (Fig. 3). Average amount paid for childbirth in 2012 Neonates to elective CS mothers show poorer adaptation skills. Compared with conventional deliveries, planned CS increases transfer rates to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) from 5.2 to 9.8 %. The risk for pulmonary disorders (neonatal transient tachypnoea and respiratory distress syndrome) rise from 0.8 to 1.6 %. Yet, there are no significant differences in the risks for low Apgar score and neurologic symptoms (Kolas et al. 2006). Studies have attempted to model the impact of tort reform on primary and repeat CS rates and have shown that modest improvements in the medical-legal climate may result in reductions of CS (Matevosyan 2013a, b). It is concluded that both caps on noneconomic damages and reductions in physician malpractice premiums would result in fewer CS (NIH Consensus 2010). On top of challenges for the internal construct, there are external threats, such as policy reforms that lessen the economic advantage of the obstetrical practice. Effective January 01, 2012, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act authorized the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create the Medicare Shared Savings Program to enable contracting with Accountable Care Organizations (ACO). The goal of ACO’s is multifold and includes transitioning from fee for service contracts (traditional model) to bundled contracts paying physician, diagnostic, ambulatory care, and hospital in a single fee. ACO’s will pay specialists both for acute care and chronic treatment over a specified interval. ACO’s will promote accountability for a population of patients, coordinate products and services under Medicare parts A and B, encourage investment in infrastructure, and redesigned care processes to achieve high quality and efficient services (Kocher and Sahni 2011). Ultimately such a structure could allow payment for “value” rather than for an endless string of patient visits and admissions; value-based payment would include outcomes for a particular condition per dollar expended. By virtue of capital, preexistence of integrated healthcare delivery services and employed medical providers, it seems likely that large community hospitals and academic medical centers will become the drivers of ACO formation (Berwick 2011). It is the Institution that must make the commitment to forming an ACO. It is then the role of the physician and hospital leadership to develop strategies to cut costs, maintain or improve outcomes, collect, tabulate and report results, and to be competitive within the new reality of the ACO. A tiny percentage of obstetrics is covered by Medicare. But, because Medicaid is also financed by the Federal Government it is highly likely that its payment structure will soon be modified. Hospitals must proactively address the cost of obstetric services along with those of all other service-lines. As a result, it simply does not make sense to remodel care within an institution and leave obstetrics out of the mix. With another political election cycle out of the way, it is clear that the Affordable Care Act will come into effect without significant modification. In December 2011, the Department of Health and Human Services named 32 Pioneer Accountable Care Organizations (see Fig. 4) out of more than eighty applicants (Fig. 4). Pioneer Accountable Care Organizations Any “market wave” is constructed by innovators-inductors, innovation-brokers, and game keepers who buffer a gap between the consumption intertion and consumption agony that demands another innovation (see Fig. 5). So too, in the healthcare market (Fig. 5) The wave of innovation By December 2012, estimates suggest ACO’s cover 31 million patients or about 10 % of the US population.",

It was always dealt with from an ideological angle (Shah et al. 2012). However, this article may be an attempt to conduct a scientific analysis of this subject by presenting the basic principles and foundations of Islamic finance. This topic is treated in different ways. For some people, it is a pure demagogue, puns, or attempt to go backward through modernity medieval practices (Ahma 1995). For others, finance which is based on the principles of (Shari’ah) is a sacred concept, or divine which is a part of cult (Malik et al. 2011). Therefore, it must be the only system that guides Muslim countries in all areas by rejecting any form incompatible with the laws of Islam. Nevertheless, throughout this paper, we will try to avoid going into purely ideological or religious discussions which is very possible, just by recognizing that this finance belongs to a wider concept which is the Islamic economics. It is an economic doctrine, which, like all other doctrines (capitalism, communism, socialism…) differs by its own value system. The system universal values which characterize the Islamic finance respect largely ethical standards. Moreover, the necessity to respond to regulatory requirements and constraints requested by applicable laws (banking laws, financial security, security laws…), Islamic financial institutions are required to agree comply with the requirements and rules specific to this system of values. These values are rooted in the Islamic law or (Shari’ah).",5

This has been recognized over the years and more formal approaches have been developed to encourage more networking and the spread of innovation”. This statement underlines the importance of innovation for the improvement of economic performances of the firm. Historically, innovation has been categorized according to two types of innovation: Radical vs. incremental innovation Product vs. process innovation This basic classification has been revised and enhanced by Pavitt who found that mostly, innovation is a cumulative process within a firm because “its technological trajectories will be largely determined by what it has done in the past, in other words, by its principal activities. Different principal activities generate different technological trajectories” (Pavitt 1984 p. 353). This concept expresses the idea that innovation is an irreversible evolving process due to the capabilities accumulated through a long development process within the enterprise itself and a cluster of enterprises. It follows that a healthy business environment is needed to create a continuous stream of capabilities; this is even truer nowadays since globalization has altered the fundamentals of competitiveness. According to Pavitt’s definition, innovation is a path-dependent process conditioned by the collective memories and the intrinsic factors coming from the environment surrounding the activities and relationships of a firm or cluster of firms. The concept of a “healthy business environment” can be also seen from the Marshallian point of view of “industrial atmosphere” that is a common space shared among interacting agents such as its industry, its people and its organizations, therefore by the community belonging to this local spaceFootnote 1. The creation of competitive advantages and therefore the performance associated to a cluster of enterprises is linked to the exploitation of that specific know-how belonging to a particular space. Given the peculiarities of each community, different trajectories are pursued leading to a creation of those “differences” that Porter assumed to be the basis of competitive advantages. The successful innovation in this context is derived by incremental steps and not by a big jump (radical innovation), because small-medium enterprises do not have the necessary resources to develop radical innovations at the very basis of the process defined by Schumpeter as “creative destruction”.Footnote 2 According to this view, innovation in the large-sized firm is mechanically planned and it does not flow naturally as in the small-medium enterprises may happen. It is here that the concept of Local Collective Entrepreneurship takes place, that is, a way for the small-medium enterprises to overcome this lack of resources and being able to compete in a globalized world. To explain the idea and its economic policies implications behind the above-mentioned concept, before all is necessary to present the characteristics useful to better understand the recent phenomenon called “the globalization of markets”.",3

Dubina et al. (2012), for example, point out that coevolution of knowledge, creativity, and innovation, and of knowledge economy and knowledge society set the background for investments in innovation that drive economic growth. Many studies have concluded that being innovative has become one of the most important factors for organisations in sustaining their competitiveness (e.g. Bernstein and Singh 2006; Rohrbeck and Gemünden 2011). The competitiveness and advantage of an innovative organisation lies in its adaptive capacity to associate and incorporate different knowledge and innovation modes via coevolution, co-specialisation and co-opetition knowledge stock and flow dynamics (Carayannis and Campbell 2009). Likewise, studies have found that organisations who manage to reconfigure their capabilities and organisational processes are able to innovate and therefore, compete and survive in the global competitive landscape (Carayannis et al. 2014). These arguments show that innovation is essential for companies to generate long-term stability, growth, shareholder returns, sustainable performance, maximised employee contentment and a sustained position at the leading edge of the industry (Cottam et al. 2001; Van der Panne et al. 2003). The success rate of new service projects is on average 58 % (Griffin 1997). In other words, four out of ten new services fail in the market place. The empirical studies, which have investigated the success factors at the project level, indicated that success or failure is not the result of managing one or two activities very well; it is the result of a holistic approach, managing several aspects competently and in a balanced manner (Johne and Storey 1998). Firms that innovate are more likely both to increase their sales and to expect to increase their sales in the future than are non-innovating firms (Hipp et al. 2000). Likewise, firms that fail to innovate will not be threatened in the short-term, but their ability to grow will slow down and therefore, organised continuous innovation efforts are required (Fitzsimmons and Fitzsimmons 2008; Blumentritt et al. 2005). The majority of NSD research has concentrated on the financial service sector, and one of the largest industries worldwide, the health industry, has not been specifically investigated. Success factors for new services are in general similar to those for new product development; only the potency of the factors differ (Cooper and de Brentani 1991, Kitsios et al. 2009). This can be explained by the nature of services, which are intangible, heterogeneous, perishable and where production and consumption are inseparable (Zeithaml and Bitner 2000). For example, the healthcare industry is characterised by constant change, as major innovations have altered the forms in which health services are developed and health care is delivered (Bowers 1987). Hospitals are often leaders in innovation and adaptation to change, as new treatments emerge almost everyday, and cutting-edge technology forces science to move forward. Duncan and Breslin (2009, p. 13) conducted a study pointing out that health service providers lack sufficient incentive to provide care in highly innovative ways even if they were to show better outcomes. Although their research was formed in the U.S., the results are valid for other countries as well. For example, the Greek healthcare system is highly bureaucratic and inefficient in resources management (Grigoroudis et al. 2012, Bellou 2010), resulting in a hesitance on the side of entrepreneurs to implement innovative processes and to develop new ventures. Considering that corporations operate in a very insecure, highly competitive and globalised environment, they should always make efforts to differentiate their offerings in order to obtain corporate survival, wealth creation and growth. This fierce international competition along with the rapid technological evolution and the advancing expectations of consumers has led to phenomenal changes in service industries (Storey and Hull 2010). Enterprises, therefore, need to create and sustain competitive advantages and continuously innovate, adopting new processes, creating novel ideas, developing, and launching successful new outcomes. This is supported by many authors including Porter (2004), De Jong and Vermeulen (2003) and Kelly and Storey (2000). In addition to the reasons why firms should develop new products, it should be noted that hospitals, for example, must develop new services to extend the time people live or to enhance the quality of living by curing severe illnesses. Therefore, companies should implement different and interdependent market research techniques, such as customer observation, experimentation and selective partnering to ascertain customers’ needs and supply them with the proper products, creating at the same time superior customer value (Slater and Narver 1998). It is also widely recognised that customer-oriented businesses heighten customer satisfaction and deliver better service quality (e.g. Fuchs and Schreier 2011; Hartline et al. 2000). This is true as companies aim to collect information about their customers in an attempt to understand and better serve their needs (Malhotra and Kubowicz-Malhotra 2011). On the other hand, many scholars identify corporate entrepreneurship as an organisational capability that promotes entrepreneurial behaviour within organisations in order to overcome internal barriers, challenge bureaucracy and encourage innovation through novel business schemes (e.g. Salvato et al. 2009; McFadzean et al. 2005). Other researchers recognised corporate entrepreneurship as an applicable method for organisational survival and corporate competitiveness (e.g. Dess et al. 2003; Kazanjian et al. 2001). According to Covin and Miles (1999), various forms of newness—such as organisational renewal and product or process innovation that reinstate the organisation—produce competitive advantages and lead to business survival. As a component of corporate entrepreneurship, corporate venturing has become a core concept in the strategic planning of some organisations as a means of achieving long-term growth and competitive advantages (Korsgaard and Anderson 2011; Husted and Vintergaard 2004). Corporate venturing is a strategy for business development, linked to both novelty and corporate renewal, and is accomplished by starting a business within an organisation (e.g. Narayanan et al. 2008). Furthermore, corporate venturing concerns investment in high-risk activities frequently related to those of the parent organisation, which introduce new products or enter into new markets, establishing new companies (Narayanan et al. 2008; Elfring and Foss 1997). Corporate venturing initiatives may lead to investments with a high growth potential or to constitutional changes in the core business of the parent corporation by expanding its operation into different industries (e.g. Husted and Vintergaard 2004). Similarly, corporate venturing compels strategic change, increases firms’ profits and conduces to the consecution of their corporate strategy (e.g. Zahra and Hayton 2008). Despite the importance of both entrepreneurship and customer orientation in the healthcare market, little has been written on either subject. The present study focuses on the health services industry in Greece. In recent years, the industry has experienced great change following mergers of organisations operating in the three wider sectors (general clinics, obstetrical and gynaecological clinics and diagnostic centres). This has resulted in the growth of healthcare groups offering a full range of diagnostic and treatment services. As the market for private health care has grown, so too has the competition between organisations, each trying to offer better service quality, promptness and facilities than one another. Especially in the mental health sector, it becomes apparent that there is a noteworthy improvement in the areas of decentralisation of mental health services (Madianos et al. 1999). Yet, there is much still to be done in terms of quality and delivery of mental healthcare services. What is more, the mental health service sector is not very highly exploited. There are few private independent hospitals of this kind across Greece, even though the public sector appears not to satisfy the needs of the patients. The purpose of this paper is to extend the discussion held in first part of the research (Sindakis 2013) and explore further the literature presenting the linkages between corporate venturing and innovation in health care as well as the factors in customer orientation affecting the success of new health service development. The present study undertakes a critical approach to innovation and entrepreneurship opportunities in the mental health sector, reflecting on joint ventures, dissemination of expertise and knowledge, delegation of initiatives to multiple agents, power sharing and research evidence. Together with developing a conceptual model for innovation in mental health services, the need for change in organisational culture and the strategies for the growth of user initiatives are considered. This research responds to calls for the further development and investigation of the concepts of customer participation in the new service development process as well as of the link between innovation and entrepreneurship (e.g. Jones and Butler 1992; Melton and Hartline 2010). It also attempts to bring the promising lens of entrepreneurship to the still emerging field of health service innovation.",13

Instead of focusing on an individual firm or entrepreneur, RIS theory emphasizes how innovation results from the interaction between actors in regional contexts, especially between enterprises in networks or clusters, and between these enterprises, R&D institutions, and local government. The term interaction is here used in a broad sense, involving not only the number and frequency of contacts but also their type and quality, that is, their whole institutional, epistemic, and social fabric. The same emphasis on institutional, epistemic, and social fabric is found in research on the internal dynamics of innovative enterprises in the workplace innovation literature. For instance, research has identified a strong correlation between how enterprises are organized in terms of hierarchies, participation, and problem solving, and how they innovate (Høyrup Pedersen 2012). Thus, the relatively egalitarian work culture found in the Nordic countries, with a large number of highly qualified employees who exercise a high degree of autonomy and participation in workfloor decisions, has been demonstrated to promote a culture of continuous innovation, particularly of an incremental kind. That is, such organizations promote small, stepwise improvements over time, resulting in high-quality products and services that make the Nordic region competitive in spite of high wage and tax levels (Asheim 2011; Arundel et al. 2007). Thus far, however, few studies have explored the connections between the two fields of institutional, epistemic, and social fabric defined above—i.e., the field represented by the system and that represented by the individual enterprise. Although the claim that such connections exist may be considered a commonplace, few studies have explored more specifically how these work in practice, and if they do, they operate mainly at a macro level and not at the meso and micro level where the internal spaces of the enterprises involved become visible. The present study addresses this research gap, first by establishing a perspective of continuity between the RIS, considered as a system of interaction between individual enterprises and collaborating organizations, and the internal spaces of these organizations. More specifically, while taking RIS theory as its starting point and exploring how organizations within an RIS interact, this study does not treat these organizations as its smallest units of analysis but extends its investigation into the internal spaces of these units with their institutional, epistemic, and social fabric. Focusing in particular on the internal spaces of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), it aims to explore how their inhabitants interact among themselves, as well as with inhabitants of other spaces representing other system units. In other words, it aims to identify the relevant interactions, processes, and structures involved in an innovation as one continuous and coherent process, whether taking place within one particular enterprise or involving individuals from other organizations in addition. This study also seeks to explore the key dimensions and aspects of such processes and structures. On this background, it poses the following research questions: What sort of interaction takes place between individuals inside and outside of an SME when it innovates, within the context of an RIS? What types of knowledge are involved in this interaction, how are they developed and shared, and what is their function in the innovation process? In order to answer these questions, a qualitative, explorative case study of nine SMEs in a specific region in Norway has been designed. This design is based on the following considerations: The fact that each SME in the study constitutes a case means that the dynamics of the RIS are explored from within the individual enterprises. This opens up for a critical perspective of the RIS due to the fact that enterprise representatives, whose main loyalty is to their enterprise, will probably perceive and evaluate their RIS differently from system members whose loyalties lie more with the system itself, such as cluster organization managers or regional government representatives. The regional basis of the study relates to the methodological norm of context sensitivity, maintaining that local conditions need to be taken into account when attempting to understand the workings of regional innovation systems and, at a later point, also when translating research findings into policy. Finally, even if a qualitative, explorative case study cannot in itself confirm the validity of a general theory, the thick descriptions typically produced from such studies may nevertheless supply valuable insights from which suggestions for theoretical revisions, modifications, or extensions may be inferred. Some such suggestions will be presented in the discussion section of this paper in addition to some policy implications.",8

Abdalla Alfaki,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Many countries have now embarked on changing from a resource-based economy to a knowledge-based one; several real examples can be cited in this respect including the economies of Malaysia and Thailand, in addition to other newly emerging transition economies Gelb (2010). A well-educated population, skills-abundance, and knowledge are the primary raw materials for knowledge-based economies. Evidence from international assessments suggests that some developing countries and transition economies lag significantly behind industrial countries in providing their population with the skills needed in the knowledge-economy (World 2003). The dangers and problems of having large numbers of citizens who are neither sufficiently well-educated nor well enough trained to take part in the new economy are becoming increasingly apparent, Kendall and Kendall (2009). Transferring people with requisite skills and knowledge to places where technology is needed represents an effective way to achieve technology transfer. However, to ensure that technology is successfully transferred and efficiently used, a broader aspect of technology transfer calls for the transfer of fundamental scientific and technological knowledge and skills to a large number of people required in the work place, Kendall and Kendall (2009). It is worth mentioning that the use of science and transferred technology should be linked with improvement of living conditions and quality of life as well as protection of the environment without compromising economic goals. One important aspect of the manufacturing sector in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is its labor intensive nature, with relatively low labor productivity due to high dependency on unskilled and relatively inexpensive foreign labor supply, Ahmed and Abdalla Alfaki (2013). However, recognizing educational problems and the lack of technological knowledge and skills among the labor force, the UAE government future short- and long-term strategies (e.g., UAE Vision 2021 and Abu Dhabi Economic Vision 2030) are advocating a move towards a diversified competitive economy that focuses on knowledge-based industries and technology products. Realization of these strategies entails investments in acquisition of advanced technologies and development of technological skills and high competency in the workforce (World Bank 2005; Allam and Abdalla Alfaki 2013). According to Seyoum (2004), a good measure of a country’s competitiveness in high technology is the presence of substantial and sustained exports in high-technology sector. Reich (2004) regards high-technology industries as the future’s primary source of wealth generation as opposed to resource and labor capital-intensive industries that dominated the twentieth century. Several factors that affect the level and size of technology transfer in an economy are discussed in the literature; these include the country’s technological infrastructure, level of available education, and training to increase the capacities to assimilate, adapt, modify, and generate technology, attraction of foreign direct investment (FDI), and utility of foreign licensing. It is argued that countries’ success in the transfer and the efficient use of technology rely largely on their ability to provide domestic production of technology and equipment sufficient to cater for domestic needs and to reduce demand and dependency on foreign technology accelerates. This would most likely reduce the negative impact of technology importation on the national balance of trade (Bachellerie 2010). Akubue (2002) noted the massive but passive importation of technology by the Third World countries, referring to the tendency of these countries to adopt technological innovations without modification. He further argued that such arrangements could be the result of a strategy of the donor countries aimed at making Third World countries continuously rely on them for maintaining the new technology. In addition to profiting from technology maintenance, through this strategy of technology transfer, the donor country might also gain an additional advantage over purchasing raw material, such as oil and minerals, or gaining political influence in the recipient country. Using data gathered from different international sources, Seyoum (2005) reviewed the change in international trade over the last two decades and highlighted the fast growth in exports of technology-intensive products (high-technology goods such as aerospace, computers, and machineries) compared to other products. He identified three factors that positively influence a country’s level of high-technology exports, namely, technological physical and dynamic human base infrastructure, home demand conditions or sophistication of buyer needs, and attraction of quality inward investment that allow for sophisticated activities and functions. He further noted that technology developments cannot always be realized just through domestic innovation activities, greater productivity gains are often the result of foreign technology acquired through foreign direct investment (FDI), licensing, or acquisition of high-technology firms. Employing the data collected from various international sources, Lee and Tan (2006) investigated FDI and technology intensities in four of the ASEAN economies, namely, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia. Their results ranked Singapore as a leader of the four counties in not just attracting FDI, but also in channeling the most modern technological knowledge and skills. The authors attributed this high competitiveness mainly to the Singaporean government speed, efficiency, and flexibility. Malaysia ranked top of the other three counties in FDI and technology transfer intensities. Contrary to the other three countries, the analysis presented a clear evidence that the Malaysian experience in technology transfer has largely benefited from FDI, international trade, and the capacity of the economy. This has led to a significant impact on economic growth. The local capabilities, domestic activities, together with heightening of competition among foreign and local investors have further contributed to greatly enhanced technology transfer into the country. The authors concluded that for countries to reap full benefits of FDI and technology transfer, they should understand its magnitude in terms of determinants and modes of transfer. This would provide for clear policies and strategies to upgrade technological capabilities, rather than just attracting FDI and technology per se. The focus should mainly be on effective transfer, diffusion, and domestic generation of technology. The objectives of this study are two folds; first, to review and discuss the realization of important factors of technology transfer and factors of exports and imports of technology products within the UAE context, highlighting strengths and weaknesses. Technology products are defined as those products that employ technology-aided manufacturing. The second objective is to empirically investigate the size of technology transfer and the level of reliance of the UAE on technology importation based on studying the country’s trade balance of technology products. The expositions are intended to understand the dynamic of technology transfer and technology exports in the UAE, and to describe, understand trend, and make predictions and forecasts of the gap (deficit) between the UAE exports and imports of technology products using time series data and methodology. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 details the research methodology outlining data sources, analysis methods, and modeling techniques. Section 3 presents a brief UAE economic background analysis, review, and assessment of several factors of technology transfer and technology products exports and imports. Sections 4 and 5 present results of fitted dynamic models intended to describe trend and forecast the size of the gap between UAE technology exports and imports. Section 6 concludes the paper and draws some recommendations and policy implications.",3

It is necessary in the socio-economic integration of the different regions of the country in that it reduces the use of passenger cars by improving the mobility of the citizens through the trip punctuality and the shortening of the journey times (especially this “home to work”) so as to reduce the fuel consumption and traffic jams. In Tunisia, the public transport sector is composed of 12 regional public transport companies (RTCs), each of which covers two or three governorates excepting that of Sfax. This is a public service, the policies of which are decided by the regulatory authority (Ministry of Transport). The operating activity is carried out by a public operator. The regulatory authority is responsible for setting the pricing policy and determining the amount of the offer, the employment level and the nature of funding. It is also responsible for the technical control of the means of transport and the implementation and management of the infrastructure. The relationships between the two parties providing the transport services are defined by a programme contract that determines the reciprocal commitments of both the State and the operator (in operations, financial and social policy) to ensure mass transport. The latter should respect the public service obligations as the State requires the operator to comply with tariff equalization and well-defined social cuts: school children, disabled people and military men…., which can lead to a revenue shortfall that must be compensated by the State in the form of a subsidy. This deficit in the recipe does not judge economic efficiency in the industry in a relevant way. For this reason, we will opt for the frontier theory as a solution to determine the level of performance in every company. Therefore, we may wonder if these RTCs perfectly optimize their production costs. However, the degree of cost efficiency of the public transport system can be explained by the quality of the governance structure adopted by the organizing authority and the type of used regulations especially in the underdeveloped and developing countries (M’raihi 2001). What are then the inefficiency factors of public transport in Tunisia? The main goal of this study is twofold. Initially, using the non-parametric approach (“data envelopment analysis (DEA)” method), we will determine the economic efficiency scores of the public transport system in Tunisia. Then, in a second part, we will evaluate the inefficiency factors of public transport. Therefore, this paper focuses on a literature review of various studies on public transport (“Literature Review”). Then, it presents the efficiency measure using the DEA method. The “Methodology” section is about the research methodology for the parts of the study (the sample, the model shape and the measuring variables). Finally, to complete analysis, an empirical application should be performed on the Tunisian public transport network.",

Ierapetritis,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Mesta is a local community found at the southwest of Chios, a Greek island of the northeast Aegean Sea, just opposite the Asia Minor coast. The village, which was granted to the Genoese by the Byzantine Empire, was designed and built by the Genoese that lived there from the end of the fourteenth century until the beginning of the fifteenth century. Mesta was 1 out of 21 mastic villages (Mastichochoria), an economic network of communities that focussed on the cultivation of the unique product of mastic, the resin of the mastic tree (Pistacia lentiscus L. var. chia), to which many beneficial properties and uses had already been attributed in antiquity. Historically, the island was handed over from the Genoese to the Ottoman Empire before it was finally annexed to the Greek state. Throughout the aforementioned period, Mesta has preserved its medieval town structure intact, as opposed to the majority of similar small communities located both in Chios and in other parts of Greece. Even nowadays, the village still has the same main activity and the very same town structure that was created by the Genoese in the fifteenth century. The present essay deals with exactly those socio-political circumstances that have allowed preserving the town’s medieval character throughout the years. More specifically, this paper unfolds the influential role of mastic cultivation to the implementation of a systematic urban planning concept throughout the years. Furthermore, it assesses the effectiveness and range of mastic cultivation within the framework of three specific time-periods as well as the respective administration systems developed, in order to create the town’s current identity. This approach will contribute to conclusions on whether the town’s growth potential will allow its preservation as a cultural monument of Greece.",

A Study of the Potential Role of Human Resource Managers in Learning and Innovation,September 2016,Dorothy Sutherland Olsen,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The method chosen is the literature review, defined as ‘a written document that presents a logically argued case founded on a comprehensive understanding of the current state of knowledge about a topic of study’. (Machi and McEvoy 2009:4). When studying the relationship between multiple themes, a systematic review of all publications is not appropriate. In this case, the study consists of two stages: firstly, a search of major literary sources was carried out. Firstly, we reviewed key texts on organisational learning in an attempt to find what they said about HRM. These texts were identified by studying reviews of organisational learning literature such as Levitt and March (1988), Dodgson (1993) and Wang and Ahmed (2003) and recent anthologies on the theme, such as Dierkes et al. (2001) and Easterby-Smith and Lyles (2011). Based on these, reviews and key contributors were identified. The next phase was concentrated on finding theoretic works and empirical studies of HRM related to innovation. This was done by searching databases containing academic publications within social sciences, including management and economics. The search was designed to pick up publications within innovation management and organisational studies. The terms chosen were the general terms used in the organisational management and innovation literature referring to firms, innovation and HRM or human resource management. A search was carried out of the following EBSCO databases: Academic Search Premier, Business Source Elite, CINAHL, EconLit, ERIC, Regional Business News and SocINDEX. The search terms used were: Innovation AND (firm* OR compan*) AND (PERSONNEL management OR ‘human resource management’) AND learning. This gave us a list of 19 publications between 2006 and 2015 on HRM. Thereafter, publications have been analysed to ascertain if they are descriptive studies of HRM activities related to learning and innovation or if they attempt to demonstrate a link between learning and innovation. The main theoretical directions are summarised and the empirical findings discussed. This paper does not provide a synthesis of studies on the themes, but instead, it selects and discusses the important ideas and arguments which have emerged in recent years relating to the themes of HRM, learning and innovation in the context of the firm. Therefore, the works discussed here in more detail have been chosen because they provide insight into issues relating to innovation, ‘in all its particularity and ordinariness’ (Onwuegbuzie et al 2012:7). The way in which these articles have been studied is that the main theme has been identified and the links to theories of innovation have been studied more closely; then, these have been compared and discussed. This method is summarised in the table below (Fig. 1). Overview of analytical method",2
7.0,3.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,07 July 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-015-0249-4,"Strategic Knowledge Management, Innovation and Performance: A Qualitative Study of the Footwear Industry",September 2016,Carla Susana Marques,Carmem Leal,Ana Rita Cardoso,Female,Unknown,Female,Female,"In recent years, knowledge has become so central to everything we do that we take it for granted. Ours is a knowledge society in which a ‘knowledge-based economy’ plays a crucial role. This role is nowhere more prominent than at the organisational level (Velmurugan 2010) and, above all, in organisations operating in global contexts, such as business enterprises. Indeed, knowledge has become the key competitive advantage of any organisation. Owners and managers alike have come to realise that the individuals who work for their organisations constitute their most vital asset. They understand that organisations that have already changed themselves from knowledge users to knowledge producers must now transform themselves into communities in which the knowledge acquired in organisational learning processes in the past and present can become a source of future value. In short, as Velmurugan (2010, p. 319) stated, ‘[Knowledge] has come to play a predominant role in defining the productive power of corporations.’ In business and academic communities, it has become a cliché to exhort enterprises to adopt innovative processes (e.g. in production, research and development, marketing and logistics, as well as in management itself). In this way, they can competitively adapt themselves to changing markets and, thereby, gain larger market shares and enter new markets. In recent years, a small number of studies have addressed the relationship between strategic knowledge management (SKM) and innovation performance in organisations (López-Nicolás and Meroño-Cerdán 2011; Jiménez-Jiménez and Sanz-Valle 2011; Choi et al. 2008). These have demonstrated how crucial it is for firms to manage the knowledge at their disposal if they want to establish and consolidate competitiveness in a global market. So far, however, the footwear industry has not been studied, perhaps because of its still somewhat (if increasingly undeserved) traditional image in many European countries. It is worth noting that, in the 1990s, Portugal’s footwear industry, along with other examples worldwide, recovered from an acute crisis and restructured itself, and it has successfully made the transition from a low-cost mass producer of cheap shoes to an export-oriented powerhouse of fashion (APICCAPS 2013, 2014). Despite facing challenges within national and international macroeconomic frameworks, the Portuguese footwear industry is expanding, which suggests that it is implementing appropriate strategies (BP 2012). In the last 3 years, there has been a global slowdown in economic growth and a deep recession in the eurozone, with gross domestic products contracting in 2012 and 2013. For a highly export-oriented industry such as footwear, with exports mostly directed towards Europe, the crisis imposed an extremely unfavourable environment for further external expansion (APICCAPS 2014). In these unpromising circumstances, the industry asserted itself, yet again, as a mainstay of the Portuguese economy (APICCAPS 2013; BP 2012). Between 2010 and 2012, contrary to the national recession, the sector managed to increase both its employment and output significantly: 10 and 20 %, respectively, according to its employers’ association, APICCAPS (2013). According to the same source, there are 1354 footwear firms with a total of 35,355 employees, suggesting that, on average, the bulk of these firms are small rather than medium-sized. The industry’s exports are growing over 7 % annually, and they account for 96 % of total production. Portugal is second only to Italy in the international ranking of average footwear export prices, with prices rising 25 % between 2006 and 2012, placing the former country in seventh position in terms of worldwide export values, although it is ranked twenty-first in terms of volume. In achieving this position, an enhanced focus on innovation and design has greatly contributed to gaining a larger market share and consolidating the positive image of Portuguese footwear worldwide. A strong geographical concentration is one of the most striking characteristics of the Portuguese footwear industry, which is usually considered one of its strengths as it favours the diffusion of knowledge and the development of strong and resilient formal and informal business networks. This provides the basis for an industry cluster, understood as ‘a geographical concentration of firms and other interrelated institutions together in a particular field that compete but also cooperate’ (Porter 1998, p. 199).Footnote 1
 Based on this preliminary background information, the present paper seeks to (1) understand the importance of SKM in firms, (2) assess the impact of this strategy on innovation generated within firms, (3) evaluate the impact that this strategy, directly and indirectly, has on the firms’ performance and (4) define the variables that compose each of the three categories studied, identifying which are the most important in this sector. To achieve these goals, this paper focuses on the first phase of a study in which we opted for a qualitative methodology, conducting semi-structured interviews with the chief executive officers (CEOs) of three firms and three academic specialists in SKM. These interviews sought to evaluate the relationships between SKM strategies (above all, aspects related to codification and personalisation) and their consequences for innovation (i.e. technological and non-technological) and for firms’ performance (i.e. financial and non-financial). Compared to previous studies, the contribution of the research presented here lies in that it is a qualitative study of the views and experiences of the three CEOs of leading firms in this sector (focusing on innovation and performance) and three academic specialists. It, thereby, provides further knowledge of each category and subcategory defined based on the literature reviewed and identifies new variables in each of the categories, which can be adjusted for the sector in question (based on the CEOs’ experiences and the academics’ opinions). The introduction of variables not considered in previous studies allowed us to explore new relationships and achieve a deeper understanding of the strategic role of knowledge management in a sector that is expected to continue making a quite important contribution to Portugal’s balance of trade during the current economic recovery. The paper is structured as follows. After this introduction, we discuss the theories supporting SKM and their effects on innovation and organisational performance. After detailing some methodological considerations, we present and discuss the results of the study, concluding with a reflection on its main limitations, implications for management practice and potential future avenues of research.",17

Although previous research has outlined both external and internal factors that affect competitor identification, few studies examine conditions where the market and environment are volatile. Prior studies suggest that firms tend to perceive only target firms with comparable capabilities (Chen 1996). Moreover, the number of competitors perceived by a firm is positively associated with its strong customer ties. Firstly, strong customer ties provide firms with critical competitive information about the necessary market competencies. Secondly, strong customer ties, which typically involve high levels of trust and mutual forbearance, not only greatly reduce the transaction costs associated with the alliance but also promote information exchange about competitors. The small businesses of the Marche area, in the sectors examined, even for the simple fact of having placed themselves on the international market, have inserted themselves into the processes of international growth of technological knowledge and into some forms of international marketing knowledge related to the technological content of the products/concepts that they offer (Morschett et al. 2010). Knowledge is a key source of competitive advantage that differentiates firms’ performance according to the differences in their knowledge resources, developed in manufacturing and research and development (R&D) activities. Knowledge assets are systems which can be both human and technology-based that function to manipulate knowledge resources; knowledge growth processes consist of various configurations of knowledge manipulation conducted by the research-oriented works belonging to the productive and R&D activities (Holsapple and Wu 2011). It is assumed, therefore, that the production activities abroad will be able to meet a new demand (for the company) expressed by different segments in the business markets (domestic and foreign) to the ones that are currently served. The enterprises from the Marche Region that internationalise do not choose, as was the case in the past, to start manufacturing plants in similar contexts (countries). It seems ultimately that in medium-sized multinationals (MSMs) of the Marche, as noted in other studies for multinational enterprises (Ambos et al. 2006), the ‘similarity of context’—in particular the organisational and cultural similarity—is certainly recognised as an important competitive factor and it can offer many benefits, but it does not necessarily also guarantee a transfer of more effective and dynamic know-how from the foreign site to the parent company. We want especially to draw attention to the fact that also smaller companies that do not have the organisational and financial structures of their multinational corporations (MNCs) may be awarded a major role in global processes of growth of technological knowledge. When the benefits of exploiting extant competencies eventually erode, firms adopt new entrepreneurial and organisational choices to explore new international competitive advantages. This paper focuses on the impact that moving between exploitation and exploration can have on a firm’s innovative performance. A common perspective is that consistent R&D investment facilitates innovation. We suggest that such transitions between exploration and exploitation are critical and are observable as significant strategic changes in a firm’s choices regarding R&D investments that occur within relatively small time windows. As far as the methodology adopted in the development of the research is concerned, I would like to underline the fact that, during the different phases, both inductive and deductive methodologies are used, principally adopting a ‘positive-interpretative’ approach. In contrast to many extant studies of MSMs, both survey and objectively measured data are combined, and because the secondary data collected contain both resource-level (input) data and subsequent 1-year financial data, a higher level of confidence may be attributable to our findings. As far as the structure of this work is concerned, in the first part, a deeper analysis of the international managerial literature is carried out, in order to place the study within the framework of the main research threads. After an overview of the growing literature on internal and external R&D strategies of firms, some hypotheses for research that we are studying are also formulated. These hypotheses concern the most representative business cases, among those analysed, in the mechanical and electronic sectors, that represent a privileged research laboratory. Following this, the results that emerge from the empirical research are highlighted. In essence, they regard the strategies of internationalisation of production and R&D activities.",2
7.0,3.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,12 December 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-014-0235-2,Performance Measurement of Technology-Production Base of the Firms: Ascertaining Their Strategic Competitive Advantage,September 2016,Panayiotis Sioutis,Konstantinos Anagnostopoulos,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The investigation of success and failure of economies and firms were and continue to be a timely and controversial issue for discussion. On the question, “why some firms succeed where others fail?,” there is no general answer. Every era has its own answers. However, since in the current era the growth of economies is generally based on technology and is rapidly affected by its changes, the success of the firms depends more and more on intangible resources like knowledge, manufacturing competencies and skills, innovation, and dynamic capabilities, which strategically determine the competition and their position in the market. To survive and prosper under conditions of change, firms must develop the ‘dynamic capabilities’ to create, extend, and modify the ways in which they make their living (Helfat et al. 2007). The dynamic capabilities and their strategic character as a competitive advantage and also their resource-based perspective shaped a distinguished field of study that strongly affects the theory as well as the current practice of the firms (Porter 1980, 1985; Teece et al. 1997; Teece 2009; Helfat et al. 2007; Penrose 1959/2009). However, the concept of dynamic capabilities, despite of its importance, remains a generic notion (it covers a wide semantic level), which is not specified in an understandable and easy to take way through the practical operations of an enterprise (Helfat et al. 2007). Guiding by this view, the formulation of the term “Technology-Production Base” (TPB) of the firm aims to the practical definition of the dynamic capabilities that build the distinctive competencies of manufacturing firms to create and make things. Thus, the TPB of the firm is defined as the “human-technological field of dynamic capabilities,” on the one hand, of adaptability in the use of technology by which things are made (production technology) and, on the other hand, of innovativeness in developing technology for manufacturing new products, at the level of individual firm. That is, the TPB is the dynamic mechanism of man–machine interaction through which the human technical skills are developed adaptively in the use and advancement of the existing production technology, and on the other hand, the technology knowledge and the applications in technology creation are developed incrementally at the level of individual firm. Furthermore, it is important to be clarified that the concept of TPB takes into account the wider meaning of the word “technology” that is defined by the two ancient Greek component words, techne and logos, which means respectively “the ability of making things” and “the knowledge of making things” (Anagnostopoulos and Sioutis 2010). Having the above thoughts in mind, our next concern is focused on the exposure of the firms to a global fluidity of dynamic market competition and to conflicts without borders and national protection rules (governmental regulations). In the current globalized economic environment, as the manufacturing products are developed rapidly, and in parallel, the processes and the technologies of production are developed rapidly, too, the price of the end-user product plays less and less role in the market. It occurs because the high productivity achieved by the TPB of the firms efficiently reduces the production cost per product unit. That which is yet more important to the enterprises is to produce new technology products and also to develop the technology innovation. As a result, the competition is shifted from the prices and costs to the ability of the firm to create and produce new technology products, that is, the dynamic human-technological capabilities of the firm. In the world of the globalized markets, if you have not a proper product, you have nothing. It is obvious that the TPB of the firms is that which creates and makes the products. Thus, the above-described global competition is a competition of the TPB of the firms. This core competition sets compulsorily the TPB of the firms at the center of the corporate strategy regarding it as its main objective. By this fundamental ascertainment, it is necessary to be researched the measurable constituents of a firm’s TPB, so that the strategy-focused manufacturing to be able to be planed and also to be measured its efficiency as strategic objective and competitive weapon of the total corporate strategy. Having all above in mind, the present study is aligned towards their direction.",1

The “learning economy” is a stage of the socio-economic progress of developed countries, in which knowledge is a main resource, while learning is the most important process of integration of new knowledge and competences (Lundvall and Johnson 1994; Freeman 1995; Edquist 1997) that enhance the capacity of firms to produce innovations. There is a great variety of firms in the market. In order to analyze such variety in more systematic form, there is a need for establishing taxonomies or, in other words, groups of firms according to specific and reasonable criteria. The analysis of “the knowledge-based firm” requires taxonomies that focus on their knowledge base. Lorenz and Lundvall (2007) argue that current types of taxonomies, which distinguish between firms operating on the basis of analytic and synthetic knowledge (Asheim and Coenen, 2005), or on the basis of high and low-technology are problematic. During times of dramatic changes in technologies and production, such distinctions tend to become blurred. Jensen et al. (2007) introduced a taxonomy, which distinguishes between the science, technology, and innovation (STI) and doing, using, and interacting (DUI) modes of innovation. The first mode emphasizes the scientific and technology-based nature of innovation. The second mode is based on experience and interactive practice. The third mode is a combination of the former two modes. The seminal study of Jensen et al. (2007) bridges the gap between the linear approach to innovation and the systems, which entails interactions (Leydesdorff 2012) and practice. Recently, the debate on the most effective mode of innovation and types of collaboration has attracted interest among scholars around the world (Jensen et al. 2007; Aslesen et al. 2012; Parrilli and Elola 2012; Fitjar and Rodriguez-Pose 2013; Gonzalez-Pernia et al. 2014). Even within the same theoretical framework, studies can vary in methodology design, data collection method and, consequently, the findings are contradicting. This study aims to provide a more comprehensive analysis and synthesis of studies on the STI and DUI modes of innovation and collaboration within these modes. We conducted a grounded meta-analysis (Glaser and Strauss 1967; Strauss and Corbin 1994; Hossler and Scalese-Love 1989) that enables to combine both quantitative and qualitative studies, extract comparable categories from the studies, and compare studies from standpoints of research purposes, methods, and results. This paper provides a grounded meta-analysis of the existing studies on the STI and DUI modes of innovation. A major purpose of this type of analysis is to provide a comprehensive comparative analysis of studies on business modes of innovation, and to inform researchers, policy makers, and practitioners about the state-of-the-art and future research directions in their area of interest. This analysis encompasses 17 studies on the STI/DUI modes of innovation published from 2007 to 2014. We synthesize the research purposes, methodologies, and results of the studies that help to identify trends and patterns in this research field. The paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we review the literature on STI/DUI modes of innovation and provide a comparative discussion of these modes and studies. Section 3 describes the methodology of grounded meta-analysis together with the selected variables and data as well as their coding procedure. In section 4, the results of grounded meta-analysis are provided. In the final section 5, the study and findings are summarized and discussed together with the relevant implications for researchers, policy makers, and managers. In addition, we point out the limitations and issues that should receive attention and delineate future research lines.",25

It began as a student initiative to publish opinions on professors, so as to force the academic administration to improve instruction. Gradually, college administrations adopted the idea, but the results were not disclosed to students; instead, only the administration and lecturer in question received the feedback results. Collecting this data has been done for decades, and every few years, small changes are made in the nature of the questions. However, in general, the issue of academic course evaluations has a long history. An early example by Bassin (1974) included a series of Likert scales concerned with five aspects of teaching. These were lecture quality, exam quality, text suitability, participation, and consideration. In an early review of the literature, Cohen (1981) found some attempts to examine correlations between evaluation scales. These tended to be limited to very specific and predictable areas, such as that between a favorable student rating of instructors’ skills and the student having received good grades. Obtaining feedback from students is a common requirement of reflective teaching, enabling teachers to refine their practices and to develop as professionals. This is one reason why formal mechanisms for collecting and processing student feedback are now used in most, if not all, colleges and universities. Many methods can be used to obtain feedback, but the literature suggests that questionnaires predominate (Kember et al. 2002; Wiers-Jenssen et al. 2002; Brennan and Williams 2004, as quoted by Huxham et al. 2008). This article aims to examine the way students of economics and management cope with the way feedback questionnaires are worded. These students are supposed to specialize in decision-making processes in their future professional lives. Therefore, it is interesting to examine the subject and the possible impact of differences in wording on these processes in the future. The way in which the questions on a feedback questionnaire are worded has a direct impact on the conclusions drawn by decision-makers, and thus on the decisions made. A large body of research is devoted to the use of feedback questionnaires, much of it concerned with testing their reliability and validity, with the aim of improving their design. Nevertheless, a lack of clarity concerning the purpose of collecting student feedback can foster cynicism among staff and students. Students often believe that feedback data will not improve teaching, and evidence exists that their cynicism hardens with experience (Huxham et al. 2008). In addition to other difficulties, it turns out that the wording of the question also affects the way in which it is answered. We must not ignore considerations about wording; ample proof in the literature for the importance of wording in questionnaires is supported by quotidian practices. Singer et al. (2010) for example, suggests that the attribution of individual differences to genetic causes may be due to the wording of the questions and to the choice of response options. The comparison of the differences in the wording of the questionnaires, as described below, is based on procedures in qualitative research, which is a broad umbrella term encompassing several specific methods and paradigms that rely on the collection, analysis, and interpretation of nonstatistical data. This is gathered principally through researcher-participant interaction and observation in real life settings (Whitley 2008). Qualitative research generally aims for depth rather than breadth in description and analysis, with researchers becoming closely acquainted with one particular community or study setting. The main methods utilized in qualitative research are interviews, focus groups and participant observation. These methods are particularly useful in accessing the lived day-to-day experience of the relevant population, allowing investigators to intimately explore and understand phenomena from a “subject’s” point of view. Quantitative research, by contrast, is convenient, controlled, and relatively inexpensive. However, internal reliability of quantitative research of students’ perception comes at the cost of external reliability. Students neither live nor make decisions in laboratories (Payne and Wansink 2011). The everyday context in which students live is essential to understand how and why they behave. Traditionally, the distinction between qualitative and quantitative research focused mostly on the contexts in which they were leveraged (Hanson and Grimmer 2005; Ratner et al. 2008, as quoted by Payne and Wansink 2011). Because much of quantitative research assumes that all other things are equal or held constant to conform to statistical rigor, it relies mostly on tightly controlled laboratory studies. In contrast, qualitative research is less concerned about control and more concerned with interpretation of phenomena in the actual context in which it occurs. Either type of research approach, however, is not necessarily synonymous with better results. Within the qualitative context, Stevens and Szmerekovsky (2010) found that wording is significant in the success of employment advertisements in attracting potential employees. The more conscientious an individual is, the more he/she will be attracted to advertisements that stress conscientiousness as a requirement. Likewise, the more open to experience an individual is, the more he/she will be attracted to advertisements that stress openness as a requirement. Wood and Williams (2007) found that slight variations in question wording resulted in significant variations in amounts reported as expenditures. Born and Taris (2010) show that a student’s inclination to apply for a job was a function of the wording of the desired candidate’s profile specified in the employment advertisement. “Wording effect” basically is achieving a desired effect by careful selection of the words used. That is, we choose the words we use in order to achieve a certain effect. For example, how many times have we heard something advertised “for only”, say, $99.99? Obviously, the price is really one hundred dollars, but the combination of the “for only” and the 99 cents make people think: “Bargain”. Xin and Chi (2010) remind us that wording effect also leads to controversy over the construct of the social dominance orientation scale, measuring individuals’ social dominance orientation. Because of the existence of a wording effect, we have to be cautious of the construct validity of the social scale and interpretations of its results. Feedback questionnaire is a tool for obtaining data from the environment to make decisions. Within the field of marketing in general, and especially in market research, for example, questionnaires are used for a variety of subjects. A managerial and marketing orientation now permeates many disciplines. Many of the marketing tools utilized are quite old, and some are partly outdated. Nevertheless, college administrations frequently make use of the same tired marketing tools, especially student feedback questionnaires. Typically, solely for convenience, most of the questionnaires are based on closed questions. The questions usually elicit answers on a Likert scale, the most widely used approach to scaling responses. When responding to a Likert questionnaire item, respondents specify their level of agreement or disagreement on a symmetric agree/disagree scale for a series of statements. Thus, the range captures the intensity of their feelings for a given item. Some consider that responding to survey questions is a sophisticated cognitive process whereby respondents go through often iterative steps to process the information provided to them by questions and response options. Others focus more on the interplay between questions and answers as a complex communication process between researchers and respondents regarding their assumptions, expectations, and perceptions. In this article, the subject of the wording of the feedback questionnaire is reviewed. The study tests the impact of different ways of wording the questions on the responses obtained (see below “Findings and Discussion”). An examination of the wording effect shows that a questionnaire that uses both positively and negatively worded items avoids the response bias resulting from acquiescence, affirmation, or agreement. Bias is due to the fact that positive or negative wordings, apparently supposed to have similar meanings, are understood in different ways, even when the content of these items is consistent (Wu 2008). Darby (2007) shows that with a Likert-type scale, students who reportedly like one aspect of a course also appear to like another, and those who reportedly dislike one aspect also appear to dislike others. Apparently, a halo effect occurs. The halo effect is a cognitive bias whereby the perception of one trait is influenced by the perception of another trait of the person or object under review. An example would be judging a good-looking person as more intelligent. This interpretation is supported by the fact that this pattern of responses does not occur with open-ended evaluations. Students in the courses, who say they like the presenters when responding using rating scales, do not necessarily say that they like the presenters when they give open-ended responses. It would seem that students react differently to different styles of evaluation forms. The failure to identify a halo effect with the open-ended responses suggests that responses on the Likert scales are subject to very different influences than are those on the open-ended evaluation forms. Teachers’ reasons for wanting feedback about their teaching practices are usually a mixture of the personal and the professional. Although some teachers are keen on obtaining information that will help them consolidate good practices or make improvements, others need to be able to document the quality of their teaching skills. Questionnaires are, of course, a common option, but a light touch is essential, for two reasons. First, questionnaires may look straightforward, but in reality, designing and processing a good questionnaire calls for considerable effort and expertise. Second, feedback questionnaires are in such widespread use that some students are experiencing questionnaire exhaustion, and exhibit a growing lack of enthusiasm to fill them in with careful thought or attention to detail (Day 1995). Furthermore, some students appear to penalize professors who increase deep learning, entailing more work for students, by using the feedback as means of retribution (Carrell and West 2010). In colleges and universities, scores on student evaluations of professors are typically used to measure teaching quality. However, recent evidence suggests that the nonrandom placement of students to teachers may bias value-added estimates of teacher quality (Kane and Staiger 2008; Jacob et al. 2010; Rothstein 2010). Carrell and West (2010) indicate that professors who promote students, whose academic achievements do not warrant doing so, on average harm the subsequent performance of their students in more advanced classes. Less is known about how the quality of instruction affects student outcomes. Measuring the ways in which professors affect student achievement is difficult, because students generally self-select their course work and their professors. For example, if better students tend to select better professors, then it is difficult to statistically separate the teacher effects from the selection effects. As a result, administrators use scores on subjective student evaluations, which are likely to be endogenous with respect to expected student grades, as the primary tool to measure professor teaching quality. Carrell and West (2010) show that student evaluation scores are negatively correlated with deep learning. Cognitive research into survey methodology shows that the respondent’s motivation and willingness to be truthful is involved in the judgment and estimation process. Ultimately, the respondent’s internally generated answer is matched to the response categories provided in the questionnaire (Lietz 2010). Brace (2004) has emphasized the importance of question encoding to the success of the communication process, which has to be able to successfully tune in to the language of respondents who are diverse in terms of gender and age, level of education, occupation and income. Typically, the results of student evaluations within the college where the issue was examined are reported by using simple summary statistics including the raw average score. Comparing different instructors by utilizing the raw averages of the questions relating to teaching effectiveness is a common practice. In many instances, this average is compared to a particular benchmark value. Such a practice implicitly assumes that any potential justifying factors (e.g., the effect of student or subject characteristics) have no effect on student evaluation differentials, or that such differentials cancel out in all cases. However, a large body of literature exists, which examines how student evaluations of teaching can be influenced by various factors, including the instructor or instructor-level determinants, student-level determinants and subject-level determinants. (For a more detailed review of the literature, see Davies et al. 2007; and also Davies et al. 2005.)",2

This transformation of public hospitals, due to fundamental regulatory changes together with technological and financial innovations, has stimulated considerable researches about efficiency and equity. The efficiency analysis is an important topic for a policy debate on the resource scarcity and demographic pressures. The measurement inefficiency in the hospital system helps provide insights about the degree at which these constraints could be met by a more effective use of the appropriate resources to make the administrative and managerial decisions allocate critical resources. However, several studies used parametric (stochastic frontier analysis) or non-parametric approaches (data envelopment analysis) to measure the efficiency of the hospitals. The data envelopment analysis (DEA) was the non-parametric method which was used by Charnes et al. (1978). On the other hand, the second method which was used by Aigner et al. (1977) and Meeusen and Van Den Broeck (1977) is the parametric called the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). The advantages of SFA over DEA include that SFA accounts for error term and thus can be used to conduct conventional test-of-hypothesis. The error term is divided into two two-sided, idiosyncratic errors and a non-negative inefficiency component. The latter, which is a one-sided error, gives efficiency results that should respect some specification distribution, such as the half-normal, exponential, truncated normal, and gamma. However, in the estimated inefficiency component, we find some firm characteristics other than outputs, inputs, or prices defined from the production or cost function, which should not cause inefficiency. The firm characteristics are exogenous variables, such as the kind of ownership and the level of GDP in the considered country. These variables have an impact on the technology used by the firms and on their inefficiency. If the variables are not taken into considerations when specifying the model, the estimation of the inefficiencies or of the frontier will be significantly affected. In this paper, we extend the literature by estimating specific inefficiency components using the Bayesian Stochastic frontier model on a parameter space that will provide a model identification. Unlike the traditional stochastic frontier models, this model allows separating the cost efficiency estimates from the technological difference (i.e., heterogeneity) within the hospitals and the inclusion of “prior” information about the parameters in inference. We use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms such as the Gibbs sampler (Koop et al. 1995, 1997). Two frontier models were estimated, a random and a fixed (homogenous) frontier model, using panel data on key Tunisian hospitals. As we can see, about emerging economics, the medical science literature generally indicates that little attention has been paid to smaller emerging economies, particularly that of Tunisia. Tunisia has channeled large resources to develop its health care system that covers the population needs. In 2011, health expenditures in Tunisia totaled approximately 6350 billion dinars, which amounts 6.2 % of the GDP. Hospitals have an overwhelmingly dominant position in Tunisian health system, accounting for an important share of 60 % of total expenditure. Yet, while Tunisia is trying to modernize its health system and improve the health status of the population, there are challenges of performance. The model allows measuring performance in case of Tunisian public hospitals over the period 2000–2007 estimated by Bayesian approach. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the section “Introduction” provides a review of the literature. The section “Literature Review” describes the methodology. The section “Traditional Stochastic Frontier Model” deals with the data issues and presents the results. Discussions and conclusions follow in sections “Bayesian Stochastic Frontier Model with Random Coefficients” and “Data and Results,” respectively.",6

Costello,Brian Donnellan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Historically, the process of product design has been well road mapped (Pugh 1991; Cross 2000) as is the case with product development methodologies (Ulrich and Eppinger 2004; Otto and Wood 2001; Cooper 1994). However, the practice of innovation is also taking place within radical redesign of business processes (Hammer and Champey 1994) and the change from task-based organizations to process-centred organizations (Hammer 1996). The increasingly important role of academia in supporting innovation in knowledge-based societies has led to the development of a number of models from the National System of Innovation (NIS) (Lundvall 1995) to the more recent Triple Helix model of university-industry-government relations (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000). In a more recent paper, Leydesdorff (2012) argues that the “Triple Helix indicator can be extended algorithmically, for example, with local global as a fourth dimension or, more generally, to an N-tuple of helices” (p. 25). The Innovation Value Institute (IVI 2013) has developed a framework for managing information technology (IT) for business value, the information technology capability maturity framework (IT-CMF), and it is being tested and diffused in an international context. The IT-CMF is a unique example of IT-enabled research and development (R&D), developed in the context of academic-industry cooperation, which has a global reach. The IVI was co-founded in 2006 by Maynooth University in Ireland and Intel with the objective of transforming IT management. IVI now has over 75 members drawn from global organizations such as BP, Chevron, Cisco, Fujitsu, SAP, Chevron and Ernst & Young. The IVI case demonstrates that innovation in IT business processes is increasingly important as a source of competitive advantage. This paper proposes to make a contribution by providing evidence that information technology can support R&D in the important but relatively underdeveloped area of business process development. Furthermore, a recent publication has concluded that key limitations of current research include “the ambiguity and fuzziness of IS business value” and “the unexplained process of internal and competitive value” (Schryen 2013) both of which are addressed in this paper. Having set the scene, the paper now proceeds as follows. Firstly, a literature review is provided to support the argument that R&D is required in the area of IT business value. Then, the concept of IT-enabled R&D is explored. Following this, an overview is presented by the IVI, the international organization that has developed an IT-enabled R&D process. Finally, contributions and conclusions are outlined.",7

These alternative sources have become especially critical in times of financial crises, more so in Europe. Unfortunately, both extant research on entrepreneurship and innovation, as well as policymakers, tend to give less attention to these outside equity mechanisms than their importance deserves. In this context, following family and friends, angel investment has now become the largest source of outside equity financing at the start-up and early growth stages (Sohl 2007; 2012). Understanding the role of business angels and the BA networks, to which they belong, therefore, becomes crucial given the significant contribution in stimulating entrepreneurial activity and consequently economic growth. Business angels, who are themselves often experienced entrepreneurs or business people, have become increasingly recognised as an important source of equity capital to innovative start-ups. In addition to the capital provided, business angels play a key role in providing strategic and operational expertise for new ventures as well as social capital (OECD 2011). Furthermore, business angels are geographically widespread, which means that their investments contribute to financing also in peripheral regions. Data collected by the European Business Angel Network (EBAN) show that firms in the ICT, biotech and healthcare energy/environment and mobile technologies attract the most investments from business angels. However, in many countries, the business angel market is still nascent and barely visible. EU countries with developing informal venture capital markets have seen governments support business angels networks (BANs) to increase and consolidate business angels markets in order to make available financing to innovative start-ups. BANs can play a very important role in countries with a developing business angel market. When the BA market is far from being organized, the part played by BANs is extremely important to understand the functioning of the angel market and in publicizing existing groups of BAs to current and potential BAs. Angel networks also play a recognized role in addressing the information asymmetry problem caused by the high search cost for entrepreneurs and angels as they try to find one another (Mason and Harrison 1999; 2002; Mason 2009; Wetzel 1987). BANs can also take on the role of facilitating co-investment between BAs, as well as promoting BA contact with formal risk capital. There has been an increasing number of studies that have linked growth from higher innovation rates in industries and regions that have been able to attract greater venture capital and private investment such as those from BAs (Kortum and Lerner 2000; Popov and Roosenboom 2012). When start-ups and other innovative companies establish in a region, patenting rates tend to increase (Samila and Sorenson 2011), as well as having an impact or regional growth via increased employment and economic activity. Thus, having active regional BANs can be a stimulating factor in regional growth. Angel networks provide a platform for the sharing of practices (conferences, workshops, etc.), thus contributing to the visibility of BA investment. Besides, BANs provide representation to BAs in meetings with policymakers to discuss juridical regimes, fiscal legislation and identification and removal of barriers to BA market development in these countries. They also form links with transnational organizations to develop cooperative activities such as developing professional standards. The usefulness of BANs is also shown in collecting data from member organizations in the “visible” angel market within the country (EBAN 2008a). In some countries, these organizations are also involved in training and mentoring programmes for angel investors. Given the importance of the activities carried out by angel networks, all of which are mostly not-for profit entities, the support given to these organizations by government bodies is understandable in contexts where the BA market is still developing, as is the case of continental Europe where EBAN, the pan-European association for the industry, was created only in 1999 with European Commission support. Many of the BAN federations and BANs across Europe were also created and helped in the early years of operation with national support (European Commission 2003; EBAN 2008b; OECD 2011) starting the beginning of this century. Besides the general financing allocated to creating and operating associations, federations and angel networks in Europe, we also find examples of some government financing to support specific activities (e.g. support for LINC Scotland to promote new business angel syndicates or government support in Spain to provide certification for BAs). Given their importance in stimulating innovative start-ups, one would expect to find in the literature significant research on the impact of the role of BANs. However, extant research on the role of BANs reveals mixed results. A pioneering study made in the UK showed that BANs contributed to mobilizing capital that would otherwise have remained invisible and promoted a number of investments which in turn, help to free bank lending (Harrison and Mason 1996). Similarly, the study by Collewaert et al. (2007) concluded that BANs played a positive role in Flanders (Belgium), enabling businesses to leverage other sources of finance. More recently, another study drawing on the Belgium experience by Collewaert et al. (2010) underlined the role of BANs in joining investors and entrepreneurs, concluding that angel investors would not have known about 82 % of the deals in which they invested had it not been for the business angel networks. This positive assessment of the role played by BANs was not however found in other studies, some concluding that BANs were not an important source of investment for most BAs (Mason and Harrison 2002) and did not contribute to the quality of deals (Mason and Harrison 1999). The aim of our study is to contribute to a better understanding of BANs’ role in developing informal venture capital markets by analysing BAs’ use of the different services provided by the BANs. Additionally, we seek to test if there is a difference in the BANs services used by BA sub-groups, with these sub-groups resulting from application of age, education, investment experience and forecasting investment criteria. We also contribute to our understanding of the location aspect in start-up financing, comparing two groups (BANs of high gross regional product (GRP) regions and BANs of low GRP regions) and assessing their contribution to the BAs of these regions and indirectly to finance innovative start-ups of these two types of location. This paper contributes to the scarce empirical research in the area of BA financing and their regional and national implications. The study is undertaken in the Portuguese context, whose characteristics are consistent with other small emergent European BA markets. It also provides a very useful field in that the BANs are developing, at the same time that there is increased interest from BAs to play a part in the burgeoning entrepreneurship story in the country. Moreover, public policy is keen to make BANs more effective, and create the right mechanisms to channel funding in the most productive ventures. We believe that the results of this study would contribute to promoting wider discussion and greater knowledge of the role of BANs and also to make rational and well-grounded policy decisions by government authorities. The remainder of our paper is structured as follows. In the next section, we briefly present the context this study was based on. “Methodology” describes how the sample was compiled and the methods used. The results of our analysis are presented in “Findings”. “Discussion and conclusions” contains the discussion and conclusions outlined.",7

This paper focuses on service innovation in the cloud computing context, which is defined as “Internet-based applications that provide different services such as social networking, distributed file systems, and structural storage systems” (Arpaci et al. 2015, p. 93). Cloud computing services are used for information collaboration and sharing as the attitude of users is above traditional technology devices (Stantchev et al. 2014). The quality and satisfaction of cloud services often depends on service innovation due to the perceived mobility, security, and connectedness (Park and Kim 2014). As an emerging new computing paradigm, organizations use cloud computing as it provides a new method of delivering technology services (Sultan 2014). The word “cloud” has been described as a knowledge bubble on the Internet due its infinite and intangible nature (Sultan 2014). Regalado (2011) posits that the term “cloud computing” was made popular by Google’s CEO Eric Schmidt in a 2006 conference but still no common term has been applied to the rapid emergence of this technological innovation. Most definitions of cloud computing include the use of both software and hardware services in a virtual environment (Grossman 2009). In this paper, cloud computing is defined as on-demand and expandable services offered on the Internet from data centers (Arpaci et al. 2015). Cloud or utility computing provides numerous services via networked media devices, which enables the sharing of information resources for interaction between groups of individuals and organizations (Sultan 2014). The possibility of interaction that was previously hard because of geographic and time restrictions has led to cloud computing services being hailed as one of the major technological innovations currently revolutionizing the knowledge economy. The benefits of cloud computing services are in the online software and virtual hardware services that can enable organizations to outsource the maintenance and updating of their own infrastructures. Arpaci et al. (2015, p. 93) states that cloud computing provides services include “anytime/anywhere access to documents and files, synchronization of data across devices, easy to share data, data redundancy, bespoke learning with no up-front capital, investment and maintenance responsibility.” The disadvantages of cloud computing services have been resolved further by advances in technological innovations but they include device compatibility, costs, and access concerns (Lacity and Reynolds 2014). This has meant that there are still some challenges faced by cloud computing services including privacy, security, and government access to data that are still being debated (Park and Kim 2014). Cloud computing services can be offered through public, private, hybrid, or community clouds (Sultan 2014). Public clouds are data centers used by cloud vendors whilst private clouds are organizations with their own data centers. Hybrid clouds use both public and private clouds to take advantage of cost and security savings. Community clouds are services provided by groups of organizations. Much of recent cloud computing service innovation has been concerned with grid and virtualization computing (Sultan 2014). Grid computing uses the power of many computers that have a large amount of processing power. Service innovations in grid computing have been in using many geographically dispersed computers, which can work on a common software program. This means that the innovation regarding parallel networks and big data have been made possible. Virtualization involves the use of physical resources to appear as multiple systems on the Internet. This has led to software applications being able to interact with multiple users in order to appear virtual. To improve the value organizations have towards service innovation, the goal of this paper is to synthesize the factors that affect attitudes. As attitudes often imply behavior, the focus on testing relationships between factors affecting attitudes towards service innovation will help managers of technology organizations to understand better knowledge intensive processes. Consistent with past studies on innovation in knowledge intensive industries and service innovation, the paper focuses on top management leadership, absorptive capacity, government support, learning orientation, and performance. The research questions addressed in this study are as follows: (1) what factors shape attitudes towards service innovation? and (2) What is the impact of cloud computing technology on attitudes towards service innovation? By examining these research questions, this paper contributes to the knowledge economy literature by testing a series of hypothesis. The paper provides an empirical approach to support organizations spending more time on service innovations. Understanding the key factors of service innovation will help managers to implement better strategies to cope with changing cloud computing technology. This paper is organized as follows. The next section will discuss the theoretical framework that integrates social cognitive theory with technological innovations. In the subsequent sections utilizing this theoretical framework, a number of research hypotheses are derived. The research methodology and data analysis are stated and the results presented. Finally, the managerial and theoretical implications of the findings are stated in addition to the limitations and directions for future research. The next section will focus on social cognitive theory as the theoretical framework for the research discussed in this paper.",9

On the one hand, we observe a general tendency of firms to agglomerate geographically. On the other hand, traditional clusters, and notably industrial districts, are facing a period of crisis, not only in their current performance but—most importantly—in their identity, structure, and cohesion. Since the turn of the new century, regulatory changes, intensified global competition, rapid changes in technology and markets, and increasing complexity and uncertainty in the business environment, have created a more dynamic and globalized market conditions for the firms of the European Union (EU) mature industrial sectors, like textile and clothing (T&C) industry. As a result of the above trends, the territories where firms are located have been significantly affected. As a result of these political, economic, and technological trends, the EU T&C manufacturers have faced increased global competition at the local level. On the supply side, they have seen a growing number of market participants; on the demand side, they have faced the growing bargaining power of retail firms as many retailers (e.g., Carrefour, Decathlon, Inditex) have increased in size and buying power. As a result of these changes and of the firms’ responses, the future of T&C industry in the regions where it is located has been questioned. A stream of public opinion has emerged in support of new ventures activity. The central argument is that the creation of startups could help reverse the employment decline (Feldman et al. 2005; Glaeser and Kerr 2009). However, it is a fact that few public policies have been implemented to date to stimulate the development of startups, and the extant policies have been implemented with little consideration of the particular territories and industries in which the startups should be developed (Zourek 2007; Obadic 2013). In light of the issues discussed above, the purpose of the research is to determine the territorial dynamics of startups in the T&C industry in Spain, one of the three main EU countries in employment and production volume (DG Enterprise & Industry 2010). The main contribution was the adoption of a historical perspective focused on analysis of the intersection of the geographical locations of startups in Spain (industrial district effect) and the main types of activities performed by startup firms (subsector effect). Our results have important implications for the theory and practice in the T&C industry: knowing the key variables that influence the location of a new firm to analyze their performance both as to the formulation and implementation of public policies. The remainder of this paper is structured in four sections. The next section provides the conceptual framework. The third section describes the research design and methodology. The fourth contains the results of the empirical analysis, along with the conclusions and academic and political economic implications of the findings.",3
7.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,28 September 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-016-0411-7,A Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Approach to Regional Innovation Systems in the Transformation to a Forestry-Based Bioeconomy,December 2016,Ida Grundel,Margareta Dahlström,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Climate change, globalization and economic crises are new challenges facing us on different geographical scales, from the regional and national to the supranational level. Environmental problems are becoming more complex, uncertain and multiscalar, affecting a variety of actors and agencies, demanding new technical solutions, societal transformation and new collaborations. A transformation into a more sustainable society calls for a larger transition of societal functions, including new innovations in technology, regulations, production and consumer patterns, values and norms and supply networks (Geels 2005). It also requires a variety of knowledge and values in decision-making processes. However, the implementation of new forms of government and governance creates a complexity of networks stretching over different sectors and geographical areas. To some extent, policy-making processes have moved into new spheres and involve other actors; for example firms, supranational organizations and expertise have been given more influence (Miller and Rose 2008). This is also seen as a hollowing out of the state, as well as a managerial form of governance based on principles of new public management (Swyngedouw 2005; Sassen 2013). Because of the involvement of new actors in policymaking, it has become more difficult for citizens to engage in political processes (Mouffe 2008), whereas citizen-based knowledge is often seen as diffuse and difficult to embed in policy-making processes (Isenhour 2011). Nevertheless, public participation is emphasized as a democratic right by both environmentalist and pressure groups (Reed 2008) as well as at the supranational level by international organizations. At the European level, inclusive growth is seen as an important driver for the transformation of society (European Commission 2010). This is specifically pointed out, for example in the smart specialization platform (Foray et al. 2012) and in the European bioeconomy strategy (European Commission 2012), where the inclusion of civil society in an open dialogue is singled out as important throughout research into processes of innovation. At the supranational level, the United Nations points to a more inclusive approach towards a sustainable future in the new agenda of Transforming our world: the 2030 agenda for sustainable development agreed upon after the 2015 Paris summit, by empowering different actors and stakeholders in society (United Nations 2015). The transformation into a sustainable society requires new challenge-driven innovations and new collaborations between more actors than earlier from different spheres in society with a variety of knowledge and practices, including civil society. Reed (2008) also stresses the importance of including different stakeholder groups in environmental decision-making processes. Environmental problems are complex and uncertain, stretching over different geographical scales and institutions. Thereby, the incorporation of different stakeholders and interest groups in policy-making processes can be a way of creating durability in the decisions made. However, if the participatory process is not handled well, it can create a feeling of disillusion among different groups seeing their claims not being realized. In relation to citizen participation in planning processes, although there is a broad field of research and literature (see for example Arnstein 1969; Healey 1997, 2003; Flyvbjerg 2003), there is a lack of research about the role and involvement of civil society in innovation systems and larger transformation processes. Therefore, here we address this gap by further developing the understandings and meanings of civil society—a fourth helix—in a regional innovation system (RIS) applied in a forestry-based bioeconomy in Sweden. In 2012, the European Commission (EC) produced a strategy for the development of a European bioeconomy (Innovating for sustainable growth: a bioeconomy for Europe), which aims to transform the European economy into becoming more sustainable. From a European context, the focus is on “the production of renewable biological resources and the conversion of these resources and waste streams into value added products, such as food, feed, bio-based products and bioenergy” (European Commission 2012: 3). Thus, the European Union (EU) sees the bioeconomy as a two-pronged way of creating a more sustainable European economy; first by becoming fossil fuel free and second by turning the economy into a circular economy building on renewable resources. Further, the European bioeconomy is linked to the European Smart Growth strategy, innovation policy, resource efficiency and the strengthening of the European market. Several of the regions in Europe have directed their smart specialization strategies, namely research and innovation strategies, towards the development of a sustainable bioeconomy in one or several industrial sectors. Thus, the discussion about both the bioeconomy and smart specialization strategies is closely linked to innovation policy. There are also connections between the development of national strategies on the bioeconomy and the recommendations made by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in the 2009 report The bioeconomy to 2030: designing a policy agenda (OECD 2009). It is important to emphasize that the meanings of the word “bioeconomy” as well as the phrase “bio-based economy” differ slightly and that their actual meanings are problematic because of vague definitions (Staffas et al. 2013). The definition of bioeconomy varies across different parts of the world. In the European context, there is a greater focus on biomass and its waste streams as a resource when transforming into a more sustainable society and a circular economy; in contrast, the OECD and the USA do not have an explicit sustainability agenda and the concept is mainly used to describe the conversion of raw material into products in biotechnology and the life sciences (Grundel and Dahlström 2015). In this article, we will use the term bioeconomy with reference to a sustainable bio-based economy with the aim of transforming society as a whole into becoming more sustainable. Thus, bioeconomy refers not only to economic activities but also to all of society. TransformationFootnote 1 into a bioeconomy covers several areas of society including changes in consumption and production patterns, a transition from the use of fossil materials to sustainable materials, as well as a change of waste streams into a circular economy. It has been argued that bioeconomy is just another buzzword for sustainable development and a “greening of the economy” (see e.g. Birch et al. 2010; Birch 2012). In Europe, this can be seen as a result of marketization and the development of new products in food, animal feed, bio-based products and bioenergy (European Commission 2012) to enhance the competitiveness of the EU. Similarly, Kenis and Lievens (2014) highlight how environmentalist claims can be depoliticized because of the power of elite groups that shape the agenda of sustainable development by the introduction of new concepts such as “green economy” and bioeconomy. This might contribute to the exclusion of certain groups in policy debates about sustainability. However, other scholars (see e.g. Campbell et al. 2015; Carayannis et al. 2012) use the concept of “quadruple helix” as a way of broadening and opening up former relatively closed policy-making processes and innovation systems, thereby making them more democratic. Earlier innovation systems such as the “triple helix” based on collaboration between universities, government and industry (Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz 1996; Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000) should also include a “fourth helix”—civil society—and thereby create a quadruple helix model. Carayannis and Rakhmatullin (2014) also point to the importance of expanding existing definitions of democracy to include not only political and civil rights but also sustainable development. In this context, they developed the concept of the triple helix innovation system into not only a quadruple helix system but also a “quintuple helix” system, where the fifth helix represents the environmental settings of a specific region. Thus, the broadening of the former innovation system includes perspectives of both democracy and environmental concerns. Carayannis et al. (2012) also saw the quintuple helix model as a way of stressing the transformation of society and the current economic system into becoming more sustainable. The development of a more advanced bioeconomy requires not only a shift in society in general but also a transformation in environmental policies. Strategies and policies used for the transformation of current economies into a sustainable bioeconomy can be seen as a way of coordinating transformation by means of protecting biodiversity, food quality and quantity, preserving biotopes and mitigating climate change. However, current national strategies and policies are used to a great extent as a way of increasing economic growth by the invention of new products, system innovations and the growth of new markets and new employment (Staffas et al. 2013). Therefore, the model of a proposed quintuple helix system is interesting from the perspective of new environmental challenges and transformation to sustainability. The aim of this article is to deepen the understandings of, and preconditions for, the transformation of an RIS into a quadruple and quintuple helix system applied to the development of a sustainable forestry-based bioeconomy in Värmland, Sweden. We address this with the following research question: In which ways can the further development of a regional innovation system contribute to a transformation to a forestry-based bioeconomy? First, an overview of theoretical considerations about different forms of RIS is given, followed by a discussion of the concepts of quadruple and quintuple helix systems. The research design and methodology are then presented, and we describe the case study that was conducted. The possible development of a quadruple and/or quintuple helix system in the region is then analysed and discussed, followed by our concluding remarks.",80
7.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,20 October 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-016-0413-5,"Entrepreneurship, Technological Innovation, and Economic Growth: Empirical Analysis of Panel Data",December 2016,Chiraz Feki,Sirine Mnif,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Entrepreneurship is linked to innovation and competitive advantage. Its importance is manifested not only in public policy initiatives that promote the development of new businesses, but also within established organizations that encourage developing and seeking new opportunities. Entrepreneurship is considered as a key instrument for the improvement of competitiveness among nations, promote economic growth, and increase employment opportunities. The three major trends of thought of entrepreneurship theory are those of Schumpeter (1934), who defines entrepreneurship as the ability to introduce innovations, Baumol (1968), who considers that productive entrepreneurship is encouraged by incentives for entrepreneurs to focus on productive innovation, and finally Kirzner (1973), who admits that the discovery of an opportunity is the central element of entrepreneurship. Furthermore, Cipolla (1981) argues that entrepreneurship is a long-term driver of economic growth. By penetrating new markets, entrepreneurship provides new opportunities, adopts new production techniques, diversified production, and intensified competitions. However, in recent years, empirical studies testing the relationship between entrepreneurship and economic growth have multiplied (Carree and Thurik 1999; Carree et al. 2004; Salgado-Banda 2004; Audretsch 2007; Afolabi 2015). These studies are facing the problem of measuring entrepreneurship and data availability. In fact, entrepreneurship is relatively difficult to measure. Several studies based on data about self-employment, surveys, and specialized interviews discussed entrepreneurship. Self-employment is often used as a measure of entrepreneurship (Storey 1991; Hamilton 2004); however, it may not adequately reflect the nuances of entrepreneurship in the developing countries. Self-employment can be measured based on official data of self-reported job and probably left unreported respondents (informal). Other approaches to the measurement of entrepreneurship focus on the GEM (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor) approach and WBGES approach (World Bank Group Entrepreneurship Survey). The GEM project is an effort to produce data that can be comparable across countries; it is mainly based on surveys and specialist interviews. The GEM surveys a random sample of people to produce the index “Total Entrepreneurial Activity” for each country. The TEA index is the sum of start-ups (people trying to start a business) and new business. This index measures the interest investigation by the workforce brings to business creation. Surveys of the WBGES are also designed to compare countries and measure entrepreneurship in the formal sector and the number of new limited liability companies (LLC) officially registered. By definition, WBGES does not include the informal sector, counting only “economic units in the formal sector incorporated and registered in a public register, which is capable of incurring liabilities and engaging in economic activities and transactions with other entities.” Acs et al. (2014) have built an empirical framework, Global Entrepreneurship and Development Index (GEDI), to measure National Entrepreneurial Ecosystem (NEE) and its consequences for economic growth. They explain not just why some people choose to become entrepreneurs while others do not, but also how and why their performance differs in the aggregate across counties. They develop a new index methodology characterizing national systems of entrepreneurship recognizing interactions between different components and in particular identifying bottleneck factors that hold back entrepreneurial performance. In addition, other indicators, such as spending on R&D, the number of patents can be used (Hsu and Ziedonis 2008; Salgado-Banda 2007). These indicators are significantly greater than self-employment. Thus, to study the effect of entrepreneurial activity on economic growth, we used two measures of entrepreneurship: the new businesses density proposed by the Doing Business Project of the World Bank where data from developing countries are available and the potential of the innovation measured by the number of patents filed to study the relationship between entrepreneurship, innovation, and growth. To this end, this paper is organized as follows: In a first section, we present the literature review on the importance of entrepreneurship and the relationship between entrepreneurship, technology innovation, and growth. In a second section, we move to the empirical validation. Empirical studies on the developing countries are very few. To enrich this research, we focus on a sample of developing countries. We propose our econometric results and economic interpretation with variables, data, and model. Based on the technique of static and dynamic panel data, the main results are first, new business density and growth are significantly and positively correlated, then, the effect of technological innovations on economic growth is positive and significant only in the long term.",30

8.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,29 July 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-015-0277-0,"The Creative Development of Fields: Learning, Creativity, Paths, Implications",March 2017,Jonathan S. Feinstein,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this paper, I present a model of the creative development of a field. The field is defined as an explicit knowledge structure that starts from a simple initial state, then develops through the series of creative contributions made by successive individuals who enter the field. New elements are added by combining preexisting elements in new combinations. The heart of the model is a rational, optimizing model of individual creative development. Individuals have initial “seed” learning, then gain intuitive signals about potentially fruitful new combinations of elements or sub-topics in the field; their signals guide them as they choose further elements to learn and then a new element to attempt to make, basing their choices on expected value calculations. When an individual is successful in his project, the new element he creates is added to the field. The field thus grows over time. I present an analysis of the model’s implications based on extensive simulations. A striking finding is the diversity of possible paths of development starting from a given initial state, in simulations hundreds of paths even for very simple initial conditions. In addition, the results show very substantial path dependence in how a field develops, as individuals build on the work of their predecessors. The results demonstrate the importance of intuitive signals that guide individuals in generating this diversity of paths, for many paths are generated in the full model with signals that are not created in a null “clean” model in which there are no signals. The model predicts distributions for output and the number of elements created over time. I also explore the dynamics of growth, including how expected output in a period depends on the choices and outcome of the preceding period, generating implications about the time series properties of output in the development of a creative field. The paper fits in the large literature on modeling the innovation process that drives economic growth and cultural development. The importance of innovation has been recognized from the beginnings of the modern literature on growth (Solow 1957) and in the Austrian focus on knowledge and individual initiative (Hayek 1960). Indeed, the central role of innovation in the development of industries was emphasized by Marshall in Industry and Trade (1919) and the importance of freedom of expression, creativity, and experimentation is the focus of John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty (1859). In the modern theory of economic growth, the production of new ideas is central to economic development (Aghion and Howitt 1992; for an institutional, historical perspective see Mokyr 2002). The model in this paper focuses on modeling the creative process in the context of a field of creative activity, which could be a scientific or other intellectual field, a field of technology or design, or a practice. It relates to models of searching for the best new alternative from a distribution of possibilities (Evenson and Kislev 1976; Kortum 1997; Fleming and Sorenson 2004); it also relates to Garicano’s model of problem-solving (a form of creativity) in organizations (Garicano 2000). Here, creativity is modeled specifically as combining existing elements in new ways to create new elements. This approach is based on the widely accepted definition of creativity in the field of creativity studies as connecting or relating preexisting elements that have not previously been connected or related (Mednick 1962; Koestler 1964; Poincaré 1908, 1952); I discuss this definition and how it relates to other views of creativity further in “Creating New Elements.” My approach is connected to the important contribution of Weitzman on recombinant growth (1998) (Feinstein 2011), although I focus more on the creative process and less on resource limits on the development of new ideas. The model formalizes and builds on the model of creative development developed by Gruber (1974), Feinstein (2006) and Cohen (2009), among others. It is a model of a field so that new ideas are generated in the context of the field (for a recent different formal model of the development of a field see Bramoullé and Saint-Paul 2010). In turn, this allows a representation of how knowledge in a field grows over time, and reveals the structure of the field in terms of how new ideas are generated based on and in relation to older ideas. Interestingly, the structure of the field resembles a lattice, thus also providing a link with the field of economic and social networks (Jackson 2008). Explicitly modeling the creative process that drives innovation and knowledge creation is important. By formally modeling how this process works, we will be better able to understand and predict the dynamics of how economies and fields develop. This includes how human agents respond creatively to shocks, as well as how they generate new ideas endogenously within a field. The aim is not to predict the exact next idea or innovation, but rather to build models that enable us to calibrate and appreciate the range and distribution of outcomes that may arise given the current state of a field. As I show with the results of this paper, the range is in fact large, and in fact is itself highly variable for different historical paths starting from the same initial condition, with a high amount of path dependence. A key motivation of this paper is to present a framework that links economic models of creativity and innovation with the field of knowledge representation. Knowledge representation provides a conceptual framework for describing concepts and their relationships (Sowa 1984, 2000; Wille 1992; Ganter et al. 2005). It is also useful for natural language based description (Helbig 2006); for example, Kaplan and Vakili (2013) have developed a text-based approach for linking patents. Lancaster’s (1966) model of attributes is a well-known related approach in economics that also fits with the model in this paper. I develop a simple example of a knowledge representation framework of a field and use it to explore how the field develops; details are given in “Attributes and Elements” and “Creating New Elements.” Specifically, I define elements in the field as strings made up out of basic “letters” or attributes. New strings are created by combining two preexisting strings according to defined rules. Success is uncertain: an element that is attempted has a probability of being viable. A viable new element has associated an output drawn from a distribution that defines its economic value; this distribution has the properties that are recognized as empirically important for the creation of innovations, specifically a long right tail so that there is a small probability of a very high value contribution. The heart of the model is a rational, optimizing model of individual creative development. The model centers on learning, intuitive signals, and project selection choice guided by the signals. The signals pertain to subbundles of attributes that may be created when an element that embeds them is created. Thus, intuition is not necessarily about a fully defined final product, but about a “wish list” bundle of attributes, and the task is to find a way to create a new element that embeds this bundle. This captures the commonsense view of the creative process as guided by partial (“fuzzy”) vision or simple insight that is then developed, filled in, and perfected. Each time period, a single individual enters the field and goes through a creative development process described in detail in “Creative Development.” The model is non-stationary in that the field grows over time as new contributions are made, and the set of feasible new combinations changes and in general also grows over time. Lastly, the field has a public history that records for each individual who worked in the field in the past, his learning choices, as well as the creative project he attempted and its outcome. Probabilities about likelihoods of success in creating new elements and associated output levels are updated at the start of each period using this public history, including indirect inferences about intuitive signals individuals received based on their observed choices. Overall, the model in this paper provides a basis for describing the dynamics of development of a field that is far more rooted in learning and rational choices than psychological models, including the Darwinian model of random variation and selection (Campbell 1960; Simonton 2003). The Darwinian model does not incorporate a rational, forward-looking learning process; it has no explicit role for either intuition or expected value calculations being made to guide choices of what to learn and attempt to combine into new elements (Gabora 2005 offers a related critique). I analyze the model through extensive simulations. I explore several different parameter cases, for each running both the full model as well as companion runs with no signals, which I call clean runs. For each simulation, I generate a masterlist that specifies for each potential new element whether or not it is viable and its value (output) if it is viable and is produced. I run each simulation out five periods, identifying every possible path of development of the field assuming that individuals follow the optimal creative development strategy; paths differ in the set of intuitive signals individuals receive, which guides their choices about learning and which new element to attempt to create. The results generate a set of interesting results. A striking finding is the diversity of possible paths of development starting from a given initial state. A typical simulation generates several hundred paths and a substantial number of distinct field structures (multiple paths may lead to the same structure): many simulations generate more than 100 distinct field structures through five periods. In addition, the number of distinct structures itself varies widely across simulations: Thus, there is variability in the potential variability of development of the field, depending on parameter values and outcomes early in the history of the field. Linked to the diversity of structures, there is also substantial variance in the number of new elements created and generated output. There are many fewer paths when the model is run with no intuitive signals guiding choices. Thus, an important finding is that much of the diversity of possible paths of development of the field is generated by the intuitive signals, which lead individuals to attempt to make elements they would otherwise not attempt, in turn opening up new frontiers for future development. A second finding is the high degree of path dependence. Comparing pairs of paths for which the element created (or attempted but not viable) in the first period is different, typically each path leads to new elements that are not created along the other path. This result fits naturally with the cumulative nature of creative development of the field, as individuals build on the work of their predecessors. A noteworthy feature, at least through five periods, is that once two paths diverge, they do not tend to reconverge, but generate substantially different sets of elements going forward. A third set of findings concerns conditional output calculations and the dynamics of output. A basic distinction is whether a new element was successfully created or not in the preceding period—is productivity higher when a new element was successfully created? I address this question with the simulations. A second issue is whether the individual in the preceding period was guided by a signal in his choice of element to make—it stands to reason that when an individual has been guided by a signal and has been successful, this will open up new frontiers that might otherwise remain unexplored. Results in general confirm this, with conditional expected output greatest when a new element has been made in the preceding period based on a live signal. Thus, the model generates implications about the time series of output. Model results also speak to how frequently an individual attempts to build a new element using as a building block an element created in the immediately preceding period, versus an element created further back in time. I have also explored an extension in which individuals earn a royalty if an element they create is used in the future; I discuss this in the conclusion. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces basic terminology about the field, its knowledge structure, the creation of new elements, and valuation of new created elements. Section “Creative Development” describes the process of creative development of individuals working in the field, including their learning process, intuitive signals, and their optimal strategy. In “The Development of the Field” section, I describe the development of the field including its structure and how the history of the field is updated after each generation. In “Simulation Results” section, an extensive set of simulation results are presented and discussed. Section “Conclusion” concludes. An (online) Appendix (available at www.jonathanfeinstein.com) contains supplemental materials.",8

The latter two discussed sociology of knowledge associated with organizational theory. Building on this tradition, Johnsen ( 2014, p. 23) argued that if the view on science is accessed through contextual, local knowledge and the phenomenon is situational or conditional, then, the local knowledge is subject to interpretation. Further, he argued that problem-solving in a particular context where it is subject to interpretation often is characterized by small group finding their way with routines, copying and adaption (Johnsen 2014, pp. 26–27). This understanding corresponds well with the forms of knowledge related to basically two distinct modes of innovation (Jensen et al. 2007): the “Doing, Using and Interacting (DUI)” mode and the “Science, Technology and Innovation (STI)” mode. In this strand of research, manufacturing industry often classifies as a DUI mode of innovation. This paper has as objective to demonstrate that the dichotomy DUI vs. STI mode of innovation is an oversimplification. A deeper analysis of actual processes inside a product development project in the automotive industry reveals that at this micro level, the STI/DUI dichotomy is not a valid hypothesis. This illustrates how product development defies conceptual and theoretical oversimplifications. We argue that industry embeds knowledge into products in such a way that making the distinction between DUI and STI modes somewhat loses its meaning and purpose. This paper describes the processes inside the company project demonstrating that uncritical reliance on broad categories and concepts originating from science and technology studies, though sensible at the meso level, can generate false conclusions at the micro level. In doing that, our findings partly support the idea of Isaksen and Karlsen (2009, 2009
2013) to introduce an intermediary mode of innovation, namely the complex, combined innovation (CCI) mode. However, our findings show that the CCI mode, as such, is not fully satisfactory as an explanatory device, and we therefore argue that generalized categories of “innovation modes” are difficult to relate to when dealing with a complex environment at the micro level.",10

Relatively few studies have examined the inverse relation, i.e., the effect of inequality on innovation, although there is an extensive literature that deals with the market structure and the concentration of industry and its relationship with innovation. Moreover, we wonder if the reverse inequality can block the diffusion of technologies and hence growth. Consequently, our work focuses on the enrichment of this limited research orientation which is in the center of the new debate in connection with the effects of inequality on the diffusion of new technologies. We will study the impact of inequality on economic growth and innovation activities through the market size. In addition, we will analyze the incentives of the demand based on innovation and the concept of non-homothetic preferences. Technological changes are a determinant for economic growth. Indeed, our goal is to analyze the impact of inequality on economic growth driven by technological changes. We will cover this new research regarding the impact of inequalities on technological changes and therefore on growth. For this purpose, we will develop the different transmission mechanisms through which inequality affects growth. These mechanisms have triggered the emergence of a new literature, related to the neo-Schumpeterian approach, linking inequality to changes in technology. The purpose of this work is not only to show that inequalities affect technological changes but also to analyze the triangular relationship between income inequality, technological changes, and economic growth. Therefore, our objective is to see whether inequality could suspend the dissemination of technological innovations, which are the source of economic growth. Unfortunately, almost all empirical studies focus on developed countries. To overcome this shortcoming, this study is done using a Panel comprising a set of 38 developing countries, determined by the availability of data, over a period of several years. For this purpose, we will present a review of the theoretical and empirical literature on this issue. After that, we will outline our specified model and the data that we have used for the empirical validation. Finally, we will compare some of the theoretical hypotheses using econometric tests on Panel data to verify the impact of inequality on growth driven by technological changes for our sample of countries.",2

The knowledge economy concept is rooted in theories ranging from information theory (Machlup 1962) to the theories of postindustrialism (Bell 1973), as well as in the ideas of Drucker who coined the terms “knowledge society” (Drucker 1969). Despite the existence of a vast body of literature on the knowledge economy, a coherent definition of this concept does not appear to have emerged (Carlaw et al. 2006). The most common definition is the one established by the OECD (1996), which describes the “knowledge economy” very broadly as an economy that is directly based on the production, distribution, and use of knowledge and information. Knowledge generated by scientific research in natural and technical sciences needs technological innovation and industry for its market exploitation. However, industrial production and technological innovation are in sharp decline, markets are saturated with industrial goods of all kinds while service activities continue to grow employing the rising share of workforce. Despite certain recovery of economic activities among the most developed members of the EU in 2013 (European Commission 2013a, b) and optimistic prognoses for 2015, there remains a common impression that the crisis has shaken trust in the ability of Europe’s political and economic systems to deliver balanced economic growth (European Commission 2012a, b, c). Differences in the levels of economic development within the EU persist despite the efforts made to support the convergence of less developed regions. These differences occur both when comparing countries and comparing regions in a country. Comparing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita in purchasing power standards (PPS), differences arise. For the 28 countries of the EU, this average is equal to 100: although in 2013 GDP per capita in PPS for such countries, e.g., Netherlands (131), Austria (128), and Sweden (127), significantly above the European average; for others, e.g., Bulgaria (45), Romania (55), Croatia (61), and Latvia (64) are well below.Footnote 1
 There are many reasons for such differences: historic, economic, and cultural. But the question is not only about the causes of this economic diversification but about the mechanisms of the most effective convergence tools as well. Technology change and innovation based on knowledge and scientific research are claimed to be the most important causes of diversification and at the same time one of the best ways for further development. The changes of these original assumptions began with the disappointing results of Lisbon I (Kok 2004) and moderate success of Lisbon II (European Commission 2010a; Johansson et al. 2007). The failure of the latter was attributed to the financial and economic crisis that hit Europe in 2008. However, it provided a boost for a new European agenda: the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Innovation Union as a flagship initiatives which is designed to deliver smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth relay on a belief in the importance of innovation in development strategy. It is stated that: “Europe’s future economic growth and jobs will increasingly have to come from innovation in products, services and business models. This is why innovation has been placed at the heart of the Europe 2020 strategy for growth and jobs!” It is recognized as a new beginning, a platform for new growth initiatives that will allow Europe to take advantage of this moment of transformation to recover from the global crisis in 2010. Conceptual and methodological approaches that had been used to dealing with future of service economies are fairly diversified and includes both severe critics of its sustainably (Jansson 2009; Oakley 2004; Ketokivi 2009; Wölfl 2005; Solberg Søilen 2012; Miles 2005; Witt 2013) as well as its acceptance as an inevitable future that may pass different scenarios (Gallouj et al. 2015), physiological adjustments in (slow) growth (Antonelli and Fassio 2014), or can take different forms such as “creativity” economy which interrelates creativity, knowledge, and innovating economies (Dubina et al. 2012). The main research questions are the following: how has the original concept of knowledge-based economy rooted in science intensive industries been equalized with the service economy where knowledge is understood not as activity of scientific research activity but as service or creative activity? How has the technological innovation in this process been exchanged for creativity and service activities as the driver of economy growth? And, is it possible transition of standard service economy often related to low-skills/wage jobs into “knowledge-intensive service economy” (KISE) with higher proportion of high-tech production and high-tech service sectors which could reconcile scientific research, technological innovation, and service activities. This paper is a conceptual paper with a methodology that relies on critical qualitative research approach which involves in-depth understanding and description of the nature of a phenomenon under consideration. The statistical data are used where available and appropriate to illustrate the presented challenges of current knowledge-based economy dominated by services. For the purpose of exploring the established research questions, we examined in the second part of the paper the historical roots of knowledge economy with a view to consider the current stance knowledge economy in Europe. The third part discusses the evolution of the concept of knowledge economy that lead to the reconceptualization of the knowledge economy which is discussed in the fourth part of the paper. The fifth part describes the changes in understanding the notion of “knowledge” within different types of emerging intangible economies which ended up in the concept of service economy as their common denominator. The sixth part explores the challenges of service economy supported by available analyses and statistical data that can serve as a motivation for fostering service economy more oriented to knowledge-intensive activities and high/medium technologies. Lastly, the main thesis is recapitulated to suggest reconsideration of the concept of knowledge economy which suits the growth path of service economy.",27

Khorsheed,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since the 1950s, economists have observed that factors related to technological change and innovation account for a large proportion of economic growth (Peters 2006). Knowledge is considered as the key ingredient in technological change and innovation. It transforms specific ways in which industrial activities are conducted. Moreover, knowledge can completely alter the process through which products and services are produced and consumed (Gulbrandsen 2011). Knowledge and the ensuing technological change bring about structural shifts in any economy and consequently in any society. Innovation involves the successful introduction of new technologies, methods, techniques, or practices into production or introduction of new or altered products and services into the marketplace (Zyl et al. 2007). It could have various shapes and styles, product-related vs. process-related, disruptive vs. incremental, and fundamentally technological vs. business models and organizational structures. Despite differences in the manner in which innovation is pursued and applied, the application and impact of technological change benefit firm value, methods of production, and economic and societal advancement. The underlying driver of innovation is the expansion of the current stock of knowledge (Uppenberg 2009) raising productive capital and enhancing economic growth. This function becomes a sustainable economic driver when as part of a wider socio-economic system, with dedicated institutions promoting the active acquisition and dissemination of knowledge that become the primary sources of innovation, referred to as national systems of innovation (Freeman 2002). Innovation is a non-linear process with complex interactions among a multitude of organizations. A society’s capacity for innovation, and consequently its ability to sustain growth, depends to a large extent, on the strengths of interactions among its institutions and the effectiveness of a variety of policies. This relationship between people, enterprises, and institutions that guides the flow of technology and knowledge within a country is referred to as the “National Innovation Ecosystem (NIE)” (Lundvall 1992; Nelson 1993). Some countries use the term National Innovation System (NIS), when either NIE or NIS frameworks have been deployed in countries to promote technology and innovation (Freeman 1987; Faber and Hesen 2004; Kaiser and Prange 2004; Wonglimpiyarat 2011; Wong and Goh 2012). NIE or NIS must include key elements such as human resources and capital, the environment for entrepreneurship, the policy environment, financial conditions, knowledge networks that enable rapid communication and collaboration among technical professionals, market conditions, research and development (R&D), and last but not least infrastructure. A serious weakness in any element of the former or in any linkage that interconnects them can pose a significant negative impact on the ecosystem as a whole (Galabova 2012). Different schools of thought have emerged in recent years in the study of NIE. The governments of Taiwan, Korea, and Finland developed their NIEs with the objective of improving the innovation capacity of the country (Dodgson 2009; Nieminen and Kaukonen 2001). The cornerstone of their models is based on intellectual property in addition to infrastructure development. The Australian government followed a similar approach to promote skill development through teamwork, problem solving, communications, and ability to prioritize and manage innovation (Ross et al. 2005). Economic growth in China and India improved as a result to increases in their innovation capacity (Fan 2011), spurred by heavy investment in R&D activities and human capital, as well as creating linkages among science and business sectors, incentivizing innovation activities, and balanced the import of technology with indigenous R&D effort. The two countries detain a similar approach to the Japanese NIE model, whereby efforts concentrate on developing collaborative relationships among R&D entities, industry, and firms (Motohashi 2005; Sun and Negishi 2010). Industrial policy, absorptive capacity in productivity growth, and the ability to transform innovation rents into positive externalities (spillovers) have played a key role in the development of indigenous technological capabilities in Asian countries (Fu et al. 2011). A number of countries are basing their economic growth on innovation using various theoretical frameworks which have been developed to guide policymakers (Oerlemans and Pretorius 2006; Williams and McGuire 2010). Some nations customized their NIE structures in order to address major challenges related to science and technology development in their states. These NIE models exhibit iterative or radical changes that illustrate how an NIE framework evolves to meet needs over time (Balzat and Hanusch 2004). Nair (2007) developed the 7i framework which outlines the factors that contribute to improving a nation’s innovative capacity. The framework identifies seven elements, infrastructure, intellectual capital, interaction, integrity, incentives, and institutions. Those elements facilitate movement up the innovation value chain. The 7i framework is depicted as a set of factors surrounded by various agents, including the government, enterprises, entrepreneurs, associations, financiers, knowledge transfer centers, social networks, and research centers. The placement of the 7is of NIE at the center of these organizations points to the implicitly formed interaction, connection, and feedback loops. Open innovation framework is another NIE model that focuses on the activities of enterprises, rather than the government’s, in driving innovation (Chesbrough 2003). Open innovation concentrates on behavioral elements that are internal to the enterprise such as networking, collaboration, corporate entrepreneurship, intellectual property management, and performance of R&D. It also notes external elements which are the stock of basic knowledge in the country, the existence of a highly educated, mobile workforce, and access to finance. This paper analyzes the NIE frameworks for Finland, South Korea, and Singapore. From 1995 to 2014, the three countries experienced gains in innovation and attained high overall performance with significant improvements in most pillars in the previous 20-year periods (InnoMetrics 2009; Schwab 2008; Schwab 2009; Schwab 2010; Schwab 2011; Schwab 2012; Schwab 2013; Schwab 2014). Sections 2, 3, and 4 illustrate the experiences from Finland, South Korea, and Singapore, respectively, with more emphasis on NIE governance structure, collaboration mechanisms, key findings, and implications. Section 5 interprets those results into pillars which impact establishing a novel NIE, and finally, section 6 draws some conclusions.",7

However, economic growth is the mainstay of any country’s economic development because of its overall benefits in the different sectors of the economy. In addition, economic growth can increase the living standard if the nation’s wealth is fairly distributed. By the way, because of the positive influence on the aggregate demand, growth raises employment rates. Further, growth provides fiscal dividend through extra tax revenue that can be used to finance public projects. In fact, it enhances the effect by encouraging investment in new technology which can then help sustain economic growth through increased aggregate supply and boost business confidence through its positive impact on the firm’s profits, which in turn boost their stock exchange values resulting in the growth of big companies (Razmi and Refaei 2013). On the one hand, the FDI inflows and environmental quality are well known as very important factors in the economic growth process. The FDI inflows can play an important role by increasing and raising the supply of funds for domestic investment in the host country. This can be done through the production chain when foreign investors buy locally made inputs and sell intermediate inputs to local enterprises. Furthermore, the FDI inflows can increase the host country’s export capacity, causing the developing country to increase its foreign exchange earnings. FDI can also encourage the creation of new jobs, enhance technology transfer, and boost overall economic growth in the host countries (Belloumi 2014). On the other hand, environment pollutants affect economic growth. There is a proof of a global nature of air pollution and its effects on the earth’s surface. The distress fullness and the long-term damaging effect of environmental pollution can contribute to destructive consequences on human wellbeing and economy. This will lead to the increase of health and social costs (Borhan et al. 2012). Therefore, pollution may directly decrease the output by decreasing productivity of man-made capital and labor. Here, pollution appears as a negative externality. Because of health problems, there are losses of labor day, and due to polluted air or water, there are deteriorations in the quality of the industrial equipment. Secondly, the firm’s production costs are increased when firms abate pollution emissions. The nexus between FDI inflows and CO2 emissions to economic growth has been intensively and empirically analyzed over the last few years. This research can be categorized into two parts. The first part investigates the impact of FDI inflows on economic growth. Most of the past studies are concerned with the questions of whether a higher level of FDI inflows leads to higher additional economic growth. However, the role of foreign investment in economic growth has been considered one of the basic principles in economics. Empirical studies concluded that there is a broad consensus that investment is good for economic growth (Edwards 1998 and Baldwin 2003). These studies showed that the accumulation of foreign capital is one of the main determinants of economic growth. On the other hand, other empirical studies, Barrell and Pain 1999; Chakrabarti 2001; Schiff and Wang 2008; Batten and Vo 2009; Hooi and Wah 2010; Aizhan and Makaevna 2011; Soltani and Ochi 2012; and Melnyk et al. 2014) confirm that there is a positive impact of FDI inflow on economic growth. However, others concluded negative impacts (e.g., Sanders and Secchi 1974; Saltz 1992; Elboiashi et al. 2009; Ahmed 2012; Saqib et al. (2013); and Bayar 2014). Finally, according to studies (see Blomstrom et al. 1994; Katerina et al. 2004; Duasa 2007; Mah 2010; Azman-Saini et al. 2010; and Aga 2014); it seems that FDI has no effect on economic growth. Moreover, other studies concluded that FDI is considered to be one of the major channels of technological transfer. They state that FDI can positively affect economic growth through the transfer of technology and know-how, and this impact can be positive (Frindlay 1978; Borensztein et al. 1998; Ford et al. 2008; Yu et al. 2011). Inversely, the transfer of technology can also bring negative effects (Sen 1998; Vissak and Roolaht 2005) The second part of this research examines the impact of CO2 emissions on economic growth. Several studies examined the link between CO2 emissions and economic growth (see, e.g., Grossman and Krueger 1991
Footnote 1; Shafik 1994; Manag 2006; Markandya et al. 2006; Richmond and Kaufman 2006; Ang 2007; Song et al. 2008; Soytas and Sari 2009; Halicioglu 2009; Chebbi et al. 2009; Fodha and Zaghdoud 2010; Pao and Tsai 2010; Christopher and Douglason 2011; Arouri et al. 2012; Jayanthakumaran et al. 2012; Borhan et al. 2012; Saidi and Hammami 2014; Bastola and Sapkota 2015; Omri et al. 2015). Thus, the objective of this study is to empirically examine the influence of FDI inflows and environmental quality on economic growth in the selected countries of the Middle East and North African Countries (MENA) group such as Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, Yemen, and UAE, for the period 1990–2012 using both static and dynamic panel data approaches. All these countries have the same level of economic structure. Therefore, there is an attempt to answer the following: How do FDI inflows and environmental quality affect economic growth in the MENA countries? The rest of the paper is organized as follows: “Literature Review” section deals with the literature review; “Econometric Method and Data” section outlines the econometric modeling approach and describes the used data; “Data and Descriptive Statistics” section reports and discusses the empirical results; and “Results and Discussions” section concludes the article and offers some policy implications.",61
8.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,06 August 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-015-0286-z,Are There Separate Effects of Male and Female Higher Education on Economic Growth? Evidence from Greece,March 2017,Panagiotis Pegkas,Constantinos Tsamadias,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Economic literature [macroeconomic (Pereira and Aubyn 2009; Odit et al. 2010) and microeconomic (Psacharopoulos 1995; Bouaissa 2009)] stresses the importance of education/human capital in the process of economic growth. It accepts education as the principal institutional mechanism of the production, accumulation and diffusion of human capital and suggests that it produces and disseminates market and non-market benefits, externalities and spillovers (Schultz 1961; Becker 1964; Lucas 1988; Romer 1986, 1990). Existing growth literature offers a variety of theories and models relating education to economic growth. Since the late of 1980, in macroeconomics, the role of education/human capital on economic growth has been highlighted by different economists. Mankiw et al. (1992) (hereafter M-R-W) augmented the neoclassical model of Solow (1956) with human capital as an additional production factor, while endogenous growth models (Lucas 1988; Romer 1990) directly relate human capital and technology adoption. Endogenous growth theory reduces the limitations of the neoclassical growth model by allowing increasing returns to scale through endogenous technological progress linked to human capital accumulation. A key difference between endogenous growth theory and the neoclassical growth model is that increasing or decreasing returns to scale within the production function for technology allows net increasing, decreasing or constant returns to scale of the produced factors within the production goods. The neoclassical model assumes constant returns to scale in production functions. Higher education (H.E) is an important form of investment in human capital development and it can be regarded as a high level or a specialized form of human capital. In the last two decades, an issue preoccupying scholars has been to investigate the effect of H.E on economic growth. The role of H.E as a key factor on research and technological progress, on innovation and consequently on total factor productivity and economic growth is well documented in the literature. In the recent literature, it is accepted that male and female education affects the output levels and growth in different ways (Tansel and Gungor 2013). There have been many empirical studies which investigate the link between higher education and economic growth (Pegkas and Tsamadias 2014). However, studies on the gender-separate education effects on economic growth are scarce. Moreover, the results are contradictory. Additionally, among these studies, the majority have been based on cross-country estimations. Studies on country-specific cases using time series analysis have been particularly lacking. In Greece, after the collapse of the 7-year dictatorship (April 1967–July 1974), the period 1975–2012 was of great importance. Three major events took place, influencing the evolution of economy and education: (1) the accession to the EEC (January 1981). Since then, Greece, as an EEC member, participated in all stages of European integration including the single European Act and the signing of the Maastricht Treaty; (2) the accession to the European Monetary Union (EMU) and the adoption of the new Eurocurrency (January 2001), and (3) Greece entered into the support mechanism (European Commission, European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund) (May 2010). Since then, restrictive fiscal policies were implemented that have a significant impact on the economy, education and employment. During this period, the higher education system consists of two sectors the university sector [universities (Univs) and technical universities (T.Univs)] and the technological sector [higher technological education institutions (HTEIs)] and has expanded rapidly (Pegkas and Tsamadias 2014). All the higher education institutions (HEIs) are under the supervision of the Ministry of Education. There was a high social demand for higher education despite the fact that the monetary rewards associated with higher education were low with respect to other countries (Tsamadias 2002; Psacharopoulos 2003). According to UNESCO (1997), in the early 1990s, over 40,000 Greeks were studying abroad, while Eurostat (2001) estimates the number of Greek students in other EU countries alone in the late 1990s to be around 50,000. The number of Greek students in foreign Univs between 1970 and 1982 held the world record (after Hong Kong) (Liagouras et al. 2003). Individuals choose their studies according to their social status and not necessarily their employment prospects and have seen a university degree as a passport to enter the public sector, which is traditionally preferred to the private as it offers higher wages, better working conditions and better pension schemes. The stock of human capital (average years of education) of the population, employees and non-employees, increased. The number of average years of education of the population in 2010 approximates the mean of OECD countries (11.13 years) and European Union countries (11.05 years) (Barro-Lee 2010). The average years of education for non-employees were more than those for employees (except in 2010) (Pegkas and Tsamadias 2014). Liagouras et al. (2003) report that there is international evidence that Greece forms the most notable exception in EU or OECD countries regarding the high unemployment rates of young graduates. These findings show that there were mismatches between education and the labour market, with a gap between the (more or less satisfied) strong demand for higher education and the limited demand of the domestic economy for highly educated personnel. It has been suggested that one of the main reasons accounting for the high levels of unemployment among graduates is the weak link between the higher education system and the labour market. The European Commission (2003) suggests that Greek education systematically insists on not taking into account the needs of the labour market. As far back as the 1960s, the relatively low returns to schooling led observers to conclude that the country may be overeducated (Patrinos 1997). The limited demand of the domestic economy for young higher education graduates is mainly due to the weaknesses of the business sector and the poor economic performance of the country in the last few decades (Liagouras et al. 2003). Microstudies estimate the returns of investments in higher education, by gender, moving at about the same level and there is not general agreement as to the layout (Hadjidema 1998; Tsamadias 2002; Psacharopoulos and Patrinos 2004). Recently, a macrostudy for the case of Greece shows that higher education has had a statistically significant and positive effect on growth, in the period 1960–2009 (Pegkas and Tsamadias 2014), and other studies (Tsamadias and Kyratzi 2014; Kyratzi et al. 2015) find that efficiency and productivity of HEIs are, on average, satisfactory in relation with HEIs of other countries, while Univs and T.Univs have, on average, higher indices than HTEIs, over the period 2005–2009. The purpose of this study is to investigate and estimate the gender-separate higher education effects on economic growth in Greece over the time period of 1975–2012. Greece during this period from a country of the Southern Balkan Peninsula became part of the core of the European Union. During this transition many structural and functional reforms and adjustments were materialized to the higher education, labour market and economy with little or more success. Also, the equal-opportunity policies which have been implemented have resulted in increasing the rate of female participation in higher education and in the labour market. This paper attempts to provide new evidence on this issue from the perspective of a single country rather than a cross-country viewpoint. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study which investigates the impact of gender-separate higher education on growth in a country that belongs in the periphery of the European Union. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The “Literature Review” section presents brief relevant theoretical literature and previous studies on the effect of male and female education on economic growth.

This paper extends prior research (Hatzikian 2013a, b) and the main question of this study is “What is the most effective innovation intensity that a firm needs to have for its firm performance?” To this end, we use productivity and knowledge production or growth as metrics of firm performance and we explore their behaviour with regard to a firm’s innovation intensity. We test the hypotheses that there is a U-shaped relationship between innovation intensity and productivity, and there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between innovation intensity and knowledge production in the short-term period. Many researchers have explained curvilinear relationships between research and development (R&D) expenditure with little consistency across studies. It has found support for a U-shaped relationship, using the organisational learning theory (e.g. Ruigrok and Wagner 2003), an inverted U-shaped relationship level, based on an increase in organisational costs as the diversity grows beyond the optimal level (e.g. Gomes and Ramaswamy 1999), a horizontal sigmoid relationship, connected to multi-stage approaches (e.g. Lu and Beamish 2004). These studies have used a diversity of theoretical approaches, from the finance theory of portfolio diversification, the resource-base view, to organisational learning theory, to predict a generally positive relationship between R&D expenditure and performance (Kim et al. 1993; Ruigrok and Wagner 2003). Our research motivation is the identification of historically the most effective innovation intensity that a Greek firm needed for its performance (before the Greek Debt Crisis). The results of this paper will motivate and guide our future research to examine the same question about the most effective innovation intensity that a firm needs to have for its firm performance under the conditions of debt crisis in Greece (2009–2014). For the needs of this paper, we apply the method for examining nonlinearities, that is, the introduction of squared terms as independent variables (see Gomes and Ramaswamy 1999; Hitt et al. 1997a). The collected variables are used in a multivariate multiple regression model formulation to evaluate the relative performance associated with them. For this reason, in this work, a number of variables are used, like the innovation intensity, the squared term of innovation intensity, the percentage of R&D personnel, the labour productivity (in terms of sales per employee) and the innovative new to the market products in the total of sales, as well as the firm size. We rely on the final results of a research project on women in innovation, technology and science based on 372 questionnaires selected on a 2-year time period (2004–2006). The structure of our paper includes the introduction where we represent our research motivations and the goals of our specific work, the literature review where we examine a variety of previous studies, methodology and conceptual framework, data presentation, variables, empirical model, results and conclusion.",1

Dimelli,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Most of the world’s population lives in a variety of settlements that are rapidly changing. More specifically, the changes that have taken place in Europe show that urbanization has increased while simultaneously the countryside loses its population. This fact is caused as consumption patterns are completely different throughout Europe from what they were 20 years ago. Mobility, new types of housing, communication, tourism, and leisure have emerged as major components of consumption by households in Europe, whose size and composition are also undergoing profound changes: many more households, smaller in size with higher consumption rates per individual. In this context, the coastal areas in particular and, to a lesser degree, the mountainous, are being urbanized at an accelerating rate—for instance, urbanization of the coast grew about 30 % faster than inland areas. This urbanization process takes place in Greece during the last 50 years with intensity that differs according to the changes of the country’s productive base. During the second half of the twentieth century, Greece has experienced significant changes on several levels of economic, social, and cultural life which are directly or indirectly associated with the rapid growth of tourism (Galani- Moutafi 2004) that caused the development of tourism infrastructures in the coastal areas. The collapse of the primary and the secondary sector and the simultaneous gigantism of the tertiary sector, especially tourism, changed the way the county’s population is spatially distributed. It is estimated that in 2000, the Greek economy depended heavily on tourism, as tourism’s contribution varied between 50 % and in some areas 90 % of the Gross regional product (Buhalis 1999). This intense tourism development has contributed to the anarchic development of the Greek coastal and insular regions that follow a single development which diachronically decayed local resources and jeopardized the sustainability of these regions in the long term. Despite tourism activity relying on the environmental quality more than any other economic activity, this is often disregarded in local planning (Buhalis 1999). Tourism development often contrasts sharply with the protection of uniqueness as it implies modernization, change in culture, urbanization, and exploitation of resources (Coccosis 1987). The 95 inhabited Greek islands with their traditionally built-up environment on the one hand and the unspoiled sea on the other made Greece a desirable destination since the 1960s (Buhalis 1999). As spatial planning was not “prepared” for this kind of growth, the areas that faced intense pressures were environmentally exploited as by that time all policies focused on the profit’s maximization by tourism activities. The results of this development also influenced the hinterlands as the mutation of the country’s productive base led to the abandonment of the traditional agricultural and industrial activities and simultaneously to intense population relocation towards the coastal touristic zones. But what is the role of spatial planning for the confrontation of the tourism effects on the insular settlements? For the development of the settlements, the spatial planning was a determinant factor. The regional and urban plans that have been applied during the past decades have not managed to propose policies for the settlements development that would designate their characteristics. At present, spatial planning policies often reflect the logic of the market. Through the legislation of uncertain restrictions that faced fragmentarily these areas, in many cases mass tourism caused the violation of carrying capacity and adverse esthetic interventions in the historical and cultural environments of these areas (Galani- Moutafi 2004). The current paper is structured by two sections. In the first section, it presents and analyzes the demographic characteristics of the insular Greek settlements. It examines their population changes during the last 20 years and the spatial problems that are caused by intense tourism development. In the second section, it focuses on the tools for settlements spatial planning and it points out the need for the formulation of specified policies that can be applied for these areas development.",15

In addition, the differences in technology represent an important determinant of the differences in the total factor productivity (TFP) across countries (Hall and Jones 1999; Romer 1990). Technological diffusion is a key element in upgrading developing countries. Technological change may be seen as a specific feature of the broad concept of “structural change”, seen as different arrangements of productive activity in the economy. As noted by Silva and Teixeira (2008) in their comprehensive survey on the matter, the composition of the economy and its relation with technology change has traditionally been seen as an important factor influencing growth, although with a varying degree of attention over time. Therefore, it would be efficient for developing countries to acquire foreign technology created in the developed countries. In principle, if the innovations are easy to diffusion, a technologically backward country could catch up rapidly by absorbing the most advanced technologies. The determinants of technological change can be classified into two categories. They can be either exogenous (not dependent on the economic conditions) or endogenous (that meets the economic obligations). Technological change is characterized by three stages: the invention, the innovation, and the diffusion. The first two steps are part of the activity of the research and development (R&D). However, the interaction between the R&D and the diffusion may well determine and describe the process of technological change. Usually, we measure the productivity changes with the growth of the TFP. For advanced nations, the literature (Coccia 2012) shows a positive correlation between R&D intensity (usually measured as a percent of gross domestic product (GDP) or R&D per capita) and various measures of economic growth, including GDP, TFP, and labor productivity. (Coccia 2012) notes that a recent analysis of 65 countries over the 1965–2005 period indicates that a 10 % increase in R&D per capita generates an average increase of about 1.6 % in the long-run TFP. One pertinent issue is to examine the determinants of technological diffusion in the Tunisian manufacturing sector. The literature has been extended into a couple of directions (Coe et al. 2008), the measurement of foreign R&D capital stock to account for the different diffusion channels, the model specification (controlling for additional relevant factors that explain the spillover mechanism), and the econometric techniques used (panel cointegration). Several empirical studies have focused on the effect of technology and channels of transmission spillovers. Most of these studies found that the new advanced technology can be transferred in the developing countries through the foreign direct investment (FDI). Some empirical research shows that technology transferred through FDI has positive effects on developing countries (Eden et al. 1997; Kokko et al. 1996; Buckley et al. 2002). An analysis of the Chinese firms (Du et al. 2011) found that the foreign presence has a significant impact on the domestic firms through backward and forward (vertical) linkages. In a similar approach (Jordaan 2011), using a cross section finds the evidence of the technology diffusion from the foreign direct investment spillovers. However, it should be noted that knowledge spillovers from the foreign presence may take time to manifest themselves. Other scholars (Todo et al. 2011) found that R&D stock plays a significant role in determining the technological diffusion. However, Suyano et al. (2009) find evidence of technological transfer through competition effects from the foreign presence in the industry using Indonesian firm data for chemical and pharmaceutical industries. Study (Jarkovic and Spatareanu 2011) showed that the spillovers productivity exists through the backward linkage in Romania. They find that the foreign investment and the existence of trade agreements between the host and home country have positive effects on the domestic producers. The literature has also emphasized the importance of the human capital in the process of technological transfer. There many works which consider the learning and the human capital as a source of growth especially in the technological change in a host country. By Nelson and Phelps (1966), the technology diffusion depends on the level of education, Cohen and Levinthal (1989) argue that adoption of technology diffusion depends on the level of the human capital. As well as Engelbrecht (2002) found a positive effect of the human capital in the absorption of the international knowledge spillovers. Kneller (2005) concludes that the effect of technology spillovers varies according to the level of the human capital, the domestic R&D, and the physical distance. Technology spillovers may also take place along the spatial/regional dimension, where knowledge spillovers are geographically localized (Audretsch and Feldman 1996; Jaffe et al. 1993), and there may be geographic boundaries to information flows and knowledge spillovers among the firms in an industry (Krugman 1991). Section “Determinants of the Technological Diffusion” analyzes the determinants of technology transfer in the Tunisian manufacturing industry. Section “The Empirical Study” analyzes the possible benefits from international technology transfer. Section “Empirical Result and Discussion” presents the empirical results and their discussion. Finally, Section “Conclusion” concludes.",4

More specifically, we ask if the spatial distribution of KIBS is solely explained by city size or whether other factors, such as collocation with manufacturing, plants and R&D centres or regional economic specialization/diversity, also contribute. Do KIBS serve their customers from central locations in the largest cities, or do they collocate with manufacturing plants in non-metropolitan industrial centres too? And what are the implications for knowledge-based regional policies? This issue was picked up by Shearmur and Doloreux (2008), who empirically demonstrated the increasingly strong role of city size (urban hierarchy) in the spatial distribution of KIBS in Canada. One of their main conclusions was that KIBS that serve manufacturing firms do not have to leave metropolitan areas in order to locate close to manufacturing firms based in non-metropolitan areas. In many small countries with developed transport and information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure, the majority of industrial and commercial centres are located within a 1-h driving perimeter from the largest metropolitan regions. As long as there is a general tendency for KIBS to concentrate in the largest cities (e.g. Aslesen and Isaksen 2007; Shearmur and Doloreux 2008; Gallego and Maroto 2013; Müller and Doloreux 2009; Cuadrado-Roura 2013; Wood 2002), there are two possible scenarios of spatial distribution of KIBS. The first scenario predicts the emergence of a spatial mismatch between the location of manufacturing firms and KIBS: manufacturing may be relatively dispersed and significantly represented in small- and medium-sized cities (Henderson 2003), while KIBS should be heavily concentrated in the largest cities. The second scenario predicts centrifugal forces to be prevalent, pushing KIBS firms to locate outside metropolitan areas, either to reduce costs or to capitalize on the proximity of large manufacturing firms, their principal customers. Drawing on empirical evidence from Czechia, we aim to contribute to this debate from the perspective of a small post-communist country, capitalizing on its favourable geoeconomic location in Central Europe. In contrast to Canada, Czechia is a small country with rather short distances, good accessibility, extremely strong economic position of the capital city Prague and a significant portion of manufacturing and R&D business employment located in non-metropolitan regions (Ženka et al. 2015). If we detected the collocation of KIBS and manufacturing in non-metropolitan regions despite the fact that metropolitan regions are well accessible, it would be a strong argument supporting the claim that innovation process in manufacturing requires face-to-face contact and thus spatial collocation. We therefore ask which of the two abovementioned scenarios is more relevant for Czechia. The remainder of this text is organized as follows. In the next two sections, we discuss arguments for and against the concentration of KIBS in the largest cities—theoretically (‘Spatial Distribution of Knowledge-Intensive Services—Theoretical Discussion’) and in terms of the specific context of Central Europe and Czechia (‘Knowledge-Intensive Services in Czechia: Discussion’). ‘Data and Variables’ describes data and variables. ‘Regional Distribution of Knowledge-Intensive Services in Czechia—Description of the Patterns’ provides a descriptive outline of the spatial distribution of KIBS in Czechia. In ‘Regional Distribution of Knowledge-Intensive Services in Czechia—Results of Multivariate Spatial Regression Analysis’, we present empirical results on the multivariate statistical analysis of spatial distribution of KIBS and its predictors. ‘Conclusion and Policy Implications’ provides conclusions and policy implications.",23

This meant that since 1992 (when that ratio amounted to only 28%), Poland’s GDP doubled. This rapid growth of the Polish economy accelerated again after entry into the EU in 2004. The growth was due, among other things, to access to new markets, international supply chains and cooperation networks, and was underpinned by a competitive cost of Polish labor, relative to the wealthier EU countries. Undoubtedly, the Polish economy also benefited from the inflow of large amounts of structural funds from the EU since 2007. Considering the Polish contribution to the EU budget, this aid amounted to €61 billion in the programming period 2007–2013, while €75 billion is planned for the period 2014–2020. On average, these accumulated sums account for approximately 17–18% of the annual Polish GDP. They have played and continue to play a significant role in modernizing outdated infrastructure and are thus key investments for the economy. Reports on the Polish economy published in the last 5 years (Appointment Council; Evans 2015; Balzer and Askonas 2016; Bogdan et al. 2014; Carayannis and Campbell 2009; Carayannis et al. 2012) acknowledge the rapid advancement and effective catch-up with the EU-17 average, but also reveal significant risks stemming from the so-called “middle-income trap.” In this context, the reports point to the low levels of Polish innovation as a major barrier to further growth. Forecasts developed, among others, by the World Bank (Evans 2015) and McKinsey (Carayannis and Campbell 2009) agree that for attaining a higher development level, Poland must effectively become a knowledge-based economy. If the country does manage to do this and continue its high-growth path, there is an expectation that it would enter another “Golden Age,” similar to the one which Poland last experienced during the sixteenth century, when it was a major player in European politics and economics. Figure 1 shows the historic decline in living standards in Poland against Europe (expressed as a percentage of average European living standards) in the period from 1500 to 1989, i.e., until the collapse of the communist Eastern Bloc and the beginning of political and economic changes. Fig. 2 shows the forecast of GDP growth per capita in the period until 2030, under the assumption of the maintenance of positive trends in today’s economy (Center of Advanced European Studies). Reaching 80% of the EU-17 GDP per capita by 2030 would result from sustainable economic growth in excess of 2.3% of the average value for the entire Union. However, according to a forecast by the OECD (Center of Advanced European Studies), after a period of rapid growth, economic stagnation is expected to occur soon after 2020, and for the next 15 years after that, the Polish economy could grow by as little as 1.1%, which would be the lowest value of all OECD countries.

 Forecast of GDP (percentage) per capita over time (1500–2030) M. Piatkowski 2013
 The McKinsey report “Poland 2025” (Carayannis and Campbell 2009) provides a more optimistic analysis of the Polish economy prospects, predicting that Poland will develop until 2025 at speeds reaching 4%, provided that significant pro-innovation reforms are implemented in the coming years. However, failure of such reforms would result in growth of only 2%, and Poland would miss the chance to join the group of European leaders. According to this report, simply increasing expenditure on research, development and innovation (RDI) is insufficient for rapid development of a more innovative economy. Much more would be required than a simple reallocation of resources. Broader change at many levels of the economy and society is needed. “Business as usual” would lead to regional stagnation, or at least under-utilization of the unique opportunity that Poland presently has under the smart specialization programs of the EU. The coming years may represent perhaps the “last chance” for Poland to use the significant public support (including EU funds that will start expiring after 2020) to accelerate the transformation of the Polish economy, escape the middle-income trap and build a knowledge-based economy. In early 2016, the Polish government announced the Morawiecki Plan to meet this challenge. The diagnosis included in the Plan draws on the conclusions of many previous expert reports, and argues that Poland’s new “knowledge economy” would be based on domestic know-how, creativity of entrepreneurs, achievements of Polish researchers and cooperation between different economy sectors. The Plan is presently subject to many debates in Poland. For example, some critics claim that it is more of a vision than a real plan, as the actions to be taken are not fully described and some details are still missing. In this article, the key components of the Morawiecki Plan and the chances for its success are examined. Section 2 provides a brief analysis of the Triple Helix model and its relevance to the reform of the Polish national innovation system. Section 3 critically examines key elements in the construction of a Triple Helix system in Poland in the period 2007–2014, identifying some mistakes that affect the current functionality of the national innovation system. In “The Vision of the Morawiecki Plan: Will Poland Use Its “Last Chance” to Catch-Up?” and “Long-Term Success Factors of the Morawiecki Plan: Building the Blocks of a Robust Triple Helix System for the Twenty-First Century and the Importance of Open Innovation” sections, we critically analyze the most recent strategic changes proposed under the Morawiecki Plan, drawing on the experiences of benchmark countries similar to Poland, which have successfully gone through the transition from a traditional economy to an innovative economy.",10

(Professor P. F. Drucker [1909–2005], 1994, p. 53) Over the last five decades, the term “knowledge economy” has been used in a variety of contexts in academic literature, but the meaning remains vague (Strożek 2014, p. 223). The term has been used interchangeably with other terms such as knowledge-based economy, knowledge society, network economy, information economy, digital economy, knowledge-based society, new economy and intangible economy (Coyle 1999; Huang and Soete 2007; Hvidt 2015; Stiglitz 1999). The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) (2010) also reports that knowledge economy has not only been used interchangeably with other terms but that the concept is understood and used differently in different research disciplines (for example, engineering, business, mathematics, sociology, anthropology, economics, education and science). A (US) Google search for the term knowledge economy results in an impressive number of hits—21.4 million (as at 12 November 2016). Over the last 12 months, there have been an average of 560 searches a month for the keyword knowledge economy (see Fig. 1). However, use of the term knowledge economy goes back some decades. Professor P. F. Drucker coined the term “knowledge worker” in 1959 (see Landmarks of Tomorrow) and considered knowledge-worker productivity to be the next frontier of management (Drucker 1959). He used the phrase knowledge economy (p. 247) in his 1969 book, The Age of Discontinuity: Guidelines to our Changing Society (Drucker 1969). Drucker (1994, p. 62), in his article “The age of social transformation”, strongly emphasizes that “By the end of this century knowledge workers will make up a third or more of the work force in the United States—as large a proportion as manufacturing workers ever made up, except in wartime. The majority of them will be paid at least as well as, or better than, manufacturing workers ever were. And the new jobs offer much greater opportunities” Knowledge economy Google search report (USA). Source: https://www.semrush.com/info/knowledge%20economy+(full+search) (accessed 12 November 2016) After collecting a great deal of evidence over a 30-year period to confirm his earlier prediction, Drucker (2001) argues that “[t] he next society will be a knowledge society. Knowledge will be its key resource, and knowledge workers will be the dominant group in its workforce”. He goes on to provide three main characteristics of a knowledge economy: (a) borderlessness (i.e. knowledge travels even more effortlessly than money), (b) upward mobility (i.e. social advancement available to everyone through formal education) and (c) potential for failure as well as success (i.e. knowledge is necessary but is not enough on its own in order to be successful). According to the Oxford Dictionary (2016), the knowledge economy is “an economy in which growth is dependent on the quantity, quality, and accessibility of the information available, rather than the means of production”. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (1996, p. 9) states that “The term knowledge-based economy results from a fuller recognition of the role of knowledge and technology in economic growth. Knowledge, as embodied in human beings (as ‘human capital’) and in technology, has always been central to economic development. … In the past decade [1970–1994], the high-technology share of OECD manufacturing production and exports has more than doubled, to reach 20–25 per cent. Knowledge-intensive service sectors, such as education, communications and information, are growing even faster. Indeed, it is estimated that more than 50 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the major OECD economies is now knowledge-based”. However, as already mentioned there is no universally accepted definition of the knowledge economy in academic literature (Huang and Soete 2007; Hvidt 2015). This study draws on the discussion offered by the OECD (see previous paragraph) and uses a definition of knowledge economy which encompasses the progress of human capital, education, employment, information and communications technology (ICT), innovation and economy. Research on this topic in the Middle East is limited, and this study, therefore, focuses on Saudi Arabia which is the considered to be the world’s most “oil-rich” country. Khorsheed (2015, p. 149) sates that “ … despite some attempts at economic diversification, the Saudi economy remains heavily dependent on oil and petroleum-related industries including petrochemicals and petroleum refining”. The study uses documentary analysis and provides two major contributions to this field: (a) a knowledge economy framework for an oil-rich country and (b) a policy agenda in line with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030. The paper is organized into seven sections: “Background Information on Saudi Arabia” provides background on Saudi Arabia; “Prior Literature” presents an overview of existing literature; “Research Methods
” outlines the research methods used; “Results and Discussion” discusses the results of the study; “Saudi Vision 2030 and National Transformation Program 2020” discusses two key Saudi initiatives, Vision 2030 and the related National Transformation Program 2020, and reports on analysis of relevant policy papers. Finally, “Conclusion and Policy Agenda” contains conclusions and comments on a possible policy agenda.",86

Actually, a small number of markets for greenhouse gas emissions exist at the national level (e.g., the New Zealand Emissions Trading System), at the local level (e.g., California’s cap-and-trade program), or at the level of a single economic group (e.g., the EU Emissions Trading System, EU-ETS). Australia currently has a carbon tax, but is planning to create an ETS that will link to the European Union as early as 2020 (DCCEE 2011). Currently, China is experimenting with ETS designs at the provincial level with the emphasis on creating a trading market at the national level (Guoyi et al. 2012). Although the latest attempt to establish a national emission trading system in the USA dropped in 2010, many regional carbon markets have been implemented (Lavelle 2010; California Environmental Protection Agency Air Resources Board 2012; RGGI 2013), which can speed up the steps to a national market in the USA. Although a multi-region agreement is yet to materialize, the potential benefits of linking emission markets across countries and regions are well recognized (Marschinski et al. 2012). In addition, the prospects for linking carbon markets in the developing and developed countries have been widely discussed and seen as a way of encouraging participation by the developing countries in a global climate agreement (ICAP 2007; European Union Commission 2009). Australia’s ETS represents the first effort to create an international emission market since the EU-ETS was established in 2005 (Australia Greenhouse Gas Reduction Scheme Administrator 2012; Nelson et al. 2012). In addition, China indicated that it would consider participating in an international carbon market if plans to expand pilot programs to the nation level are successful (Guoyi et al. 2012; Environment News Service 2013). The impact from linking carbon markets depends in some measure on the relative amount of emissions in both regions. For example, a link between the EU-ETS and a hypothetical ETS in the USA has a larger impact on the EU carbon price as is the link between the EU-ETS and a hypothetical ETS in Mexico (Gavard et al. 2011). Within the framework that we consider, relevant markets have very different emission levels. However, the total CO2 emissions caused by the use of fossil fuels in Australia were around 385 million metric tons (mmt) in 2010, compared to 3861 mmt in the EU, 7259 mmt in China, and 5763 mmt in the USA (International Energy Agency 2011). Therefore, linking the EU-ETS with a cap-trade program in China and the US should have a more important impact on the EU permit price than linking this system with an ETS in Australia. This paper examines the impacts including changes in carbon prices, emissions, and welfare of carbon markets in the Europe Union (EU), the USA, Australia-New Zealand (ANZ), and China (CHN). Some benefits from establishing an international ETS are obvious. Particularly, a global market provides more elasticity for parties to achieve emission reductions at the lowest marginal cost across all the covered sectors and jurisdictions (Flachsland et al. 2009b). However, the impact of global trading cannot always be positive for all parties. For example, market distortions or trade effects can affect the relative advantages to each country of participation (Babiker et al. 2004; Flachsland, et al. 2009a). Other researchers suggest that emissions trading regimes may alter the way economic shocks are transmitted through international markets (McKibbin et al. 2008). In this paper, we utilize a multiregional computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Such model is well suited to the task at hand, as it captures linkages between energy and economic systems and interactions among regions (Marschinski et al. 2012). The paper is organized as follows. “Methods” discusses the model and data used for the analysis. “Results and discussions” describes the scenarios implemented in the model and “Conclusions and policy implications” discusses the results and concludes.",2

In fact, it has become so popular that it is constantly being abused, especially by people in management or research circles, treated as a filler word without meaningful intent or as a piece of popular jargon whose positivity can disguise the poverty of the user’s ideas (Berkun, 2008). Ironically, innovation was not always something that people were so eager to take credit for, as the term has a history of pejorative connotations. Godin (2010) notes the first recorded controversial use of the term, in the mid-1620s, during the turbulent times of the reformation and counter-reformation. Henry Burton, a Puritan minister, used the term to accuse the bishops of the church of England of innovating in matters of church doctrine and discipline. His polemical sermons resulted in him being brought before the court, where his opponents accused Burton himself of innovating. The minister had his ears cut off and was sentenced to life imprisonment (Godin, 2010). In fact, until the eighteenth century, an innovator was a suspicious person that was not to be trusted. The connotations of innovation started to shift from negative to positive only during the eighteenth century, when innovation was used to refer to an originality of authorship or creation, contrasted to copying and plagiarism (Godin, 2008a). In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, anthropologists studied innovation through culture change, referring to humanity’s progress in agriculture trade and social and political organisations. Innovation came to express novelty in a positive way but ‘invention’ was usually the preferred term when making mention of the creative abilities of man (Godin, 2008a). This is the critical distinction clearly established in the twentieth century by Joseph Schumpeter: invention is an act of intellectual creativity whereas innovation is an economic decision referring to the (commercial) application of that invention in practice (Godin, 2008b). It is evident that throughout the history of the term, whether it referred to religious doctrine, eighteenth century anthropology, Schumpeter’s economic framework or the four post-war generations of prevailing innovation metrics stretching from the 1950s to the twenty-first century (Milbergs & Vonortas, 2004), the emphasis is on processes and systems. The spark of individual creativity that gives rise to innovation, despite being a fundamental prerequisite for the whole process, is treated as a mere catalyst, often an unintentional one. In Schumpeter’s own words, the individual act that instigates innovation ‘is without importance to economic analysis’ (Schumpeter, 1939, p. 85). This reliance on systems might seem harsh or unfair, especially on the inventors behind major technological advances. However, while no one denies that innovation would have been impossible without the individual genius producing the invention behind it, the fact remains that invention per se is not enough for innovation (Levitt, 1963). The history of technology, which shows that many ideas and inventions fail despite their novelty and brilliance, provides ample proof of this, which is the main distinction between invention and innovation. Innovation makes use of the invention in order for benefits to accrue (Goddin, 2008a). And in order for that to happen, a whole system has to be in place, involving multiple components and people and going beyond the capacity of an individual. In the framework of Schumpeter’s (1939) original conception of innovation, the key is the role of the firm, which is responsible for the commercialisation of an innovative idea. However, by the 1980s, it gradually became apparent that the innovative performance of individual firms is not solely dependent on their own R&D expenditure but it is significantly affected by the new technological knowledge generated in other firms and universities (Griliches, 1984; Jaffe, 1986). This led to a shift of focus from firms to networks of public and private institutions whose activities and interactions influence the environment for innovation, creating the capacity and opportunity for innovation (Komninos, 2008). These are what became known as innovation systems (Freeman, 1987), operating in specific areas—usually either on a national or regional level—since geographical proximity facilitates the flow of information (Heidenreich, 2004). Despite technological advances and globalisation trends, the importance of geographically based systems of innovation is increasing and they are the standard used to assess innovation performance or implement innovation policies (Hollanders & Es-Sadki, 2014). Even though it is not the sole prerequisite for innovation, individual brilliance is still a component of every system of innovation, and a very crucial one at that. In fact, the theme of the 2014 instalment of the Global Innovation Index (GII) (Cornell University, INSEAD & WIPO, 2014) was the human factor in innovation, which is described within that issue as ‘the fundamental driver behind any innovation process’ and the main explanation for the disparity of innovation prowess between different countries, with other factors influencing innovation, such as technology and capital, essentially being subordinate to it. In fact, human talent is expected to be more important than capital or infrastructure in the future in the framework of the predicted fourth industrial revolution (Schwab, 2016). Of course, as the forewords to the Global Innovation Index point out, while innovation is an inherently human endeavour which succeeds when people with experience, skills and capabilities come together, the existence of highly qualified individuals does not, by itself, guarantee scientific or technological breakthroughs. It is, however, an essential starting point (Cornell University, INSEAD & WIPO, 2014).",8

For me, Ray Kurzweil (2005) popularized it best with the best-selling title of his book, “Singularity is near.” At the end of the twentieth century, more than 80% of the economy of developed countries, as measured by their gross domestic product (GDP), are intangibles (Nakamura 2001) and become the largest systematic source of economic growth (Corrado and Hulten 2010, p. 102). Moreover, recent research submits that financial capital and labor combined account for only 14% of economic growth.Footnote 1 The supplementary 86% is explained by energy (Ayres and Ayres 2010, p. 14) and knowledge-human capital, which currently are not reported and/or depicted directly by the financial markets. Experts suggest (e.g., Lev 2001; Schmidhuber 2007; Bates et al. 2009) the mid-1980s as the time when knowledge, as a production factor, product, and outcome, became a prominent factor in the new global economy. Some examples to illustrate the unique aspects of the new knowledge-driven economy are as follows: the precipitously shrinking half-life of knowledge (Siemens 2005) which is currently, in management, engineering, and medicine, approximately 2 years; the apparent detachment between productivity gains and labor wages (Fleck et al. 2011; Sachdev 2007) whereas companies are hiring more part-time employees, paying lower wages, and reacting more aggressively to economic downturns (Hanka 1998); the 5% decline in global share of labor of income since 1975 (Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014); and the explanatory power of educational attainment for earnings increase noticeably corresponding with returns to skills (Acemoglu and Autor 2011). Those trends have recently been significantly enhanced by the technological impetus resulting from a growing adoption of social networks, deep learning artificial intelligence, and robotics (e.g., Russ 2016). Let us add now to the abovementioned a brief discussion of intangibles and knowledge, a few major characteristics of the present economy, and the social sphere. The growing national debt, minimal real return (zero or even negative) on financial capital, the growing pace and severity of economic crises (recessions), and the slower rate of economic and labor (wages and employment) recovery are few of the major facets of the post-2009 crisis economy. Also, the “hoarding” of considerable amounts of cash by successful companies (e.g., Pinkowitz et al. 2014), the declining rates of new start-ups (e.g., Kane 2012), the “winner take all” market and technology strategies (e.g., Noe and Parker 2005), and the complex, counter-intuitive, and high-risk business and technology strategies (e.g., Del Giudice and Della Peruta 2016; Vrontis et al. 2016) are some of the facets of the current business environment, resulting in growing concentrations of capital and power and increasing the probability of unexpected systematic failure (e.g., Taleb 2014; Kelly 2015).Footnote 2 And finally, growing economic, political, and educational inequalities are becoming a global social phenomena (e.g., Stiglitz 2012). Such a distinctive economy may suggest that the current market and legal structure are inadequate (at best) for facilitating the majority of the population and institutions to deal with such an extraordinary change (Rainie and Wellman 2014; Rickards 2014; Rifkin 2014), questioning some basic assumptions we hold to be true for a healthy, free, democratic, and flourishing capitalistic society.Footnote 3 The more recent data about the extremely high and still growing level of economic and educational inequality, the high level of unemployment and underemployment, especially among the younger demographics (e.g., Thompson 2015), and others requires an urgently needed solution. At the same time, companies are looking for talent and skilled employees worldwide with limited success. To this end, the following question will be discussed in this conceptual paper: in the context of the new networked, knowledge-driven, global economy, do we still have one labor market or are the recent waves of technological revolutions causing a phase transition of the labor market into three (since trifurcation) distinctive labor markets? To facilitate such discussion, in the rest of this article, I intend to analyze the labor markets and I would suggest that we need to accept the reality of three distinctive labor markets, each responding to very different forces and dynamics and requiring different legal frameworks and economic policies. This narrative multidisciplinary literature review draws on multiple academic literatures. Among them are the labor’s economic literature, technology management and business innovation literatures, human capital and knowledge management literatures, and psychology and organizational behavior literatures. The main focus has been on articles and books published during the last 5 years, but earlier literature was used as well, as needed. The literature of labor and labor markets in the new economy is voluminous (see recent examples at Betcherman 2012, 2015; Pavlin 2014),Footnote 4 and systematic review of such literature is beyond the scope of this paper, as such this paper is selectiveFootnote 5 in that it exposits only some of the most significant research contributions and highlights the most important aspects as relevant to the changing nature of the labor markets in the new, networked, knowledge-driven economy. Three databases were utilized, continuously using a snowballing process among references (backward and forward) for over 3 years. We used the following: ABI, EBSCO-Business source premier, and Google Scholar. All three databases were employed since, for many aspects of the research, we found them to be complementary. Initial screening was conducted using key word searches of titles and abstracts, followed by a collection of full texts, but this was of limited usefulness. For example, a search of “bifurcation” and “labor markets” in abstractsFootnote 6 of ABI and EBSCO resulted in 11 articles (each) with only 8 relevant to the scope of this paper. The following key words were used (in different combinations): labor markets, ontology, new economy, talent, unemployment, underemployment, bifurcation, trifurcation, narrative review, human capital, monopolistic competition, monopsony competition, winner-take-all, creativity, idea, information, knowledge, and entropy. In total, the number of references used (see below) is 226. Heidegger’s (1954) ontology of technologyFootnote 7 (and knowledge) was used since it allowed us to cover the broad scope of the multidisciplinary nature of the subject. The five components of the framework—operational, collaborative, organizational, instrumental, and holistic—were adopted and modified to outline our “Trifurcation framework” (see Fig. 3 and Table 2). The narrative multidisciplinary literature review used was a modified version of an integrative literature reviewFootnote 8 (Torraco 2005). This methodology allows for initial conceptualization resulting in a new model and/or framework, offering a new perspective on a multidisciplinary topic (pp. 357–8).Footnote 9 See summary of the research process in Fig. 1. Summary of the research process: a narrative interdisciplinary integrative literature review process (cf. with Fig. 1 in Iñigo and Albareda (2016) (p. 3) The traditional academic economic literature refers to labor as a single asset, where there is differentiation by skill (see T1 in Fig. 2 below), education, etc., (Acemoglu and Autor 2011, 2012; Philippon and Reshef 2012; Katz and Margo 2013), but it is subject to one set of rules, forces, legislation, dynamics, etc., operating in the labor market (e.g., Goldin and Katz 2009) where human capital is augmenting the effective units of labor (Acemoglu and Autor 2012, p. 427). In a similar vein, the traditional social science literature (e.g., Brown et al. 2003) is searching for one theory that will explain the labor’s supply and demand dynamics in the knowledge-driven economy. Here, my conjecture goes beyond the distinction used by the present economic literatureFootnote 10 and partitions that single market into three distinctive labor markets, since trifurcation,Footnote 11 which I would call: routine labor, skilled labor, and talent (Russ 2014a). Each one of the three is different (e.g., different production functions consistently equate the value creation), and even though today (see T2 in Fig. 2, along the a1, b1, and c1 trajectory) there is still some fuzziness at the margins and blending at the edges, the fast technology-accelerated development and globalization are reducing such amalgamation and making the boundaries between the three sharper and the distinctions significant. The transition from one labor market to three distinctive markets (see T3 in Fig. 2, along the a2, b2, and c2 trajectory) could be seen as gradual, but at this point in time, my contention is that we have enough evidence to treat the three differently and separately and that preserving their treatment as one market does more harm than good to public discussion, policy making, and academic research. This may require some additional explanation. Three labor markets (modified from: Russ 2014a, p. 6) First, I have to consent that such trifurcation (into routine labor [A], skilled labor [B], and talent [C]) and its implications might be controversial for many readers since it might have emotional, political, and societal connotations and implications (e.g., Reich 2013). But, such an amendment of the labor market is supported by present developments of technological frontiers (Kümmel 2011; Frey 2015), direct and indirect (e.g., globalization; Autor et al. 2016) impacts of technology (e.g., Karabarbounis and Neiman 2014), and by changes in social norms and legislation. For example, the social and economic consequences of the present discussion of raising the minimum wage in the USA (e.g., Laliberte 2012; Kotler 2015) to a living wage can only be understood when one realizes that market forces (supply and demand of unskilled labor) will push the cost of labor as close to zero as possible (see A in time T3 in Fig. 2) because of an almost unlimited supply and very limited, and I would add temporary demand. The situation of the oversupply of labor is so damaging that more people are dropping out of the labor force today than in the last 30 years, and, more than ever, employees are taking jobs that they are overqualified for, what the economists call underemployment (e.g., Howell 2010; BLS 2013), with long-term damaging financial consequences (e.g., Guvenen et al. 2015). All this is happening while at the same time, companies complain that even in the worst economy they have skilled jobs that they cannot fill and they have a significant demand for talent, which also they cannot fill (e.g., Quintini 2011; Accenture, Burning Glass, & Harvard Business School 2014) (see more below). Nonlinear behavior of labor markets, and bifurcation specifically, was studied earlier in a specific context (e.g., immigration or income inequity) by Chiarella et al. (2000); Neugart (2000); Saint-Paul (2001); Tisdell and Svizzero (2003); Gries and Jungblut (2007); and Holden and Spinu (2014), among others. Studies in industrial sociology use the dual economy and dual labor market theories to examine human resource practices (e.g., Parcel and Sickmeier 1988) and bifurcation of work due to “deskilling” (e.g., Baldoz et al. 2001). To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to propose a trifurcation of the labor market as a global (not local or context specific) phenomena. As such, there are two qualitative changes in the form of equilibrium, and two points of bifurcation of the system (cf. Venables 1996, p. 352), which this paper is suggesting, are (at minimum) a function of time. The major driver behind this discontinuous labor market disruption, causing the phase transition, is the breathtaking pace of the development of the infosphere (Floridi 2014): the combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics, Internet of Thinks (IoT) and other telecommunication, computer-based technologies, what Bresnahan and Trajtenberg (1995) called “general purpose technologies.” The combination of technologies, as suggested by Floridi (2014), is an oversimplification of the revolutionary nature of the technological disruptions of economic and social markets. In reality, in the last 40 years, the economy, labor markets, and firms are going through a number of waves of such disruptions (see a discussion of how labor markets are responding to a single disruption in the last 30 years in Hornstein et al. (2005)). Those technologies are expected to eliminate (by replacing) tens of millions of low-skilled jobs and medium-skilled, highly routine jobs (e.g., Goos et al. 2014; Schwab and Samans 2016) in near future, while creating a significantly smaller number (complementary and new) of highly skilled jobs (see B in time T3 in Fig. 2).Footnote 12 The effect of this technological pressure on the skillFootnote 13 to value-added relationship (see Fig. 2) can be seen when moving (along the a1, b1, and c1 trajectory and then along the a2, b2, and c2 trajectory) from T1 (past) to T3 (future): where more and more jobs of “routine labor” (low skills [A]) either disappear or have a below-living-wage economic value (a); the “skilled labor” (medium-high skills [B]) market is shrinking (together with the middle class), while being more competitive at the low end due to increasing supply and future options of being replaced by technology, and the high-end because of the higher demand for skilled labor (job polarization) and the continuous need for learning and adapting to faster and faster changes (b); and the growth of the “talent” (highly skilled and creative [C]) market which is creating an increased value (c) (Russ 2014a). The traditional economic literature (in the context of technological change) refers to two sectors of labor: skilled and unskilled (Katz and Murphy 1992), and to a substitution between the two sectors (assuming that there is a substitution between the two). This paper is advocating the conjecture that there is no substitution for the critical, relevant skills between the three markets. For the low end of skills, the jobs, tasks, and the skills needed for them are replaced (or have a short-term potential to be replaced) by technology, when the skills needed to operate the technology are not attainable by the low skill labor (gap in individual absorptive capacity that cannot be closedFootnote 14; see a similar assumption in Lindbeck and Snower 1996); and/or are orthogonally different (see example in Fowler and Fowler (2012; p. 70)—who assume that the unskilled do not have access to human or physical capital; or see Snower and Goerlich (2013), for the competency of high level of multitasking). As such, this paper is suggesting that the classic assumptions that the “one labor market” literature has regarding the continual distribution of skills in the labor market is not appropriate. At the low end of skills, even the model of a finite number of skills (e.g., Cahuc and Laroque 2014) is optimistic, since when the capacity or relearning of new skillsFootnote 15 is eroded, and due to the accelerating shrinkage of half-life of knowledge, the number of skills that are relevant for value creation are actually reduced. For the high end of skills, there is no substitution between (what is defined here as) talent and skills. In the multidimensional space of skills, talent operates in dimensions that are orthogonalFootnote 16 to those of skills (as defined here), and because of the “winner takes all” nature of the market for talent, the infosphere disruption is talent biased (cf. with observation 15 in Hornstein et al. 2005). Also, countering the prediction of the theory of directed technical change, that a growth in the relative supply of a factor of production (talent) will induce technological change that is biased in favor of this factor (e.g., Hornstein et al. 2005), in a winner-take-all market, this may not happen, since the change is technology-push driven, and a competing technology may take over, which requires a different set of skills (through discontinuous change resulting from disruptive innovation, see Christensen 1997; Utterback and Acee 2005) at a very fast pace. Add to thatFootnote 17 the inability of the price to convey the scarcity of talent, due to the high uncertainty of valueFootnote 18 (in some cases, the value is unknowable at the time of the hiring/transaction decision) and the high asymmetry of information. For example, in the case of top CEOs, the price in many cases is actually the buying “real” option price of the value the talent is expected to create in the future (e.g., Jacobs 2007; Jung and Subramanian 2013). Let us now discuss, in more depth, each of the three labor markets and their descriptions, the current situation, the future under the current economic and legal system, and the specific solution and implications I am recommending framed by the Homo Sustainabiliticus (see later) paradigm (Russ 2014b; Russ 2016). 
Routine Labor market I proposed (Russ 2014a) to view “routine labor” as a human assets commodity with limited differentiation in skill, facing a monopsonistic competition where a limited number of buyers (firms, governments, not-for-profits, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), etc.) prescribe the employment terms (within the legal setting) to a powerless mass of little-differentiated employeesFootnote 19 that have limited employment optionsFootnote 20 and, for any practical matter, have very limited social and geographicalFootnote 21 mobility. The valueFootnote 22 generated by routine labor is minimal (see also Kümmel 2011), and the salaries and wages are typically prescribed by legislation, labor laws, political pressure, and social norms regarding employment, unemployment, minimal wage, etc., (e.g., Kotler 2015), ensuing from a dysfunctional labor market (see Fig. 2, A at time T2). Therefore, routine labor wages and salaries will be mostly dictated by minimum wage legislation or alternative unemployment benefits and subject to idiosyncratic dynamics,Footnote 23 being driven more by social and political than economic issues.Footnote 24 On the other hand, since the legal structure and economic and business forces allow for multiple arrangements to match the supply and demand of routine labor in this inefficient market,Footnote 25 this market should not be seen as uncomplicated. One illustration of such uniqueness is demonstrated in studies regarding the base-of-the-pyramid (BOP) labor markets and their mechanisms, such as altering the classic principal–agent relationship by forming the agent as a principal (Kistruck et al. 2013, p. 663). Another example of this complexity is what Autor and Dorn (2013) categorize as the service occupation (versus the service sector). In their study, they identified an increase in numbers of both employees and wages,Footnote 26 for example, by providing personalized services to high-income individuals: trends that are considerably different from those for the middle- and higher-skill percentiles.Footnote 27 Moreover, for the USA—but not only there—it became painfully clear that prisonsFootnote 28 and some parts of the militaryFootnote 29 and other public sectors are part of the public market solution for employment in this low-end (even negative) value-creation sector. If the proposition stated above can be confirmed, this should have enormous implications. One implication is that the higher education of this sector (routine labor) cannot be seen from a narrow economic perspective as a human asset.Footnote 30 For example, research conducted in Italy and grounded in 2004 data discovered about 14% of the employees to be overeducated (Cainarca and Sgobbi 2012). A similar study carried out in China, based on 2003 data, described about 20% of higher education graduates to be overeducated (Li et al. 2008). More recent data suggests that this statistic is worsening, especially for the younger generation.Footnote 31 Sattinger and Hartog (2013) quantified the drawbacks for over-education in wage corollaries to be between 1.7 and 7.7% (see also Guvenen et al. 2015). Consequently, seen from a narrow economic perspective, such an investment in higher education should be seen as a human assets debt, since economic benefits from the unemployment or underemployment of those individuals are minimal at best, if not negative (Bivens et al. 2013; Leoni and Gritti 2013). Moreover, this may explain the high level of default on educational loans in the USA, especially at for-profit colleges. From the broader social perspective, this may suggest that education (like health care) should be alternatively considered as a right (Yamin 1996; Oakes et al. 2008) and not as a product, since if delineated as a product, a significant and growing portion of the population will not be able to afford it, and as such, it should be more of a social and political issue and not an economic one. Another implication this postulation has is in regard to what some call the “poverty trap”—presently seen as a temporary trap (e.g., Stapleton et al. 2006) that the willing and hardworking can escape only if they work hard enough or acquire new skills (Guvenen et al. 2015). Recent research on the trap and the indicators of lack of social mobility, as well as from the “labor” market perspective, might suggest that this is, to a large degree, a permanent social and educational problem, not only an economicFootnote 32 issue (similar to the Bottom of the Pyramid; Prahalad 2005), and that the old way of resolving the issue will not do, especially since this segment of the labor market and population is growing both in absolute number and as a percentage of the labor force. Additional complications for this postulation are race and gender issues. This segment of the labor market has a higher representation of males (worldwideFootnote 33) and African Americans (in the USFootnote 34), resulting in social, political, and other major concerns (which are beyond the scope of this paper).Footnote 35
 To summarize, here are the characteristics of the routine labor market: Description Minimal skills are required for the jobs in this market, mostly in services. Employees have either minimal education (high school or less) or undergraduate degrees, have minimal training, and are employed in low paying (below living wage) jobs. Current situation High number of unemployed (e.g., Bell and Blanchflower 2011) and underemployed.Footnote 36
 Very limited social and geographic mobility. High and growing personal debt due to cost of education, growing default rate (e.g., Athreya et al. 2013). Employment in these sectors is growing slowly, with stagnate salaries, due to high concentration of (monopsonic) labor demand, large and growing supply of labor, ongoing pressure of technology,Footnote 37 and tough international price competition. Current salaries are also driven by minimum wage legislation and unemployment safety-net legislation. Future under current economic and legal system Work/labor will not be available to all wanting jobs. A second wave of robotics and AI will replace even growing sectors in this market when the price point and performance reach the right levels, resulting from the learning curve of such technology implementation in the skilled labor market (see below).Footnote 38
 Minimal new opportunities will be created in the future. Monopolistic-monopsonic, demand-side-driven, competition for cost (wage) of labor. Growing gray (barter) labor gig-economy (e.g., Milkman and Ott 2014) markets. Solution recommended Change in social norm regarding labor, resulting in legislation of minimum living wageFootnote 39 and/or “basic income.”Footnote 40
 Creation of not-for profit, social service opportunities to employ-similar to Roosevelt’s Civilian Conservation Corps (e.g., Brauer 1982) or the Danish and Dutch experimentations (e.g., Green-Pedersen et al. 2001). Defining higher education as a right (not a product-service) subject to market forces—similar to the German experience.Footnote 41
 
Skilled Labor market The immense and continuously contracting middle arena of labor markets (see Fig. 2, B at time T2) is presently dominated by skilled employees, who have commonly codified skills (which is the cause for future potential job elimination, e.g., Chipulu et al. 2013; Frey and Osborne 2013), receive higher pay (than routine labor), have various unique skills, and create higher value (than routine labor). This market bears a resemblance to the classic labor market where the supply and demand of labor and skills play their classic economic roles. In this labor market, capital investment and technology can potentially, and will, substitute for most of the jobs (most of them in services), but can also be complementary.Footnote 42 Such a substitution will occur due to effectiveness, efficiencies, quality assurance, and financial profitability concerns, and as a result, the wages and value will fluctuate in response to market, technology, skills, costs, and investments (Acemoglu and Autor 2012). This middle ground, as proposed by Acemoglu and Autor (2012), includes low-, medium-, and high-skilled labor, and the distinction between the three segments is a function, changing over time, of technology and investment in human capital (education, training, etc.), but is contracting due to technological advancements,Footnote 43 global competition, and profitability pressures (e.g., Kolev and Saget 2010; Canon and Marifian 2013). The continuous pressure on this market is also the outcome of the gaps between the productivity and cost share of labor and energy, and the low cost of the mixture of energy and capital in comparison to the high cost of labor (Kümmel 2011, p. 245). The mid-ground of this market suffers from a mismatch of supply and demand, and companies might have to step in, lead, and nurture proactively the revival of middle-skills jobs (Accenture, Burning Glass, & Harvard Business School 2014). Moreover, at the high end, complementary segment of this market, there is a positive interaction between skills (existing) and technology (Acemoglu and Autor 2012). This labor market is also susceptible to a trap, the “middle income trap.”Footnote 44 The notion here is different from the classic economic term which refers to a country (e.g., Felipe 2012). The individual’s middle income trap is a result of the combination of the shrinking half-life of knowledge and the imposing need for continuation of investments in one’s human capital as well as being pressured for conformity to the accepted norms and repertoire (e.g., Durand and Kremp 2016).Footnote 45 This requires time and money to support the needed space of learning.Footnote 46 Time and money are also needed to support the expected middle class life style (e.g., Kotler 2015). Those conflicting demands on both the time and money of the skilled labor, result in falling behind on keeping up with the need to upgrade skills and knowledge. This then translates into the need of increasing one’s working hours at a lower (relatively) income, due to the declining negotiating power of a less and less relevant set of skills, as well as the global competition of low cost skilled labor and technology. To summarize, here are the characteristics of the skilled labor market: Description Employees have medium range and complex codified or codifiable skills and medium or high levels of post-high school and undergraduate education and are employed in jobs paying medium salaries (above living wage), subject to the supply and demand forces of the labor market. Current situation Not a very efficient labor market, with some markets having big mismatches between supply and demand. Short and shrinking half-life of knowledge resulting in creation of new jobs and new needs for knowledge and skills created; pushing for higher cost of education and new degrees developed. Lack of effective and efficient internal to the company labor markets. Future under current economic and legal system Due to high cost of skilled labor, and/or shortage of skilled labor and the growing pace of job complexities and knowledge needed, this market is at the highest risk of human labor being replaced by the 1st and 2nd generation of Robotics +AI technology, since here the return on investment will be much higher than in the routine labor market. Increased cost of higher education. Increased inefficiencies and ineffectiveness of labor markets. New jobs will be created at the higher end of skills needed while at the lower end, jobs mostly will be destroyed by the complementarity of technology and low cost routine labor. Solution recommended Smarter labor legislation needed-less restrictions in Europe (more/less/different) elsewhere. Legislation and policies affecting: taxation, mobility, education, and training supporting effective and efficient labor markets. Creation of vertical exchanges of alternative digital currencies and local and regional various forms of decentralized autonomous organizations to create the appropriate ecosystems (e.g., space of learning, resources) for long-term survival and growth (see more later). 
Talent market The talent market (see Fig. 2, C at time T2) as defined earlier (Russ 2014a) is an inefficient labor market, a market failure (Bator 1958; Ouchi 1980; Hidalgo 2015, p. 113), since the value of the product is weakly captured by its price, either because the skills or tasks entailed to produce it are tacitFootnote 47 (e.g., Autor 2014) (not codifiable) or because the uncertainty,Footnote 48 risk, and value are difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain (e.g., Cattani et al. 2013; Martin et al. 2013) and the price in many cases is driven by star branding or/and reputation and status (Sum and Jessop 2013; Ertug et al. 2016; Kilduff et al. 2016). Also, at least in some cases, even though the value of the market is extremely high, the number of buyers and sellers is very limited (see example in Driskill and Vrooman 2016). Talent is a rare commodity; takes a long time to develop and master (Colvin 2010, pp. 168–169; Kaplan and Rauh 2013, pp. 48–52); requires special considerations, for example, deliberate practice (Ericsson et al. 1993); and intrinsic motivation complemented by extrinsic motivation and investment (Colvin 2010, pp. 61–63, 133–136, 188). Counterintuitively, in the knowledge-driven economy, when the half-life of knowledge is shrinking, the time required to master the needed knowledge is longer and the investment is larger. No wonder companies cannot find the talent they are looking for; they have to take the time, risk, and make a commitment to invest in talented and motivated employees in order to develop the talent they need to succeed in the “creativity economy” (Dubina et al.2012). The talent market has a very distinctive characteristic from the previous two markets (routine labor and skilled labor) and operates similar to the increasing-return, winner takes all, economy (Arthur 1989; Maier et al. 2004; Frank and Cook 2013), either because of imperfect (asymmetry of information, risks) internal and external markets,Footnote 49 because of financial (Philippon and Reshef 2012) and non-linear characteristics,Footnote 50 the “stickiness” (Szulanski 1996) and embeddedness of tacit knowledge,Footnote 51 or because of an external networking effect.Footnote 52 As a result, for example, in the USA, college-educated individuals are working longer hours (Thompson 2015) and the income of the highest-earning 1% of workers almost doubled between 1991 and 2007 (Haskel et al. 2012), while in Australia, the most successful artists are working less hours in the art labor market (than less successful artists; Rengers 2002, p. 140). Moreover, in the talent market, there is a positive “deep” interaction between skills (existing and newFootnote 53) and technology (Kaplan and Rauh 2013, p. 50). One possible risk this market presents is the “luxury trap,” (Hudders 2011). The high cost of luxuries and the rewarding nature of luxury consummations impose a lifestyle that limits the time and the access to diverse inputs so crucial for creativity and experimentation,and talent development.Footnote 54
 To summarize, here are the characteristics of the talent market: Description Employees have highly uncodified, tacit, and complex (multidimensional set of) skills and a medium or high level of postgraduate education. They are employed or creating extremely high paying salaries and wealth (top 5% or lessFootnote 55), subject to “suppliers win all” dynamics. Think for example of top athletes, superstars, actors, CEOs, financial market traders, successful entrepreneurs, etc. Current situation Extremely inefficient and ineffective labor market, with significant asymmetries of information and very small, volatile and uncertain, fast paced, badly defined, and regulated markets. Short and shrinking half-life of knowledge resulting in new jobs and new needs for creativity, knowledge, innovation, and skills created; cost of education is of less relevance, while creativity, performance, and luck play a critical role in the winner take all competition. Completely ineffective and inefficient, internal to the company, labor markets. Future under current economic and legal system Growing share of income, driving economic, social, and educational inequalities to new heights in recent memory. Least at risk of being replaced by robotics and AI. Creating new jobs with high-end, increasingly complex skills and performance needed. Solution recommended Recognize that legislation of talent might be socially and economically desirable, since it may improve talent allocation (Ferreira and Nikolowa 2015). Manage and legislate by exception,Footnote 56 similar to monopolistic markets, realizing that you cannot legislate the markets for top artistic or athletic talent, the same way you legislate top financial management or corporate executive talent,Footnote 57 while providing a floor (guarantee minimal income) to support risk taking and experimentation (e.g., Frey 2015). Create personalized and autonomous teams’ alternative digital currencies (see Russ 2014b for additional discussion). To summarize, I postulated that the curve of value added from (and for) the firm (internal market/firm specific not transferable) and the individual (external market/transferable) as a function of skill percentile is not only exponential, but as a function of time, is becoming more so, and as such, the economic inequality, and the social gaps and polarization (winner takes all) are growingFootnote 58 (see above). I also suggested that artificial intelligence and robotics technologies, and the accelerating shrinking of the half-life of knowledge are primarily putting (and will continue to) pressure on the skilled labor because of the bigger potential benefits and higher returns to the firm and to the producers of the alternative solution delivered by means of artificial intelligence and robotics while replacing codified, skilled jobs.Footnote 59 Replacing talent at this stage of development is still too costly, and in many cases, the technology is not there yet;Footnote 60 so, the most practical and economical approach is to tackle the middle (e.g., Autor 2010; Kolev and Saget 2010; Canon and Marifian 2013). Davenport and Kirby (2015) recently suggested reframing the threat of losing jobs in this labor market with an “Augmentation” strategy and described five different approaches toward employability that are optional to individuals and companies. Two of them (“step up” and “step in”) require additional skills (still in B). Two of them require skills that are not codifiable yet (“step aside” or “step narrowly”) (could be in B or C) and the last one (“step forward”) requires both additional skills and non-codifiable skills (could be in B or C). Most of those options require (as mentioned earlier) higher education, life-long learning, and creative skills that are increasingly hard to find. Therefore, the low-cost, inefficient routine labor market is synthetically maintained by the government and the legislator (for political reasons—the people still can vote) and the dominant elite (buying social peace)Footnote 61; the high-end (talent) market is not efficient. The only market somewhat economically efficient (but shrinking) is the skilled labor market, the one in the middle. The inefficiencies of the three labor markets come at a high price. The economic inequality is the highest; it has been in recent (some say longer) history. Also, the efficiencies are unacceptably low. For example, Kümmel (2011)Footnote 62 estimated output elasticities for laborFootnote 63 to be between 0.09 and 0.15, and for creativity to be between 0.10 and 0.19, in comparison to output elasticities for capital to be between 0.18 and 0.51, and energy to be between 0.35 and 0.73. Table 1 summarizes some of the characteristics of the three distinct labor markets. Acknowledging the notion of three very different labor markets with diverse dynamics and economic rules should illuminate the present (2016) discussion in the USA (and elsewhere) about the need for a minimum (or living) wage or universal income, the astronomical growth in economic inequality, and the shrinkage of the middle class. In line with such rationale, for example, the CBO (2014) recently suggested that increasing the minimum wage could result in hundreds of thousands losing jobs while increasing income for millions. A question not considered yet is how many potential employees, that presently are out of the employment statistics (since they dropped out from the labor force), will return to the routine labor market and look for jobs, which could paradoxically increase the rate of unemployment and underemployment, but will also potentially increase the GDP. The other less-discussed consideration is the expected impact that the increase of minimum wage will potentially have on the skilled labor market (marginal at best in my opinion), which should be seen as further evidence of the two markets being (almost completely) disjointed. One way to validate the proposition as listed above is to look into the social and geographic mobility of individuals, employees, and firms. If the three labor markets are indeed distinct, then the “rules of the game” in each one will be different. The lack of (or minimal) social and geographic mobility in the routine labor market (Bosker et al. 2012; Machin et al. 2012; Partridge et al. 2012; Gill et al. 2013) and the ease of social movement and global mobility of the stars and talent are well documented (e.g., Filatotchev et al. 2011; Currid-Halkett and Ravid 2012; Haskel et al. 2012), and their externalities go far beyond the traditional returns (e.g., Oettl and Agrawal 2008). Lastly, the professionals (the middle, skilled labor) seem to follow their own social and geographic mobility mechanisms.Footnote 64
 Finally, let me postulate how entropy and the new definition of human capital proposed elsewhere (Russ 2014b; Russ 2016) can play a different role in the three distinct labor markets mentioned above. The function of managementFootnote 65 (skilled market—see Fig. 2, B at time T2) can be articulated as a complexity reduction task between the selected environment (strategy, measured as entropy) for the individuals that deliver the value,Footnote 66 when creating it for customers. Effective and efficient management minimizes the entropy,Footnote 67 allowing the employees to deliver the product/service while traversing with minimal noise/complexity/entropy.Footnote 68 If the amount and scope of complexity (entropy) the employees are engaged with is minimal and decreasing as a result of use of technology,Footnote 69 we are in the routine labor market (see Fig. 2, A at time T2). If the amount and scope of complexity (entropy) the employees are engaged with is above the minimum threshold and varies over time, and the employees have some control over the scope of entropy, then we are in the skilled labor market (see Fig. 2, B at time T2). When the actors have a substantial amount of control over the scope of complexity (entropy), including the choice of increasing entropy, at least temporarily, the timing of such exploration and the ability to optimize (not minimize) the entropy, at least in one dimension of their multidimensionalFootnote 70 set (space) of skills, then we are in the talent marketFootnote 71 (see Fig. 2, C at time T2) which could result in a new or modified niche (eco-system).Footnote 72
 To summarize the discussion above, the following framework for the three labor markets is conjectured.Footnote 73 The framework includes the aspects (dimensions) along which the trifurcation takes place (or potentially will take place), as proposed above. The proposed framework (see Fig. 3) includes four major aspects of the labor markets of human capital in the networked, knowledge-driven, global economy: (1) environmental factors; (2) task factors; (3) human capital factors; and (4) value factors. Trifurcation framework: the four factors Let us now list the major aspects of the four factors, based on the discussion above, in the three labor markets. One might expect that new technologies (nano, bio, media, 3D printing, etc.) will create new opportunities, and, provided time, new jobs will be created as well (e.g., Levy and Murnane 2012; Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014; Invernizzi 2014). The caveat is that most of those jobs will require a much higher level of skilled labor (graduate education) or a mix of skills and creativity that only the star/talent employees might have. However, even this prediction is changing, since this is where artificial intelligence technology will replace skilled labor (e.g., Banks and Humphreys 2008; Rotman 2013; Frick 2015). So, the spillover (if any) as an opportunity of new job creation in the routine labor market will be minimal at best, reemphasizing the need of legislation to be proactively engaged in enabling the markets or to directly create jobs for this segment, or alternatively, to move to a universal income, as more and more countries considerFootnote 74 and visionary leadersFootnote 75 suggest. Complementing the mostly dysfunctional labor markets is the mostly negative (or nonexistent) role that legislation is performing regarding intellectual property and intangible assets (including of course human capital and assets). On one hand, the legislation in a few areas is too restrictive. For example, patents are granted for too long to support innovation (e.g., Heller 2008), which also creates opportunities for patent trolls (e.g., Golden 2007), or large companies that control the distribution channels, taking over small, entrepreneurial, and innovative companies (e.g., Schweizer 2005). On the other hand, many areas are not regulated at all, which not only makes it difficult for new markets to be created, and as such, limits the possibilities for ownership and capital investments or insurance protection, but also allows technology to dictate the roadmap and its owners (when successful) monopolistic profits. Another interesting ramification of this analysis is that in light of the present legal and economic environment, we have to modify the way we consider the majority of SMEs. The contemporary economic and business literatures view those companies as drivers of innovation and job growth. In reality, the vast majority of the SMEs are part-time or full-time, single or less-than-five employee, companies. I would propose viewing them not as an attempt by the entrepreneur to build a firm while exploring the benefits of future opportunities, but as an attempt to capture and capitalize on one’s (specifically the middle-ground skilled labor individuals mentioned previously) human and social capital (Baumol 2010, p. 156; Kaul 2013; cf. also with Hampden-Turner and Trompenaars 2015, Ch. 6). If this proposition is supported, the explanation for the large number of women and minorities hitting the glass ceiling and leaving their present place of employment is not because they identified a new business opportunity, but because they identified the ownership option as the best choice to capitalize on their experience and social capital, which is significantly better than the working-for-a-corporation option or the unemployment or underemployment options (Pofeldt 2016). Regrettably, the significant majority of routine labor (see above) does not control or own the capital (financial, human, or social) needed for such embarking, and as such, they are immovable in their job (underemployed), are unemployed, or choose to participate in the gig-economy as necessity entrepreneurs. Lastly, the distinction is between value creation and value appropriation (e.g., Mizik and Jacobson 2003). It is naïve and wrong to assume that all value creators are fairly compensated by the markets. This is where power, opportunism, and/or status play a key role in value distribution and appropriation.Footnote 76 As such, not all creative, risk taking and value creating skilled labor and talents are fairly or highly compensated,Footnote 77 while others are overpaid, adding to the dysfunctionality of labor markets. Industry-specific policy and legislative interventions are strongly encouraged to support fair compensation and minimize the risk of a race to the bottom, similar to what is occurring in the routine labor markets. Narrative and selective literature reviews have major limitations,Footnote 78 among them, unsystematic and subjective methods to search for, assemble and interpret biased information without critical appraisal, and with a specific hypothesis in mind, summarized with a convenient narrative. To minimize those weaknesses, the authors triangulated multiple perspectives from the economic and business literatures, presented the models at number of seminars, and sought out feedback from a number of experts in this field (see Fig. 1 and acknowledgements). Enacting a formal model that will use the new definitions of capitals (see Russ 2016) and the three labor markets simultaneously should be the next step. One starting point could be the model of problem-solving producers proposed by Lucas (2009). In his model, (α)Footnote 79 is the rate (individual’s own ability and effort) at which ideas are processed, (λ) and (θ) are, respectively, the quality (knowledge, as a function of time [t]) and the diversity of the environment.Footnote 80 What the discussion above is suggesting is that ability and knowledge are multidimensional (see also Guvenen et al. 2015; Lise and Postel-Vinay 2015) and the environment for each one of the three markets has different characteristics, including the multidimensionalityFootnote 81 of the competitive labor market landscape. Incorporating such a multidimensional space into the winner-take-all human capital markets (see for example the model developed by Frank and Cook 2013) may allow quantitative analysis of what specific aspects or skills enable talent actors to win it all,Footnote 82 as well as what makes them different from skilled actors who seem to operate/act in the same industry niche but, in actuality, are operating in a “richer” space (see example where such models can be used to resolve research gaps in the art markets, as in Rengers 2002 for the talent-skilled markets proposed here and in Menger 2006 for the skilled-routine markets proposed here). The paper also suggests a number of research gaps that will be briefly discussed here. The most glaring is the need to study the overeducated and underemployed. The current statistics of underemployment focus on the most simplistic (and may I say “old economy”) aspects of underemployment: hours. People looking for a full time job that are working part time jobs. The fast growing issue worldwide is the individuals that have higher education and are either unemployed (there is statistical data about that) or underemployed since the jobs they take do not require the level of education they possess. This is an economic waste, a social welfare setback, and in many cases, a personal disaster. The first step must be a “better” data collection system, including metadata that must be put in place to learn about the size, and other critical aspects, of the issue and also to enable studies to support future policies. The second issue is the role of globalization in accelerating the process trifurcation. This paper assumed that it is the accelerating pace of the waves of technological revolutions that is driving this global phenomena. To economists, the long-term benefits of open borders for investment and trade are clear. To labor economists, the short-term impact on labor is mixed at best, but for policy making purposes, more research needs to be done on the intersection of globalization and technology. For research purposes, critical dilemmas are those of the appropriate units of analysis. Geographically, cities and megaregions seem to be the drivers of economic, demographic, and social growth and change. For policy making and legal perspectives and funding, the state nations (federal and lower levels) are still the governing bodies. Then, there is the issue of industries. New scientific areas and industries are created at a breathtaking pace, while old industries decline, restructure, or combine with others. Formal, valid, and reliable data collection to support diverse and new units of analysis are years behind, so how should the researcher proceed? This paper suggested that imperfect competition is everywhere. Is it different in the three labor market? The paper suggested that different dynamics operate in each one of the three. Do the dynamics change over time? Are the dynamics different at different segments? Immigration was one of the areas that early identified bifurcation in the labor markets, and traditionally was treated by economics and by labor economics, separately from globalization. At present, this is a hotly contested political and social issue. So, what role does immigration play in the three different markets? Lastly, and most intriguingly, from pure research curiosity, are the micro-foundations of the mechanisms within each market and the research methods and tools used to study them. One distinction clearly made in this paper (see Table 1) is that each market must be studied by different methods and more importantly, the statistical methods and tools must be different. So, to develop formal models for the three markets and test them with the appropriate tools will be the ultimate test of the proposals introduced in this conceptual paper. On the other hand, the paper is suggesting (see Table 2) a large number of factors (dimensions) enabling the trifurcation. Which are the few that really enable the trifurcation? Are they the same in all industries? The networked, knowledge-driven, global economy is nothing like what humans faced in the past (e.g., Russ 2016). The realization that the labor markets are going through a major phase transition through trifurcation might make the transition easier, the policies and legislations more effective, and minimize the social and economic negative consequences.",4

Rodrigues and Royal Institute of Technology, Björn Hårsman for research support. In particular, I also would like to thank Vernon Smith, Stephen Rassenti, and David Porter as ICES-GMU for their invaluable input on economic system design, pilot tests, and the economic experiment and Dan Houser for statistical analysis ideas. Finally I would like to thank one anonymous reviewer who's comments greatly helped to make the paper better and hopefully more accessible for non-patent professionals. With experiments, we can study markets and environments that never existed and learn from them.Footnote 2 This article examines the coordination of inventive, trading, and innovating decisions through an organized market in patents (contracts) with prices in an environment of searchable technology areas of initially private and uncertain values, using such a controlled laboratory experiment. This design contrasts economic analysis of such decisions in a hierarchy (firm), where inventor, innovator, and other company managers decide among themselves what technology to further invest in, without a competitive selection process through (public) prices on intellectual property rights on technical ideas. See Fig. 1. Economic model of institutions and environment. Mechanisms for a two-part tariff contract and patent validity are treatment variables The performance and behavioral properties in a multiple-round game with three different institutional (contract market mechanisms) and two environmental (patent system validity) arrangements are compared with respect to the search behavior expressed as willingness to search (WTS) for the most valuable patentable technologies from nine induced technology areas. The market designs are characterized by increasing demand side bidding languageFootnote 3 and are investigated in two environments with “high” and “low” presumed patent validity (propensity that a patent will be upheld in court when challenged), in a 3 × 2 design. The economic model (system) design is thus a dynamic one including learning through the search process based on price signals. “Robustness” of coordination—an aspect important in mechanism design—is tested by having different induced value sets: simple, varying blocking value; linear, varying blocking and investment value together; and complex, varying blocking and investment values independently creating possibility to express preference for blocking, investing, or both. The outcomes are explained in terms of behavioral properties, focusing on WTS, in the selection process of which technology area to invest in. The standard literature on the economic analysis of the patent system has mostly been on the product (Arrow, 1962; Nordhaus, 1969a; Plant, 1934), not on coordination of competitive technology used in new products. In such an analysis patent rights on technology are mostly treated as synonymous to information used in product monopolies, not as tradable assets in their own rights. Also, economies of scale have been a key claimant in trying to explain growth of outputs as a result of growth of inputs. However, there are often hundreds or thousands of patents from tens to hundreds of inventors/owners that go into a single product or service today, indicating a serious effort of coordination in technology. (A car contains 2000-3000 patent from 200-300 owners (Source: EPO) and a smartphone could contain up to 250,000 patent claims according to recent estimates.) The study of this coordination problem may therefore shed light on the selection problem of which technology to further invest in, laying the ground to inform theory on growth in the “right kind” of technology for growth in outputs. Controlled laboratory experiments have not been made in this area with few exceptions. The experimental work on patents appears limited to patent races in (Zizzo, 2002), (Silipo, 2005) and others, where results show limited support for current patent-race theory. The standard treatment in economics of the coordination of inventor, trader, and innovator activities is that of coordination in a hierarchy (firm). This is done under neoclassical conditions of competitive commodity (product) markets and full information in the seminal article by Arrow (1962); this approach treats patents as marginal additions to information on manufacturing processes (not new products) and with known values (or with a known probability distribution of values), i.e., as an information problem. When outcomes are “uncertain,” i.e., risky and a probability distribution is known, this risk is priced in separate Arrow-Debreu securities, one for each state of nature. This analysis appears thus not capture the dynamic process of selecting the most productive technology for new product innovations or multiple use of the same technology, both which are common practice in patenting, potentially leaving out important values of the patent system to productivity and economic growth. A more subtle difference is that patents are not simply “information” but a solution to a technical problem, thus targeting a human need for betterment (food, clothing, housing, energy, communication, etc.), which may not be captured by a “value neutral” economic analysis reduced to information. As a matter of fact, a patent is granted for an invention that is “reduced to practice,” i.e., shown to work technically, not economically. It can therefore be said that it is more of a property rights regime, something the law scholars’ use as a starting point. The economic tools may thus be insufficient to analyze the patent system fully as only economically viable solutions, on the margin, may be deemed rational. In this study, we attempt to capture some aspects of the patent systems' principles by focusing on prices in an “asset” market and competition between technical solutions with uncertain values as inventors search to find areas innovators are willing to pay the most for. Different aspects of innovation and the patent system have obviously been studied for a long time, however, mostly by law scholars, but in recent decades an increasing interest has flourished also among economic scholars and has grown rapidly in the last 5–10 years. Here follows a short, but far from complete, summary of work on different aspects of more or less patent systems and the economy that still influences policy and thinking in these areas. The Schumpeterian view is that of coordination in a hierarchy (firm) where new innovator firms disrupt incumbent firms (1934) or intrapreneurs create new products within extant firms (1942). This is more explicit in terms of hierarchy than the institution less neoclassical view. In this treatment, the inventions (technology) are also treated as information available to the innovation process (an “exogenous force” acting on the economic system), and the selection of which invention (technology) to invest in is implicit and process-less. However, the patent system grants two rights: the right to exclusive use and the right to transfer or license with mutual consent, thus includes an explicit process. This has been the way patent systems are construed since the first system was invented in Venice in 1474.Footnote 4
 The legal scholar Plant (1934) contends that the patent system “lacks theoretical economic principle” and simply creates “scarcity.” However, the right of exclusion and right of transfer or licensing create, together with enforcement, a tradable asset and as such are a property right regime creating a market in ideas, thus providing an economic principle. Plant contends that not even patent licensing appear to solve the selection problem, thus creating “more patents of the wrong kind,” i.e., not socially beneficial in the end. Nordhaus (1969a), in his seminal paper, trying to explain generation and transmission of new knowledge, finds a very noisy relationship between invention and technological change based on random contribution of marginal contribution of inventions. The model is created to understand input-output relations, represents a more realistic approach, and is testable. This model does reject the Schumpeterian hierarchy approach, with technology as an exogenous force, but introduces a neoclassical market of “temporary little monopolies on information” that are constituted by well-kept trade secrets or patents. A “technology production function” is rejected, whereas “inventor equilibrium” seems to hold. The analysis is however also here process-less, but a refined attempt to integrate invention and innovation processes through neoclassical markets for goods that have temporal exclusive use rights, a feature of all patent systems. In this rare attempt to break free from a single or implicit hierarchy approach, disclosure to public knowledge is included in the model—another key feature of all patent systems—but apparently kept private until end of the patent term, contrary to patent applic. publish (mostly 12-18m). In the optimal patent licensing literature, inventors have an exclusive right to face a monopoly innovator producer with a certain value of the patented technology, skimming off any surplus with an optimal royalty (similar to Nordhaus (1969b)). Here, we can see coordination between inventor and innovator but without competitive bidding or alternative technologies available with different values. Kamien (1992), Kamien et al. (1992), Kamien and Tauman (1986), Shapiro (1985), and others focus on cost-reducing inventions (to fit with neoclassical assumptions of marginal utility). A key result is that the optimal licensing contract ought to be a royalty contract (that can thus skim off the monopoly profits from the innovator). Both Kamiena and Tauman and Shapiro introduce game theory in solving a more strategic problem of licensing. More recent developments have identified and looked at the role of intermediaries in this licensing market historically and empirically. A study by Lamoreaux and Sokoloff (2001) of unorganized markets covers the 1834 change in US patent law and finds patent lawyers becoming intermediary “traders” as the uncertainty of a patent right went down through the newly invented examination system. These intermediary markets have resurfaced in the last two decades motivating a renewed interest from economists emphasizing key economic decisions related to market value of research, patent races, patent licensing, and emerging markets through intermediaries. Market value and research and development (R&D) are studied in Griliches (1998, 1981) and Griliches et al. (1989). Today, the patent market has 100:ds of different types of intermediaries ranging from patent lawyers, specialized patent aggregation entities, patent pools, buyer clubs, securitization, and monetization agents. These emerging markets in patents and other IP have been studied by Monk (2009), the rise of intermediaries by Wang (2010) and Benassi and Di Minin (2009), or business models of intermediaries (Millien and Laurie 2007). In the above treatments there are few explicit studies of institutional aspects, willingness to search for new technology and take risk, or using an environment with uncertain values. In summary, in contrast to Arrow’s information approach, the design in this study is based on the principles and practices of the patent systems, practices which are well supported by the referenced literature, especially on intermediaries. An experimental approach is chosen, as mathematics is prohibitive. An analysis of stable behavioral patterns provided by experiments may provide a way forward. Before developing the experimental design, I would like to briefly state the results. Institutions with increased demand side bidding language significantly yield higher WTS. Validity, (or patent strength) is also significant, but has only very limited effect on WTS. When it comes to convergence (to highest use values) over time, multiple “equilibriums” (2-3) appear the norm for more complex value sets. This suggests (i) preference of blocking or investing, or (ii) possibly slow convergence, possibly due to uncertainty in price signals. Search patterns swing from “high” to “low” WTS over the sessions, suggesting that common expectations do not easily form in the complex sets. For simple value sets, convergence to highest technology value takes place much quicker. However, these factors have generally low explanatory power (pseudo R2 of 0.2). The results, although limited, therefore call for further research on institutional mechanisms, especially early stages of “learning” (the economic side). This would then complement the current policy agenda’s almost sole focus of enforcement, based on patent system reform, but also here, a more inclusive asset ought to be the goal, less dependent (ideally independent) of the inventor’s size or industrial structure (the legal side). As convergence between inventor, trader and innovator to the highest valued technology eventually takes place, coordination in a market in technology based on the patent system(s) provides a hypothesis candidate to explain the difference between changes in input and output worth pursuing.Footnote 5
 In the sequel, the microeconomic system design will be discussed, followed by details of the experimental and software design such as agent characteristics, rules of trade, and trading screens. The sequence of the experiment is then discussed, followed by empirical results and hypothesis tests. Finally, willingness to search is being discussed based on institutional behavior, ending with conclusions and policy recommendations.",2

Woods,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Production decisions by US firms are influenced in part, by competitive pressure and the desire to improve profitability. Highly competitive industries producing in a global market may have difficulty raising their output price attempting to increase profits. Thus, many firms relentlessly focus on their production processes to improve productivity in order to lower production costs as a route to higher profits. The adoption of new technologies by firms has had a profound impact on the capital-labor mix used in the production of goods and services. Further, technological innovations have enabled firms to customize products efficiently leading to greater consumer choice. Consumer welfare has improved as technology has lowered transactions costs incurred in the exchange process. Clearly, new production processes, distribution and product innovations resulting from the adoption of new technologies have benefited producers and consumers. One important result of technological change is how it has affected the skill requirements of workers and the task structure of jobs. These changes have affected the optimal mix of capital and labor used in production by US industries. This research contributes to the literature by integrating three strands of research. I link different types of technical change to US aggregate production by examining the following: (1) how technology changes the task structure of jobs; (2) the influence of technical change on the capital/labor ratio, output, and total factor productivity (TFP); and (3) the impact of technical change on the relative shares of capital and labor used in US aggregate production. By developing a conceptual framework attempting to address the above relationships, the goal of this paper is to provide intuition concerning some of the complexities associated with technical change, the task structure of jobs and changes in the relative shares of capital and labor utilized in US production. To illustrate these complexities, I used different examples to identify some specific channels of technological change. This conceptual framework also defines terminology useful in understanding the task structure of jobs. Additional intuition is provided using simple graphical models and flowcharts illustrating the implications of technical change on the US aggregate production function. “The Capital-Labor Mix in US Production” discusses the Cobb-Douglas (CD) production function for the purpose of identifying the shares of capital and labor used in US production. This model is calibrated with recent annualized values of empirically derived factor shares showing the increasing importance of capital utilization in US aggregate production. “The Nature of Technological Progress” examines the nature and complexity of technological progress. To identify the effect of neutral and bias technical change on the production process, I transform the CD production function into the Solow growth model. This enables a more tractable way to illustrate the impact of various types of technical change on the capital/labor ratio, output, and TFP. Concrete examples are provided showing the effects of various types of technical change on the relative shares of capital and labor used in the production process. “Technological Change and the Task Structure of Jobs” defines different types of tasks workers and computers perform and provides examples of those tasks. New technologies affect not only the skill requirements of jobs, but how tasks are performed by workers and machines within jobs. Changes in how jobs are designed and the nature of tasks performed within jobs have implications for the relative shares of capital and labor used in US production. “Discussion, Further Implications, and Conclusion” concludes with a discussion of some broader aspects of technical change. For example, linking technological change to the capital-labor mix in US production has important implications for the following: (1) the task structure of future jobs, (2) the elasticity of substitution between capital and labor, (3) the distribution of future occupations, (4) the mix of education and training programs, and (5) income inequality. Understanding these linkages is important in order to collect relevant data. This would enable the development of testable hypotheses based upon the growing body of theoretical work.",2

8.0,2.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,11 January 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-016-0441-1,"ICT, Innovation and Productivity: Evidence Based on Eastern European Manufacturing Companies",June 2017,Aleksandra Skorupinska,Joan Torrent-Sellens,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The widespread use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) is one of the main distinguishing features of today’s economic activity (Jovanovic and Rousseau 2005; Jorgenson and Vu 2007). The reason for this is twofold: first, their direct contribution to increased productivity and economic growth; second, their indirect contribution resulting from the generation of complementary innovations that improve the economy’s Total Factor Productivity (TFP) (Pilat 2006; Jorgenson et al. 2011; Ceccobelli et al. 2012). From the perspective of the impact analysis of ICT investment on productivity and economic growth, empirical evidence shows the following: 1) the rates of return on digital investment are relatively much higher than those on investment in other physical components; and 2) the reason is that the digital investment and use often go hand in hand with other endeavours, usually human capital improvement and organisational and institutional change (Bresnahan et al. 2002; Arvanitis 2005). The link between innovation and ICT has been identified in literature as a set of internal knowledge externalities to explain company productivity (Venturini 2015). The accelerating point of this literature is established with the consolidation of ICT as the general purpose technologies (Venturini et al. 2013). However, ICT does not give rise to generalised productivity improvements until companies and their workers have achieved the required technological, educational/training, strategic, organisational, labour and cultural competencies. In other words, the role of ICT as a general-purpose technology needs organisational and business process changes to fully exploit its growth opportunities. In this context, the effects of ICT on company productivity are indirect. Complementary relationships (co-innovation) are established with other dimensions, in particular with human capital and workplace innovation. These spillovers are widely demonstrated in research using company data (for a review of this literature see Cardona et al. 2013; Díaz-Chao et al. 2015). Transition countries of Eastern Europe (EE) face considerable challenges in adapting their economies to effectively compete in regional and global markets. It is a key issue for them to find a way to increase their productivity and adapt their economies’ structure to global-knowledge competition, promote co-innovation and develop new goods and services that respond to the changing domestic and international demands. Thus, the impact of digital technological changes and their co-innovation processes on productivity is an important aspect in the region’s economic performance. The main motivation behind this study is to evaluate the relationship among ICT, management practices, innovation and human capital, and to evaluate the influence of these variables on productivity in a sample of manufacturing enterprises in Eastern European countries. The following are the main questions underpinning the research: 1) Does the existence of new co-innovative productivity sources (the usage of ICT, workplace organisation and human capital) affect the performance of manufacturing enterprises in Eastern European countries? 2) What are the interrelationships in these complementary factors? 3) What are the differences in the relationships of complementarity (co-innovation) as the sources of productivity in Eastern European manufacturing enterprises? The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: The literature review section presents a survey of empirical literature on the relationship among ICT, innovation and company productivity. The data section describes the Management, Organisation and Innovation (MOI) dataset and presents descriptive analysis of the sample. The empirical results section reports the results of the ordinary least squares (OLS) model, the structural equation modelling (SEM) model and the empirical findings. Finally, the conclusion provides a summary and policy implications based on those findings.",22

This paper’s intent is to untangle some of the confusion concerning the concept of creative spaces, focusing on the urban areas as a unit of analysis. For that, as a conceptual framework, we will draw upon knowledge management typologies and taxonomies developed from the firm’s strategic perspective in a business context (Russ et al. 2010). First, we will discuss the characteristics of modern urbanization and the scaling effect. Next, we distinguish between knowledge cities and experience cities (both are creative spaces) utilizing the distinctive knowledge bases needed to provide for the diverse competencies required by the two sectors. We will use sectoral definitions for the city’s type since we will be looking into education as a mitigating variable. The industry sectors used in this study will be drawn more as indicators rather than as a comprehensive measure since some of the sectors used by the literature are (or have the potential of being) a mixFootnote 1 of both types of cities. This paper will use the sectors of software, IT and R&D as indicators for knowledge cities, and arts, recreation, and accommodations as indicators for experience cities. This will be followed by a discussion about education and economic inequality. We are interested in the role of education for several reasons. First, education is seen as a major building block for human capital which in turn is seen as a necessary base for both the new knowledge-based economy and for the experienced economy. Education is also seen as an enabler for social mobility, a critical factor for a healthy democratic system, and a factor in helping societies adjust to economic change. On the other hand, at least in some cases, education is seen as a mechanism maintaining prevailing social and economic inequalities as well as introducing new forms of inequalities. Education might also play a moderating and/or mediating role affecting economic income and inequalities. These are just a few of the reasons education is seen as an important factor. Early research suggests that the higher the educational level, the more successful cities are, as well as the reverse; the more successful the city, the higher the education level. Research also indicates that the more creative a city is, the more attractive it is to the creative and educated class. Early research also hints that the more successful the city, the higher the economic inequality, which may suggest that some of the expectations regarding the equalizing role of education may be simplistic. Next, we will present our hypotheses, research methods, and findings. We will wrap up the paper with conclusions, implications, limitations, and recommendations for future research.",2

The health consequences of water-related hazards, especially the use of unsafe water and sanitation, are severe (Fay et al. 2005; Shears 2007). The efforts to improve health services and water management, however, remain insufficient in many developing countries (Mudege and Ezeh 2009; Baguma et al. 2010a, b). Poverty is one of the major causes of poor health status, and partly influences the availability of safe water, negatively impacting national growth and child fatality rates (Naddumba 2008). Perpetual poverty also slows transition into the knowledge economy, retards emergency of the new organization of wealth (Sveiby 1997), affects learning as a lifelong process and keeping abreast of change (Drucker 1993; Hall and Howell-Moroney 2012) and could exacerbate ill health and water-related challenges (Shears 2007). Numerous studies on poverty reduction and many poverty-driven international agencies are available; yet, adequate quality of child health is far from universal (Shears 2007; Fay et al. 2005). The challenges associated with poor health and environmental care, for example inadequate human resources and emphasis on water management within nations, are also influenced by instabilities in economic, social and political conditions (De Jong 2010). Even so, water-borne and climate-related diseases pose health and infant morbidity risks partly because of inequality in interventions across nations, especially between developed and developing countries (Baguma et al. 2010a, b, 2012; Reuveny 2007; Olwoch et al. 2008). Moreover, although many developing countries have managed to reduce child fatality, diarrhoea, a water-related disease, remains among the most common causes of under-five deaths (Black et al. 2010). This paper agrees with studies emphasising global health interventions for challenges faced from child health care and water management in developing countries (Fink et al. 2011). For this, we examine infant mortality and water management for the period 1950 to 2010, as mortality is linked to consequences of inadequate water management, such as cholera and diarrhoea in eastern African and southeast Asian countries. However, western European countries have made substantial progress towards transforming to the knowledge economy and were thus used for comparison purposes. The paper presents an overview of infant mortality between birth and age 1, and the related risks but not the status in developing countries. The paper contributes important information because infant mortality is a persistent challenge in many developing countries.",1

According to Sir Francis Baccon “Knowledge is Power” is being replaced by “Sharing knowledge is Power.” KM is a systematic ongoing process of creating, applying, disseminating, renewing, and updating the knowledge for obtaining organizational objectives (Awad et al. 2008). Knowledge management pertain those processes associated with the identification, creation, and sharing of knowledge. Knowledge management requires systems for the formation and maintenance of knowledge repositories and to promote and facilitate the sharing of knowledge and organizational learning (Grover and Davenport 2001). People perceiving the value of measuring intellectual assets have recognized the growing value of organizational knowledge as a competitive asset. Research studies show that universities and other higher education institutions are involved in knowledge creation, dissemination, and learning; hence, they are recognized to be in the knowledge business. Sedziuviene (2009) conclude that KM system in higher educational institutions is necessary to point out the valuable knowledge, to develop a methodology for receiving, transforming, and consolidating knowledge, to trigger and optimize the process of knowledge formation, transmission, and evaluation, to perform expand of knowledge among the members/faculty and students, and to constantly perform knowledge monitoring and make future decisions accordingly. Rowley (2000) in the study on KM in higher education concludes that KM challenges lie in the creation of a knowledge environment and the recognition of knowledge as intellectual capital. Effective KM in higher education requires significant change in the culture and values, organizational structures, and reward systems (Ranjan and Khalil 2007). Unfortunately, the universities/higher-educational institutions are giving less importance to institutional structure, culture, and process which has positive impact on organizational performance. However, the fast growth of emerging and cutting edge technologies along with knowledge management systems has led to the increased adoption of new applications that contain ranking the universities, assessing the quality of lecture delivery, assessing the courses and programs, measuring the performance of faculty and students, tracking research and developments, and enhancing faculty development (Bhusry and Ranjan 2012). The addition of above-mentioned applications enables the sharing of knowledge that is essential for any university. Knowledge management ensures effective distribution of resources and staff, increases performance and productivity without increasing the cost (Kiessling et al. 2009). Knowledge is a capacity of people and communities to continuously generate and renew themselves to meet new challenges and opportunities. The advancement in the service sector and the rising need of immaterial labor have contributed dramatically to change the way in which knowledge is produced/created, disseminated, and utilized. Knowledge is referred as the product which can be utilized in an organization for its improvement and upscaling (AlMashari et al. 2002). Knowledge is the relevant information that could be developed and transferred in such a way that it would be readily available to right persons at the right time and place to uphold the effectiveness of the future/strategic decisions. Knowledge is a dynamic and smooth flow of specialized experiences, values, and insights (Wiig 1996). Knowledge continuum represents data, information, knowledge, and wisdom. Knowledge differs from information in the context and use which can be best understood from the given pyramid represented by Skyrme and Amidon (1997). The detail of the data, information, knowledge, and wisdom is shown in Fig. 1. Pyramid of knowledge continuum. Adapted from Skyrme and Amidon (1997) Figure 1 indicates that the fundamental element of information for any organization is the data. Organizations collect, summarize, and analyze this data to identify patterns and trends (Ackoff 1989). Data can be collected, quantified, categorized, and calculated for the functional processes of the organization. Data has no significance beyond its existence. Data is in the form of discrete facts, figures, symbols, words, code, tables, etc. and having no discernible meaning. Data represents fact or statement of event without relation to other things (Skyrme 1997), example, “It is raining.” Information is basically data that has been given meaning by way of relational connection (Skyrme 1997). The accumulation/organizing of data into a meaningful context provides information such as in the form of sentences, paragraphs, equations, concepts, ideas, questions, and simple stories. It can then be transformed into a process or procedure, making it useful. Information is the collection of facts and figure about on a particular subject (Ackoff 1989). As we know, information is data that relates who, what, where, and when to each other and providing a baseline/input for a process, conversion, comparison, connection, order, etc. Information embodies the understanding of a relationship of some sort, possibly cause and effect, example, “The temperature dropped 15 degrees and then it started raining.” Knowledge is different from data information; it can be created from any one of those layers, or it can be created from existing knowledge using logical inferences (Skyrme 1997). Knowledge is the application of information, which addresses how and why, in addition to who, what, where, and when. The knowledge connects all the information together to produce a comprehensive policy, process, or procedure. It organizes information as in the form of chapters, theories, axioms, conceptual frameworks, etc. (Ackoff 1989). Knowledge exhibits a pattern that links and generally provides a high level of predictability as to what is described or what will happen next, example, “If the humidity is very high and the temperature drops substantially the atmospheres is often unlikely to be able to hold the moisture so it rains.” The complete understanding of effects and application of knowledge is called wisdom. In other words, wisdom is the utilization of accumulated knowledge to create a higher level of understanding of the data (Ackoff 1989). Wisdom is the applied knowledge in the form of books, paradigms, systems, philosophies, schools of thought, traditions, principles, truth, etc. Wisdom is essentially systemic, i.e., “It rains because it rains. And, this encompasses an understanding of all the interactions that happen between raining, evaporation, air currents, temperature gradients, changes, and raining.” Knowledge management processes significantly impact/improve organizational processes, like innovation, collaborative decision-making, individual, and collective learning. Chu (2000) mentioned an empirical finding that the type of combination between knowledge integration mechanisms and innovation strategies has a positive and significant influence on the performance of knowledge conversion.” These improved organizational processes turn out intermediate outcomes such as better decisions, organizational behaviors, products, services, and relationships. These, in turn, lead to improved organizational performance. Jian (2007) used empirical data to support his argument that a company’s market KM capability has a positive and significant influence on its operating performance. Organizational performance is derived from a comparison of results/output or a comparison between the actual output achieved and the initial projection/target. Meanwhile, it provides a criterion for measuring how an organization reaches goals, both effectively and efficiently, by using resources and meeting customers’ needs. There are a number of studies which discussed the role of knowledge management on organizational performance; however, very limited studies successfully defined the term “organizational performance” (Sanchez and Mahoney 1996; Alvi and Leidner 2001; Gold et al. 2001a, b). Lee and Choi (2003) defined as organizational performance act as an important instrument for sustaining competitive advantage, and many companies are started to manage organizational knowledge. Du Plessis (2007) simplified the role of knowledge management in innovation as an aid to addressing the innovation complexity. Acar and Acar (2014) defined the organizational performance in terms of the contribution of the employees for the success of the organization. Ahmed and Shafiq (2014) defined organization performance in terms of organizational culture which comprised the actual output of an organization which was measured against the organizational goals and objectives. Organizational culture is one of the important factors that lead to an increased organizational performance. Turel and Bart (2014) defined organizational performance in terms of information technology resources, which the management team used IT-related tools to enhance organizational performance. Huang (2002) mentioned an empirical finding “that the intensity of interaction with customers, the customer-related KM capability, and customers” personal qualities affect the new product’s performance in a significantly positive manner “and Lin (2009) mentioned that customer-related KM, customer-orientation, and adaptive selling behavior all have a positive and significant influence on sales results and also lead to a higher degree of job satisfaction.” Lee et al. (2007) proved that organizational learning and knowledge sharing affect the performance concerning product development in a positive and significant way. In a developing country such as Pakistan, where service industry is in infant stage and has lots of room for expansion and development. In the last few years, the service industry has seen not only employment and growth but expected to grow further in the years to come. The competition in this sector will encourage increase of incentives and services to attract customers to acquire and maintain competitive advantage (Bhatti 2011). This study helps managers to understand not only the knowledge management but also its impact on the organizational performance in education sector. Universities and higher education institutions share a common vision—discovering, developing, preserving, and disseminating knowledge. During the process of KM, a wide range of policies and practices can shape the values of an educational organization. According to Kidwell et al. (2000), knowledge management benefits the services and processes that are the following: The research process The curriculum development process, teaching and learning processes Student and alumni services Administrative services Strategic planning Contemporary theory of knowledge management answers the question “what is the production of HEIs and who its client is”: The product of HEIs is knowledge, which a student receives/acquire during studies. It is very essential to ensure that knowledge should not be on the paper, but it should be visible by him during the exams, from qualification, in laboratories, from his profession and practice at work place. The client of HEIs first of the entire student himself, then society, and finally the state that provides the finance from the budget for acquiring knowledge and management processes (Rowley 2000). The knowledge management applications provide different recommendations that include a set of repositories/warehouse and portals. Centralized portals (in relation to research, student affairs etc.), modifying library software, enhancing teaching tools, adding knowledge management components to student management systems, building knowledge management systems, purchasing intelligence products, and appointing chief knowledge officers (CKO). These approaches/initiatives reported have led to enhanced student enrolment and satisfaction, improved research, and improved student and academic planning in the organization (Sedziuviene 2009). A number of universities are managing intellectual property and knowledge workers as an asset for their organization. It is now widely believed in the higher education sector-universities that knowledge management can help to enhance organizational efficacy through the application of constructive/useful knowledge (AlMashari et al. 2002). Significant work has been accomplished in the area of KM in higher educational system, and many new contributions have been made by the researchers in this field. Table 1 describes the work already achieved in this area and its relevance to the authors in their research. The following studies have been proved that there is positive impact of KM on the organizational performance. To provide more innovative services to a demanding public, universities must be involved in the creation of new knowledge, utilization, and its share. Active management of the knowledge assets is mandatory for organizational success (Santo 2005). The study reported that education sector experiences some issues, challenges in implementing knowledge management in the university environment. Few challenges/barriers are as under: Lack of understanding concerning what knowledge is and how it is different from information. Rigid organizational structure. Insufficient inclusion of knowledge management techniques in academic and administrative services/operations. Lack of planning and slow pace to incorporate societal changes. Lack of leader participation and insufficient time for employees to develop knowledge activities. Diminutive willingness of faculty and staff to share knowledge. Employees training in knowledge management techniques. Low awareness of the benefits of knowledge management. Nour (2014) examined the role of tacit knowledge and codified sources of knowledge at firm and aggregate levels and found that tacit knowledge is complementary with schooling at microlevels, while both the tacit and codified knowledge exert the positive association with the economic growth at aggregate levels. Vargiu (2014) examined the different indicators for assessment of public engagement of universities, i.e., mission and vision of the universities, governance and institutionalized practices for public engagement, research portfolio of the universities, student engagement in health activities, dissemination of knowledge among the stake holders, accessibility of basic infrastructure, etc. According to Al-Omari et al. (2014, P. 616), “…..knowledge growth measurement and elicitation is an active research spanning from the concepts that include the stages of knowledge growth…” The overall studies indicate the effectiveness of knowledge management and organizational performance in different human/environmental settings. This study distinguished from other studies in different perspective, i.e., the study selected skilled and educated peoples that we called “human capital” for sample of the studies. The sample includes teaching and research faculty along with management staff for getting feedback about the knowledge management and organizational performance in the higher educational institutes of KPK, Pakistan.",53

The transport literature does not answer this question. The idea here is to exploit the contribution of the corporate governance literature on explaining the shortfall Q* − Q, which is the difference between optimal firm value and observed value. Next, the objective is to propose the optimal corporate governance structure that may improve the transport firm value. To the best of our knowledge, this study is an original essay in transport literature that introduces the effect of the internal organisation of transport firms’ control system as a reason for distortions in their Q value and to account for the observed value. According to Jarboui et al. (2014), corporate governance mechanisms and controls are designed to reduce the inefficiencies that arise from moral hazard and adverse selection. There are both internal monitoring systems and external monitoring systems. Internal monitoring can be done, for example, by one (or a few) large shareholder(s) in the case of privately held companies or a firm belonging to a business group. Furthermore, the various board mechanisms provide for internal monitoring. Therefore, internal corporate governance controls monitor activities and then take corrective action to accomplish organisational goals. External monitoring of managers’ behaviour occurs when an independent third party (e.g. the external auditor) attests the accuracy of information provided by management to investors. Therefore, external corporate governance controls encompass the controls external stakeholders exercise over the organisation. Several previous studies have investigated the role of governance mechanisms in the resolution of conflicts of interest between shareholders and managers and in the improvement of performance. The latter implies an interest in the plurality of actors. Indeed, in the field of tourism, partnership is often rigorous and must be taken into account. It is therefore important to integrate various stakeholders (banks, state, another hotel chain, suppliers, customers, etc.) in making strategic or other decisions, with the aim of creating value. In recent years, corporate governance has become one of the most studied domains in economic literature (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). Increased interest in corporate governance can be justified by the great deal of recent research providing details about the effects of certain issues of corporate governance on managers’ decisions and transport firm value. In recent years, the debate has focused on the activity of the board of directors, the most outstanding governance mechanism of internal control systems (Jensen, 1993). Literature in corporate governance has mainly concentrated on two mechanisms: the ownership structure and the board of directors’ characteristics, which implicitly explains the relative importance of these two internal mechanisms. A seminal paper by Hermalin and Weisbach (2003) has initiated a debate concerning the effect of the existence of an optimal governance structure on firm value. In their work, they empirically find that the board of directors can negatively affect firm value. Habib and Ljungqvis (2005) also demonstrate that corporate governance mechanisms and especially board characteristics and ownership structure may affect firm’s value for large American listed manufacturer firms. They investigate the effect of internal corporate governance mechanisms on firm value. Another interesting work that can serve here as a strong theoretical pillar opening the door to the study of the effect of corporate governance mechanisms in explaining firms value is that of Pawlina et al. (2005). In their study, they also explore the effect of board characteristics and ownership concentration on firm value. They show that internal corporate governance mechanisms can explain the shortfall in firm value. They mainly concentrate on the effect of board characteristics as an explanation for the inefficiency term that represents the deviation from firm optimal value. Their conclusion aligns with the studies of Hermalin and Weisbach (1998), confirming that board structure is considered in achieving the optimal corporate governance solution to the monitoring problem. The aim of our research is to exploit the contribution of the corporate governance literature on explaining the shortfall Q* − Q (the difference between optimal value and actual value) of 64 public road transport firms in different countries between 2000 and 2011. Next, our goal will be to propose an optimal structure of corporate governance that may improve the firm value. To the best of our knowledge, this study is an original essay in transport literature that sets out to introduce the effect of the internal organisation of transport firms’ control system as a reason for distortions in their value and to account for the observed inefficiency term. The major contribution in this paper is to identify the inefficiency determinants of the firm value. As opposed to other studies on the public transport operators’ efficiency, this study attempts to explain inefficiency by variables under operators’ control. In this paper, we present an original essay that seeks to explain how the corporate governance mechanism can affect the value of public transport operator and how this approach can limit managers’ mistakes leading to public transport operators’ value. The remainder of this paper is presented as follows. In the ‘Literature Review and Hypothesis Development’ section, we present a literature review on the potential effect of internal governance mechanisms on transport firm value and we formulate our hypothesis. In the ‘Methodology and the Model’ section, we explain the methodology employed. The ‘Data Description’ section describes the database used. The ‘Results and Discussions’ section presents and discusses the results obtained. Finally, the ‘Conclusion’ section presents a conclusion and the possible limitations of the paper.",5

This new model has changed many economic rules (Stiglitz, 1999). Furthermore, the changes in production, distribution, and consumption methods have affected all the aspects of the social life to the extent that it has brought new social life into existence. Actually, it offers significant economic opportunities, such as revolution in productivity, which entail improvement of living standards to a high level and solves the current economic issues facing societies. Proper use of these opportunities presupposes identifying them in the first place. To understand every phenomenon, requires special theoretical framework, as viewed an appropriate method of identification in the current study. In fact, the main question of this paper seems to be finding the best theoretical pattern to analyze and understand issues concerning new economy and the best way to achieve such approach. The important point in every research paper is to select a certain appropriate theoretical framework, since it gives order and consistency to the procedure and prevent the mind and the process from being distracted from the research, so as to help in achieving a more comprehensive understanding about the subject of the study.

They number more than 30 million people in West Africa alone. Their major homeland is southwestern Nigeria. A sizeable number of them are also found in other parts of the world outside West Africa such as Latin American and Caribbean countries. In their southwestern Nigerian homeland, the Yoruba people are divided into a number of sub-ethnic groups such the Ife, Oyo, Ijesha, Ekiti, Ijebu, Egba, Awori, Okun, Akoko, and so on (Falola 1999: 1). A major significant aspect of the Yoruba existence is their possession of a common tradition of origin and eponymous father (Oduduwa), a generally acknowledged spiritual headquarters (Ile-Ife), a common language with is mutually intelligible to all the groups (with various dialects) and socio-political ways of life (Eades 1980; Olatunji 1996; Akinjogbin 2002). The Yoruba, like other African peoples, have indigenous knowledge and conception of diseases and a well-thought out and defined system of indigenous medicine which is determined by their culture (Jegede 2002: 322). Yoruba medicine falls under what the World Health Organization (WHO) categorizes as traditional medicine. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) (2000): 1: Traditional medicine is the sum total of the knowledge, skills and practices based on the various theories, beliefs and experiences, indigenous to people of different cultures, which could be used in the maintenance of health, as well as on the prevention, diagnosis, improvement or treatment of physical or mental illnesses. This definition suitably describes the Yoruba indigenous medical knowledge and practices. In contemporary medical discourse in Nigeria, traditional medicine is interchangeably used with such terms as indigenous medicine, natural medicine, alternative medicine, unorthodox medicine, nonconventional medicine, complementary medicine, and other related terms (Amanze et al. 2007: 1). The suitability or otherwise of these terms in the description of Yoruba medicine is not the purpose of this paper. However, this paper will adopt the use of the term ‘indigenous medicine’ in its analysis of the nature, methods, forms, and dynamism of the Yoruba medicine. This is because, with whatever name it is called, indigenous medicine refers to all forms of medicine, indigenous to a people, other than modern western-imposed type of medicine, having been passed from one generation to the other. Essentially, it must be stated from the outset that Yoruba indigenous medicine has all the basic characteristics of any well-defined medical system. These basic characteristics include systematic understanding and diagnosis of diseases, causes of diseases, names of diseases, methods of therapy, different forms of medications (curative/therapeutic and preventive/prophylactic) as well as dynamism of medical practices. Premised on these, this paper examines the nature and character of Yoruba indigenous medicine and its continued relevance in contemporary Yoruba societies.",1

The justification for these programs rests on a vast and steadily growing literature that estimates the private and social returns to R&D. Much of the returns to R&D literature build on the R&D capital model formalized in Griliches (1973, 1979), and the literature is reviewed in a number of excellent surveys. Mairesse and Mohnen (1990) is an early example. Hall et al. (2010), in a new Elsevier Handbook, is the most recent authoritative review.Footnote 1 All surveys conclude that there are large returns to R&D, although no one computes a combined return estimate using a formal meta-analytic technique. Most economists have a prior belief that returns to R&D are positive and possibly large, but the returns to R&D literature are prone to problems related to measurement, selection, choice of functional form, and appropriate lag lengths. This suggests that there is a danger of publication bias. Reporting and publication bias are widely recognized as threats to the validity of empirical research. This bias may be self-imposed by researchers or imposed by editors and referees who consider negative, small, or non-significant coefficients to be suspicious and of little interest. Studies—and results within studies—where the returns to R&D are overestimated are then more likely to end up reported than results where the returns are underestimated. To the extent that this occurs, the average of estimates from published studies will overestimate the true return. This topic has not been given any attention in previous surveys of the returns to R&D, except for a brief comment by Griliches (1992):  “The estimated social rates of return look surprisingly uniform in their indication of the importance of [...] spillovers. While one must worry whether this is not just the result of self-imposed publication filters, my own involvement in this work and my acquaintance with many of the other researchers in this area leads me to believe in the overall reality of such findings.” We do not question the “overall reality” of positive returns to R&D, but we discuss the scope for publication bias and provide a first analytical investigation of whether the “worry” that Griliches reflects on, is warranted or not. Surveying a related literature, Ientile and Mairesse (2009) find evidence suggesting that “there might be a positive publication bias in the literature on the efficiency of R&D tax credits”.Footnote 2
 The literature on the private and social returns to R&D is very large and diverse. Our ambition is not to conduct a systematic review of the full literature, but to complement the narrative and influential survey by Hall et al. (2010) and the prior meta analysis by Wieser (2005).Footnote 3 Although narrative reviews are selective by their very nature, their strength—or perceived strength—is that leading researchers in the field have selected what they think are important, high quality studies that give a reliable picture of the evidence base. Typically, they will also focus on the estimates from each primary study that represent the authors’ preferred specifications. Systematic reviews will include all estimates, including erroneous research and many estimates from specifications that are reported only for comparison.Footnote 4
 In his meta analysis, Wieser explores whether the return estimates are stable over time and across different countries, industries and econometric specifications, but he does not analyse publication bias. The topic is not touched upon by Hall et al. (2010), either. Our focus is on the private returns to R&D estimated on firm level data. Using both funnel graphs, the “trim and fill” -method and regressions, we find evidence consistent with a strong positive bias in the part of the literature that controls for unobserved firm fixed effects. The reason may be that fixed effects specifications are particularly susceptible to measurement errors and therefore have a high probability of producing implausibly low return estimates. Our analysis suggests that as much as 23 % of the results in a hypothetical complete literature is missing. Although there exists potential alternative interpretations, and although it may be rational for individual researchers to filter out implausible results without reporting them, this number is surprisingly high. Many papers included in the surveys we build on are done by the most merited researchers in the field, and they were in many instances commissioned or invited in some way without being subject to usual publication selection.Footnote 5 Moreover, they tend to focus on methodological issues where zero or negative results should be as interesting as positive ones. In a subsample that estimates the gross private returns to R&D directly, we find a combined return estimate of 17.9 % before accounting for publication bias. When correcting for publication bias, the combined return estimate drops to 13.3 %. Our analysis, of course, does not imply that 13.3 % is a correct estimate of the true private returns to R&D-investments. In fact, 13.3 % seems implausibly low for a gross rate of return to R&D, as R&D investments are believed to depreciate by at least 15 % per year from a private point of view (Hall et al. 2010). The lesson to be learned from our meta analysis is rather that reporting and publication bias is a relevant issue in the returns to R&D literature, and that negative specification biases, such as measurement error bias, is likely to interact with publication bias and mask the full effect of the specification bias.",9
8.0,3.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,03 October 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-015-0312-1,Defining the Characteristics of an Expert in a Social Context Through Subjective Evaluation,September 2017,Halvor Holtskog,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Peter Drucker said that knowledge worker productivity is one of the biggest management challenges of the twenty-first century (Drucker 2008). This statement spurs a set of questions that both from an academic and a practitioner’s point of view should bring interesting answers. First, we would like to pose the question: what is an expert? Second, what characterizes an expert? And third, are the identified characteristics sufficient to enable us to tell an expert from a non-expert? When introducing the term “expert,” it is important to make a distinction between the relatively broad term “knowledge worker” and the more specific notion of an individual who holds exceptional knowledge within a domain. Ericsson defines an expert as someone widely recognized as a reliable source of knowledge, technique, or skill whose judgment is accorded authority and status by the public or his or her peers (Ericsson 2006). Hence, an expert must be said to belong to the group of knowledge workers, but with the additional ability to consistently exhibit superior performance—as determined by other experts or knowledge workers. Traditionally, there are two main approaches to the study of the characteristics of experts (Chi 2006). The absolute approach studies truly exceptional people and their performance within formal domains, often domains linked to academia and intellectual games, and informal domains such as sewing and cooking. In contrast, the relative approach tries to better understand how novices can achieve expert status through training and experience (Dreyfus et al. 1986). In this paper, we will not claim to strictly follow either of these two approaches. Rather, we focus on how experts excel in their natural context, which in this case means an organizational setting aimed at developing new and innovative products for global value chains. In looking at organizations which have a proven track record of competitiveness in demanding global markets, we can safely assume that they attract and develop people who are able live up to certain performance standards. We can therefore infer that the requirements of the absolute approach are met by the selection of potential respondents. The relative approach is primarily focused on how knowledge can be identified, exchanged, integrated, and utilized in order to create experts. These are all important elements of the learning cycle, but are not the core of this study. Thus, we will not delve into major philosophical debates such as the distinction between knowing how and knowing that (Ryle 2009) and the denial of such a meaningful distinction in an epistemological sense (Stanley and Williamson 2001; White 1982). This study is not an effort to differentiate types of knowledge, but rather to determine the individual and subjective meaning of each person’s apprehension of their own abilities and status. However, today’s multitude of media for social interaction affects the exchange and integration of knowledge and how people receive feedback from others, gain social support, and interact outside the organization (Grant 2007). These broad changes in social interaction are claimed to impact the motivation, performance, and well-being of professionals, with the result that social dimensions deserve greater attention than they have received before (Oldham and Hackman 2010). This view, like this study, is rooted in the tradition of sociology that asserts that the lives of individuals cannot be understood independent of their social context (Evetts et al. 2006). There is an ongoing debate whether work designs that stress collaboration and team work are at odds with the person- and role-based identities often held by professionals (Johns 2010). Although the hero status, sometimes linked to descriptors such as cool, independent, iconoclastic, and non-conformist (Johns 2010), is somewhat individual, product development in the organizations participating in this study is truly based on team effort. In the following section, the theory basis for developing a set of statements, aimed at identifying and characterizing experts, is outlined. Insight in the books Leading Geeks (Glen 2003) and Clever (Goffee and Jones 2009) provide the characteristics of the expert and give depth to the arguments. In an organization, it is common to title people with expert of this and that. The intent behind this could be to say that in this area the individual should seek to develop competence, as when a parent seeks to motivate a child to excel. Alternatively, the intent could be to praise the work of an individual or a team. So who are these experts in an organization? Goffee and Jones offer the following definition of expert (Goffee and Jones 2009): [Experts]… are highly talented individuals with the potential to create disproportionate amounts of value from the resources that the organization makes available to them.
 Therefore, skills and talent are essential characteristics for an expert, who uses these assets to add significant value to the organization. Another definition of so-called exceptional people deals with “geeks” (Glen 2003) which are defined as: … the enablers of technology who develop, deploy, and support the systems and products that deliver value to customers and help companies remain competitive. They are the indispensable enablers of innovation. In this definition, technology is a key element, in combination with people creating/developing, deploying and supporting technology, and thereby delivering a competitive advantage. Innovation arises from the synthesis of people’s effort to make technology work and the uniqueness of the technology. Some of the resources that the organization makes available to the experts can be technology, and it is technology that can then form the basis of some of the disproportionate amounts of value they produce. In this case, the experts are motivated by concrete results in the form of a product or a process. Their expertise must be recognized by others, and in that sense is bounded. Technology-driven innovations will also give very specific areas in which the person is an expert; this results in compartmentalization. Goffee and Jones identify nine characteristics of experts in the organizational setting (Goffee and Jones 2009). These nine characteristics pertain to both the expert’s identity and the social factors that provide a foundation for their function in the organization. This paper focuses primarily on the individual subjective opinion of persons. Such subjective opinions will play a part in the larger picture of how experts behave in organizations and especially in R&D projects. Every person has an identity or a way of perceiving himself or herself. An expert’s identity is often centered on his or her competence, knowledge, or function, together with how these characteristics are put to use. It is essential for an expert to know details which are irrelevant to others, while from the expert’s point of view, the company’s overall “big picture” is not particularly interesting. This perfectionist attitude makes experts reluctant to rely on others, except for collegial expertise (Evetts et al. 2006), because others are not clever enough to understand the complexity and the nuances of knowledge that form expert identity. Goffee and Jones (Goffee and Jones 2009) summarize it this way: “cleverness is central to their identity.” Another element in the characteristic identity is found in Glen’s writing (Glen 2003). He claims that experts revere the rational, but points out that this reverence is ironic because their boundless faith in the rational is “fired by passion,” and passion is inherently irrational. Glen (Glen 2003) claims that playfulness and the childlike view of the technological world remain with experts throughout their lives. While identity is important, the trait approach tells us that education, experience, and autonomy are not enough to define an expert (Evetts et al. 2006; Sonnentag et al. 2006). Employee skills are often emphasized as a company’s most valuable resource (Liker and Hoseus 2008) and the backbone of its competitive advantage. What kinds of skills set an expert apart from the rest of the employees? First, their skills are primarily tacit, or as observed by Glen, they include a joy of puzzle solving whereby knowledge, creativity, and logic are the ingredients for a lifelong pursuit of puzzles (Glen 2003). This mode of thought is segmented into the problem-solution mind-set of the expert (Glen 2003). Experts are on top of their trade and are well connected, so that for instance, they often have a greater reputation among experts outside the company than they have inside the company. Goffee and Jones summarize it this way:“a great deal of their cleverness resides not what they know but who they know and how they know it” (Goffee and Jones 2009). At the same time, an expert is regarded as an individual player (Glen 2003). This view is supported by Locke et al. who claim that some tasks, such as those that require sophisticated use of highly specialized individual knowledge or expertise, are better suited for individual rather than collective performance (Locke et al. 2001). As mentioned above, the skills of an expert are tacit, meaning that knowledge is personal and difficult to articulate and codify (Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995). This factor implies that company performance relies heavily upon skilled people—something an expert is well aware of. Some knowledge can be codified and written down, but to attempt to record all the knowledge in a company would be a monumental task or near impossible. As soon as something is written down, it can become obsolete, leading to inertia, since organizations tend to conserve what exists (Weber and Antal 2001). Goffee and Jones (Goffee and Jones 2009) observe that experts with specialized knowledge can be very blunt in their assessment of their leaders. Those who have deep knowledge of their field and use it in real world projects, and, last but not least, are willing to share their knowledge and abilities, are considered technological leaders (Glen 2003) or experts. Questioning the leaders follows naturally from experts knowing their worth, putting a lot of pressure on leaders and their role. Questions may be asked in a manner that reveals that experts believe they are always right. This belief is the key to “selling” ideas to the rest of the organization. They instantly challenge what is laid before them, which may serve as a prerequisite to a new way of thinking that can lead to breakthrough innovations (Goffee and Jones 2009). Some of these tendencies are also reported by Glen (Glen 2003), who notes that experts tend not to get along with those they consider fools. In this light, a difficult question can be seen as a way of testing the abilities of others. But it can also be a sign of recognition and acknowledgment of other people, if the expert holds the belief that asking difficult questions shows signs of caring and giving the other or leader the opportunity to answer in a way that shows his or her own excellence. Experts understand very well the dynamics of organizations and related politics. Some demonstrate an ability to play political games to their advantage in the organization, in which typically, funding of their interests or projects is the ultimate goal. Goffee and Jones write, “they are expert gamers” (Goffee and Jones 2009). This game playing may, despite the fact that experts generally are very clear in their opinions, lead to fuzziness when it comes to separating facts from assumption, opinions, inferences, and implications (Glen 2003). This notion of “my facts are your facts” comes into play when experts are dealing with the dynamics of an organization in order to get their way. From this perspective, it is interesting to introduce the theory of self-management. This theory claims that strong personalities need to have specific and challenging goals that ultimately go along with company strategy (Renn et al. 2011). Corporate hierarchy and managerial control do not impress the experts (Evetts et al. 2006). This implies that a leader is “only as good as your last idea” (Goffee and Jones 2009). Knowledge and skills are what count, not a title or a position. In other words, leading experts is all about gentle guidance in the desired direction, much like nurturing knowledge creation (Ichijo 2007). Interestingly, it seems that the organizational chart is not what motivates experts, but on the other hand there is an “invisible wall chart” (Goffee and Jones 2009). The invisible wall chart is an informal organizational chart of experts. Here we also find so-called “heroes,” experts who claim to both define problems and provide solutions. This concept brings to mind the Chief Engineers at Toyota (Morgan and Liker 2006) and the discourse of fat design (Fujimoto 1999). Heroic actors are also described by Schön as product champions who use every means of informal pressure, persistence, and courage of heroic quality in promoting innovations (Schön 1963). Motivational factors are other things than money and formal power (Gagne and Deci 2005). For example, acceptance and recognition inside and outside the company, together with values such as individualism, freedom, independence, self-determination, integrity, and creativity, are recognized as important for experts. When playing with ideas, experts tend to be overwhelmingly enthusiastic about their own ideas. In this state of mind, experts find it difficult to understand why others do not share the same enthusiasm (Goffee and Jones 2009). This is similar to the presumption that inability to delay gratification may be negatively related to operating and willpower (Renn et al. 2011). They believe that the idea is so revolutionary to the company that all systems and everything should stop immediately. For a leader, this kind of behavior can be thought of as interference or acts of genius. Howell and Boies found support for this enthusiasm, asserting that champions provide enthusiastic support for new ideas more often than non-champions do (Howell and Boies 2004). Burgelman also reported that champions often lay a convincing master strategy for their ideas that includes mobilizing resources and establishing and maintaining intense contact with top management to keep them informed and enthusiastic about the project (Burgelman 1983). Experts need to be connected to other experts outside the organization in order to be effective. This is a paradox. Resources that will bring or create new knowledge for an expert are usually found outside the organization itself. And it is the intellectual process among the experts that is the foundation for this new knowledge. Earlier, in the discussion of replication of knowledge, the point was made that the most important thing about experts was whom they know rather than what they know. This implies that being an expert involves being part of a network in which your expertise is recognized in a social interaction. Networks of this kind are where experts get bright ideas and a source of perpetual improvement. Questioning assumptions and making unacknowledged links are some of the main driving forces in the network. According to Tsoukas (Tsoukas 1996), social learning is a network of collective behavior based on distributed knowledge, implicitly assuming the existence of a group mind within professions. Studies of communities of practice, by Wenger and Brown and Duguid for instance (J. Brown and Duguid 1998; Wenger 1998), typically lie within this tradition. A community of practice does not separate the activities of working, learning, and innovating. Brown and Duguid (J. S. Brown and Duguid 1991) argued that such communities constantly improvise and adapt their behaviors to cross the limitations of formal organization. Experts will not follow a past dogma blindly; to satisfy their true and natural curiosity, they must question past reasoning. “It is born of the need for a free inner life of thought and reason” (Glen 2003). This idea points back to key concepts such as identity, knowing their worth, and asking difficult questions. In keeping with the notion that an expert does not want to be led, he or she will not recognize any value of your leadership. “Even when you’re leading them well, … may be unwilling to recognize your leadership” (Goffee and Jones 2009). This does not mean that experts are unthankful, but leadership is not in their focus and interest. Goffee and Jones summarize it this way: “You know you’re a success when you hear them say you’re not getting in the way too much.” It is believed that this characteristic follows from an expert’s strong sense of identity as described earlier.",6

This paper utilized the case analysis of Turkey’s initiative of smart projects that aim to “enable Turkey to benefit from ICTs effectively and to identify the middle- and long-term strategies and targets for the realization of transformation” (ISS 2006-10 2006: 2). Turkey’s advancement towards becoming smarter is a continuum process initiated by ICTs. I analyzed two policy documents titled Information Society Strategy of Turkey initiated in 2006 and 2014, respectively. Based on these strategy documents, the continuum process of becoming smarter in Turkey starts with ICT infrastructure. The process, however, contains ever changing dynamics that create, transform, and design new reconfigurations in complex socio-technical platforms. Therefore, considering diverse local institutional design, context, and different aspects of smart solutions experiences, one might say that it is not possible to identify a one-fits-all definition of a smart city. As a result, this paper revealed that the processes of implementing successful smart projects create policy areas performed by various and multi-dimensional socio-technical reconfigurations. These areas emerge and interact to create and institutionalize new urban solutions. Examining the problem areas of smart city projects reveals the contradictions, limitations, and gaps in smart city projects, as well as institutional differences at the local level. Therefore, this paper identified the weaknesses of smart city projects and action plans prescribed by the policy reports in order to understand how a smart city projects actually work on the ground. Therefore, the main focus of the paper was to address the question: what are the contradictions and limitations of the socio-technical reconfigurations of smart city projects? How have the reconfigurations played out in past projects and how should they be institutionalized? In order to address these questions, this paper analyzed how these projects are operationalized and implemented on the ground. Based on the document analysis, I studied the case of the Information Society Strategy of Turkey 2006–2010 and 2015–2018 in order to identify the gaps and problems in creating smart city projects. Each action plan was examined by defining the progression of achieving the level of smart as an operationalizing concept in order to discover the gaps towards becoming smarter and adequate approaches to close these gaps. As such, it was of equal importance to identify and examine the new actors of these socio-technical reconfigurations. This paper set out to explore the problem areas and challenges in order to suggest new dimensions and solutions to overcome identified challenges.",16

Clusters are defined in terms of annual FDI inflows, show the hierarchical spatial concentration patterns of FDI inflows to China, and they may consist of more than one administrative provinces. Clusters’ composition of administrative provinces may not be stable over time. The determination of clusters is based upon the results of the cluster statistical methodology application. Second, the detected spatial hierarchies may be interpreted on the basis of a mathematical model constructed by variables such as annual gross product, annual exports and imports, annual consumption, average annual nominal wages, etc. The explanatory ability of the model is tested via the empirical application of the model using appropriate approximations of the variables that refer to individual cluster level and by applying the one-way ANOVA statistical technique. Third, upon the empirical results, a discussion is constructed trying to establish economic explanations of the detected hierarchical concentrations in China by bridging the economic theory and evidence on FDI decisions with investment location theory. Finally, comparison with other empirical results on location concentration and explanations in China is made. The paper aspires to introduce for the first time the use of the cluster methodology in determining FDI spatial hierarchies and to bridge the FDI economic theory with location theory in deriving interpretations for the detected spatial hierarchical concentration patterns using China as a case study. China is divided into three regions, i.e. Eastern, Central and Western that are divided into 31 provinces. In particular, the Eastern Region is constituted by the provinces of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Liaoning, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Shandong, Guangdong, Guangxi and Hainan. The provinces of Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei and Hunan are the constituent parts of the Central Region. The provinces of Chongqing, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia and Xinjiang constitute the Western Region. The spatial distribution of FDI in China is quite uneven showing significant concentration in the coastal provinces of the Eastern Region (Bucley et al. 2002). In the period of 2003–2007, the Central and Western regions received only the 8.8 and 3.8 % of the cumulative FDI inflows respectively, while all the rest went to the Eastern Region. Even within the Eastern Region, the FDI distribution between provinces is quite uneven (Delis, 2010, pp. 87–94). The uneven spatial FDI distribution may be partly attributed to the government’s policy of gradual economic transition. Initially, in 1978, the government’s open door policy aiming at stimulating economic growth through the attraction of FDI focused preferentially on seven economic zones located in the eastern coastal area, and foreign capital was allowed to invest only in export-oriented joint ventures. Gradually, foreign investments were allowed to enter a large number of industries, to take all possible entry modes, even of wholly owned subsidiaries, and to locate outside the special economic zones in 14 coastal cities, which were the traditional industrial and commercial centres of China with adequate infrastructure, and at a later stage, in a number of other provinces, even some inner ones. FDI entered to the Chinese economy in increasing numbers, taking momentum after the reforms of 1991–1992 pertained to economic openness and liberalisation, i.e. relaxation of government controls and intervention, and the introduction of pro-market legal, institutional and regulation reforms. China’s membership to the World Trade Organisation in 2002 provided a further consolidation of the country’s position as FDI host. The central government has been implementing its open door policy through administrative decentralisation, i.e. it has created a multilevel governance system, and through transferring the authority of economic development policy design and implementation to local level governments but in a preferential mode, i.e. it has been granting different degrees of autonomy to different local administrations. This policy design, in fact, has reinforced interregional competition for attracting business, especially foreign ones, and it ended to sustaining or even enhancing the polarisation between a developed zone at and near the eastern coast of China and a less developed hinterland (Li and Wei, 2010). Although the central government took policy measures for promoting economic growth in 12 provinces of the poorer Western Region in 1999, and in the northeastern provinces and in 9 provinces belonging in the Central Region in 2003, the problem still remains. There is a well-developed body of economic theory interpreting FDI both as an economic phenomenon and as a strategic decision of the firm and the determinants of its location patterns across countries. Dunning’s eclectic paradigm (Dunning, 1980, 1993, 2001) establishes that if both ownership-specific and internalisation advantages exist, then FDI is determined by the distribution of location advantages between potential recipient countries. Theoretical and empirical literature (e.g. Caves, 1996; Blonigen, 2005) suggests a variety of location factors such as natural resources; production factor endowments, cost, and quality; market size and growth leading to the realisation of both economies of scale and economies of scope; trade openness and regional economic integration; institutions, market regulation, political stability, etc. When a host country has been decided upon, the next choice is that of the production plant exact geographical site. The neoclassical theory of location (Weber, 1929; Smith, 1981, 1991) bases the determination of optimal plant location on supply and demand variables. The supply oriented location theory suggests that production activities should be located where the total cost function is minimised assuming a given size and distribution of markets and perfect competition. Total cost minimisation depends upon the availability, the cost and efficiency of factor inputs and the transportation cost from the production site to the market. An alternative model (Smith, 1981; Greenhut 1957, 1964) assumes production costs to be independent from location. Under imperfect competition and demand variations over space, competitor firms rival for controlling market shares. Each location guarantees an element of space monopoly, the extent of which depends upon the market structure, the location strategy and efficiency of competitors and transportation costs. In addition, the existence of economies of scale affects both the tendency of firms to cluster or disperse and the number of firms involved in a market. The optimum location is determined by an oligopolistic competition game model. It is accepted that a comprehensive location model should incorporate determining factors from both the supply and the demand side. In an imperfectly competitive situation, such a model does not necessarily lead to a minimum cost optimal location. However, production should be located in places where cost conditions are favourable, and transportation facilities make target markets easily accessible. Krugman (1991, 1993, 1996, 1998) established a general equilibrium model, i.e. the new economic geography model that assuming imperfect competition determines location patterns upon the interplay of both supply and demand factors. These factors may be stemming from the geography of a particular location, e.g. centre, periphery, distance from main markets, etc.; market comparative advantages such as production input cost, external economies, existence of production clusters, size and growth dynamics of local and neighbouring markets allowing the realisation of scale economies; and non market comparative advantages such as institutions, regulation, bureaucracy, labour education, training and skills, existence of knowledge centres, etc. There is sufficient empirical evidence supporting the relative stronger importance of agglomeration economies as a factor affecting location choices of FDI (e.g. Levinson, 1996; Coughlin and Segev, 2000; Barrios et al., 2002; Campos and Kinoshita, 2003; Disdier and Mayer, 2004; Pusterla and Resmini, 2005), while geography, for instance host location distance from the FDI source country, also plays a role (Martin and Velăzquez, 2000). Firms tend to locate production plants in areas where there is some concentration of production of the same and/or complementary sectors, in order to take advantage of production inputs both tangible and intangible, e.g. intermediate goods, production services, labour skills, technological spillovers, marketing networks, infrastructure, etc. Spatial concentration reaches an equilibrium determined by the intersection of agglomeration benefits and congestion costs. The latter arise from pollution, increasing traffic jams and commuting costs due to infrastructure exhaustion and rising input prices, e.g. land, labour, etc., due to supply shortages and bottlenecks.",2

Their independence from the UK came as late as 1971. At that time, Qatar and the UAE were very underdeveloped, but by 2011 they respectively rank as the 6th and 26th richest economies in the world (World Bank WDI). The two countries are highly dependent on hydrocarbons with oil and gas as percentage of export earnings reaching 91 and 69 % in Qatar and the UAE, respectively, (Hvidt 2013). Moreover, the pattern of development chosen by both countries is also similar. They are highly dependent on expatriate workers—comprising 88 and 91 % of the total workforce of Qatar and the UAE. Both countries also use public employment as a part of the welfare state package for their national populations (Qataris and Emiratis, respectively). Not surprisingly, the large majority of nationals choose to work for the public sector where wages are sometimes “several factors higher than those elsewhere” (Forstenlechner and Rutledge 2010, page 48). Indeed, the number of nationals working for the private sector as of 2014 was 1 and 0.5 % in Qatar and the UAE (De Bel-Air 2014; Arabian Business 2014). However, both countries have become aware that the capacity of the public sector to absorb nationals has been largely exhausted. Consequently, localization programs, called Emiratization and Qatarization, respectively, are being implemented. These programs provide incentives for the private sector to absorb higher proportions of the national labor force growth. Lastly, and as stated in the Qatar Vision 2030 and the UAE Vision 2021, both countries share the ambition to diversify their production systems away from oil and to become knowledge-based economies as well as leading regional/global players. Knowledge and innovation have always played a crucial role in production and society in general. However, with the technological revolution and globalization process of the last few decades, societies are entering a new postindustrial era, where knowledge and its rapid change has clearly become a key driver of competitiveness and social interaction. In this new scenario, the role of manufacturing has been diminished to give space to a growing service sector with particular strength in the information and communication technologies. For 10 years, from 1995 to 2005, Brinkley and Lee (2007) reported that knowledge-based sectors created twice as many new jobs in the USA and four times as many in Europe as low-knowledge sectors did. In the same vein, in most economically advanced countries, investments in intangibles are now as important as investments in tangibles goods. In 2005–2006, the investment in intangibles was estimated to be almost half the size of tangible investment in the market sector of the Australian economy (Barnes and McClure 2009). For the year 2005, the Finnish business intangible investments were estimated to be 9 % of the GDP (Jalava et al. 2007). For the USA, during the period 1995–2003, “the inclusion of intangible investment in the real output of the non-farm business sector increases the estimated growth rate of output per hour by 10–20 % relative to the baseline case which completely ignores intangibles” (Corrado et al. 2009, page 682). Many definitions of a knowledge-based economy are available and the World Bank (2007) suggests the following one (page 14): [The] knowledge economy … meaning is broader than that of high technology or the new economy, which are closely linked to the Internet, and even broader than the often-used information society. Its foundations are the creation, dissemination, and use of knowledge. A knowledge economy is one in which knowledge assets are deliberately accorded more importance than capital and labor assets, and where the quantity and sophistication of the knowledge pervading economic and societal activities reaches very high levels. This same source considers four pillars for a knowledge-based economy, which are the main framework that guides analysis in the current paper, i.e., (1) information and communication technology (ICT); (2) education; (3) innovation; and (4) economy and regime. For each of these pillars, this paper assesses the performance of Qatar and the UAE through a comparison against a group of benchmark countries. Given Qatar and the UAE’s stated high ambitions, it does not make sense to benchmark them against very low performing countries. Similarly, little can be learned by comparing them against long established and highly developed economies. Thus, the approach adopted here is to benchmark them against a few relatively similar countries, which allow a better focus on country specificities as well as interesting anecdotal contrasts. Currently, the position of Qatar and the UAE as knowledge economies in relation to other comparable countries is largely unknown. Even though a few previous assessments are available, they typically benchmark among the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC) or a sub-group of Arab countries and mainly focus on education or labor market regimes (e.g., Muysken and Nour 2006; Karoly 2010; Lightfoot 2011). We differentiate from these studies by benchmarking against a larger but still comparable group of countries in relation to four pillars considered to be crucial in the development of a knowledge-based economy. In particular, we benchmark Qatar and the UAE against 17 countries, i.e., Australia, Bahrain, Chile, Costa Rica, Finland, Israel, Kuwait, Malaysia, Norway, Oman, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Tunisia, and Turkey. In addition, the very much distinctive labor market conditions in Qatar and the UAE clearly affect each of the four pillars and so deserve special consideration. As already mentioned, these conditions are a large dependency on expatriate workers; a large majority of national choosing to work for the substantially better paid public sector’s jobs; and the provision of incentives for the private sector to absorb higher proportions of the national labor force growth (through the Emiratization and Qatarization programs). The final section will be devoted to discuss the implications that these issues have on the education and mainly the innovation pillars. The following section discusses the methodology and the choice of the benchmark countries. It is followed by four sections that respectively assess the performance of Qatar and the UAE in terms of each of the four pillars, which is done through a comparison against the performance of 17 benchmark countries. “The Role of the Labor Market Conditions” section discusses the impact of the current labor market conditions on both countries’ knowledge potential. “Result and Discussion of Current and Alternative Policies” section summarizes the main results and assesses current and alternative policies. “Conclusion” section concludes and offers policy recommendations.",44

The history of economy indicates this reality that in addition to different points of view among economists about income distribution, this issue has always been highlighted. Vast experiences and literature in growth and development emphasize this reality that any long-term action in economic growth and development is subject to the consideration of distribution policies such as fair distribution of income in a society (Dahmarde et al. 2009). The problem in income inequality is often regarded under fair social issues and poverty, and this case has made short-term solutions to be advised for dealing with this problem while the performance of short-term policies and without identification of effective factors has caused undesirable impacts on income distribution and economic growth. On the other hand, economic growth is not merely influenced by physical factors of production such as physical capital and labor forces, but also, it depends on other factors such as the productivity of production factors, and this productivity is influenced by several factors such as knowledge. Phenomenon such as development in information technology and globalization have made new economic structures, in developed countries, which are called new network economy or knowledge-based economy after primary economy, agriculture, and industry receive attention. High efficiency of this new structure on reducing the gap within growth and development in developing countries especially the Islamic countries as well as reducing the gap within societies has attracted mentioned countries’ attention to this issue; the product of which in the last decades have been rapid economic growth and increasing the per capita income without relying on natural resources and reduction of income inequality in these countries. In knowledge-based economy, knowledge is the main driver of growth, making money, employment, and reduction of inequality in all activities. According to this definition, knowledge economy is not limited to the number of industries based on developed technology, but in this type of economy, all economic activities even mining and agriculture are to some extent relying on knowledge. Also, required knowledge for constructing a knowledge-based economy is not merely a technological one. It includes cultural, social, and management knowledge (Shabani and Abdolmaleki 2012) Since 1980, the topic of income distribution and analysis of distributive policies works applied on increasing the economic growth has become important in scientific settings as well as policy-makings. Therefore, the achievement of an acceptable level in income distribution, estimation of developing policies in distribution field, finding people’s position and welfare, and at last, planning for the promotion of social justice all depends on current situation of income distribution in society and people’s position in different income groups (Dahmarde et al. 2009). This case is not possible unless proper studies relating to income distribution and identification of effective factors on it are done. In case of identifying the effective factors on income inequality, it becomes possible to achieve social justice and sustainable development. In other words, the present era is the era of knowledge-based industries and on this basis the richest country is a country having the ability to produce more knowledge. Thus, those countries are successful that are able to pass the way of production and distribution of knowledge faster (Shahabadi and Sari-Gol 2013). According to the cases mentioned about the importance of the topic, the present study investigates the role of knowledge economy components on income inequality in a selection of the Islamic countries during 1995–2012. To this end, in the second part, first, the literature is introduced and then some empirical studies conducted in this area are provided. The third part deals with the models and methodology. Fourth part discusses the model tests and analysis of results, and fifth part regards conclusions and policy recommendations.",13
8.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,10 November 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-016-0417-1,The Role of Knowledge Economy in African Business,December 2017,Vanessa Simen Tchamyou,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Over the past two decades, the economies of leading countries have increasingly evolved toward knowledge-based economies, relying less on traditional resources such as labor and capital for economic prosperity and wealth creation (Dahlman 2007; Chavula 2010; Chandra and Yokoyama 2011; Asongu 2015a). It is widely acknowledged that the creation of new knowledge, innovation, and technological changes drive prosperity in these countries. Accordingly, economic incentives based on new knowledge stimulate economic growth, improve the ladder of employment opportunities, provide higher wages, and ultimately enhance the country’s competitiveness within the global environment. The appealing economic trends prevalent in many developed countries strongly depend on investments in new technology, high skilled labor, and high-technology industries. These are essential ingredients for the development of a knowledge-based economy (African Development Bank 2007). Whereas innovation has been substantially identified as a driver of economic prosperity and productivity in the developed world, the capacity to innovate remains relatively low in most African countries (Anyanwu 2012). The globalization of technology, however, presents new opportunities for development in developing countries if governments can transform political will into adequate economic policies needed for the building of knowledge-based economies (African Development Bank 2007). Moreover, in order for developing countries to build their potential as knowledge economies, substantial investments in human capital, high skilled labor force, and infrastructure for high-technology industries are imperative. In essence, the fostering of scientific technological collaborations and networks with developed countries is also required to enhance the competitiveness and international trade goals of corporations in developing countries (Lee and Kim 2009; Suh and Chen 2007). In light of the above, a recent stream of African-related studies have been consistent on the relevance of knowledge economy (KE) on the continent (African Development Bank 2007; Amavilah 2009; Andrés and Asongu 2013a, b; Nyarko 2013a; Andrés et al. 2015; Asongu 2015b; Asongu and Tchamyou 2016). These include among others general discussions on KE (Rooney 2005; Lin 2006; Anyanwu 2012), innovation (Carisle et al. 2013), information and communication technologies (Butcher 2011; Asongu and Nwachukwu 2016a, b), education (Ford 2007; Weber 2011), institutional regime and economic incentives (Cogburn 2003; Letiche 2006), indigenous knowledge systems (Raseroka 2008; Lwoga et al. 2010), research and development (German and Stroud 2007; Sumberg 2005), intellectual capital and economic development (Wagiciengo and Belal 2012; Preece 2013), intellectual property rights (Zerbe 2005; Lor and Britz 2005; Myburgh 2011; Andrés and Asongu 2013a, b; Andrés et al. 2015; Asongu 2013a), KE in space transformation (Moodley 2003; Maswera et al. 2008), and spatiality in the production of knowledge (Bidwell et al. 2011; Neimark 2012). The above stream of narratives is consistent with the need for more scholarly research on factors encouraging KE in Africa. South Korea relied on KE in the doing of business to achieve its spectacular development (Suh and Chen 2007). As far as we have reviewed, there is yet no study that has investigated the relevance of KE in African business. Against this background, it is relevant to position an inquiry on the relevance of KE in African business for the following reasons. First, since Africa is increasingly nursing ambitions of KE projects,Footnote 1 understanding the relevance of these projects in the doing of business in the continent would provide policy makers with the much needed guidance. This point is even more crucial due to failed post-independence industrialization-based measures and thwarted structural adjustment policies of liberalization and privatization (Rolfe and Woodward 2004) that have not substantially boosted African business (especially intraregional trade). Second, knowledge-based African business growth holds high potential for the improvement of existing agricultural economies and development of value-added technology-based services essential for economic prosperity, competitiveness, and adaptation to the challenges of globalization.Footnote 2
 Third, KE potentially holds the promise of lifting the continent out of poverty through the much needed investment opportunities and employment possibilities (to tackle soaring demographic change). While there are growing challenges in African business (Leke et al. 2010; Ernst and Young 2013), the transition from product-based economies to a KE typically involves measures such as long-run investment in education, modernizing the information infrastructure, innovation capability, and nurturing an economic environment that is conducive for market transactions. In light of the above, this paper aims to assess how KE affects African business dynamics, notably: starting business, doing business, and ending business. We employ panel instrumental variable fixed effects to account for the unobserved heterogeneity among sampled countries and issues of potential endogeneity. Concerns of information redundancy in the KE dimensions are mitigated by using principal components analysis. But for some exceptions, the findings broadly show that KE drives the starting and doing of business in Africa. The investigation is original in its contribution at the same time to the scarce literature on African KE and the growing challenges of improving the business climate of the continent by means of KE. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The second section presents the conceptual framework which embodies stylized facts and theoretical highlights. The literature review of KE and African business is covered in the third section. The methodology and data are presented in the fourth section. The empirical analysis is covered in fifth section. The last section contains the conclusion.",293

South Africa facilitated through its regional leadership and it has recently entered to the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, China) cooperation mechanism, reflecting its growing international influence and transforming nature of global governance. In the past few decades, some large economies such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) have acquired a vital role in the world economy as producers of goods and services, as receivers of capital and as potential consumer markets. The BRICS economies have been identified as some of the fastest-growing countries and the engines of the global recovery process, which shows the changed role of these economies. Even in the G-20 countries’ forum, BRICS are playing a tremendous role in shaping macroeconomic policy. We see these five countries encompass over 40% of the world’s population and account for nearly 25% of total global GDP in terms of PPP. If one compares the GDP in PPP terms, four economies figure among the top ten, with China, India, Russia, Brazil and South Africa in 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th and 26th places, respectively (Table 1). In terms of contribution to growth of PPP-adjusted global GDP of the world, these five economies accounted for 55% during 2000–2008, and their contribution is expected to rise in the coming years. The BRICS comprise a huge land share of the world and, as a result, own vast natural resources. China, which has a land area of about 9.6 million km2, is the third-largest country in land size, after only Russia and Canada. Russia accounts for around 20% of the world’s oil and gas reserves, while China has about 12% of the world’s mineral resources. In terms of agricultural land, Russia has 121.5 million ha of arable land. Brazil covers 47% of South America and is the fifth largest country in the world (8.5 million km2), surpassed only by Russia, Canada, China and the USA. Each of the BRICS countries has multiple and different attributes, and thus, each has a huge potential to develop. Brazil is extremely rich in resources such as coffee, soybeans, sugar cane, iron ore and crude oil, with around 60 million ha of arable land (just 7% of its land area) but with an agricultural area of 31.2% of the total land area. Russia is noted for its massive deposits of oil, natural gas and minerals. India is a strong service provider with a rising manufacturing base, while China is seen as the manufacturing workshop of the world with a highly skilled workforce and relatively low wage costs. South Africa is the 26th largest economy in the world, with a GDP of US$ 357 billion. It is a medium-sized country with a total land area of slightly more than 1.2 million km2 and around 12% arable land area. It is the world’s largest producer of platinum and chromium and holds the world’s largest known reserves of manganese, platinum group metals, chromium, vanadium and alumino-silicates. South Africa generates 45% of Africa’s electricity and the South African power supplier provides the 4th cheapest electricity in the world. In recent years, many African economies have been growing rapidly, stimulating talk of a new era of ‘Africa rising’, yet the continent still predominantly relies on natural resources for its income. How can Africa catch up in the new global knowledge economy, while ensuring that the poorest on the continent are not left behind?",9

Matevosyan,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Claude Henri de Rouvroy Saint-Simon (1760–1825), also known as Comte de Saint-Simon, was a French utopian socialist whose theory influenced the foundations of the nineteenth century sociology with inclusions of technological optimism, metaphysics of morale, and political morality. As a born aristocrat, Saint-Simon converted to meritocracy, advocating technocracy where the economy was managed by industrialists and technical masters whose leaderships were based on technical merits (Ionescu 1976; Durkheim 2009) and not on the market polls. Saint-Simon was determined that the technocracy would lead to a national community of cooperation and that the organizational change might be navigated by those who were neither entitled nor elected but were fitted to do so (Frank 1962). Saint-Simon devoted himself in founding the school of scientific improvement (McWilliam 1993). His treatises L’Industrie (1817) and L’Organisateur (1819) were well regarded by the French aristocrats Pierre Duard, Auguste Comte, and Georges Sorel (Manuel 1956). Comte’s followers, Saint-Simonians, foresaw that industry would be more concentrated in great syndicates and that the state as an organ of social centralization would intervene in intensifying tally. They had intuition of what we now call trusts and deals (for non-profit and profit settings, correspondingly) (Goyau 2014). The term technocracy is rooted on Greek tekhne (skill) and kratos (power). It denotes a system where those who have knowledge, expertise, or skills compose the governing body. In technocratic government, the best technical experts are in control of decision-making in their respective fields and are selected based upon how highly knowledgeable they are. An American economist Thorstein Veblen (1891) was the early advocate of technocracy and was involved in technical alliance—in line with Howard Scott (1894) and M. King Hubbert (Cleveland 2006). Veblen too, saw socialism as an intermediate phase in organizational progress of society that would be brought about by the natural decay of the solely market-based business enterprise system by the inventiveness of engineers or scientific minds. A view that pervades the modern attitudes yet gets little explicit attention; the technological optimism as a theory of politics was figured prominently in the early 1970s in an important debate about nothing less than the future of our planet, and it won (Krier 1985). Today, critical discussion of the optimistic viewpoint is largely passé. However, shall we give up with the idea of technocratic optimism? Can we apply this concept in measuring the healthcare efficiency?",

In this respect, several researches were focused on the requirements of financial and legal perenniality, by neglecting the requirements of effective governance. To this end, the governance became, since the beginning of the 1990s, a pressing need to solve the problems of social and economic development of a country. This is why we will try in this research to identify the influence of the mechanism on the minimization of risk of insolvency of an institution of microfinance, to analyze the concept of the governance in the sector of the microfinance, and to prepare a broader search for its mechanisms being able to make a success of a project of good a governance (Zouhayer and Anis 2013). More particularly, we seek to explain how the corporate governance in associations of microcredit affects the rate of refunding of micro-borrowers (Hartarska and Mersland 2012; Galema et al. 2012a). In this respect, the central question that we will approach in this study is: Which are the explanatory factors related to corporate governance in microfinance that influence the rate of refunding within Tunisian associations of microcredit? From this same question, it will raise one other axial question: Is there a mediating effect of management information between the mechanisms of governance and the lack of reimbursement? In fact, corporate governance was frequently integrated in the researches such as the role of the board of directors, the regulation, fascinating transparency, and parts of the system of governance. In this respect, the analysis of the board of directors (BD) was circumvented around the choice of its optimal size, its composition, and the distribution of the capacity between the general manager and the BD (Mersland and Strøm 2012). To study these variables, which affect the rate of refunding, this paper is organized around four principal paragraphs. Initially, we will expose our conceptual model, and thus, we will try to raise the principal corporate governance leading to the financial performance concretized by a minimization of the risk of insolvency. Then, we discuss the method adopted to treat our questions of research. In the third part, we will discuss the principal results of this study. Lastly, the last paragraph will be devoted to the conclusions and the implications of the study.",

Firstly, the increasing relevance of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has led to the restructuring of knowledge-based processes in the organization of information (Laursen and Meliciani 2010; Papaconstantinou et al. 1998). In this development, the generation and diffusion of knowledge has become essential to modern economies (Cooke and Leydesdorff 2006; Lundvall 1992). Secondly, growing competitive pressure has substantially increased the quantitative and qualitative relevance of the service industry. Therefore, service innovations increasingly affect business processes and the growth dynamics of manufacturing and service sectors (Evangelista et al. 2013; Gallouj and Savona 2009; Millar and Choi 2011; Sakata et al. 2013). In this development, organizations serving as innovation intermediaries have a pivotal role (Howells 2006), particularly those providing research based-knowledge, such as universities, research institutes (Pinto et al. 2012; Tether and Tajar 2008), and knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS)Footnote 1 (Strambach 2008). The relevance of KIBS has been emphasized with regard to their positive effects on regional innovation systems (RIS) (Cooke 1992; Doloreux 2002), serving as innovative intermediaries with particular relevance for small- and medium-sized enterprisesFootnote 2 (SMEs) (Muller and Zenker 2001). Consequently, a large number of studies have provided detailed results regarding KIBS’ specific capabilities and their impact on RIS (Muller and Doloreux 2009), following a supply-side perspective in investigating KIBS’ economic functions, their mechanisms of adding value and modes of interaction with client firms (Miles and Boden 1998; Muller 2001). While this particular focus has substantially furthered our understanding of innovation intermediaries in RIS, we suggest a demand-side approach investigating KIBS’ impact on client firms to identify factors potentially complicating KIBS-client interactions and thus hindering the efficient transmission of innovations. Rather than focusing on the cases of successful cooperation with clear innovation effects, an investigation of client firms’ incentives, motives, and experiences in cooperating with KIBS can help to better understand reasons for success or failure of innovative cooperation within RIS. Drawing on firms’ issues in cooperating with KIBS thus enables the derivation of policy implications for the crafting of regional innovation systems that foster innovative cooperation between KIBS and firms. In this paper, we present a qualitative approach using in-depth interviews that focus on the demand for KIBS by client firms and their innovative impact within a specific RIS. We use a sample of 19 SMEs that have had business relations with KIBS and investigate their motivation for the cooperation ex ante, obstacles during the cooperation, and the impact of their cooperation ex post. Three case studies highlighting different patterns of cooperation are presented. The results of our investigation are used to derive policy implications for peripheral RIS. We find that the decision processes leading to KIBS–SME cooperation are driven by a strong uncertainty about the potential outcomes. A general risk aversion or cost concerns hold little relevance to firms; rather, the trustworthiness and reliability of the cooperation partner is the primary concern. In all stages of the cooperation, firms perceive substantial information asymmetries, which limit cooperation ex ante as SMEs face uncertainty about the expected return of cooperation. Interestingly, this uncertainty exceeds the cooperation itself as firms are—ex post—regularly unclear about the gains of using KIBS. This yields the interpretation that the demand-side perspective for SMEs should be interpreted as a credence good situation, which tends to limit innovative cooperation. The lack or ineffectiveness of formal networks leads firms to resort to informal networks to reduce information barriers: while these reduce search costs, they tend to foster the diffusion of previous negative experiences and skepticism towards KIBS, thus precluding potential cooperation. The problems of credence goods and informal networks highlight the relevance of regional policy to systematically support cooperation structures and build trust between firms and KIBS to foster innovative cooperation. We suggest that formal network structures established, controlled, and disseminated by regional public institutions, such as chambers of craft and commerce could best serve as a neutral intermediary fostering cooperation and disseminating information on specific KIBS. Their impartial role could succeed in gaining mutual trust between the actors and reduce the impact of negatively biased stereotypes of KIBS in informal SME networks. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the relevant literature. Section 3 introduces our methodology, and Section 4 presents the results and case studies. The results are discussed and linked to regional policy in Section 5, before Section 6 concludes.",6

This paper focuses on craft firms because they have contributed to the creation of a strong image of Italy in the world and encouraged the development of industrial districts and small firms in the country over the past decades (Schillaci et al. 2013). Currently, they are facing difficulties triggered by the persistence of the economic-financial crisis, which has caused ongoing, uncertain, dynamic, and hard-to-interpret scenarios since 2008. Further complications include the gradual shifting of the economy toward service industries, technological progress, information and communication technologies (ICT), and expanded global competition, as well as customers aimed at looking customization, higher quality products, value creation, and living experiences (Pine and Gilmore 1999). This situation became particularly critical for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) such as craft firms because of their typical traits that make them vulnerable or, in some cases, even resistant to face these changes more than large companies that hold most entrepreneurial, managerial, and financial skills. Generally, SMEs are constrained by factors (Cioppi et al. 2014) such as (a) reduced availability of financial resources and, during the moments of crisis, even difficulty in obtaining credit (Pal et al. 2014), (b) reduced economies of scale, (c) limited marketplaces, (d) concentrated demand (Papaoikonomou et al. 2012), and (e) low levels of professionalism, especially in critical areas such as marketing (Hin et al. 2013; Palacios-Marqués et al. 2015). In addition, some craft firms are still attached to the characteristics of the traditional handicraft model (Brusco 1989), which includes the following aspects: (a) to propose products to a local market, (b) to use simple and multipurpose machinery, (c) to rely on low levels of school education and specialization, (d) to acquire professionalism through years of apprenticeship with another artisan, (e) to develop relationships between firms by means of imperfect competition, and (f) to develop relationships with customers through mutual trust and knowledge. In order to overcome these difficulties connected to economic, technological, social, and cultural changes, craft entrepreneurs should modernize themselves by offering technologically innovative and highly customized products in national and international marketplaces (Micelli 2011). In other words, they have to review the ways in which they provide value to customers in the knowledge economy era (Rullani 2004). On the basis of these considerations, the following research question is posed: How can craft firms face these ongoing changes in order to remain competitive in the future? Digital manufacturing research has only responded to this question from an engineering and design perspective, whereas management scholars have neglected this topic, though it has been discussed by the national trade press. Therefore, by means of a qualitative explorative study, this paper aims to analyze the strategic directions undertaken by some Italian craft firms in facing these changes in their environment. The paper proceeds as follows. We outline the relationship between SMEs, especially craft firms, and digital manufacturing, open innovation, and servitization and propose some significant contributions from these research streams. After explaining the research method used, we describe the development of craft firms in Italy and outline their importance for national growth. Next, we highlight how some Italian craft firms have integrated digital technologies in their design and production processes and adopted open innovation and servitization logic. These results are analyzed and discussed from the perspective of management. Finally, we conclude with the limitations of the study and directions for future research.",48

This is enough to highlight the increasing academic interest for this topic. Open innovation has emerged as a new approach of innovation management founded on the assumption that innovative ideas can be sourced also from the outside; then, companies need to look outside for new paths to innovation (Chesbrough 2003; Gassmann et al. 2010). The open business perspective proposed by Chesbrough (2003, 2007) states that open systems are today more successful than the closed ones (Gay, 2014). While traditional closed systems recommend to raise barriers to the external environment to generate innovations through internal research and development and to acquire defensible positions against the competitors, nowadays, in many industries, companies have understood the opportunity of incorporating new ideas from the outside in order to complement their own competencies (Carayannis et al. 2014). In effect, in open markets, companies operate in turbulent and hyper-competitive industry conditions that force them to continuously innovate; market dynamics erode the acquired competitive positions and companies need to reconsider their customer value creation strategies (Martens et al. 2012). Market-driven management has been recognized by many academics (Day 1994, 1999; Narver and Slater 1990; Kohli and Jaworski 1990; Webster 2002; Best 2009; Lambin 2000) and practitioners as one of the best strategic approaches for competing in global markets; its main purpose is exactly to create a superior customer value in direct and continuous confrontation with competitors (Brondoni 2012). To reach this purpose, market-driven companies are involved in continual processes of innovation that can lead to a higher perceived customer value. They develop market strategies by monitoring and anticipating the environmental trends’ evolution and by collecting information about the expectations of all market participants (Lambin 2000). Since the growth (Gupta et al. 2013) of market-oriented companies is strictly related to their ability of innovating value propositions for current and potential customers, the purpose of this article is to highlight the relationship existing between market orientation and open innovation from a theoretical perspective in order to verify if market orientation can be considered as an antecedent of open innovation. In fact, despite the rapid growth of academic papers about open innovation in innovation management field, few studies have to date investigated the existing theoretical linkage; the present study attempts to fill this gap. The paper is structured as follows: after the introduction, the theoretical background about open innovation and market-driven management is provided as presented in the academic managerial literature; the proposed relationship existing between market-driven management and open innovation is discussed, some business case studies are reported and, then, conclusions with managerial implications are drawn in the final section.",7

Rather than using exclusively internal research and development (R&D) to support innovation processes, and devoting internal R&D outcomes exclusively to their own innovation efforts in accordance with the vertically integrated innovation paradigm, the open innovation paradigm postulates the use of both external knowledge from within to support innovation, and internal knowledge from outside to capitalize on innovations (Schroll and Mild 2011; Frankenberger et al. 2014). What is known as outbound innovation implies the selling and revealing of innovations and ideas outside the firm’s boundaries, whereas what is known as inbound innovation entails acquiring and sourcing of innovations and ideas from outside the organizational limits (Dahlander and Gann 2010). Existing studies on open innovation have assumed a model of the firm according to which decision-making, as regards innovation, is centralized and firm boundaries are well-defined, as in the case of single-business firms. However, multi-business firms deviate markedly from this model (Herzog and Leker 2010). On the one hand, strategic decision-making is divided between the corporate office and the business units in diversified firms, which may lead to a divergence of interests as regards inbound and outbound innovation activities and the differentiated impact of those decisions on corporate and business unit levels. On the other hand, a business unit’s boundaries include the internal network, which is composed of sister business units and the corporate office, in addition to the widely-studied external network beyond the firm boundaries, which signifies the possibility of trade-offs between the internal and external networks. Only two studies have dealt with open innovation in diversified firms (Cesaroni 2004; Lichtenthaler 2010), neither of which have adopted a business unit level perspective to address the issue of how business units engage in traditional (external) open innovation activities when they may also rely on internal network innovations. The objective of this study is therefore to shed light on the unexplored issue of business units’ involvement in open innovation and its effect on business units’ innovation performance, thereby analysing whether there are subtleties involved in being a multi-business firm in the open innovation-innovation performance relationship. It is argued that business units are embedded in internal exchange networks which involve innovation-related knowledge inflows and outflows in similar manner as they are connected to external networks for inbound and outbound innovation. The common feature in internal (intra-network) and external exchanges is, therefore, that a knowledge flow takes place, whether it is a knowledge transfer within the organization’s boundaries or an external knowledge transfer across the firm’s limits. It is postulated that the locus in which the innovation-related knowledge transfer is carried out matters for business unit’s innovation performance. This study specifically hypothesizes that external inbound innovation is more beneficial than internal inbound innovation, whereas external outbound innovation is less beneficial than internal outbound innovation. The results derived from a sample of 227 business units from top Spain-based diversified firms confirm the role that internal networks have played in business units’ innovation efforts and support the fact that business units should look outside the firm’s limits for inbound innovation and inside organization boundaries for outbound innovation if they are to strength innovation performance.",15

In addition, KIBS are key players in innovation systems, particularly in advanced regions where manufacturing competitiveness largely depends on knowledge contents provided by highly specialised suppliers. Over the last 20 years, authors (e.g. Abecassis-Moedas et al. 2012; Muller and Doloreux 2009; Simmie and Strambach 2006) have focused their research on understanding the potential implications of KIBS on innovation processes and on the competitiveness of both firms and economies. Pina and Tether (2016) argue that KIBS are increasingly recognised as among the most dynamic sectors of advanced economies, not only achieving high rates of innovation but also helping their clients to innovate. According to other authors (e.g. den Hertog 2000; Santos and Spring 2015), when focusing on the role of KIBS services in client innovation, KIBS are seen to function as facilitators, carriers or sources of innovation and, through their almost symbiotic relationship with client firms, some KIBS function as co-producers of innovation, not only through the cooperation with their clients but also with higher education institutions (HEI) and other organisations. Often KIBS act as transmitters of knowledge, contributing in different ways to the innovation processes of related firms (Haukness 1998; Miles et al. 1995). In addition, some recent papers have shown the relevance of these firms in the process of entering new foreign markets (Di Maria et al. 2012; Doloreux and Laperriere, 2014). At the same time, innovation has played an important role in internationalisation (Rodriguez and Nieto 2012; Rodriguez and Nieto 2010) and it is, often, the channel for firms to increase productivity (Altomonte et al. 2013). While a growing amount of research emphasises internationalisation, little academic research focuses on its consequences on innovation strategies and activities (Doloreux and Laperriere 2014; Marques et al. 2016; Marques et al. forthcoming). The value of the present study lies in a better understanding of the association between distinct strategies of internationalisation, management knowledge, cooperation and innovation in KIBS firms. In the present research, we aim to explore the effects of knowledge, cooperation and innovation on internationalisation, sending questionnaires to CEOs of Portuguese KIBS firms. In addition, we aim to contribute to management practices by offering firms a deeper knowledge of forms to increase competitiveness, particularly in relation to both KIBS and business clients from any activity sector, and to provide some suggestions and improvements for national adjustment policies. This study used a quantitative approach, based on a sample extracted from the Survey of the Scientific and Technological Potential, with KIBS activity in 2014/2015. Upon completion of the data collection, systematisation of data was done through the use of factor analysis and multiple linear regression that allowed for conclusions to be drawn about the goals we proposed to achieve. This paper is structured as follows: The next section examines theories supporting the hypotheses that involve the possible relationships between internationalisation, knowledge, cooperation and innovation. After discussing some methodological considerations, the results are presented, and the chapter concludes with a reflection on the study’s most important limitations and implications for management practice, as well as suggestions for future avenues of research.",10

The usually recognized understanding of how a “knowledge economy” works consists in using accumulation of “knowledge capital” as a novel development dynamic (Benneworth and Charles 2005; Velmurugan 2010), by growing returns to scale, and the prospective for knowledge spillover and clustering (Longhi 1999; Parcero and Ryan 2016). These elements are critical since new technologies have generated innovative market chances, but at the same time significantly increasing the impact of competition (Porter 1998). It is to note that the creation, acquisition, absorption, imitation, and diffusion of knowledge are perceived as the central feature of up-to-date competitive forces as well in the raising innovation (Sorenson and Baum 2003; Santoro and Chakrabarti 2002). From this point of view, it arises that some location capabilities reinforce the socio-economic performance more than others, chiefly in promoting entrepreneurial initiatives (Audretsch et al. 2006; 2012). The regional knowledge creation is the dominant economic explanation of regional competitiveness (Pakes and Griliches 1984; Sum and Jessop 2013). The Triple Helix model remarks the critical function of innovation and entrepreneurship for regional growth and competitiveness (Farinha and Ferreira 2012; Farinha et al. 2016; Smith and Bagchi-Sen 2012). Indeed, the interaction of entrepreneurship and economic geography are receiving increasing interest by academia and practice, highlighting the prominence of the dissemination of endogenous prospective of regions, working as knowledge/technology spillovers (Backman and Lööf 2015), which potentially affect their degree of competitiveness in the international/global economy (Camagni and Capello 2013). At integration of the Triple Helix, it is to consider the Quadruple Helix innovation model, which brings the views of the media-based, the public culture-based, and that of civil society. In addition, the Quintuple Helix remarks the critical role of natural environments of society, basic elements for the knowledge creation and innovation (Carayannis and Campbell 2011; Carayannis and Rakhmatullin 2014). In this context, the university function becomes more effective and critical in the development and exploitation of innovation in the current knowledge-based economy (Cesaroni and Piccaluga 2015; Etzkowitz 2010). The on-going improvement of the academia as creators of chances for new forms of entrepreneurship—the so-called entrepreneurial university—has transformed the socio-economic functions of universities in several context (Lazzeroni and Piccaluga 2015; Kalar and Antoncic 2015). Without a doubt, the increased importance of the influence of university on the socio-economic system is observed within the regional entrepreneurial context (Aldrich, 2012). In this line, universities are called to be more entrepreneurial with the purpose to stay competitive and innovative in the link among academic world and industry (Kirby et al. 2011; Carayannis et al. 2015). In view of this, the commercialization and diffusion of knowledge technology, developed in academia, have increased the attention of policy makers as strategic and key components, supporting and fostering the regional socio-economic development and competitiveness (Iacobucci and Micozzi 2014). Therefore, the entrepreneurial university may have an effective and active role in partially determining the competitive advantage of regions. In this paper, we explore this issue in one specific—and growing acknowledged—university entrepreneurial mechanism, namely the university spin-offs (USOs), which are new companies created with the aim to exploit commercially the knowledge and technology developed within a university (Rodríguez-Gulías et al. 2015; Carayannis et al. 1998; Del Giudice et al. 2013a, b). USOs are potential and active ways to stimulate the growth of knowledge economies in different national and regional context (Sternberg 2014; Campbell and Carayannis 2016a, b). They also constitute a growing pressure on universities to embrace a more proactive involvement in the socio-economic growth and competitiveness of the regions (Pirnay and Surlemont 2003). However, in spite of the relevance of these arguments, the same are not fully investigated in the literature, leaving some relevant knowledge gap. Indeed, up to now, there are no studies that are directly focused in exploring the impact of USOs’ activity and outcomes on the competitive advantage of regions. In this paper, we want to fill this gap by exploring the issue of whether USOs partially determine the competitive advantage of regions. This paper partially expands the work started with Iacobucci and Micozzi (2015), which analyzed the direct and indirect impacts of academic spin-offs on the local context in Italy, to the role of USOs’ activity in contributing to the degree of competitiveness of the local context at regional level. Further, since the spin-off phenomenon in several European regions is expected to differ from that in more advanced high-tech contexts (Smith and Ho 2006), this call is to improve the assess of USOs’ contribution to local economies in European regions, bearing in mind that their effects differ considerably if the changes in the regional environments get considered. This paper aims to add new knowledge and evidences in this regard. To this end, the paper analyses a longitudinal sample of 952 USOs located in 20 Italian administrative regions. Italy is one of the main European countries showing a fast growth of the spin-off phenomenon from university (Fini et al. 2011; Iacobucci et al. 2015). Indeed, according to the up-to-date Netval report (Netval 2015), at 31.12.2014, there are 1102 research spin-offs in Italy, and about 87.4% of them have been established over the past 10 years. The paper aims to provide a potential contribution to the knowledge—both from the theoretical and practical view —about the role of the entrepreneurial university in stimulating and contributing to the socio-economic value and competiveness of local contexts, with specific regard to the proactive role of the USOs. Furthermore, the paper wants to encourage proper policy planning and actions with the purpose to raise the regional development, contributing to the economic exploitation of innovation and fostering the competitiveness evolution of the territories.",5

Matevosyan,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Organ transplantation is an effective, often the ultimate, therapy for end-stage organ failure. Sensibly, organ shortage is a growing public health concern. In the USA, nearly 28,000 organ transplantations are performed per year—with 120,000 people on the waiting lists. The majority of the organ subscribers die before the donor organ becomes available. It is estimated that 35 % of all US deaths could be prevented, or at least delayed, by organ transplantation. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), organ transplants are currently achieving less than 10 % of the global demand (Shimazono 2007; WHO Report 2012). This shortage of an indigenous supply has led to development of the international organ trade or “transplantation tourism”—a term used in resolution - WHA 57.18 to describe the means and manners that contravene the regulatory frameworks and ordinance. Transplantation tourism is often arranged by the intermediaries and health-care providers who recruit donors and cover the travel costs. There are websites offering all-inclusive “transplant packages” (Shimazono 2007). Under the General Agreement of Trade in Service (GATS), governments may choose to trade health services to achieve their national health objectives. Health service exports, through the treatment of foreign patients entering their territory (classified as “mode 2”), are used by some countries as an instrument of economic development (Rizvi et al. 2009). However, this trade may result in inequitable allocation of deceased donor organs and also raises ethical concerns, especially when occurring in countries without developed regulatory frameworks to protect live organ donors from coercion, exploitation, and physical harm (WHO, WTO 2002). According to the Organs Watch—an organization based at University of California—major organ importing countries are Australia, Canada, Costa Rica, Israel, Japan, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and the USA (Scheper-Hughes 2008; Lin 2003). Commonly active organ exporting countries are India, Pakistan, China, Colombia, Bolivia, Brazil, Iraq, Israel, the Republic of Moldova, Peru, Iran, and Turkey. Most of the donor organs are alleged to have been procured from executed prisoners—a heavily criticized unethical practice. Lack of established rules about the organ market are widely reported (Minhua and Yingguang 2005; Tianjin 2005; Ghods and Nasrollahzadeh 2005). A compounding quandary, even the fortunate ones who timely receive an organ donation face challenges for the desired quality of life aftermath. A heightened frequency of medical complications are consistently reported, including transmissions of the HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses, and tuberculosis (Akpolat and Ozturk 1998; Frishberg et al. 1998; Colakoglu et al. 1998; Al-Wakeel et al. 2000; Morad and Lim 2000; Sever et al. 2001; Inston et al. 2005; Ivanovski et al. 2005; Kennedy et al. 2005; Kucuk et al. 2005). Many organ recipients embrace a path of lifetime immunosuppression to stave-off an organ rejection at the cost of lowering their overall immune defense. There are also risks associated with the preservation and transporting of the donor organ. Currently, there are two preservation approaches for most donor organs: static and dynamic. Simple static cold storage (SCS) is the main method of static storage, while hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP), normothermic machine perfusion (NPM), and oxygen persufflation are methods of dynamic preservation. Of these four, only SCS and HMP are clinically approved for kidneys, and only SCS is approved for the livers, lungs, pancreas, and heart. The remaining methods are in various stages of preclinical studies (Semenza 2000). The SCS relies on the effects of cooling alone, supplemented by the use of special preservation solutions buffering cellular and molecular changes (Strey et al. 2010). In contrast, the HMP depends on activating residual metabolism and energy generation needed for the oxygen supply for aerobic metabolism delivered by vascular perfusion (Lee and Mangino 2009). Both preservation modes are preceded by the donor procurement phase, where the access to required organs is surgically achieved by introducing chilled solutions in sufficient volumes into the major vascular channels to wash out the blood and achieve moderate cooling (10–15 °C) before final removal from the body. Per SCS, the organs are placed in fresh sterile solutions, double-bagged, and buried in melting ice in transport containers for dispatch to the recipient. The SCS is technically simpler and cheaper than the HMP (which in the USA costs about $3000) (McAnulty 2010; Edgardo et al. 2011). The costs of donor organs are high for any household. According to the Florida Hospital statistics, in the USA a heart transplant costs $550,000–$650,000 (Williams 2013). A lung transplant costs next to $200,000–$1,000,000, and a kidney transplant anywhere between $263,000–$500,000—depending on complications, multiple hospitalizations, critical care, or repeat surgeries. Medical costs include insurance deductibles, co-pays, pre-transplant evaluation and testing, surgery, recovery fees for the donor, follow-up care and testing, additional hospital stays for complications, fees for surgeons, physicians, radiologist, anesthesiologist and recurrent lab testing, anti-rejection and other drugs—which can easily exceed $2,500 per month, and the cost of rehabilitation. Non-medical costs include food, lodging and accommodation, long distance phone calls, transportation, air-tickets, child care, and lost wages. Table 1 presents the estimated US average charges per transplant in the year of 2014: States and federal government may fund the organ transplantation under Medicare and Medi-Cal. Pursuing Social Security Disability (SSAD) pre-approval is a good idea for seeking a full transplantation coverage under the Medicare. In the last decade, Medicare paid for post-transplant anti-rejection and immunosuppressive medications at 100 % for life of the organ-recipient. After the enactment of 2010’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Medicare remains available to retirees over age 65, to disabled people, and to those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). There are two parts of Medicare involved: part A (hospital insurance) and part B (medical insurance). The Medicare part A average deductible is $1156. If a patient is hospitalized several times through the year, this deductible must be paid each time, unless the patient is re-hospitalized within 60 days from a previous hospital discharge. Physician services, or Medicare part B, are covered at 80 % once a $140 annual deductible has been met. The patient is responsible for the 20 % of physician fees not covered by Medicare during a kidney or kidney/pancreas transplant hospitalization. These fees are approximately $4000. Medicare usually reimburses poorly on the anesthesiologist’s bill and there is often a patient responsibility of $400–$500. Medicare part D covers prescription medications, excluding the anti-rejection drugs. 
Medi-Cal or Medicaid is a state-funded health insurance program for low-income families or individuals. Services rendered to transplant recipients and donors are reimbursable only if the transplant recipient is eligible for Medicaid during the month of service. Proof of donor eligibility and authorization are required for major solid organ and bone marrow transplants. Treatment Authorization Requests (TAR), including those for readmissions related to complications, should be approved by the state Health and Human Services Department. For recipients younger than 21 years, or recipients who are eligible for the Genetically Handicapped Persons Program (GHPP), providers are required to submit a Service Authorization Request (SAR). Donor and transplant recipient services are billed on separate claims. Presently, only the liver, kidney, and lung transplants may require hospitalization of the donor and the recipient. Occasionally, when a complication occurs, a bone marrow donor may also be hospitalized. When the living donor and recipient are at different hospitals, both hospitals must be designated as Medicaid Centers of Excellence for the specific organ transplant involved. Medi-Cal covers transplants only for approved, select diagnoses, and only when performed by approved Centers of Excellence. Technological advancements in life sciences are continually pressing forward despite the vocal resistance. Examples include assisted reproductive technologies, genetic engineering, stem cell research, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology. Synthetic biology utilizes synthetic biological “parts” to build cells and entire organisms that can either mimic what occurs in nature or be programmed with wholly novel characteristics (Endy 2005; Paradise and Fitzpatrick 2014). With advances of nanotechnology and regenerative medicine, number of solutions become available, including the ability to regenerate whole organs using stem cells, bioprinted tissues, and developing artificial and created (harvested, cloned) organs. With the exception of reproductive organs, the custom-designed organs (cornea, heart, joints, kidneys, liver, lungs, spleen, teeth) are becoming available “off the shelf.” In 2010, when J. Craig Venter Institute announced the creation of the first synthetic man-made cell, the public resonance was intense. It was hailed as both a tremendous discovery that could benefit mankind and at the same time, an “evil perversion of nature” tending to alter the human race (Press Release 2010). Out of the various arrays to synthetic organs, we describe the main three techniques. The concept is based on isolation of a three-dimensional (3D) biological scaffold material vacant of any cells, then using a stem cell technique to plant the patient’s own cells unto the 3D scaffold. This process involves reintroduction of the cells. The patient’s cells (skin cells, muscle cell, hair) are opted and converted into a stem cell that can be driven along a particular line of differentiation. Thus, a stem cell can be coaxed into becoming a mature hepatocyte, osteocyte, or myocyte. Since these cells belong to the patient, there’s no need for immunosuppressant therapy. Experts estimate that next to $10–$30 million US dollars is needed to harvest one TBO (Badylak 2015). Modified natural polymers and synthetic polymers are used to replace damaged portions of organs and tissues, including the skin, cartilage, lymphatic tissue, pancreatic islet, the human cornea or the entire corneal thickness. The essence of tissue engineering is that those cells capable of initiating and sustaining the regeneration process are ‘switched on,’ perhaps through growth factors or genes, so that they generate new functional tissue of the required variety. Collagen-based biopolymers, combined with synthetic crosslinkers or copolymers, form effective scaffolds for developing prototype artificial corneas or other tissues (skin and cartilage) for replacements (Griffith et al. 2002). The tissue engineering strategy is cheaper in both investment and recurring costs. Tissue-engineered constructs for endothelial keratoplasty could be produced at a cost of US $880 per transplant. In contrast, utilizing donor tissue procured from eye banks for endothelial keratoplasty requires US $3710 per transplant (Tan et al. 2014). This is either natural or artificial creation of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules in various contexts: DNA replication (in vivo amplification), polymerase chain reaction (enzymatic synthesis), and gene synthesis (physically creating artificial gene sequences). Emerging techniques promise a creation of new nucleobase pairs in addition to the naturally occurring pairs, A-T (adenine-thymine) and G-C (guanine-cytosine). A third base pair could dramatically expand the number of aminoacids that can be encoded by DNA, from existing 20 aminoacids to a theoretically possible 172 (Bradley 2014).",

This process of disruptive change is, in fact, characterised by (1) interconnection over a network; (2) investment, falling prices and the persistent and innovative use of information and communication technologies (ICT); and (3) the increasing presence of knowledge streams in the economic flows, within a context dominated by the globalisation of economic relations. There has been a consensus to identify this process of transition from an industrial economy towards a knowledge-based economy (Castells 2004; Foray 2004; Rooney et al. 2005; Dolfsma and Soete 2006; Torrent-Sellens 2015). The increase in the use of ICT and knowledge in employment flows is likely to have changed the labour market in many dimensions. It has been found that ICT users hold jobs of higher quality and earn substantially higher wages than non-users. In addition, ICT is particularly used by more highly educated workers, suggesting that skill advantages play a crucial role in explaining employment structure and wages. Thus, it is still unclear whether these observed better jobs or higher wages are a result of ICT skills, or whether there are other sources underlying these occupational and wages differentials (Borghans and Ter Weel 2005). What is clear is that the adoption of ICT has been accompanied by an increase in cognitive demands, autonomy improvements, hierarchical control reductions, job quality increases and better wages (Autor et al. 2003). However, could it be asserted that, with the adoption of ICT and knowledge streams, employees feel happier at work? Which are the determinants or explanatory factors of job satisfaction for knowledge-based workers? These are the questions explored in this article. In Spain, the proportion of knowledge-intensive private work rose from 15.7 % in 2000 to 16.2 % in 2008 (OECD 2011). Despite this trend, the levels continue to lag well behind European countries such as Luxemburg (31.5 %), Belgium (27.5 %) and Germany (27.3 %). On the other hand, job satisfaction has become a topic of interest in the social sciences. It is recognised that around a quarter of our lives are spent at work. Therefore, social scientists attempt to understand people’s satisfaction in the changing workplace. The aim of the article is to address the determinants of job satisfaction for knowledge-based work in Spain. In spite of the growing number of studies on job satisfaction (Rose 2003, 2005; Gallie et al. 2012; Roach-Anleu and Mack 2014), the proposed subject has received limited attention in the empirical literature. Therefore, this article aims to fill this gap in knowledge. The analysis of job satisfaction in Spain is relevant because, in recent years, its labour market has deteriorated ostensibly as a result of the economic crisis. First, there has been a rapid rise in unemployment, which currently stands at 25 % of the working-age population. Second, there has been a marked deterioration in working conditions, which particularly manifest themselves as wage cuts, work precariousness and poorer work organisation and promotion conditions. In this context, empirical evidence has indicated that one of the main reasons for the serious deterioration of the labour market in Spain is its failure to adapt to the flow of knowledge-based work. The analysis of job satisfaction in Spain, according to knowledge intensity, can provide evidence for the future dynamics of companies and suggest policies to reconfigure labour markets. To this end, microdata was used of 6499 waged workers from the 2010 (latest year available) Survey of Quality of Life at Work, prepared annually by the Spanish Ministry of Labour and Immigration. This is the only survey available in Spain that collects qualitative and quantitative data on the various internal and external job dimensions that influence worker satisfaction.",8

A Review of Evidence for Developing Countries,June 2018,Kamel Bel hadj Miled,Jalel-Eddine Ben Rejeb,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"During the past few decades, microfinance has enjoyed tremendous growth generally targeting the very low income groups or households. During December 2000–2011, the number of microfinance institutions increased from 220 to 1389. It became one of the major development programs in the world, in terms of both the number of people targeted and the financial input that it receives (Rooyen et al., 2012). The industry has obtained a universal avowal as a potential in reducing poverty in many developing countries (Armendariz and Morduch, 2005; Bakhtiari, 2011; Gibbons and Meehan, 2002, Johnson and Rogaly, 1997; Imai et al. 2010), and a vital, dynamic mechanism toward attaining the millennium target of reducing poverty and hunger by 2015. Based on this close relationship between microfinance and poverty, several studies have postulated a positive correlate between microfinance and consumption expenditure, especially if loans are taken by women (Pitt and Khandker 1998; Khandker 2005). Indeed, microfinance financial services provide a range of financial products and substantial flow of finance, often to very low income groups or households, who would normally be excluded by conventional financial institutions (Kurmanalieva, Montgomery and Weiss, 2003). Microfinance has brought positive impact to the life of clients and boosts the ability of poor individuals to improve their conditions, and others have indicated that poor people have taken advantage of increased earnings to improve their consumption level and health and build assets (Appah.Eb et al. 2012). Today, microfinance is increasingly becoming an important investment opportunity, mainly in developing regions and all major international institutions. Indeed, dominant organizations like the European Union, the United Nations, the World Bank, the Asian Bank, and the American Development Bank dedicates funding and research to microfinance. Khandker (2005) and Mosley (2001) pointed to a potential bias arising in the impact of microfinance in these studies. In view of this, studies that have recently emerged have used one of the following three approaches: (i) examining the impact of microfinance on poverty (Hulme and Mosley, 1996; Pitt and Khandker, 1998; Copestake and James, 2002; Khandker, 2005; Tedeschi, 2010), (ii) studying the impact of microfinance on women’s empowerment (Hashemi et al. 1996; Steele et al, 1998; Rahman et al. 2009; Garikipati, 2012), and (iii) highlighting on other effects of microfinance, such as the impact on education, health, nutrition, consumption level, and building assets ( Deloach and Lamanna, 2011; Gertler et al, 2006; Jacobsen, 2009; Kouassi, 2008; Leatherman and Dunford, 2010). However, most of the evidence of the impact of microfinance interventions around the world remains highly controversial and limited on micro-economic foundations (household or business data). This study set out to establish the relationship between microfinance and poverty (incidence, depth and severity) and provides some new empirical evidence on the poverty-reducing effects of microfinance institutions using the cross-country and panel data. Our objective is to further examine the hypothesis that a country with higher microfinance institution (MFI) gross loan portfolio per capita tends to have lower levels of FGT class of poverty indices and higher level of expenditure of consumption per capita. It is notable that microfinance loans per capita are negatively associated with not only the poverty headcount ratio but also with the poverty gap (which measures the depth of poverty) and squared poverty gap (which measures the severity of poverty), implying that even the poorest benefit from them. The rest of the paper will be organized as follows: the next section presents a literature review on microfinance, especially its impact on poverty at the macro level. The third section presents the Econometric Framework and describes the Data Source, Definitions of Variables, and Empirical Results. The last section describes the Conclusion and Political Implications.",10
9.0,2.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,26 January 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-016-0353-0,"ICT Diffusion, R&D Intensity, and Economic Growth: a Dynamic Panel Data Approach",June 2018,Bahar Bayraktar Sağlam,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Since the early 1990s, there has been a rapid diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICTs) with the penetration of mobile phones and the Internet. A wider use of ICTs has facilitated the flow of information and knowledge by reducing the costs of communication. In this context, a number of studies have been concentrated on the causes and the consequences of the fast-paced growth of ICTs. Even though a number of factors are responsible for the fast growth of ICTs, augmented research and development (R&D) in ICT-related technologies have been the most notable one.Footnote 1 On the other hand, knowledge accumulation through the wide spread use of ICTs has improved productivity and efficiency of the R&D sector. Thereby, close linkages take place between the ICT penetration and the R&D activities. Actually, R&D activities have been the seed and the flower of the rapid expansion of ICTs. While numerous studies have attempted to assess the contribution of ICTs to economic growth and productivity by providing macro and micro empirical evidence,Footnote 2 few of the studies have considered the overall interaction between R&D activities and the rapid use of ICTs. Moncada-Paternò-Castello et al. (2009), Hall and Mairesse (2009) and O’Sullivan (2006) have found that relatively small ICT-producing sector has been the main cause of low R&D intensity in Europe. For German firms, Cerquera and Klein (2008) have pointed out that a more intense use of ICT lowers the R&D intensity. For Dutch firms, Polder et al. (2009) have supported a complementarity effect of ICTs on the R&D sector. For Italian firms, Hall et al. (2013) have revealed that R&D and ICTs are both strongly associated with innovation and productivity, with R&D being more important for innovation and ICT investment being more important for productivity. Even though those studies have provided conflicting results on the relationship between R&D intensity and ICTs, all of them extensively highlighted the close relationship between R&D and ICTs. Therefore, to reap the benefits of ICTs, one needs to strengthen the link between R&D and ICTs. In this context, Guerrieri et al. (2011) have argued that countries need to update ICTs equipments and software in order to enrich the R&D intensity and devote a certain share of labor and income to R&D in order to favor the development of the ICTs. This paper attempts to examine the causality dynamics among ICT diffusion, R&D intensity, and economic growth for the OECD countries by employing panel vector autoregressive model (VAR) techniques for the 1990–2012 period. Even though a number of firm level studies have provided evidence on the link between the R&D intensity and ICTs, very few papers have investigated R&D intensity and ICT diffusion jointly and tried to assess the dynamic causality between them. To our knowledge, this study is intended to fill the gap by examining causality between ICTs and R&D activities. That is, it investigates whether the extensive use of ICTs has contributed to the research and development, or whether the expansion of the ICTs is simply a consequence of the increased R&D activities. On the other hand, the literature on ICTs has generally examined the two-way causality between ICTs and economic growth without focusing on other variables, thus this paper enriches the analysis by capturing the overall interaction between the ICTs and R&D. For the robustness of the results, different proxies for ICT penetration have been used such as investment on ICTs, the Internet users, and mobile phone users. The research intensity is measured both by the share of R&D personnel in employment and the share of R&D expenditure in GDP. According to the empirical findings, both ICTs and R&D activities promote economic growth and in turn growth improves the development of ICTs and strengthens the R&D sector in the OECD countries. In addition to the direct contribution of ICTs on economic growth (which is extensively highlighted by the literature), ICTs generate growth indirectly by expanding the share of R&D personnel in employment, which is not captured by the literature yet. In other words, the wide spread use of ICTs has significant impact on the human capital formation in the OECD countries as the share of R&D personnel in total employment represents the very sophisticated type of human capital. Since there are conflicting findings on the effects of ICTs on education, this study contributes to the literature by highlighting the inevitable role of ICTs on human capital accumulation. The paper proceeds as follows. Section II presents the data and section III displays the methodology. Section IV conducts empirical evidence and provides the discussion. Section V concludes with policy implications drawn from the findings of the study.",8

The current economic context reveal that higher education institutions should pay attention to the coherence between them and their environment, in order to answer to the quest of global competitiveness. The European Commission places great emphasis on competitiveness, given its importance in creating jobs and growth in Europe. It works to mainstream public and industry-related competitiveness concerns across all policy areas. In particular, for EU countries, the focus is on ensuring that they benefit from simplified public administration and more broadly, a business-friendly environment, and have sufficient access to resources, including finance, raw materials, energy and suitably skilled labour. The quality of public administration is important for Europe’s competitiveness. Modern, innovative and efficient public administrations are essential to sustaining the recovery and unlocking Europe’s growth potential. Furthermore, management scholars have for long recognized scientific and technological advances stemming from so-called entrepreneurial universities as the main drivers of national social and economic development (Carayannis et al. 2015). It could be said that a number of features are important for competitiveness, so as to encourage improvements in government and public administrations. Each state’s public administrations are as regards promoting growth and competitiveness. It can be stated that public administration needs a new synthesis, one that will coherently integrate past theories, conventions, principles and practices of enduring values with new ones that respond to today’s challenges (Bourgon 2011). Public services are faced with a range of significant challenges and considerable constraints, not least the possibility of a marked decline in public spending (Mori 2010). European firms have fought hard to maintain their competitiveness during the crisis that began in 2008. However, the effects of the crisis are still being felt in the EU today. Therefore, it is important to improve the business environment through growth-friendly public administration. The quality of public administration is an important driver of EU countries’ competitiveness. Overall, 2014 Member States’ Competitiveness Report: Reindustrialising Europe showed that while the EU has experienced a recovery of exports and an increase in productivity in most countries, many factors still hinder competitiveness (2014 Member States’ Competitiveness Report: Reindustrialising Europe 2015). This includes a lack of investment, limited access to finance and access to markets, high energy prices and the need for a more business-friendly environment and public administration. Competitiveness requires reducing costs and uncertainties for public and businesses when dealing with public administration. Increased efficiency in public administration leads to more fast-growing firms, especially when financial turnover is increased. Time-consuming and costly tax rules, corruption and ineffective justice systems are the most detrimental to firms’ growth. These tasks in public sector can be implemented the universities’ academic staff by providing education and training services, improving employees’ skills and knowledge and transferring the latest technologies and management methods. Universities can provide important benefits, which could arise from bringing innovation further into the mainstream of management thinking and practice, concerning technology, entrepreneurship and organizational behaviour (Lombardi et al. 2014). Today we live in a complex world where understanding relations and identifying opportunities is a big challenge. Nowadays, to graduate from a school or university does not mean to forget about the process of learning. Growing amount of knowledge and information makes it necessary to update skills and competencies of employees. This makes it crucial to focus on education quality not only at the stage of school or university, but also afterwards, when one constantly needs to gain new knowledge and abilities. The concept of lifelong learning has never been more accurate. The research question which is going to be further addressed in this article is therefore as follows: How can the university cooperate for professional development in public administration area? The aim of research is to reveal the role and influence of the university for developing the public administration, professional education and training, and to identify the most significant areas of the customs auditors’ for professional development. Skills and competences are therefore of a great importance, as they help to acquire and maintain competitive advantage. For customs auditors, it is increasingly important to gain those skills and competences in a fast and effective way. That is why new and innovative approaches to education and professional development need to be elaborated, disseminated and promoted. In order to identify what policy processes, methods, technologies, administrative capacities of customs officials and partnership with public organizations may allow a successful achievement of public policy objectives the research was carried out. A survey was the best way to collect the data. A method of the written questionnaire was used to collect the direct data needed for the research chosen. Mathematical-statistical methods were used to reason the representation of the research results and to process them. In order to achieve the aim of this research, a comprehensive analysis of the scientific, practical and methodological literature was carried out. The analysis of the scientific literature is based on the scientific studies, researches and papers of foreign as well as Lithuanian authors. The analysis of the legal acts was carried out in accordance with the legal acts of the World Customs Organization, the European Union and the institutions of the Republic of Lithuania.",5

The opening of various categories of data possessed by the government (e.g. government spending, economic and business, legal, social, environmental, agricultural and tourism data) to the citizens constitutes a central element of the first component and at the same time a critical precondition for the achievement of the other two. For this reason, Open Government Data (OGD) initiatives have proliferated over the last years worldwide, not only in developed countries but also in developing ones as well (Huijboom & Van Den Broek, 2011; Harrison et al., 2012a; European Commission, 2013). According to the Open Knowledge Foundation, open data are defined as data that are freely accessible online, available without technical restrictions to re-use and provided under open access license that allows the data to be re-used without limitation (OKF 2012). Geiger and v Luecke (2012) define OGD as ‘all stored data of the public sector which could be made accessible by government in a public interest without any restrictions for usage and distribution’. A variety of government organisations with different strategies and technical capacities and which are under different social, political and legal conditions are embracing this concept and are opening big numbers of datasets they own to the society, aiming at the achievement of both social and economic benefits, the former being associated with government transparency and accountability as well as citizens’ participation, and the latter with development of economic activity in new value added e-services based on the combination of various types of OGD (and possibly private data as well) (Jetzek et al. 2013a and 2013b). Though the initial motivation for opening government datasets was to promote government transparency and accountability, subsequently there has been an extensive interest in the potential of public sector information (PSI) as an engine for business innovation and job creation, by opening appropriate parts of it as OGD to the society and creating complex ecosystems of public and private actors around them, in order to exploit them and generate social and economic values from them (Harrison et al., 2012b; Chan, 2013). According to the Digital Agenda Assembly (2011), ‘the direct annual turnover in the PSI Sector is estimated to be around EUR 28 Billion, with annual growth of around 8 %, and this makes the PSI Sector one of the faster growing sectors of the EU economy’, while it is estimated that ‘the aggregated macroeconomic footprint of the PSI industry is EUR 140 Billion. This means that the ‘spill’ or overflow from the PSI industry is even bigger than the sector itself’. A recent study by the McKinsey Global Institute showed that more than 40 countries have developed OGD platforms and over one million datasets have been published worldwide, which is expected to lead to the creation of actual value of about three trillion US dollars in seven industries (education, transportation, consumer products, electricity, oil and gas, health care and consumer finance) (Manyika et al. 2013). For all the above reasons, there is widespread and growing debate on OGD among government practitioners and academics, resulting in a continuously growing research literature (e.g. Allan, 2009; Meijer & Thaens, 2009; Robinson et al., 2009; Lathrop & Ruma, 2010; Parycek & Sachs, 2010; Maier & Huber, 2011; Janssen et al., 2012; Kassen, 2013; Zuiderwijk et al., 2014; Mellouli et al., 2014) as well as in the establishment of opening government datasets as a ‘political orthodoxy’ in numerous countries worldwide (e.g. in the USA (Obama, 2010), in the UK (Cameron, 2010), in Australia (AGIMO, 2010) and across Europe (European Commission, 2013 and 2014)). However, despite the big investments that have been made for the development of ‘OGD sources’, defined as various types of portals enabling access to government datasets by the public through the Internet and providing various capabilities/functionalities in this direction (see “Background Literature Review” for more details) by a variety of government organisations with different strategies and technical capacities and under different social, political and legal conditions worldwide, limited research has been conducted on these OGD sources in order to understand better their main characteristics from various perspectives (a brief review of the limited previous research literature on them is provided in the following ‘Previous Related Work’) and identify their strengths and weaknesses. This paper contributes to filling this research gap, by presenting an analysis of the characteristics of OGD sources in Greece. These OGD sources constitute a new type of information systems (IS), so according to previous relevant research on IS Success (DeLone & McLean, 1992 and 2003; Urbach & Mueller, 2012), their success relies critically on three main characteristics of them: their ‘information quality’ (i.e. the quality of the information they provide), their ‘system quality’ (i.e. their being from a technological perspective) and their ‘service quality’ (i.e. the support provided to its users, such as training, helpdesk, etc.). Our study focuses on the first two of them. In particular, this first analysis of OGD sources in Greece focuses on two important dimensions of their ‘information quality’: the thematic width of the datasets they provide and their semantic capabilities; it also focuses on two important dimensions of their ‘system quality’: the functionality they offer and their technological characteristics. Therefore, the research objective of this study is to analyse the characteristics of OGD sources in Greece from the thematic, functional, semantic and technological perspectives, in order to identify strengths and weaknesses and formulate recommendations for improvements. It should be noted that our study is conducted in a national context different from the ones of the economically and technologically developed countries, having a long tradition in the introduction and exploitation of new technologies and innovations, where most similar previous studies of the main characteristics of the utilisation of various new ICT have been conducted (see ‘The Greek National Context’ for more details on this). This is quite interesting, as previous research has revealed the importance of the national context on government information and knowledge sharing (Gharawi and Dawes, 2010; Dawes et al., 2011) This paper is structured in six sections. In the following second section, a review of the background literature of this study is presented, while in the third section, our research methodology is described. In the fourth section, the results of our analysis are presented, and in the next fifth section, there is a discussion of them. Finally, in the sixth section, the conclusions are summarized and future research directions are proposed.",20

A Panel Data Analysis for Four Mediterranean Countries,September 2018,Mounir Ben Mbarek,Kais Saidi,Rochdi Feki,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The existing studies show that there is an over correlation between the economic growth and the available energy (see, e.g., Jbir and Zouari-Ghorbel (2009); Apergis and Payne (2010a, b); Shahbaz et al. (2012); Shahiduzzaman and Alam (2014); Abid (2014); Abid and Mraihi (2014); Mbarek et al. (2014); Saidi and Hammami (2015). Economically, energy economics is a brief overview of energy and its historic role in the economy and why energy is inextricably linked to our economic future. While, environmental economics is a sub-field of economics that is concerned with environmental issues. Today, we cannot transform inputs into output (goods and services) without using energy. Energy is a vital and important input in the production process. This quantity over includes oil and gas. However, the traditional energy use has two problems: First, the problem of importing and then the problem of the greenhouse effect. For the import, oil is a strategic and very expensive good. This is why, over the years, after an oil shock, economic difficulties arise in the world. Developed countries like Europe and North America have programmed to consume renewable energy because this energy reduces dependence on foreign countries and is safe and sound (Menegaki 2011). It should be noted that the analysis of the determinants of environmental degradation and climate change has become a very exciting topic in the economic and ecological literature and most of the works are endeavoring to test the hypothesis of the environmental Kuznets curve between economic development and indicators environmental degradation (Panayotou 1993, 1995; Grossman and Krueger 1995). In addition, the greenhouse effect has become a global problem. Actions such as the Kyoto Protocol were conducted in order to reduce this effect (Lee and Chang 2008). The consumption of fossil fuels is the main reason for the emission of CO2. But limiting the consumption of fuel by states and protocols creates a problem in the process of economic growth, so a solution is the spread of renewable energy consumption. In the last two decades, the interactions between economic growth and the environment have become a topic of increasing importance both national and international (see, e.g., levels, Jia et al. (2013); Mbarek et al. (2014); Lo and Chow (2015); Saidi and Hammami (2015); Tavakoli et al. (2015)). These interactions between growth and the environment are both multiple, complex, and important. It is the latter that come all the basic inputs (metals and minerals, soil, forest cover, and fisheries) and the energy required for processing. This is also the environment that receives waste from economic activity. However, due to the increase in the production scale, it turns a degradation of the environment. For authors like Georgescu-Roegen (1971) and Meadows et al. (1974), the environmental degradation is mainly due to economic activity (production and consumption), which causes the depletion of natural resources, concentration of pollutants, and waste accumulation that exceeds the ability of the biosphere. By cons, Beckerman (1992) shows a strong correlation between income and environmental protection measures; it demonstrates the long term, economic growth is the best way that guarantees the quality improvement of the environment. The link between renewable energy and economic growth, and economic growth and CO2 emissions, has been extensively studied in recent years. Studies in this regard can be divided to three principal lines of research. Starting with the first link, is closely related between renewable energy and economic growth dating the pioneering study of Sadorsky (2009) estimates the links between renewable energy use and income for a selection of emerging economies. Their results show that the increases in real income have a positive and significant impact on renewable energy consumption. However, the study of Apergis and Payne (2010a, b) studied the causal relationship between renewable energy consumption and economic growth for a panel of twenty OECD countries. Their findings reveal a long-run equilibrium relationship between economic growth, renewable energy, gross fixed capital formation, and labor force with positive and statistically significant coefficients. The Granger causality tests indicate bidirectional links between renewable energy and economic growth in the short and long run. Similarly, Apergis and Payne (2010a, b), using variables such as capital formation, GDP, labor, and renewable energy consumption, have shown that in Eurasia there is a bidirectional relationship between economic growth and consumption renewable energy. They reported the same result for the OECD countries in 2010. In another work, Apergis and Payne, (2010a, b) examined the relationship between economic growth and renewable energy consumption for a panel of Central American countries. Their finding from the panel VECM indicates a bidirectional causality between economic growth and renewable energy consumption. In an early study, Shahbaz et al. (2012) investigated the relationship between energy renewable consumption and economic growth of Pakistan. Their results shown that renewable energy consumption add in economic growth. The VECM Granger causality analysis validates the existence of feedback hypotheses between renewable energy consumption and economic growth. A bidirectional causation was established between renewable energy and growth by Apergis and Payne (2010a, b) for selected emerging economies (including 20 countries) during the period 1985–2005.con. Unlike the study by Apergis and Payne (2010a, b), in our study, the countries selection for the panel is more specific (four Mediterranean countries such as France, Spain, Italy, and Turkey). For this purpose, we utilize a different and new database. The second line of research focuses on the causal link between environment and economic growth, consider the inverted-U relationship between pollutants and growth to check the validity of the EKC curve (hypothesis the environmental Kuznets). Empirical studies by various authors drew different findings. Selden and Song (1994) supplied empirical evidence on the validity of the EKC curve. Nevertheless, Holtz-Eakin and Selden (1995) found a monotone ascending curve, Friedl and Getzner (2003) found a shaped curve N-other, whereas Richmond and Kaufman (2006) concluded that there is no significant links between growth and pollutants. In a study of eight developed economies and two emerging economies, Andersson and Karpestam (2013) analyzed the determinants of energy intensity, carbon intensity, and scale effects. The findings show that there is a difference between the short-term and the long-term results and that climate policy are more likely to affect emission over the long term than over the short term. But the findings also suggest that a carbon tax is likely to be insufficient decouple emission from economic growth. Such a decoupling is likely to require a structural transformation of the economy. Saboori et al. 2012 examined the dynamic links between economic growth and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for Malaysia. The empirical findings suggest the existence of a long-term links between CO2 emissions and per capita GDP when the carbon dioxide emissions level is the dependent variable. Their results affirmed that there is an inverted-U shape relationship between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and economic growth in the short and long-term, thus supporting the hypothesis of (EKC). The Granger causality based on the error correction model (ECM) shown an absence of any links between CO2 emissions and economic growth measured by GDP in the short run while there is a unidirectional causality relationship running from the growth to emissions in the long run. In fact, Burnett et al. (2013) analyzed the relationship of the carbon Kuznets curve. However, these authors estimate a dynamic ordinary least squares model of monthly carbon dioxide emissions, personal income, and energy production in the USA. The results suggest that economic growth drives emissions intensities, not absolute emissions as is often implied in past studies. Hilaire and Fotio (2015) analyze the effects of economic growth on the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions for the Congo Basin. Their empirical results present a positive impact of the economic growth on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in these countries. As well, the population density, the consumption of energy, and industrial activities increase the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions significantly, their findings shown also that the commercial opening does not affect the carbon dioxide emissions. The third line of this overview explores the relationship between the environmental degradation (pollution), renewable energy use, and economic growth by simultaneously considering a modeling and data framework. These empirical studies searched and analyzed the dynamic relationships between these variables by combining the theory of the environmental Kuznets curve “EKC” with the growth and of the energy consumption. Some previous studies indicate the various windows results that depend on the campaign period and the time was held in the analysis and econometric techniques used. For example, Yazdi and Mastorakis (2011) examine the potential of renewable energy consumption in decreasing the impact of carbon emission in Iran and the greenhouse gas emissions, which leads to global warming. The co-integration analysis affirmed that there is evidence of long-run links between the studied variables. The validity of the EKC hypothesis has been tested for these countries. The Granger causality tests represent the existence of a unidirectional causality running from the square of per capita output to per capita CO2 emissions and renewable energy. The renewable energy consumption and economic growth has a positive bidirectional causality and contribution on carbon dioxide emissions in the short run. This study emphasizes the important role of renewable energy use on the both carbon dioxide emissions and economic growth. Kulionis (2013) analyzed the causal links between renewable energy use, economic growth measured by real GDP and the environmental degradation measured by carbon dioxide emissions (CO2) in Denmark. The results from Toda Yomamoto-causality and Granger causality test using supported the existence of unidirectional relationship running from renewable energy (REC) consumption to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. The findings supported also the absence of any links between the renewable energy consumption and economic growth, which supports the neutrality hypothesis during the relationship between renewable energy and growth. Apergis and Payne (2014) by another study examined the determinants of renewable energy consumption per capita for selected countries of Central America. Their empirical analysis affirmed the existence of a long-term co-integration between per capita renewable energy consumption, per capita real GDP, per capita dioxide carbon (CO2) emissions, real oil prices, and prices of real coal, with positive and significant coefficients restrictive. Leitão (2014) studied the existence of causal relationship between carbon dioxide emissions, renewable energy use, economic growth, and globalization for Portuguese. The Granger causality reports a unidirectional causality between renewable energy and economic growth. Sbia et al. (2014) investigated the relationship between foreign direct investment, clean energy, trade openness, carbon emissions and economic growth in case of UAE. Their empirical results affirmed the existence of a long-run co-integration between the used series. They showed that trade openness (TO), foreign direct investment (FDI), and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions decline the energy demand, in addition, the clean energy and economic growth and have positive and significant impact on energy consumption. The previous research makes several important contributions towards the links between renewable energy and growth in the literature related to energy economics. Almost all studies in the literature have considered panels of countries in explaining the causality relationship between the two variables. A major criticism related to these empirical studies, we notice, is the selection of panels. Countries within the considered panel have a greater degree of heterogeneity, and the difference between countries (in terms of economic strength). To overcome this problem, in this paper, we select four developed Mediterranean countries that have almost the same characteristics. In addition, this is the first piece of research dealing with emissions, renewable energy, and growth using panel co-integration analysis for these four top renewable energy consuming countries. The difference between our study and the previous studies mentioned in the literature review that along with traditional explanatory variables, we selected both renewable and non-renewable energy consumption in order to identify the relative effect of each of these in the economic growth and Co2 emissions for the selected countries. Unlike the previous studies, in our study, the country selection for the panel is more specific (four Mediterranean countries such as France, Spain, Italy, and Turkey). For this purpose, we utilize a different and new database over the period 1980–2012. The objective of this study is to investigate on the dynamic link between renewable energy (REC) consumption, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and economic growth measured by (GDP) for four Mediterranean countries for the period 1980–2010 using co-integration test and the causality test. This study extends the existing literature specifically on the nature of causal links between renewable energy, CO2 emissions and economic growth; in the literature, there is no study that examined this relationship in four Mediterranean countries. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the second section discusses the methodology, data and descriptive statistics, the third section presents the panel unit root test, the fourth section presents the panel co-integration results, the fifth section is reserved for the Granger causality results and the sixth section presents the long-run relationship with FMOLS and DOLS estimations. Finally, the conclusion and some policy recommendations are given in the sixth section.",13

Allen,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Communities and networks of professionals are well-established in the literature as sources of knowledge sharing and exchange, both within organizations (Brown and Duguid 1991; Lave and Wenger 1991; Nonaka 1994) and between organizations (Granovetter 1985; Kogut and Zander 1996), and across the Web (Chen and Hung 2010; Chiu et al. 2011). Many of these contexts operate independent of market-based institutions of the knowledge economy (Benkler 2002, 2006; Raymond 1999). Early studies of these environments find the motivations and conditions for knowledge sharing and exchange to be grounded in social norms such as reciprocity, gift exchange, trust, and the generation of social capital (for a comprehensive review, see Wang and Noe 2010). Such motivations shape—and are shaped by—an overarching open-source ideology that cuts across open-source software (OSS) projects (Stewart and Gosain 2006). Recent research explores differences across diversely motivated community constituents, including factors not commonly associated with (and sometimes in contrast to) open-source ideologies. The trend to hybridize software production, distribution, and licenses is evident in the software and professional service industries and has begun to receive attention in the research literature as business models adjust to new marketplace realities (Deodhar et al. 2012; Okoli and Nguyen 2015). This hybridizing trend will also be evident in the social contexts that facilitate knowledge sharing and exchange, i.e., as user communities grow and evolve as sites of knowledge exchange and peer-support, the relationship between nonmarket, volunteer-based contexts, and their market-based counterparts (i.e., commercial software and services firms) will coevolve. This paper presents results from an empirical study of hybridization in a software user community and how it might affect the social context for knowledge production and exchange.",1

In the 1980s, researchers such as Rogers, Sveiby, and Edvinsson began to recognize the importance of knowledge resources (Edvinsson 1987; Rogers 1987; Sveiby 1988). In general, it is identified that KM was established as a discipline since 1991(Nonaka 1991). Then, KM started to attract broad attention when it was systematically discussed once again (Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995). From then on, knowledge was known as one of the most important resources, capabilities, or assets for organizations to main their sustainable competitive advantages (Bruton et al. 2007). As a significant and emerging managerial tool, KM was witnessed with an explosive growth of research on it in the last two decades. Currently, KM is a major field of academic publications. The construction industry is one of the main pillars of many countries’ economy boom. KM in the construction industry, which is now characterized by intensive knowledge (Kim 2014), is essential to improving business performance. The importance of KM is increasingly recognized in this industry, and many KM research achievements in the special field have been published by past researchers (McRea and Langdon 2003; Senaratne and Sexton 2009). However, the reporting of the research achievements is often ad hoc, fragmental, and disorganized. The diversified and changing nature of past works in this field warrants us to stocktake, identify research framework, and predict research trends for theoretical improvement and practical implementation in the future. A summary of past research can contribute to systematic thinking and better judgment of the past research achievements. Prediction of potential research orientations can provide significant information for new researchers to conveniently identify new clues and avoid “reinventing the wheel.” Hence, this study was set to answer two questions: what has been studied in the past, and what are the potential research orientations in the future? To answer these questions, major topics and research framework were summarized and future research orientations were predicted in this paper on the basis of literature review. The remainder of this paper is thus organized as follows. Methodology of literature retrieval and paper selection is explained in Methodology section. The major topics in three stages which are distinguished in terms of the number of papers are discussed in Major topics section from an evolutionary perspective. The research framework in the past is summarized in Research framework section. Prediction of potential research orientations is proposed in Prediction section to improve the past research framework. Finally, conclusions, limitations, and future work are presented in Conclusion Remarks section.",27

In this sense, Goldfajn and Baig (1998) Dekle et al. (2001) point out that during the Asian crisis of 1997, the increase in the interest rates was due to the exchange rate appreciations in countries such as Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand. Moreover, McKinnon 2001 showed that the volatility of the exchange rates can increase the volatility of the interest rates. Thus, several theoretical studies have been conducted to describe and study the links between financial and sovereign debt crises. In this context, Pescatori and Sy (2007) say that the determinants of banking crises recorded in the 1980s were used after that to anticipate the sovereign debt crises. The current financial crisis that began in 2007 is a clear case of carrying and spreading of systematic risk. The banking crisis reached a peak in September 2008 with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the subsequent support for the financial system. In early 2010, it turned into a crisis of sovereign debt. At that time, the European authorities made great efforts to find a way out of the debt crisis in the euro zone. In this crisis, the euro zone appeared to be poorly organized, unbalanced, and incapable of defining a common economic policy after the 2008 financial crisis. The current crisis is largely a banking one (Avaro and Sterdyniak 2014). Indeed, the European Union pledged funds to the euro zone of €1 billion to help countries in trouble. For this reason, the European Central Bank (ECB) injected, in a first step, significant amounts of liquidity into the banking system of the euro zone to mitigate the consequences of the balance sheet of the banking sector exposed to the deterioration of sovereign debt. The consequences of the euro zone sovereign debt crisis reached far beyond Europe’s borders, with the IMF calling it “the most immediate threat to global growth” (Popov and van Horen 2015). Therefore, European banks, especially in Spain and Ireland, contributed to the worsening of the situation through the financial and real estate bubbles. The impact of the crisis is also due to the outbreak of the mass of capital seeking liquid and profitable investments. These investments are primarily in the neomercantilist countries, such as China, Germany, the Scandinavian countries and also countries producing raw materials. Mathieu and Sterdyniak (2011) claim that the crisis is the result of the unbearable implemented macroeconomic policies, on the one hand, and the neomercantilist countries, on the other hand, by the Anglo-Saxon countries. So far, the consequences of the sovereign debt crisis have not been clear. Many analysts believe that the tensions in the bond markets of the euro zone countries are internationally transmitted through the bank lending channel. It represents an ideal experience to assess their impact at the national and international level. Also, several researchers, such as Kashyap and Stein (2000) and Jiménez et al. (2012), stipulate that the spread of international shocks occurred via the balance sheets of multinational banks. This crisis represents an ideal experience to assess their impact at the national and international level. Recent research, such as that of Blot and Labondance (2011), Harbo and Welz (2011), and Karagiannis et al. (2010), has tried to explain the triggers and causes of this crisis. However, studies that dealt with the impact of the crisis on the different sectors remain rare. Within the same context, Sandra (2012) argues that the sovereign debt crisis in the zone area is a banking crisis rather than a public finance crisis. The relationship between the two is a frequent characteristic of the financial crisis. Therefore, this interdependence is clear in the current crisis. However, Wehinger (2010) and Acharya and Schnabl (2011) consider that the “subprime” crisis is a possible explanation for the increase in the sovereign risk. Furthermore, Annika (2012) outlines five main phases in the phenomenon of the current financial crisis. He states that there are links between the financial subprime crisis and that of the euro zone, given the general chronology of universal acts. He believes that the crisis in the euro zone is a continuation of the financial crisis. In the same sense, Ferrer et al. (2010) showed that the variation of the interest rates affects not only the banking sector during the crisis of the euro zone but also the non-financial sectors (industrial technology). Thus, changes in the interest rates have a negative and significant effect on the stock returns of non-financial corporations. Moreover, Pablo et al. (2014) unveiled that the volatility of the interest rates has affected the Spanish industry. On the other hand, Wensheng et al. (2010) pointed out that the exchange rate volatility increased the business risk. Our study is based on recent literature, such as that of Blot and Labondance (2011), Hein (2012), and Dullien et al. (2013), to measure the sensitivity of the banking sector of Ireland, Greece, Portugal, and Spain during the sovereign debt crisis of the euro zone, using publicly available information. We empirically measure the effect of the short and long-term interest and the exchange rates in the banking sector in these four countries which were the most vulnerable to the crisis during 2006–2014. After describing the effect of each variable on the banking sector in these four countries, we compared the sensitivity of each banking sector about others. The ultimate goal is to understand how each banking industry is affected by these three variables during the crisis and confirm the view of some economists and researchers such as Sandra (2012) and Avaro and Sterdyniak (2014). These authors argue that the euro zone crisis is a banking crisis and that these countries also support pressures in the financial markets during the crisis. The main findings provide a certain number of points of view on the situation of the banking sector in the countries of our sample and on the nature of the euro zone crisis that has already hit Greece. We make two main contributions. First, we complement a previous literature that described the effect of the financial crisis on the banking sector (study exp) and the large literature focusing on the recent financial crisis by observing its effects on the banking sector of four euro zone countries. Second, the period of study of the situation of the banking sector includes the subprime crisis and that of the euro zone, unlike other documents which examined the phenomenon during a single crisis. Moreover, this study was conducted in four countries (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain) which were the most affected by the crisis in a clear way compared to other empirical studies that dealt with these and other countries, such as Germany and France, which help up during the shock. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the “Literature Review” section presents a literature review while the “Data and Model Specification” discusses the data and the methodologies used. “The Results of the Empirical Analysis” section illustrates and evaluates the results of the empirical analysis. Finally, the “Conclusion” section concludes the paper.",

According to the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis, as output increases, carbon dioxide emissions increase as well until some threshold level of output was reached after which these emissions begin to decline. The main reason for studying carbon emissions is that they play a focal role in the current debate on the environment protection and sustainable development. Economic growth is also closely linked to the FDI inflows since higher level of FDI inflows leads to higher economic growth (Abdouli and Hammami 2015). However, it is also likely that the increase of FDI inflows requires a higher level of economic growth. The relationship between FDI inflows, environmental quality, and economic growth is puzzling. The picture seems quite different for developing countries, especially Middle East and North African (MENA) countries. Therefore, the question of sustainability of growth in the Middle Eastern and North African countries becomes central. On one hand, environmental constraints may lead to lower the necessary growth for the region in a context of demographic boom associated with a high rate of unemployment. On the other hand, new opportunities and benefits from technological transfer may lead to better trend of growth and sustainability. One of the most important questions that arise in this context is what is, until now, the nature of the relation between FDI inflows, economic growth, and environmental quality in the MENA countries? Do we have the same trends than elsewhere or is there some specificity for the region? In recent decades, research on the relationship between FDI, \( CO2 \) emissions, and economic growth has attracted the interest among economic researchers. Therefore, the interaction between foreign direct investment, economic growth, and environmental quality has been the subject of considerable academic research. For that reason, it is interesting to study the relationship between FDI inflows, economic growth, and environmental degradation in the MENA region. In literature, the link between FDI, \( CO2 \) emissions, and growth has attracted the attention of researchers in various countries for a long time. We can classify the previous studies in this area in three parts. The first part concerns the relationship between CO2 emissions and economic growth (Grossman and Krueger 1991; Richmond & Kaufmann 2006; Holtz-Eakin and Selden 1995; Fodha and Zaghdoud 2010; Christopher and Douglason 2011; Wang et al. 2011; Saboori et al. 2012; Omri 2013; Omri et al. 2014). The second examines the relationship between economic growth and FDI flows (Tsai 1994; Nguyen and Nguyen 2007; Tang et al. 2008; Adams 2009; Klasra 2011; Anwar & Nguyen 2010; Adhikary 2011; Kumar 2011; Ahmadi and Ghanbarzadeh 2011; Lenuta 2012; Omri et al. 2014; Aga 2014). The third part focuses on the link between CO2 emissions and FDI inflows (e.g., Jorgenson 2007; Acharyya 2009; Zhang 2011; Hitam and Borhan 2012; Ming Qing and Jia 2011; Kahouli and Kadhraoui 2012; Lee 2013; Omri et al. 2014; Lau et al. 2014). The objective of this study is to use production function approach where gross domestic product (GDP) depends on CO2 emissions, the capital, and other inputs such as FDI inflows. The extended Cobb–Douglas production framework helps us to explore the causal relationships among the variables: economic growth, capital, CO2 emissions, and FDI inflows. The variables are chosen to capture the particular characteristics of Middle East and North Africa. Our study thus contributes to the existing literature by giving the first integrated approach to examine the three-way linkages between economic growth, CO2 emissions, and FDI inflows in 12 Middle Eastern countries and 5 North African countries over the period of 1990–2012 by using the dynamic simultaneous equation models (DSEMs) which follow the spirit of the conventional growth framework. The reason is that all the variables in a growth form model are stationary. While, cointegration demands that all variables, as a prerequisite, need to be non-stationary with panel data specifications. Specifically, this study uses three structural equation models, which allows one to simultaneously examine the impact of (i) the FDI and CO2 emissions on economic growth, (ii) the economic growth and CO2 emissions on FDI inflows, and (iii) the economic growth and FDI on CO2 emissions. The next section describes briefly the reviews related to literature. The “Econometric Method and Data” section outlines the econometric modeling approach and describes the used data. The “Data” section reports and discusses the empirical results. The “Results and Discussions” section concludes the article and offers some policy implications.",31

Specifically, knowledge management is considered as an essential tool in order to obtain competitive advantages in organizations (Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995; Davenport and Prusak 1998; Drucker 1998; Davel and Snyman 2007; Ajmal et al. 2010); therefore, the process is important to all governments, but with special emphasis in developing countries because it is the real key to create value. However, the intangible character of knowledge linked to the heterogeneity of firms hinders contributions related to knowledge management. In this way, despite the numerous studies which have been undertaken in recent years, there is currently no commonly accepted model by all stakeholders that helps to manage knowledge in enterprises (Choi and Jong 2010). Besides this information, a gap in the literature is identified: Research in knowledge management area is essential in order to support decision making process in organizations by using knowledge, and this topic is still under discussion because there is not an agreement about it. In this context, an interesting analysis is presented showing how enterprises in a developing country with a growing benefit manage their knowledge in order to identify if this process should be replicated in other countries following its example. This is very important because there is not much research on this topic, although it is interesting for governments, managers, and scholars. Besides this information, Chile is selected and a cluster analysis is realized with the aim of comparing different behaviors and identifying their similarities and differences. These results have implications for some stakeholders: First, it is interesting for Chilean enterprises, because it explains what they do and what they should do. Second, the results could help the Chilean government because the analysis shows how the behavior of its enterprises is. Third, the analysis supports the decision making process in other developing countries, both in governments and enterprises. The paper is structured as follows: First, a bibliographic review about knowledge management is presented, analyzing its importance for enterprises and its relationship with innovation, learning, and knowledge sharing. Then, the methodology is detailed specifying data collection and sample. In the following section, results are analyzed explaining how Chilean enterprises manage their knowledge. Finally, the conclusion includes the main findings of the research, future research possibilities, and limitations.",2

International organizations, including the United Nations and World Bank, have been emphasising the growth impacts of ICT in developing countries. In addition to its immediate effect on GDP and income, employment opportunities in the ICT sector have a multiplier effect in developing economies (UNDESA, 2012). In a recent report, the World Bank (2011) argues that, in developing countries, ICT is the biggest driving force behind economic growth, serving as an engine of job creation, particularly among youth and women, and has also promoted trade and competitiveness through exports. Although we generally expect a positive correlation between ICT diffusion and economic growth, the existing literature does not necessarily conform to this stereotyped relationship. Nevertheless, in recent decades, developing countries have been mobilizing resources to build ICT infrastructure. This shows why the number of internet and mobile users is rising significantly in the last two decades in low and lower middle-income countries. Tables 1 and 2 show the rising trend of internet and mobile subscriptions, respectively, in developing countries from 2000 to 2014. Concomitant to these changes in the ICT sector, both low and lower middle-income countries have undertaken a number of policy measures to develop the financial sector in recent decades. The development in the financial sector and ICT diffusion can jointly affect economic growth through accumulating capital, technological innovation, reducing imperfection in the capital market and asymmetry of information across different economic agents (Levine, 1997; Sassi and Goaied, 2013). While the theoretical literature highlights the positive effects of financial development and ICT diffusion on economic growth, empirical studies on this aspect have remain deficient (Sassi and Goaied, 2013). The objective of this paper is to fill the gap in the empirical literature by answering the following research questions: (1) What is the growth effect of ICT diffusion in developing countries? (2) Does financial development play any important role in explaining the movement of output per capita in developing countries? (3) How does ICT diffusion, when combined with financial development, affect economic growth in developing nations, specifically in low income countries (LICs) and lower middle-income countries (LMICs)? We use a panel of 43 developing countries for the 2000–2014 period to investigate the dynamic relationships between ICT diffusion, financial development, and per capita economic growth. Table 3 provides the list of countries. We apply the system GMM approach that uses valid instruments and accommodates for endogeneity, which may emerge from explanatory variables. Finally, countries are grouped into two categories: the LICs and the LMICs. The system GMM technique is applied to these groups to identify regional variations of the ICT-finance-growth nexus. To preview, our results suggest that, on average, ICT diffusion has a positive impact on economic growth when all developing countries are included in the same panel. We do not find any significant impact of financial development on economic growth. The joint effect of ICT diffusion and financial development is positive and significant, suggesting that the impact of ICT on economic growth occurs through the channel of developed financial sectors. When countries are grouped according to their income levels, regression results indicate that the joint effect of ICT and finance is positive in the LICs, but insignificant in LMICs. In this study, a number of novel issues are introduced. First, we examine the individual effects of ICT and financial development on the growth of GDP per capita, while controlling for country-specific effects and endogeneity. Second, we examine the joint effect of ICT diffusion and financial development on per capita economic growth. Third, this study includes a large dataset of 43 developing countries. Fourth, we provide a comparison between LICs and LMICs with respect to the joint effects of financial development and ICT diffusion on economic growth. To our knowledge, this study is the first of its kind. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. “Literature Review” reviews the literature on ICT, financial development and economic growth. “Methodology” presents the data and the econometric methodology. “Results” presents the empirical findings of the selected groups of countries and provides policy implications for developing nations. “Analysis” analyzes those results. ""Conclusion” concludes the paper.",37

The importance of corruption has been analyzed by economists in several areas of research, giving rise to various streams of literature. However, much of traditional economic analysis has tended to analyze the direct effect of corruption on macroeconomic variables. Several studies have analyzed the effect of corruption on economic growth (Svensson 2005; Mobolaji and Omoteso 2009; Maiyaki 2010; Dridi 2013). Other studies do not support empirical methods estimating a unique income–pollution relationship. So, corruption and other institutional inefficiencies are highlighted in the literature as crucially affecting the country’s total factor productivity as well as the government’s concerns and control for environmental quality. According to López and Mitra (2000), due to the non-optimal government decisions, actual emissions are above the socially optimal levels of any level of GDP per capital income. Indeed, the higher the degree of corruption, the greater will be the deviation from the social optimum. Damiana et al. (2003) concluded that the effect of trade liberalization on environmental policy is contingent upon the level of corruption: the greater the level of corruption, the larger the impact of trade liberalization on the environment will be. For some economists, corruption affects the environmental quality through these effects on natural resources. Indeed, the lobbying activities of special interest groups in many developing countries have played a significant role in influencing key government policies that determine land use decisions in these countries (Ascher W. 1999; Hafner 1998). Paunov (2016) has analyzed the impacts of corruption on smaller- and larger-sized firms that adopt quality certificates and patents. His conclusion is that corruption reduces the chance of these firms to obtain quality certificates. Corruption affects, particularly, smaller firms which become more sensitive to the adoption of quality certificates. Our objective, in this study, is to investigate the impact of corruption on CO2 emissions, energy consumption, and economic growth for a panel of the 13 Middle East and North African (MENA) countries during 1984–2012. For this reason, we have used simultaneous equations GMM-estimation for the empirical analysis. The following study analyzes the effect of corruption on different energy consumption to CO2 emissions and economic growth. Indeed, in sum, the majority of studies analyze the direct effect of corruption on pollution. The studies that have taken into account the indirect effects of corruption on pollution through growth and energy consumption channel are very limited (Welsch 2004a; Cole 2007). This paper attempts to shed a new light on the effects of corruption on economic growth, environmental degradation, and energy consumption, taking into account the indirect effects. Specifically, the analytical framework employed in this study integrates the approach used by Cole (2007). We have broken the effects of corruption on our variables into two effects: direct and indirect. Corruption directly affects the quality of the environment through regulation and taxation. However, corruption affects the environmental quality through its effect on economic growth. In fact, corruption negatively affects economic growth; as any increase in the level of corruption will be accompanied by a reduction in the level of GDP. This reduction in GDP levels will affect the environmental quality by referring to the environmental Kuznets curve theory. Through our research, we will try to investigate (1) the direct relationships between corruption and economic growth, environmental degradation, and energy consumption; and (2) the indirect relationships between corruption with economic growth, environmental degradation, and energy consumption through the mediating effects of corruption. The key research question (RQ), that we address in this study, is as follows: RQ: What are the relationships among corruption, economic growth, environmental degradation, and energy consumption in the MENA region? The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the ensuing section, we present the literature review. This is followed by an empirical analysis for testing the hypotheses. We use the data from 13 countries of the MENA region. Then, we discuss the results and the implications for future research.",57

This importance stems from the fact that it allows to synthesize the firm situation and its continuity. Also, it can be an indicator of good management. Thus, the accounting result may represent an incentive or inhibitive factor for decision-making by users of the accounting and financial information. In such a situation, managers are found sometimes forced to intervene in the process of presentation of financial statements in order to publish accounting figures that motivate their partners and reduce risks faced by them (Healy and Wahlen, 1999). This phenomenon is called earnings management. In this sense, the accounting literature distinguishes mainly two modalities of earnings management. The first corresponds to earnings management through accruals. It was the subject of the majority of empirical studies (Schipper, 1989; Dechow et al., 1995; Healy and Wahlen, 1999). The second modality is called real earnings management. It has experienced a huge consideration in the accounting literature since the studies of Graham et al. (2005) and Roychowdhury (2006). In the framework of this modality, Roychowdhury (2006) distinguishes essentially three practices based on operating activities, namely, the overproduction, reduction in discretionary expenses, and sales manipulation. In our research, we chose to study only the sales management. Faced with the rise of these different accounting and real manipulations, governance mechanisms took a special attention in the recent years. In this sense, the financial security laws, such as the Sarbanes–Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002 in the USA and the Financial Security Act No. 96-2005 in Tunisia, stressed the importance of these governance mechanisms and especially the internal mechanisms. The board of directors, considered as the most important control mechanism by Fama and Jensen (1983), has the broadest powers in the firm that can limit earnings management behavior. These powers include the monitoring role, the service, and the strategic role (Zahra and Pearce, 1989; Charreaux and Pitol-Belin, 1990; Johnson et al., 1996). The studies of the association between board characteristics and real-based earnings management activities remain relatively mixed. Some studies confirm the impact of these characteristics, while others refute this impact. In this regard, Carcello et al. (2006) find a positive association between the board size and the practice of reduction in discretionary expenses; however, other authors showed the absence of this association (Visvanathan, 2008; Garven, 2009). Regarding the proportion of independent directors, Visvanathan (2008) proves the existence of a negative association between this characteristic and the overproduction practice, while he did not find a relationship between board independence and sales manipulation. However, Garven (2009) did not identify a link between independence and real earnings management. The objective of this research is to examine the impact of some board characteristics on the sales management in the Tunisian context allowing considerable freedom to companies in determining their board characteristics. Those characteristics include board size, independence of directors, dual position of CEO, and chairman, as well as the frequency of meetings of this organism. This study is based on a sample of 29 Tunisian-listed firms from 2009 to 2013. In this paper, we measure sales management by using the model presented by Roychowdhury (2006). The regression results show that the board of directors is an effective internal control mechanism for the detection of sales manipulation. Thus, the size of board of directors, the independence of directors, and the number of its annual meetings seem to have a significant effect on reducing the extent of sales manipulation. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section “Theoretical Framework and Hypothesis Development” provides theoretical background and hypotheses for the study. Section “Research Design” outlines the research methods, and section “Findings” describes sample selection and data. Section “Conclusions” reports the results of the empirical study and concludes.",18

This is due to a lot of reasons. First, there has been a global trend—approved by both developed and developing countries—towards the privatization of public firms. Such privatizations have taken the form of acquisitions via the modality of public offering of sale or tender offer. Second, given the economic expansion experienced by the world in the 1990s, multinational companies—in order to counteract the rise of competition—have been aware that they should be integrated to become more efficient. Third, the succession of financial crises that have enveloped the main financial markets (Asia in 1995 and the global crisis of 2007) have raised an important fact that small businesses have been the most affected and have suffered the heaviest losses. Therefore, these enterprises have attempted new strategies to increase their sizes, such as the M&A. This general context, characterized by the succession of financial crises, has had several effects on the behaviour of the commercial banks in the EU. To face these negative effects, a large portion of banks have had recourse to the M&A to make their size bigger and to get increasing returns of scales. Thus, in the present paper we will try to answer the following question: What are the dynamic effects of the M&A on the bank performance? So to respond to this problematic, we will see in the second section the literature review explaining the main mechanisms through which the M&A can transmit the realisation of performance. The third section presents the model and the data. The fourth one will be reserved to interpret the principal results of econometric estimation. The fifth and last section will conclude the paper.",6

It consists in asking the classical question: “Does the diffusion of technological innovation create new jobs or destroy the existing employment?” The opinions diverge about this question. On the one hand, periods of technological change have always been characterized by the fear of technological unemployment (Timur and Ponak 2002). Moreover, since it started, the economic theory has emphasized the existence of economic forces that can compensate for the reduction in employment due to technological progress. According to the technological theory of unemployment, increased productivity destroys employment because labor is replaced by machines. Several studies showed that technological progress leads to the casualization of non-skilled labor and unemployment. This idea is based on the substitution of capital for labor. However, in the nineteenth century, economists came up with a theory known as “the compensation theory,” which explains the mechanisms caused by technological changes that trigger job creation (Vivarelli 1995). However, according to this theory, technological innovations reduce short-term employment (replacement effect) and create it in the medium and long term (compensation effect). The objective of this article is to analyze the effects of short- and long-term technological innovation on employment. Do technological innovations contribute to the creation or destruction of employment? For this purpose, we present the concept of “creative destruction” of Schumpeter in the first section. In the second section, we explain the classical “theory of compensation” and the different compensation mechanisms. Then, we move to our own empirical validation. There are very few empirical works related to developing countries. To enrich this research, our analysis focuses especially on Tunisia since this country has a relatively high unemployment rate of between 15 and 16 %. Therefore, we present our econometric results and our economic performance with our variables, our data, and our model in the third section. Based on the structural vector error correction model (VECM) technique, we can ask the following question: what is then the impact of a technology shock on employment in Tunisia.",3

The European sovereign debt crisis affected different countries of the euro area. Tunisia suffered the worsening situation in Europe aggravated by the negative cyclical events after the revolution from January 2011. The current account deficit widened, mainly due to bankruptcies of several companies, outings of direct foreign investments (FDI) and the considerable losses of the tourist sector. Consequently, the levels of deficits and public debt have risen sharply. Panizza and Presbitero (2014); Cecchetti et al. (2011); Nersisyan and Wray (2011); Checherita and Rother (2010) have examined the relationship between the public debt and economic growth of European countries. They emphasized the existence of a negative impact of public debt on economic growth. Panizza and Presbitero (2014) claimed that correlation does not imply causation. However, Nersisyan and Wray (2011) noted that during a recession, the public balance becomes automatically deficit and the debt ratio increases. The public debt effect is not limited to the impact on growth; there is also an impact on monetary policy and inflation. Indeed, in the case of failure, the State risks a possible default that may cause a banking crisis. According to Amisano and Giannini (1997) and Pétursson (2000), the SVAR (structural vector autoregressive) model has shown excellent results to explain macroeconomic fluctuations; this type of model is well suited to modeling the term structure both on theoretical and econometric analysis. The estimate allows verifying empirically the theory applies in reality. This type of model is useful, in particular, to evaluate the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies and the effects of external shocks. The interest of non-structural and structural vector autoregressive model (VAR and SVAR), was known after criticism of Sims (1980) that economic theory have not the ability to identify large structural models. In the VAR model, each variable is considered endogenous and is modeled as a function of its own lagged values and those of other endogenous variables used in the system. The matrix covariance of residuals may contain non-zero values other than on its main diagonal, meaning that the effect of innovation on the VAR system cannot be isolated and residuals can be correlated. The SVAR model have solved the problems of the VAR model and turn correlated innovation into orthogonal structural shocks (independent) that may have an economic interpretation. Blanchard and Quah (1989) are the pioneers of the SVAR approach. Pfaff (2008); Lütkepohl (2007), Hendry (1995), Johansen (1995); Hamilton (1994); Banergee et al. (1993) have developed the SVECM (structural vector error correction model) that can be used if there is the presence of cointegration relationships between variables. The SVAR methodology has been used in several studies to analyze the effects of monetary and fiscal shocks for several countries; such as Abdelkafi and Feki 2012; Beaton et al. 2009; Aarle et al. 2003; Garcia and Verdelhan 2001; Christiano et al. 1999; etc. In this work, our aim is to study the effect of public debt on growth and monetary policy in the case of Tunisia by identifying possible causal relationships. We use the SVECM model and Granger causality over the period 2002–2013. This paper is structured as follows. The “Theoretical Overview” section presents a theoretical overview of the relationship between public debt, monetary policy, and fiscal policy. The “Empirical Study” section describes the methodology of structural VAR including breaks and cointegration relationships. We also discuss the causality approach and we propose an adaptation of these techniques for our problem. The “Conclusion” section is devoted to the main conclusions of this work.",4

Even though the term has been used to characterize nowadays’ economies, there are not yet any consensual indicators used to measure a knowledge-based economy,Footnote 1 so that publications used range of indicators that varies from one edition to another or from one institution to another.Footnote 2 Recently, Mêgnigbêto (2014a) proposed the transmission power as an indicator for measuring the knowledge-based economy. This study seeks to answer the following research question: Does the transmission power measure the extent to which an economy is knowledge-based? We aim to test any correlation between the transmission power and some indicators used to measure knowledge economy. Any correlation found could mean that the transmission power measures the same things as the considered indicator; the absence of correlation could mean that the transmission power really captures a dynamic that is missing from other indicators. The article is organized as follows: First, the literature is reviewed; then, the selected countries and indicators are dealt with; in a third step, we discuss the data source and collection. Results are presented, and a discussion follows in subsequent sections.",8

To compensate for this lack of databases, several researchers used geographic proxies in their empirical studies (e.g., Subramanian et al. 1996; Davey Smith et al. 1998; Marmot and Wilkinson 1999; Mustard et al. 1999; Macintyre et al. 2002; Gordon 2003; Rehkopf et al. 2006). The primary objective of this proxy is to assign socioeconomic information calculated on the basis of small unit as possible in order to ensure a high degree of homogeneity in the socioeconomic conditions attributed to each resident in this unit. These pieces of socioeconomic information relate to small areas that can be introduced into administrative databases by linking these areas to the data available in the databases. Despite the limits associated with this practice, it is, nevertheless, a preferred approach for measuring the social disparities associated with mortality, health and social morbidity, in short and long terms, and the use of health and social services. This practice however raises questions about the magnitude of the inequalities highlighted because it can vary depending on whether the socioeconomic measures are individual or area-based version. To compensate for this situation, this study resorted to an estimate of geographic proxy tracked social health inequalities, an approach now hardly used in the field of health (e.g. Kunst and Mackenbach 1996; Krieger et al. 1997). This estimate takes the form of a material and social deprivation index (Townsend 1987). To facilitate the monitoring of social inequalities related to certain important phenomena of health, such as mortality and disability, two versions of the deprivation index are correlated with the proportional risk of mortality and the relative risk of disability among adult aged 35 years and over. Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to explore empirically the impact of socioeconomic measures on health in Tunisia. Our goal is to compare the magnitude of the life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy gaps among men and among women, using the deprivation index, and to explore its validity and variations according to area-based socioeconomic resources that reflect Tunisia’s diversity, and to illustrate its use in health planning through the example of mortality and disability risks. In addition, to apply the deprivation index, the study will empirically investigate whether social inequalities in health decrease when socioeconomic resources and financial support to the poor are expanding. The outcomes of this study are expected to guide the policymakers of Tunisia in order to reduce social inequalities in health through the development of public social transfer programs and the improvement of living conditions of the poor people. Moreover, it contributes to the literature on the impact of socioeconomic resources on health inequalities in the context of Tunisia and can be extended to other developing countries also. This article is distributed as follows. Section 2 depicts data description and empirical methodology used. Section 3 interprets the empirical results of the study. Section 4 discusses the results. Section 5 holds the concluding annotations and suggests some policy implications.",4

Since the seminal work by Marshall, Alfred (2006), when a company reduces costs and increases production volume, the internal economies of scale have been achieved. External economies of scale (EES) occur outside of the firm and within an industry. In fact, when an industry’s scope of operations expands (due to the creation of a better transportation network that resulting in a subsequent decrease in cost for a company working within that industry), the EES are said to have been achieved. During the last decades, many scientific, analytical, and empirical works have attempted to study the findings of the economies of scale and density in the public road transport sector. In the seventies of the last century, these works were interested in the concept of the substitutability, their total productivity, and the relative concept to price elasticity and costing as well as economies of scale and density. The previous main empirical works were based on cost estimates and production technology that can influence the charging structure in the transport sector. More precisely, these inputs were based on linear cost functions, the CobbDouglas functions, the Keller functions, and the Diwert second order translog arbitrary cost. In this paper, we concern ourselves with Tunisian road transport, that is, with 12 road transport companies. In fact, this study seeks to broaden the knowledge in the impact of the economies of scale and density drawn in the road transport sector in Tunisia. This paper aims to grasp the possibility of a substitutability of the used production factors, in order to highlight the importance of the global productivity achieved in the operation of means of transport for the users and the community. This paper contributes to the previous studies by using methodological developments and discussing policy recommendation about Tunisian transport. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section “Previous Research Finding” focuses in the most relevant research finding in the literature. Section “Methodology and Proposed Approach” deals with the methodology and proposed approach used in the study. Section “The Descriptive Statistics” describes the data. Section “Results and Discussions” presents results and empirical findings. Section “Conclusion and Recommendations” gives some recommendations and concludes this study.",1

National economies are shaped by the regulative, normative, and cognitive structures of a society (Kostova and Zaheer 1999). Consequently, MNEs, which represent a part of each society, involve, and subsequently, reflect through their “internal institutions,” conditions established and developed in the society within its regulative, normative, and cognitive structures. International business (IB) literature has developed different aspects of distance to capture such differences, starting with the concept of psychic distance and cultural distance. Literature on entry mode choice has made a lot of progress and it has recently shifted its focus towards an institutional perspective. As “many researchers (North 1990; Scott 1995) have largely agreed that institutions do matter,” they have tried to find out how exactly institutions influence strategic choices, under which circumstances, to what extent, and in what way. This shift has led to increasing recognition of the significance of institutional distance for the entry mode choice made by MNEs, particularly when entering developed countries (Aguilera and Jackson 2003; Lubatin et al. 2007). However, there is a comparative gap in literature concerning emerging economies, usually marred by weak institutions, even though there are prospects for a promising debate. This paper, combining recent IB advances and the calls to investigate broader aspects of distance (Ghemawat 2007), differs from prior research on entry mode choice in the following: firstly, by studying the impact of substituting administrative by institutional distance in the conceptual CAGE framework; and secondly, by testing how this substitution can affect two specific entry mode choices, namely, a WOS as opposed to joint ventures (JVs) and its various forms, i.e., minority, co-ownership, and majority JV, considering the case of the emerging economy of Turkey. In this framework, what the paper’s theoretical development suggests is, first, that institutional distance, and more particularly, regulative and normative distances, influences MNEs towards a higher level of control in the emerging economy of Turkey within the CIGE (cultural, institutional, geographic, economic) distance framework. Second, geographic distance through historical ties and kilometer differences influences MNEs towards a higher level of control, as well. The study of institutional distance, in combination with WOS vs. JVs through CIGE in the emerging economy of Turkey, provides a useful theoretical and empirical context for two main reasons. First, because the period 2002–2010 signaled the transition of the Turkish institutional environment from the “rhetorical phase and institutional crisis (1989-2001)” (Önis and Bakır 2007, p. 149) to the “Re-regulation phase (2001 onwards)” (Önis and Bakır 2007, p. 149), when a new “era” was inaugurated for the Turkish institutional framework, involving not only setting up new institutions, but also significant increase in the powers of implementation. Second, Turkey’s historical ties with EU and non-EU countries are likely to play an important role in determining the level of control investors decide on when investing in Turkey. Turkey has borders with eight countries and has developed diverse historical ties with several of them, as a consequence of geographic proximity (Makino and Tsang 2010). Therefore, this paper explores the interaction between historical ties and institutional distance and the impact such interaction has on WOS vs. JVs. Overall, this paper makes the following contributions: First, it departs from prior literature on entry mode choice in that the paper tests WOS vs. JVs through the CAGE comprehensive conceptual framework, something that has not been specifically addressed in the IB literature so far. Second, it contributes to entry mode choice literature by recognizing the need for an institutionalism-based entry mode choice concept in the CAGE distance framework, capable of capturing not only administrative and political associations between two countries, as CAGE proposes, but also taking into account the wider institutional context firms decide to enter. Institutional theory recognizes that there is not one but several variants (Scott 1995)—regulative, normative, and cognitive—which can present an in-depth approach to entry mode strategy. So, the replacement of administrative by institutional distance allows us not only to assess the merit of institutional distance through a unified conceptual framework, but also to decipher which specific “variant” of institutional distance mainly affects the entry mode choice. Third, this paper extends prior research (Makino and Tsang 2010; Kedia and Bilgili 2015) by examining historical ties through geographic distance in a relatively less researched host context, namely, Turkey; it explores whether or not historical ties interact with institutional distance, and finally, how historical ties may affect the ownership strategy of an MNE’s entry mode choice into the emerging economy of Turkey. This paper’s modifications are empirically tested through a sample of 245 MNEs, of which 17 are of EU origin and 21 of non-EU origin. The dataset comes from the Republic of Turkey Prime Ministry Investment Support and Promotion Agency (ISPAT) and the econometric testing method is Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR). The period of investigation extends between 2002 and 2010. The rest of the paper is constructed as follows: the next section reviews literature associated with ownership strategies, institutional theory, and geographic distance and presents the composition of the new CIGE framework. Hypotheses development is based on analysis. The econometric methodology has been employed in order to test the validity of the research hypotheses, to describe the sample data utilized when applying the econometric testing, and ultimately, the model constructed. Hypothesis testing presents the results produced by the empirical application of the model. Discussion analytically elaborates on empirical results, while the conclusions focus on theoretical, policy, and managerial implications and present some suggestions for future research.",4

Given the relatively few studies that focus on the interaction between ICT and knowledge, this paper fills the gap in the literature by focusing on Sudan as a new case study and using new primary data on the impact of ICT in transformation and production of knowledge. Different from the limited scope of analysis presented in Nour (2002a, b, 2006), this paper provides more comprehensive analysis of the role of ICT in enhancing knowledge production and transformation in Sudanese universities using the most up-to-date and relevant data. The aim of this paper is twofold; first, to examine the use of ICT at Sudanese universities and, second, to explain the role of ICT in facilitating transformation, connection, access to, production and dissemination of knowledge in Sudanese universities. The impact of the use of ICT, its potential opportunities and challenges are also discussed. The paper aims to test four hypotheses: (1) the use of ICT facilitates connection within knowledge institutions, namely, in Sudanese universities. (2) The use of ICT enhances access, production and the dissemination of knowledge in Sudanese universities. (3) The use of ICT facilitates collaboration between Sudanese universities and international universities. (4) The use of ICT has both positive and negative effects by providing opportunities for the positive transformation and production of knowledge by building connections and organizational changes, but simultaneously also creating negative effect and hazards to transformations and knowledge production by creating disconnection for those who do not know how to use ICT in Sudanese universities and knowledge institutions. In our view, this paper makes a relevant contribution to the literature on ICTs for development because it examines the impact of ICT in connections, transformations, creation and transfer of knowledge in higher education institutions (public and private universities). The results of this paper imply that the intensified use of ICT will contribute to enhancing the production, creation and transfer of knowledge, which in turn contribute to enhancing economic development. Moreover, the findings confirm the role of higher education institutions (public and private universities) through the intensified used of ICT in enhancing the production, creation and transfer of knowledge and hence, enhancing economic development. This paper consists of five sections: “Introduction” presents the background of the study; “Review of Theoretical and Empirical Literature” reviews and discusses the literature on the significance and impact of ICT; “Research Methodology” explains the data and methodology; “Research Results” discusses the findings, examines the hypotheses and shows the main results concerning the potential opportunities and challenges that the use and impact of ICT are introducing in transformation and production of knowledge in Sudanese universities; and “Conclusions” is provided in the last section.",6

Carayannis,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Traditionally, the role of journalism has been to report on innovation processes and, in so doing, take part in the diffusion of a new idea, product, or service (Rogers 1965). However, this may be changing. Journalists are increasingly invited to engage in dialogic innovation processes where they are given the opportunity not only to report on an innovation—a new concept, product, or service—but also to take part in identifying problems and co-creating possible solutions. These developments have the potential to change how journalism operates as an enabler of democratic change. Little research has emerged of collaborations between journalists and other stakeholders in innovation. This may be due to invitation-only policies and the relative novelty of these events. In this article, we analyze the changing role of journalism in the context of social innovation. We investigate a series of multi-stakeholder innovation workshops that took place at The Helsinki Deaconess Institute (HDI), a health care social enterprise, from 2012 to 2014. The objective of these workshops was to engage in reflection with stakeholders about the strategy of HDI, its underlying values, and proceed toward concrete innovations that could revitalize the troubled public social and health care services in Finland. The organizers viewed journalism as a central element in envisioning, communicating, and legitimizing innovations in these services. We see this case as a potentially generalizable example of how professional roles are being redefined in systems of innovation. In this article, we approach this phenomenon by focusing on analyzing the role of journalists in innovation—a group of professionals that has traditionally maintained a detached and disinterested position to news sources and topics. While it is not a new thing for journalists to socialize with sources of news, a possible change in the journalists’ role may be underway through their deeper and systematically facilitated inclusion in the innovation process. For example, the Finnish Innovation Fund, Sitra, has, since 2011, organized educational forums for Finnish decision makers in the fields of business, politics, government, and civil society in order to create and pilot innovative changes in the ways we work, educate, govern, and do business.Footnote 1 Sitra routinely invites journalists to attend these events that usually take the form of several weekend-long workshops. A similar project that facilitates innovative networking of journalists with decision makers and civic leaders is the Rural Academy organized by the Finnish Ministry of Employment and the Economy in 2014 and 2016.Footnote 2 To our knowledge, the role of journalism in such innovation processes is largely unexplored. To be able to benefit from this cooperation, critical research on the opportunities and pitfalls of emerging practices is crucial. The workshops we investigate were partly inspired by, but also further developed versions of, Sitra’s model of multi-stakeholder innovation courses. One author of this article (Heikka) was, as a consultant, part of creating the communication strategies and practices for Sitra’s workshops and participated on a Sitra course as a journalist-entrepreneur in 2013. Furthermore, he was part of a small consulting company that helped the Helsinki Deaconess Institute in conceptualizing and organizing their workshops. This involvement provided us opportunities to learn from an emerging phenomenon from the inside and offered us unlimited access to the data emerging from the workshops. The implications this kind of engagement might have for objectivity of research are discussed in the methods section. In our analysis, we move from the context of a social enterprise, where the innovation is envisioned, to explore how the ideas and pilot projects emerging from the workshops were reported in the media and how the participation of journalists in the workshops affected the mediated results. In the discussion section, we critically reflect on this working model with the help of contemporary literature on participatory journalism practices and innovation systems.",3

That means that managers have a large opportunity for discretion and decisions allowing them to make public or not the accounting and financial information. The information quality has become a key area in accounting and knowledge management literature due to the high signal-to-noise ratio of non-essential content in knowledge and information diffusion and the lack of the information quality measurement (Hu et al. 1997). Thus, the strategy of voluntary disclosure is not a fortuitous act related to the forgotten mandatory disclosure, but in accounting it is considered a policy instrument that aims to reach certain objectives. Based on the idea that a good corporate governance guarantee is financial disclosure with a high level of quality, the firm should put in place a good strategic corporate governance that assures the protection of the stakeholder against managers’ opportunism. In this context several studies support that the audit quality helps a firm to enhance voluntary disclosure in annual reports (Datar et al. 1991; Piot and Janin 2004; Chalmers and Godfrey 2004; Mohd Ghazali and Weetman 2006; and Martins et al. 2016). Financial disclosure in annual reports has become the number one issue for accounting research, and, more specifically, voluntary disclosure has received a lot of attention from academicians, and much research is done both in developed in different contexts (Firth 1979; Bradbury 1992; Raffournier 1995; Smaili et al. 2009). The annual report is considered the significant element in overall disclosure practice because it is the most widely disseminated source of financial information on publicly held corporations (Arnold et al. 1984). However, voluntary disclosure in annual reports represent a resource in the nature of financial information beyond the required content in financial statements (Lakhal 2005; Kumar et al. 2008). Voluntary disclosure is to disclose more information than indicated by the law and is based on managerial incentives (Healy and Palepu 2001). The main question of this research is how far the audit quality characteristics influence the decision to make more voluntary information in the annual reports of listed companies in Tunisia. The principal objectives of this research are firstly to evaluate the level of voluntary disclosure in the annual reports of the listed companies in the Tunisian Securities Exchange (TSE) and secondly to examine the relationship between a number of characteristics of audit quality (Big 4, joint audit, and industry specialization) and the level of voluntary disclosure of these companies. Tunisia is a developing country, with an emerging capital market established in 1969 and has currently (as of June 2016) 83 listed firms, and whose economic environment has been subject to major changes in recent years. In this country, financial disclosure constitutes an under-regulated field that helps users evaluate management performance, lighten their perception of the firm, and evaluate the future profitability of their own investment. Several Tunisian firms do not disclose sufficient information in their annual reports. The empirical results conducted in the present context indicate that membership of the listeners to an international network audit, ""Big 4"", improves the voluntary disclosed information. In addition to the size of the audit network ""Big 4"", we found that the industry specialization of audit firms positively influences the level of voluntary disclosure published by the company. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: the following section will be designed to present literature review. The third section will present the theoretical framework of audit quality and voluntary disclosure and the development of our hypothesis. The research method will be exposed in the fourth section, while the fifth section presents the findings and discussion. The last section includes our conclusions.",5

Nevertheless, information is sometimes misused or not used in both public (e.g., Jansen 2008; Van Dooren and Van de Walle, 2008) and private sectors (e.g., Boulding et al. 1997). Misuse and non-use have consequences for decision-making and thus for utility. Deciding between mutually exclusive actions lies at the heart of decision-making, and information often provides facts about the costs related to different action options. The concept of opportunity costs has been used to describe all real costs associated with different choices of action, including the loss of money, time, energy, and a derived pleasure/utility. In this study, it is argued that the decision maker sometimes assesses opportunity costs incorrectly because information is misused or is not searched properly. Unfortunately, previous research has not developed a cost concept that describes the negative value of an incorrect decision caused by the non-use or misuse of information. Thus, the first aim of this research is to develop such a concept. It is also claimed here that information system dysfunctions relating to information non-use and misuse have been underexamined in the field of information economics. Therefore, the second objective is to develop a concept that describes these types of information system dysfunctions. The third purpose is to clarify the distinction between information and knowledge asymmetries, a third topic that has not been addressed properly in previous literature. The precise research questions are the following: How should the costs arising from information non-use and misuse be defined? What factors contribute to information non-use and misuse, and how do they do so? How does information asymmetry differ from knowledge asymmetry? The research method is based on constructivist epistemology (cf. Guba and Lincoln 1998) and the logic of abductive reasoning (cf. Peirce 1998). This means that the new concepts constructed in this research are derived from previous scientific arguments describing either the dysfunctional information uses and their meanings to decision makers or the opportunity costs relating to actions. This study utilizes some of the most relevant and important arguments from previous research traditions to construct new theoretical concepts and mental models that justify these concepts. For this reason, an exploratory literature review is conducted, in which comprehensiveness is not as important as the focus on the research questions. In this type of review, the researcher examines the literature to find novel ideas and insights. A model of information systems described by Joos (2000: 7) is used to detect their components. Described in Fig. 1, these components (or themes in other words) guide the information search by pointing out the possible sources of dysfunctions. This research simply searches dysfunctions relating to these information system components. To understand the information expectation gap (IEG), knowledge asymmetries, and infonomic costs (ICs), previous theoretical and empirical results from psychology, economics, computer sciences, philosophy, and information sciences are utilized. If future research wants to understand non-use and misuse better, this type of synthesis is useful because it collects together dispersed information from causes leading to non-use and misuse and points out to new research directions in empirical settings examining these causes together. Sources of information system dysfunctions (source: author’s own conceptualization) This research contributes to the current literature by developing three new theoretical concepts in economics—knowledge asymmetry, ICs, and the IEG. The IEG helps in understanding the use, non-use, and misuse of information. It also clarifies how imperfect information can be and what factors in information systems cause problems to knowledge sharing (cf. Obeso and Sarabia 2016), transfer (cf. Powell and Snellman 2004; Janicot et al. 2016), and management (cf. Ahmad et al. 2015). Additionally, the IEG provides reasons why information asymmetries, knowledge asymmetries, and ICs can arise and why these market dysfunctions exist although signaling, screening, and other methods are used to balance information asymmetries. For academics, this study offers new theoretical concepts and research topics to be addressed in future research endeavors. Practitioners can use the theoretical framework underlying the concepts to improve the operation of information systems and to troubleshoot these in general. This article is divided into four sections. The first section briefly explains the main concepts used in this study. The second section depicts the components of an IEG and the mechanism that creates it. The third section deepens the understanding of how the IEG comes into existence. The last section presents the conclusions.",2

Asongu,Vanessa S. Tchamyou,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"The globalization phenomenon is today an ineluctable process which can be ignored only by sacrificing the progress of nations. It has been become abundantly clear that for nations to be competitive and involved with the global economy, they have to keep up with the rules of competition that characterize globalization. Competition in the twenty-first century is substantially centred on knowledge economy (KE), which has been a key theme in World Bank and the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reports since the beginning of the third millennium (Tchamyou 2016). These dynamics of KE have been well understood by developed countries (e.g., Europe and North America) which are inexorably charting the pattern of development in the international arena. In calculated steps, Asia and Latin America have been increasingly articulating KE in their implementation of regional and national programs (Dahlman 2007; Chandra and Yokoyama 2011). The pattern of the Japanese KE has set the course for Malaysia, China and the Newly Industrialized Economies of Asia (Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea), which have been experiencing a remarkable transition from ‘product-based economies’ to ‘knowledge-based economies’. In light of the above, there has been growing interest in the relevance of KE in developing countries, especially those in Africa: a continent which has been documented to be lagging substantially in terms of KE relative to other regions of the world (Anyanwu 2012). Currents in this stream of KE literature have included, inter alia: (i) general discourses on KE (Aubert 2005; Rooney 2005; Lin 2006; Makinda 2007; Anyanwu 2012); (ii) education (Weber 2011; Kamara et al. 2007; Amavilah 2009; Ford 2007; Oluwatobi and Olurinola 2015); (iii) indigenous knowledge systems (Lwoga et al. 2010; Raseroka 2008); (iv) communication and information technologies (Maurer 2008; Jonathan and Camilo 2008; Aker and Mbiti 2010; Ondiege 2010; Chavula 2010; Merritt 2010; Butcher 2011; Thacker and Wright 2012; Penard et al. 2012; Demombynes and Thegeya 2012; Asongu 2013a, 2014a); (v) economic incentives and institutional regime (Andrés and Asongu 2013a; Cogburn 2003; Letiche 2006); (vi) innovation (Oyelaran-Oyeyinka and Sampath 2007; Carisle et al. 2013; Oluwatobi et al. 2015); (vii) intellectual capital and economic development (Wagiciengo and Belal 2012; Preece 2013); (viii) research and development (Sumberg 2005; German and Stroud 2007); (ix) intellectual property rights (Zerbe 2005; Lor and Britz 2005; Myburgh 2011; Asongu 2013b, 2015a; Andrés and Asongu 2013a, b; Andrés et al. 2015); (x) spatiality in knowledge production (Bidwell et al. 2011; Neimark 2012); (xi) KE in the transformation of space (Moodley 2003; Maswera et al. 2008); (xii) KE related to finance (Asongu 2013c, 2014b, 2015b) and (xiii) KE convergence or catch-up in light of the development miracle from East Asia (Kim et al. 2012; Bezmen and Depken 2004; Andrés et al. 2015; Andrés and Asongu 2013a, b; Asongu 2015b, c, 2013d, e). There has also been an evolving literature on the effect of development assistance on development outcomes in the African continent. Some recent studies include (i) Gyimah-Brempong and Racine (2014) and Kargbo and Sen (2014) on the positive impact of development assistance on economic growth and (ii) the potentially questionable economics of development assistance with notable works from Banuri (2013), Krause (2013), Ghosh (2013), Monni and Spaventa (2013), Wamboye et al. (2013), Titumir and Kamal (2013), Quartey and Afful-Mensah (2014) and Asongu (2014c, 2015d, e). Consistent with Amin (2014), foreign aid to developing countries could be principally motivated by neocolonialism. Quartey and Afful-Mensah (2014) have established that there is need for African countries to reconsider their overly reliance on foreign aid by assessing alternative sources of finance. The stances of Afful-Mensah, Amin and Quartey are in line with (i) Ndlovu-Gatsheni (2013) on the entrapment of Africa into neocolonial ‘foreign aid influential webs’ and (ii) Kindiki (2011) on the imperative for Africa to limit its overly dependence on foreign aid. Obeng-Odoom (2013) has recommended that foreign aid oriented policies should be based essentially on the fundamental needs of citizens in recipient nations. The position of Obeng-Odoom is shared by Arthur and Quartey (2008) who have expressed the need for a more holistic approach to foreign aid location decisions: an approach that takes into account all stakeholders in international policies for migration management. Noticeable in the above literature and to the best of our knowledge, very few studies have assessed the relevance of foreign aid in KE in developing countries. As far as we have reviewed, studies closest to this line of inquiry are Asiedu and Nandwa (2007); Preece (2013) and Asiedu (2014). Asiedu and Nandwa (2007) have investigated if development assistance in education affects economic growth by disaggregating data into (i) primary, secondary and tertiary education and (ii) low-and middle-income countries. The study finds that the impact of foreign aid varies (in sign and magnitude) depending on the type of aid and income category. Preece (2013) has engaged the nexus between the international agenda for lifelong learning and financial aid to low-income nations (especially those from Africa) to show that international aid priorities negatively affect government policies and choices for lifelong learning in recipient countries. Asiedu (2014) has examined if foreign aid in education significantly influences growth in Sub-Saharan Africa to conclude that aid in education (especially primary schooling) broadly has a positive effect on growth. In light of the above, this study contributes to the KE and foreign aid literature by investigating the effect of foreign aid on education and lifelong learning in 53 African countries for the period 1996–2010. Lifelong learning is measured as the combined knowledge acquired during the primary, secondary and tertiary levels of education. Foreign aid dynamics include total aid, aid from multilateral donors (MD) and aid from the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) countries. The empirical evidence is based on an endogeneity-robust generalized method of moments. We also contribute to the existing literature by introducing a measure of lifelong learning in African countries. This is essentially because, despite textual African-related foreign aid and lifelong learning literature (Preece 2013), a measure of lifelong learning with which to extend the underlying literature is missing. After exploring a substantial bulk of literature on education and lifelong learning, Tuijnman (2003) has concluded that an all-inclusive lifelong learning indicator could only be comprehensively derived in the distant future: “But given the current state of play of the social sciences, and in particular of survey practice and indicator measurement, the time when a holistic and comprehensive framework of lifelong learning indicators can be proposed lies far in the future” (p. 471). Moreover, “To date only two macro level studies, i.e. the European Lifelong Learning Indicators (ELLI) instrument developed by the EU (2010) and the Composite Learning Index (CLI) instrument developed by the Canadian Council on Learning (undated.), have dealt with this issue” (Luo 2015, p. 19). While the ELLI is exclusively focused on European countries, the CLI is Canada’s indicator for progress in lifelong learning. Consistent with Asongu and Nwachuku (2015), these two indicators consist of dimensions of ‘learning to be’, ‘learning to live together’, ‘learning to do’ and ‘learning to know’. There are two principal drawbacks in the application of these indicators to African countries: (i) they are exclusively focused on Canada and European countries and (ii) to the best of our knowledge, only data on the dimension of learning to know is available for African countries. Hence, lifelong learning within the framework of this study is defined as the combined knowledge acquired during primary, secondary and tertiary educational levels. The interest of examining the effect of foreign aid on education and lifelong learning is at least fourfold, notably: (i) the critical role of lifelong learning in Africa when the continent is lagging in terms of knowledge economy (KE) which is essential for twenty-first century economic prosperity; (ii) contributing to the growing debates on the effects of foreign aid; (iii) extending a new stream of learning literature and (iv) engaging a new paradigm on ‘soft economics’ which has been built on foreign aid misallocation and growing poverty levels in Africa. First, the relevance of lifelong learning in African KE is crucial because, there is some growing disturbing evidence that the knowledge index of the continent has dropped during the period 2000 to 2009 and remains substantially below those of other regions in the world (Anyanwu 2012). This has led to a growing stream of studies on KE that are essentially motivated by the need for more KE on the continent (Tchamyou 2016; Asongu 2015c). Second, complementary to the foreign aid literature engaged above, international aid policies are distorting lifelong learning policies in African countries (Preece 2013). Third, the paper extends an interesting strand of studies on achieving development success based on learning from different activities (Nyarko 2013) or success strategies (Lee 2009; Lee and Kim 2009; Wa Gĩthĩnji and Adesida 2011; Babatunde 2012; Fosu 2013). Fourth, we engage a new paradigm on soft economics which has been built on foreign aid misallocation and growing poverty levels in Africa. Accordingly, the April 2015 World Bank report on Millennium Development Goals has revealed that extreme poverty has been decreasing in all regions of the world with the exception of Africa (Word Bank 2015; Caulderwood 2015), in spite of over two decades of growth resurgence that began in the mid 1990s (Fosu 2015a, p. 44). The concern about exclusive growth in Africa has motivated a recent book by Kuada (2015) which proposes a new paradigm of soft economics as means to understanding African development trends.Footnote 1 Kuada (2015) has postulated that the introduction of human capability development and emphasis on soft economics as opposed to ‘strong economics’ (or structural adjustment policies) are crucial in assessing and understanding recent trends in African development that have been characterized by exclusive growth, high unemployment and increasing poverty levels. The narrative of Kuada (2015) on soft economics for inclusive growth, poverty alleviation and employment in Africa is consistent with a recent stream of African development literature that has focused on the imperative to tailor development assistance towards alternative mechanisms in order to ultimately boost employment, improve human resources and reduce poverty (Page and Shimeles 2015; Page and Shimeles 2015; Jones et al. 2015; Asongu 2015f; Jones and Tarp 2015; Page and Söderbom 2015). In light of the above, four problems boldly standout, notably: (i) Africa’s lagging position in knowledge acquisition in spite of the growing relevance of KE in twenty-first century development; (ii) the conclusions of Preece (2013) that need to be empirically verified; (iii) the need to extend a growing stream of literature on using foreign aid for soft economics in view of improving human resources that are essential for poverty reduction and increasing employment and (iv) the absence of an indicator of lifelong learning for developing countries. Hence, the objective of this inquiry is to assess the effect of foreign aid on education and lifelong learning in Africa. Three main issues are assessed, notably: (i) the effect of aid on education; (ii) the incremental impact of aid on education and (iii) the effect of aid on lifelong learning. The rest of the study is organized as follows. “Design and Methods” section discusses the data and the methodology. The empirical results are covered in “Empirical results” section. “Conclusion and future directions” section concludes.",44

These revolutions caused the emergence of new sources of growth and creation of values materialized by the intangible assets. Trade and capital flows have become deregulated. International trade and intangible investment now play a leading role in the economy of the countries compared to the past 20 years. The result of the change is a high economy called knowledge economy (KE), which was able to obtain various appointments such as post-industrial society, information society, innovation economy, knowledge economy, economy of networks, digital economy, and E-economy. Every appointment deserves to be translated by different aspects of structural change which the world of business has experienced. However, research dealing with this new era is still in its embryonic phase. Indeed, the value of companies is traditionally estimated from the material wealth they hold. In the context of the knowledge economy (KE), these elements are no longer enough to estimate this value. We speak about new sources—called immaterial—of value creation. In this work, we target four objectives: first, to test the ability of accounting and financial data to give a reliable measure of the performance of firms in the (KE), by drawing on classical performance measuring models; second, to check whether to disclose information on intangibles to allow better estimates and speculate on firm performance; and third, a trustworthy and relevant measure to the overall performance of firms in the (KE). We, then, ask about the characteristics of the knowledge economy and in order to assess its impact on the economic development, in particular, the valuation of the financial performance of firms. The present study is looking for reliable measures of the performance of firms which are operating in the new economy. The failure of accounting and financial data leads us to add other information. These pieces of information are related to intangible capital which is the main source of value creation for firms in the (KE); however, they are ignored in traditional metrics. The field of intangibles includes elements such as human capital, trademarks, goodwill, skills, customer satisfaction, and efforts of research and development. These elements must be taken into account to give a reliable assessment of the performance of firms. Nevertheless, the intangible elements, without physical or intangible substance, are difficultly taken into account by old accounting methods. Moreover, they are the weak link of accounting information, especially in the particular context of the knowledge economy. The utility of traditional accounting metrics is then questioned. We have tried within this work to find an answer to the following question: Is there an alternative to accounting and financial measures to measure the overall performance of firms operating in the knowledge economy? We have tested the relationship between the accounting and financial data and the market value of firms which are operating in the particular context of the knowledge economy. Subsequently, we test the contribution of data on intangible capital in new sources of value creation and this is by adding them to traditional accounting metrics. The data in question are simultaneously human capital, structural capital, and customer capital. The work performed around our problem tries to define a model that reflects the overall performance of firms of the (KE), by adding information about the intangibles to the old accounting data. We chose the context of Tunisia, given the small number of works dealing with this issue in this context. The data are taken from the site of the Tunis Stock Exchange (TSE). We have developed a literature review of the works that dealt with this issue. Then, we presented the conceptual framework of the study and the hypotheses to be tested. Finally, we have spread out our research methodology and key results we found.",9

The cognitive component of many products is now more important than other physical components. Moreover, human and social capital have become the most important types of capital for companies and communities. Building a knowledge society provides many development effects. It leads to a higher quality of education level through providing a public space for learning, exchange, and use of information and communications technology. Moreover, it increases capacity to access to knowledge and create wealth in the community. In addition, it develops the technological infrastructure and innovative capabilities through promoting innovative initiatives. On the other hand, building a knowledge-based economy also has developmental effects such as encouraging innovative activities with high productivity which means an increase in the income level. Also, it improves the quality of health services, as a result of improvement in the level of used technology, increases productivity in the education sector due to the spread of the mechanisms of continuous learning which develop workers’ skills in knowledge-based industries, and achieves environmental sustainability. There is a dialectical relationship between knowledge society and knowledge economy, with which we cannot imagine having knowledge economy without being accompanied with a knowledge society. Knowledge society facilitates exchanging, using, and distributing knowledge between individuals and institutions, which in turn increases the productivity of various activities of knowledge economy. Since the relationship between knowledge economy and knowledge society is dialectic, the following question arises: which is the most important and should come first: knowledge society or knowledge economy in the developing economy of Russia? One point of view suggests that there is no possibility to build a knowledge economy without starting with a knowledge society where the community uses high technologies and is able to work effectively within the knowledge economy activities. On contrast, another point of view considers building knowledge economy as a priority, since individuals who are working in the knowledge economy activities constitute social circles or public space in the community “for exchanging and circulating the knowledge and new information and communication technologies, those are intensively used to codify and transmit the new knowledge” (David and Foray 2003). However, large transitions to knowledge society or economy do not occur equally around the world because of cognitive disparity between developed countries and emerging and developing countries. This disparity is due to many social, economic, and political factors which control each type of those countries. For example, the cognitive production levels and mechanisms of creating value in developed countries are more advanced than in emerging and developing countries. Also, the map distribution of cognitive centers in the world illustrates the great disparity in the density of cognitive activities between developed countries and emerging and developing countries. The internal problems of emerging and developing countries that emerge in the context of the transition to the knowledge economy and society are different from those in the developed countries. For instance, the transition process suffers from many difficulties associated with factors related to physical technological infrastructure and social and economic conditions prevailing in those countries. In addition, the development strategies followed by developing countries do not focus enough on operations that improve development process output while building knowledge economy and society. This study is one of the first studies that examine the impact of the knowledge society on the development process during the process of transition to a knowledge-based economy. We examine the interactive relationship between building a knowledge society and the process of transition towards a knowledge economy.",13

As evidenced in the recent financial crises, countries are becoming more and more interdependent (Tezcan 2009; Belka 2009a; Dhameja 2010; Staehr 2010a; Stephen and Enisse 2012, 2015). The problems which arise in a sector may affect other areas and have an impact beyond the borders. In the light of economic and financial stability, there is no country “island.” As well known, the global financial crisis exposed fundamental weaknesses in financial systems worldwide. This kind of crisis exposed a number of structural problems and had a significant impact on the developed and developing economies such as unsustainable levels of public or private debt or declining competitiveness (Cali et al. 2008; Marco 2008 ; Belka 2009a, Belka 2009b; Tezcan 2009; Dietz and Protsky 2009; Dhameja 2010; Staehr 2010a; Staehr 2010b; Terazi and Senel 2011). The global challenge is to limit the consequences of this financial turmoil already evident, on the real economy, to preserve the long-term financing and investment necessary to initiate a global economic governance to rebuild a stable and socially acceptable. Over the past few decades, several studies have been done to establish how the financial markets stability might be affected by the economic and financial crises, but little previous research has assessed what might happen to global financial systems (e.g., King and Levine 1993; Devarajan, Swaroop, and Zou 1996; Levine and Zervos 1996, 1998; Borenztein et al. 1998; Beck, Levine, and Loayza 2000; Beck and Levine 2001, 2004; Rioja and Valen 2002). Financial crises and their countermeasures have pronounced and unintended effects in financial regulation and supervision proved devastating to the stability of financial institutions. However, King and Levine (1992, 1993) have focused on the relationship between financial development and economic growth. They concluded, from a cross-sectional study, that beyond the positive relationship between the two variables that financial development can well predict the economic growth in the 10–30 years to come. They also found that a high level of financial development was associated with a further improvement the rate of accumulation and efficiency in terms of capital allocation. Devarajan, Swaroop, and Zou (1996) examined the relationship between the level of public expenditure and economic growth, using panel data from 43 developing countries over 20 years. The results indicate that there is evidence of a negative relationship between per capita growth and the capital component of public expenditure. Furthermore, the study makes evident that an increase in the share of current expenditure has a positive and significant impact on economic growth. In the same line of ideas, Borenztein et al. (1998) examined the impact of foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth, using data on FDI flows from industrial countries to 69 developing countries over the last 20 years. The study suggests that FDI contributes to economic growth only when a sufficient absorptive capability of the advanced technologies is available in the host economy. In addition, these results prove that the higher productivity of FDI holds only when the host country has a minimum threshold stock of human capital. In the same thought, Beck, Levine, and Loayza (2000) found that the short-run relationship between financial development indicators is positive with the rate of economic growth, the rate of capital accumulation, and total factor productivity, while it is still ambiguous with the private savings rate. The study of Rioja and Valen (2002) suggests that financial development may affect economic growth in low-income countries through capital accumulation, while in high-income countries is the increased productivity which serves belt transmission. In fact, most of the previous studies which have focused on the relationship between financial development and economic growth often used ratios measuring the state of the banking system. These measures conceal a part of the recorded financial development over these recent years in many developing countries have resulted in a rise of the financial markets in the case of stock exchanges especially in the emerging countries. As well to better identify the financial development, various existing studies incorporate indicators of measuring the size and liquidity of the stock market. The works of Levine and Zervos (1996, 1998) and Beck and Levine (2001) provide evidence that the development of stock markets is an indicator that predicts good prospects for economic growth. At the same current literature, Bekaert, Harvey, and Lundblad (2005) show that the economies that have liberalized their stock markets have high economic growth rates. The work of Henry (2000) concluded from the methodology of event studies that the liberalization of stock markets positively affects the level of private investment. Although the cleavage between “financial system oriented market” and “financial system oriented bank” seems to be exceeded (Jacquet and Pollin 2007), since the banks contribute actively to the development of stock markets, and the two systems will dread more easily in a logic of complementarities. Tadesse (2002) suggests that financial systems dominated by banks are more favorable to growth in underdeveloped countries financially, whereas in the developed countries financially, the oriented systems market would be most promising growth. By against, Atje and Jovanovic (1993) found that the indicators of the banking sector are less correlated to investment performance than those of the stock market. Many arguments making reference to the sources and nature of financial instability have been developed to show the weak link or the negative impact of financial development on economic growth. In fact, several existing studies have recognized the incontestable association between financial development and financial instability (Demirgüç-Kunt and Detragiache 1998, Kaminsky and Reinhart 1999, Hung 2001, Guillaumont and Kpodar 2004; Loayza and Ranciere 2004). If it is known that financial instability is detrimental to economic growth, one can conclude that financial development and financial instability may penalize economic growth. However, Beck and Levine (2004) examined the financial system stability effect on economic growth over the period of 1976–1998, by verifying the incidence of the banking and stock exchange sector on the economy growth for 40 countries. The results reveal that the stock exchange and the banking system affect positively and significantly the economic growth. The results of Guillaumont and Kpodar (2004) study suggest that financial liberalization is a good determinant that can promote financial stability and financial development to achieve economic development, taking into account attention to changes in the political and economic environment. In the same field, Wan-Chun and Chen-Min (2006), Mario (2006), Fu-Sheng Hung (2009), and Eggoh (2010) have highlighted the interaction between financial developments and economic growth and recognizing the essential role that the real sector plays in economic growth. In a similar vein, Eggoh (2010) examined the link between financial development, financial stability, and economic growth using simultaneous equation models with both panel and time series econometric techniques for 71 countries. The findings suggest that, in long term, financial instability does not have predictive power on economic growth and the relationship between the latter and financial development. But in short term, financial instability has a negative impact on the relationship between financial development and economic growth. However, despite their evidences reveal the negative impact of financial instability on the relationship between financial development and growth, their conclusions are no longer limited in the short term. In addition, the study of Wahyoe, Fouad, and Amine (2011) observed that the big power of the market on the banking sector results in bigger instability. While banks are better capitalized in less competitive markets, their risk of defect remains high. A profound investigation shows, however, that such a behavior depends on the economic environment. Economic growth contributes to neutralization risk-taking and annihilates the instability in the less competitive markets. We propose in this study a deepening of the work by analyzing the three-way linkages between financial stability, monetary policy, and economic growth in both developed and developing countries over the period of 1993–2015. The paper is structured as follows. The “Data and Methods”section presents the data description and econometric model. The “Results” section discusses the estimation results. The “Conclusions” section summarizes the main results.",14

In this context, in March 2013, the Tunisian Monitoring Centre and Business Intelligence (Centre Tunisien de Veille et d’Intelligence Économique, CTVIE) claims that considering the capacity utilization rate, 66.7% of manufacturing firms operate at lower levels than their expected capacity, and only 4.8% report higher operation levels. This relative weakness in the rate of capacity utilization does not seem—at least for 65% of the companies—to affect their production level. Capacity utilization rates account for the difference between the actual and the potential outputs and thus reflect the imbalance degree between the potential supply and the demand for goods. They allow a better analysis of the companies’ investment behavior, the changes in the productivity of the production factors, the storage behavior, and the evolution of inflation as well as foreign trade coverage rates. The comparison over a long period of capacity utilization or, equivalently, the excess capacity margins between sectors or enterprises size classes highlights permanent structural differences, referring to the offer conditions, i.e., the production organization, the capital intensity, and more or less the demand variable feature. The installed capacities are broadly related to the volume of global production and demand for outputs after primary and secondary processing. However, most sectors have always registered under-capacity utilization records. The average of sectoral capacity utilization disparity is relatively high. The production conditions difficulties and the companies’ average size are, in this context, largely discriminatory. The capacity utilization rate varies for certain branches depending on the annual production fluctuations. Despite some improvements in the capacity utilization rates recorded by the Tunisian industry, this industry cannot make optimal use of its production potential. Nevertheless, the question of the capacity utilization rate seems to be crucial for us, especially in the case of the influence of the production capacity under-utilization on the investment decision. From this point of view, understanding the companies’ production capacity enables them to define their limits and opportunities in terms of competitiveness. The capacity output of a firm can be defined in many alternative ways. It is a measure of the maximum quantity of the output that a firm can produce from a given bundle of quasi-fixed inputs even when other (variable) inputs are available without any restriction. According to Johansen (1968), this definition is intuitively very interesting. After all, even when labor, material, and energy are available in unlimited quantities, a firm can produce only a finite quantity of output from its plant and equipment of any given size. The actual output produced must be less than or equal to this capacity output. Therefore, the capacity utilization (CU) is simply the ratio of the current production and the level of the production capacity. Being less than 100% CU may be due either to insufficient demand faced by the firm, which makes production restricted to a level below the capacity, or to the shortage of certain essential inputs (for example, energy) that inhibits production even when the product demand is sufficient. Cassels (1937), however, defined the capacity output as the level of production where the average cost curve reaches its minimum at the long run. Therefore, since the average cost is considered at the long run, no input can be held as fixed over time. In the nonparametric literature, Färe et al. (1989) and Ray (2015) provide a nonparametric model to measure the physical production capacity and the associated CU rates in the presence of fixed inputs. However, there is no comparable parametric model. An apparent reason for this lack of a parametric measure of (physical) CU is that, except for Leontief-type production functions, the marginal product of any variable inputs always remains strictly positive. Therefore, even if some inputs remain fixed, production continues to increase with the increase of the variable inputs consumption. However, for the economic measure of the production capacity level and the CU, the case is quite the opposite. In the case of a parametrically specified cost function, we consider the general appropriate first-order condition to minimize the average total cost in order to determine the relevant level of the output. This is not possible in the nonparametric analysis. In the existing literature on data envelopment analysis model (DEA), considerable attention is devoted to measure the scale efficiency (e.g., Färe et al. 1994). We can solve the appropriate DEA models to determine if the actual firm production level minimizes the average total cost and how far its average total cost could be reduced by an appropriate change in the level of the output. Literature does not, however, explain how to determine the output level that minimizes the average total cost of a firm in the presence of a vector of input prices. The present paper aims to formulate an estimation method based on the DEA for an efficient production level in the single output case. We consider both the long- and the short-run average total cost curves. To determine the minimum of the long-run average total cost curve, we assume the hypothesis of the variable returns to scale. In fact, both constant and variable returns to scale are considered for the short run when an input is held fixed. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The second section is a theoretical review about the foundation of the nonparametric production approach. The third section presents the relevant DEA models to find out the minimum point of the long-run average total cost curve with variable returns to scale, the minimum of the short-run average total cost curve under the assumption of the long-run constant returns to scale, and also the model which helps find the physical production capacity level for a given level of quasi-fixed inputs. The fourth section suggests an empirical application for the Tunisian manufacturing and presents the main interpretations. The last section is dedicated to draw the main conclusions.",6

The 2011 revolution has highlighted the fragility of the Tunisian economy and underpins put additional pressure on the country’s economy. In fact, many events have threatened the Tunisian economy and urge the economists to better develop the monetary policy (Abdelli and Belhadj, 2015). Note for example, the evolution of inflation from 4.9% in 2014 to 5.6% in 2015 (the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT, 2015). In the mid-2007, Tunisia has acknowledged an acceleration of the real GDP of 5% and a significant reduction of inflation (i.e. 2%) due to the monetary tightening. Noteworthy, however, and after the end of 2013, the BCT underlined that the economic growth rate went down to 2.4 from 3.7% in 2012. The deterioration of the situation was essentially in relation with the downturn in business that affected some sectors, mainly those of agriculture and fishing as well as the manufacturing industry. In 2014, this rate was established at 2.3%. As of the inflation rate, it continuously increased and set at 4.5 and 5.6% in 2014 and 2015, respectively. This difficult situation has exposed the inability of the BCT of Tunisia to achieve its primary objective of price stability. Therefore, the economic stability has acquired a growing interest in the Tunisian monetary authority. Hence, our paper’s primary goal is to criticize the inability of the latter to stabilize the economy. This paper also intends to analyze the dynamics of monetary policy in Tunisia during the last decade and seeks to explain the main factors that prevented the economic stability. To do so, we estimate a Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium model (DSGE). In particular, DSGE models are powerful tools that provide a coherent framework for policy discussion and analysis (Tovar, 2009). Under this view, the DSGE model has the advantage of the agents’ behaviors to explain some of the peculiarities of the banking and better simulate the intervention of the central banks (M Del Negro and Schorfheide, 2012). Background studies carried out in this context, affirmed that the monetary policy can be well estimated by the DSGE models. The incorporation of nominal rigidities helps to more explain the effects of monetary policy on output and prices (Boivin and Giannoni, 2003; Lubik and Chorfheide, 2004; Juillard, Karam, Laxton and Pesenti, 2006; Galí, 2010; Adjemian and Devulder, 2011). While, there is a substantial literature on the Tunisian monetary policy, the application of DSGE models within the Tunisian context is scarce (Ben Aissa and Rebei, 2012; Lahouel, Ben Slimane and Ben Tahar, 2012; Jouini and Rebei, 2013; Abdelli and Belhadj, 2015). It is worth noting that the approach presented in this paper differs from the previous literature for two several reasons. First, the model is developed in a framework of a small open economy.Footnote 1 Second, Bayesian techniques are used to estimate our model (Vangu, 2014; Smets and Wouters, 2003, 2004, 2007). As mentioned (Smets and Wouters, 2007; An. and Schorfheide, 2007), this methodology overcomes many current standard difficulties in estimating macroeconomic models incorporating the beliefs of the researcher as additional information. Furthermore, this approach has become the most popular in the recent macroeconomic literature, since it allows taking into account of the prior beliefs on parameters from the literature or experience of the practitioner. Indeed, these techniques can overcome many common difficulties in the estimation of macroeconomic models. This empirical quantification method relies on an initial appeal for the calibration of the parameters (Francesco Sergi, 2014; Coupet and Renne, 2008; Mankiw, 2010). By using a Bayesian approach, we can easily analyze the economic policy and forecast (Geweke, 1998). However, taking a Bayesian estimation in our models is for several reasons. First, As discussed in (Leeper and Zha, 2000), it takes advantage of the general equilibrium approach estimation of reduced-form equations. Second, it outperforms General Method of Moments (GMM) and maximum likelihood (ML), in small samples. Third, even in the case of misspecified models, Bayesian estimation and model comparison are consistent (Fernendez-Villaverde and Rubio-RamÌrez, 2004). Bayesian approach, therefore, combines a sound, micro-founded structure suitable for macroeconomic policy analysis with a good forecasting performance (Smets and Wouters, 2007). We also contribute to the broader literature emphasizing the sticky prices (Calvo, 1983) and sticky wages to analyze and criticize the failure of Tunisia’s central bank to stabilize the economy in the post-revolution period. The rest of the paper has the following structure: a brief description of the equations of the model in section 2, the specification of data selection methodology, sources, model calibration, determination of priors and estimation results in section 3, conclusions, and further research in section 5.",2

It accepts deposits that are considered free-interest loans for customers, and therefore, are guaranteed. Actually, the Islamic bank plays the role of a vis-à-vis investment manager of depositors. The capital participation and funding of current and fixed assets are an integral part of the bank’s operations. Therefore, this bank is a financial institution that collects funds and invests within the framework of Sharia.Footnote 1 It follows that the refusal of usury transactions is a key pillar in the work of Islamic banks. The City UK (2011) argues that the assets of Islamic banks (including Islamic windows of conventional banks) dropped from $ 1,041bn, at the end of 2009, to $ 947bn, in 2008. This would be amplified by 10 to 15% in 2010 amounted to about 1.5% of the global financial assets (Financial Times 2011). Therefore, faced with the multiplicities of financial crises, especially the 2008 severe financial “subprime crisis”, Islamic finance has known a recent growth. In this case, Islamic banking has shown a remarkable development in recent years, therefore, there is much focus on Islamic products. At the global level, Karyotis et al. (2009) argue that “Islamic banks, unlike their conventional counterparts, have shown some stability and resistance against crisis.” Islamic finance is intended for investors who wish to obey the laws of “sharia” that govern the daily lives of Muslims. It incites all parties to conclude a transaction which shares the profit or loss (Willison 2009; and Hasan and Dridi 2010). It further selects projects and invests in less risky ones. Its main interest is to maximize the profitability of the productive project, unlike conventional finance, which has no engagement in the productive sphere once the loan is granted. Within the framework of Islamic finance, any credit is backed by a real asset. Securitization, which is the practice of transferring the risk of a claim to another investor, is similar to a debt sale which is prohibited by the Islamic law (Ozturk 2008). Various advantages make Islamic finance a more reliable and efficient framework for some cases as it excludes risky financial operations. It encourages investors to intervene in the market without fearing the shortcomings of conventional finance. Therefore, there have been a lot of debates on the relationship between Islamic finance and stability during the recent global financial crisis. Some specialists assume that Islamic finance, by its nature, is more solid than the conventional one. Besides, the sources of financial instability of the conventional system, such as liquidity problems, unsecured loans, speculation, and fixing the interest rates by the central bank, are completely absent in the Islamic financing, which promotes financial stability, in general (Bouslama 2009). In this sense, Ramadan (2011) showed that if the principles of Islamic finance had been used, one could have escaped the subprime crisis for the simple reason that this crisis is the result of mortgage granting to indebted households that were not creditworthy. However, others believe that conventional financing, which is characterized by the multiplication of financial innovations in deregulated markets, can lead to massive monetary creation. Several studies have been carried out to find out which banking system (Islamic or conventional) is more resistant to financial shocks. We can mention the study of Čihák and Hesse (2008); Laeven and Levine (2009); Cihak and Poghosyan (2009); Beck et al. (2013); Faye et al. (2013) and Rajhi and Hassairi (2014). These studies used the z score indicator to evaluate the level of banking stability. As a consequence, the objective of this paper is to study the stability of both Islamic and conventional banks during the current subprime and the eurozone crises through a comparative study between the usurious and non-usurious banks in 13 countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, using the z score as a measure of financial stability. The proposed model empirically evaluates the relationship between financial stability and some financial reports. Our sample includes 157 banks, 69 Islamic and 88 conventional banks situated in 13 countries of the MENA region over the 2003/2012 period. A number of causes justify the selection of these countries. In particular, the largest Islamic banks in the world are located in the MENA region. Moreover, the co-existence of Islamic and conventional banks enables to compare the stability of both banks’ type. On the other hand, the MENA banking sector is relatively young, and most banks were established in the 1970s at the latest. In fact, these countries share similar social and economic characteristics. Accordingly, the banking system of the MENA region provides a reasonable laboratory to examine our objective in a comprehensive manner. The present article adds to the empirical literature on Islamic finance in many ways. First, it concentrates on the MENA region,Footnote 2 unlike previous studies on Islamic banks that investigated the case of the GCC banking system (Siraj and Pillai 2012; Khediri et al. 2015 and Gamaginta and Rokhim 2011) who examined the case of the Indonesian banks. Then, our sampling period enabled us to study the effects of the world financial crisis from 2007 to 2012 on both types of banks. This period includes the subprime crisis and that of the eurozone (Table 1). Finally, we are motivated by the fact that no study has so far examined the financial stability of Islamic and conventional banks during the current crisis using the shock variable. The remaining part of this paper is organized as follows: “Literature Review” presents a review of literature while “Data and Model Specification” discusses the data and the used methodologies. “The Results of the Empirical Analysis” illustrates and evaluates the results of the empirical analysis. Finally, “Conclusion” concludes the paper.",7

Trade helps acquire skills which can be developed by importing and using a highly productive technology and innovation. Innovation and technology can be used by exporters while acting as sub-contractors to foreign companies or through competition on international markets. However, imported substitute products are target to severe competition from foreign companies. Actually, they require to use more capital-intensive production facilities to face the hard competition in the developing countries whose products are usually capital intensive (Frankel and Romer 1999). Trade openness can have a positive and significant impact on economic growth thanks to the accumulation of physical capital and technological transfer. The most important role of FDI is raising the supply of funds for domestic investment in the host countries. This can be achieved via the production chain where foreign investors buy locally manufactured products and sell intermediate ones to local companies. Moreover, the FDI can check the host country’s export capacity; therefore, developing countries would be able to increase that exchange earnings. On the other hand, the FDI may enhance the creation of new jobs, technology transfer, and economic growth in the host countries. According to Wang and Blomstrom (1992), the four main channels of technological spillovers from foreign firms to local ones are mutation, competition, skills (i.e., labor mobility), and relationship. Most of the previous empirical studies focused on the impact of either trade or FDI on economic growth (Karbasi et al. 2005) or on the relationship between FDI and economic growth (Baliamoune-Lutz 2004; Lipsey 2000) or (and), also, on the relationship between trade and economic growth (Pahlavani et al. 2005). All these studies came to the conclusion that FDI inflows and trade promote economic growth. However, they were unable to reach a conclusive result about these relationships and the causality direction in the developing countries. The FDI enhancing effects on economic growth vary through countries. In some countries, however, both FDI and trade may even produce a negative effect on economic growth (De Mello 1999). The Middle East and North African (MENA) countries need to apply and maintain some structural and economic reforms to boost trade, investment, job opportunities, and citizens’ trust in order to make sustainable and inclusive growth a reality. Within this trend, the MENA countries have made progress in their reforms in favor of openness, diversification, and public governance of the economy, but the 2011 uprisings have shown that these efforts have not created prosperity for all the social categories. Indeed, inequality and poor employment prospects in the disadvantaged areas remain important causes of social distress. Indeed, the economic growth in the MENA region was at 2.3% in 2015, while the emerging and developing countries recorded 4% on average. The foreign direct investment (FDI) in the MENA region has dropped by 50% since 2008, reaching its lowest level—1% of GDP—in 2015. The legal and administrative barriers are an important disincentive. The instability and insecurity in the region did also affect the FDI, as well as tourism, resulting in a sharp decline in Tunisia and Egypt. Intra-regional trade has become scarce and accounts for only 10% of the total commerce in the region (OCDE 2016). It is only through collaborative reform efforts to create a more open and inclusive economy and improve governance that we would achieve stability, prosperity, and equal opportunities, especially for the youngsters. The contribution of our study to the existing literature lies in providing conflicting results regarding the relationship between FDI and economic growth. Moreover, the MENA countries have an integral policy that targets FDI attraction and trade liberalization. In addition, our research deals with the MENA countries that represent a very interesting case study of developing countries which implemented some incentive programs so as to attract this FDI. The remaining of this paper was structured as follows. The second section presents a brief literature review. Empirical Analysis section outlines the used data and the empirical analysis of the results. Conclusion and Policy Implications section concludes the articles and offers some policy implications.",35

M. Riad Shams,Zhanna Belyaeva,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Quality assurance in a service delivery process is usually an important factor for innovation and development in overall management processes of an organisation (Campanella et al. 2013; Izzrech et al. 2013). In general, higher education is a service. Service is defined as ‘the application of specialized competences (e.g. knowledge and skills), through deeds, processes, and performances for the benefit of another entity or the entity itselfʼ (Lusch and Vargo 2006, p. 283). This definition of service closely relates with the provisions of higher education. Since, in general, in higher education, based on an offer letter from education providers, as a deed between the providers and students, students receive benefits to become skilled human capital through the application of the providers’ specialised knowledge and skills, based on the delivery processes of higher education. In such provisions of higher education service, quality of the service is one of the major concerns, in terms of delivery, assessment and overall management of the education service. In the contemporary higher education service management, educators encounter challenges from diverse perspectives to uphold quality in their service provisions. Such perspectives would include the multidimensional external influences of various stakeholders from government and market (e.g. the geographical location where an education provider offers their services) agencies as well as the internal influence of academic profession on quality assurance of higher education (Dill and Beerkens 2013). Considering such importance of quality assurance in this sector, this study attempts to summarise the key driving factors that act as antecedents of knowledge management to achieve and maintain higher quality in education service. A key objective of this attempt is to discuss the significance of the existing quality assurance driving factors in higher education as prospective antecedents for knowledge management among the key stakeholders in the higher education sector and beyond. Here, the knowledge management denotes to effectively sharing and transferring knowledge within a network of stakeholders. A secondary objective here is to reduce the time and efforts of current and future researchers and students in this academic stream by providing a quick snapshot of the major stakeholder-centred quality assurance driving factors to share, transfer and manage knowledge in the higher education sector. However, this is an initial attempt to summarise such quality assurance driving factors; this summary will be useful for future researchers to recognise the key quality assurance driving factors in the contemporary higher education at once. Since the future researchers will straightaway be able to recognise some of the key factors from the extant higher education quality assurance literature, where such factors are currently acknowledged in a dispersed way in this vast knowledge stream. To achieve these objectives, this study reviews the extant scholarly views from this knowledge stream and summarises the relevant information, along the progress of the discussion, so that the summary could be evolved, as an inductive synthesis approach (Glaser and Strauss 1967; Hallier and Forbes 2004; Randall and Mello 2012; Naidoo and Wu 2014; Shams and Lombardi 2016; Shams 2016a, b). In this analysis approach, the findings are justified based on the mutual influence of all reviewed information from the extant literature on the aim of the study (Eisenhardt 1989; Yin 1994; Smart et al. 2012; Osman et al. 2014).",28

Carayannis,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Creating news together with the audiences has been of active interest in journalism research since the early days of the Internet’s mass penetration (Lasica 1996; Rosen 1999; Heinonen 1999; Bowman and Willis 2003; Gillmor 2004). A newsroom-centered approach has dominated this research. However, the leading role of professional journalists in participation is challenged by the emergence of hubs for social innovation in metropolitan cities in the USA (Patel et al. 2013; Goldstein & Dyson 2013, McCann 2015). In these environments, civic activists combine elements of journalism, business, voluntary activism, and advocacy, in pursuing civic goals (McCann 2015). The work of traditional journalistic organizations is complemented and challenged by individual data-empowered advocates and networked civic organizations. New forms of collaboration are emerging, supported by philanthropic foundations that have formerly funded innovation in the field of traditional news journalism.Footnote 1 One of the centers for civic innovation in the USA is the City of Chicago. We explore the case of the Chicago Public Schools closings and the mediated civic responses to these events from 2012 to 2013, to analyze participation in news production. This article draws on the research fields of participatory journalism and innovation theory to understand changing patterns of news production. To this end, we applied a more detailed model of co-creation than has been used in journalism research to date. Drawing from the innovation framework (Theory U) of Scharmer and Kaufer (2013), we refined the idea of co-creation in participatory journalism through the three-stage distinction of co-initiating, co-sensing, and co-creating of news. Finally, we discuss how this model of co-creation can be understood in the context of the kind of innovation theory that includes the media and the civil society as an actor in innovation (Carayannis and Campbell 2012).",10

Asongu,Jacinta C. Nwachukwu,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Positioning of an inquiry on linkages between information and communication technology (ICT), financial sector development and financial access in Africa has a fourfold motivation, namely (i) the scope of ICT on that continent, (ii) need for alternative sources of finance for Africa’s growing investment needs, (iii) rising concerns about surplus liquidity and gaps in the measurement of financial development and (iv) scarce literature on financial sector development. First, there is considerable scope for the development of ICT in Africa compared to other regions of the world. As documented in recent ICT literature (Penard et al. 2012; Asongu 2015a), the continent is experiencing an uneven development in mobile phone and internet penetration. According to the narrative, whereas as of 2010 mobile phone and internet penetrations had reached saturation levels in developed economies, their development in Africa was low and asymmetric with 41% (9.6%) of mobile phone penetration (internet penetration). The studies are consistent with the view that the ICT market in Africa represents considerable opportunities for doing business because high-end markets in Asia, North America and Europe are experiencing stabilization in the penetration of the mobile phone and internet. Second, the African business literature accords with the view that domestic sources of capital are needed to finance Africa’s growing investment ambitions (Rolfe and Woodward 2004; Bartels et al. 2009; Tuomi 2011; Darley 2012). A means of internal finance is through the role of financial intermediaries in the transformation of mobilized domestic deposits into credit. Third, unfortunately the need for internal finance on the continent starkly contrasts with substantially documented concerns of surplus liquidity in the financial intermediary sector (Saxegaard 2006; Fouda 2009; Asongu 2014a). Furthermore, the literature has failed to assess this anxiety in the light of conceiving and measuring financial development efficiency as to the ability of financial institutions to fulfil their fundamental role of transforming mobilized deposits into credit (see Ataullah et al. 2004; Al-Obaidan 2008; Kiyota 2009; Kablan 2010). The financial efficiency indicators employed in the African financial development literature have included the following: profit efficiency (Hauner and Peiris 2005); Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) for technical efficiency (Kablan 2009) and cost efficiency (Chen 2009; Mensah et al. 2012). Fourth, financial sector development has not been given the attention it deserves in the finance literature. In accordance with recent papers (O’Toole 2014; Asongu 2015b), the bulk of studies has been restricted to more specific dimensions of financial institutions like foreign bank participation and bank concentration. We deviate from this by focusing on financial sector development in terms of competition. Theoretically, whereas a considerable proportion of the literature has assessed the effect of financial reforms on financial development (Arestis et al. 2002; Batuo and Kupukile 2010), this study argues that the failure to introduce the concept of financial sector development through shares of formal and informal financial sectors is a substantial missing link in the literature. Noticeably, the above literature leaves room for improvement in three main areas. They involve the need to (i) focus on regions where concerns about financial access are most severe; (ii) understand financial development from the perspective of the fundamental role of banks in transforming mobilized deposits into credit in the light of substantially documented surplus liquidity issues and (iii) examine the role of ICT in financial sector development for financial access. By introducing the concept of financial sector development (which is discussed in detail in Section 2), this study unites two streams of research by simultaneously contributing to the macroeconomic literature on measuring financial development and responding to the growing field of economic development by means of informal finance and ICT. Moreover, the empirical exercise suggests a pragmatic way of disentangling the effect of various financial sectors on financial development. In essence, we introduce hitherto unexplored concepts of financial sector formalization and informalization. In the light of the above, this study further examines the role of ICT in financial sector development (or financial sector competition) for financial access in 53 African countries for the period 2004–2011. The positioning of this inquiry steers clear of recent knowledge economy literature on the relevance of ICT in development outcomes, notably in: electricity consumption and economic growth (Shahbaz et al. 2016); Research and Development (R&D) for business value (Costello and Donnellan 2016); regional economic performance (Kleibrink et al. 2015; Ahmed and Ridzuan 2013; Ahmed 2010); human capital spillovers for knowledge-based economies (Ahmed 2016); university education (public and private) (Nour 2016); R&D intensity and economic growth (Sağlam 2016) and financial development (Das et al. 2016). The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The ‘Theoretical Underpinnings and Financial Sector Development’ section discusses theoretical underpinnings and clarifies the concept of financial sector development. Data and methodology are covered in the ‘Data and Methodology’ section. The empirical results and policy implications are presented in the ‘Empirical results’ section. The ‘Conclusions, caveats and further research directions’ section concludes and advises on future research directions.",17

Organizational decision-making on production and operation relies heavily on the capability of information collection and knowledge discovery (Davenport et al. 1998). Information thus becomes a valuable resource for knowledge-intensive organizations while knowledge is becoming an important capital which supports organizational performance and competitive advantage (Isik 2013). Marketing is intertwined with internal functions and external customers, which significantly influence the outcome of economic organizations (Gummesson et al. 2014). When competition in markets is more and more fierce, many organizations seek new knowledge-based marketing, for example, customer reference marketing (Jalkala and Salminen 2010) and targeted marketing (Fong 2012), to promote sales and satisfy customers. Customer information, which helps organizations to provide the right services for the right customers, plays an important role in the new marketing (Jeffery 1996). In the past three decades, there was a transition in China’s economic development from a strategy based on heavy industrialization to a new one based on development of knowledge-intensive economy (Ramesh 2013). In the new economic system, construction industry and housing markets which are even characterized by intensive knowledge are facing a sustained boom (Yu and Yang 2016). Currently China’s housing markets are large, prosperous, and surely competitive. A great number of organizations in the primary market, the second market, and the decorative market engage in targeted marketing to develop potential customers (Tang et al. 2006). It’s inevitable that customer information is almost the most important source of the marketing performance. Since organizational value depends heavily on customer information, it is then not weird that customer information leakage is out of control (Liu 2012; You and Chen 2010) when there are lack of effective control measures in the young housing markets in China though Chinese government always tries to punish the offenders. However, like a coin has two sides, from customer perspective customer information leakage is opposite to rights safeguarding, from service provider perspective customer information is valuable resource though the leakage behavior always causes complaints from customers. But then again, as one said, “the mother of all the rights is the right to information, which makes rulers of the country responsible towards its citizens in a true sense” (Sadashivam 2015). Hence, it is necessary to build an integrated management model which balances the information requirements of customers and service providers to avoid customer information leakage. However, just several researchers focused on solutions for avoiding customer information leakage in China’s housing markets. You and Chen (2010) reported an event of customer information leakage in Shenzhen, Guangdong and appealed to the legislation for privacy security. Chen (2012b) discussed the law issues about customer information leakage and proposed suggestions for improvement of personal information rights safeguarding. The research work of Chinese researchers focused on legal tools for customer rights safeguarding but did not enough consider the information demand of service providers. It should be noted that no relevant research achievement was published in English publications according to the author’s retrieval. Consequently this paper engaged in construction of an integrated management model for avoiding customer information leakage in China’s housing markets. The contributions of the model reflect on information rights safeguarding for customers and customer information management for service providers. The application of customer information management would be valuable for standardized management and sustainable development of the housing markets in China. It would contribute a lot to the health and sustainability of Chinese knowledge economy’s development. To further develop the model, a survey was organized to answer two questions. First, what categories of service providers and customer information the leakage problem was involved in and how did the customer information flow? Second, what factors the customer information leakage was caused and the customer information rights safeguarding was influenced? Therefore, the paper was finally organized as follows. Backgrounds about China’s housing boom and customer information leakage were discussed in the “China’s Housing Boom and Customer Information Leakage” section. A framework for managerial solutions followed in the “The Framework of the Integrated Management Model” section. To improve the model according to the framework, in the “Data Collection and Analysis” a survey was arranged for data collection, and then results and findings were respectively presented in the “Results” and ”Findings” sections. The integrated management model was finally developed in the “Modeling” section. The “Conclusions” section presented conclusions, limitations, and future work.",

Recently, however, scholars have started to question this paradigm since large investments into research and/or extensive achievements in innovation do not automatically lead to high performance in economic terms (Oughton et al. 2002; Dosi et al. 2006; Ejermo et al. 2011; Fragkandreas 2013). While there is now a growing literature dealing with country-specific evidence on this issue, only few systematic explorations of the causal relationships between these dimensions are available for the EU as a whole (Dosi et al. 2006). An assessment of the linkages between education, R&I and economic development together with an investigation of heterogeneities across countries and country groups is important in the light of the EU’s central Europe 2020 strategy to achieve smart growth ‘through more effective investments in education, research and innovation’.Footnote 1 In this strategy, common targets for R&I and education have been set together with a harmonized governance system that implements and coordinates policy actions between the EU and national levels. Consequently, in order to guarantee the working of the smart growth pillar of the strategy, a certain degree of homogeneity among EU countries is needed for a common policy to reach its overall targets in terms of appropriateness, effectiveness and efficiency. In order to assess the prospects and pitfalls of a common EU growth strategy building on the pillars of R&I- and education-led development, this paper takes the task of bridging the above described research gap between the available empirical evidence for individual EU countries and the missing overall picture for the enlarged European Union (EU-28) with the help of Granger causality and poolability tests. In this context, we also aim at investigating the likely particularities among the countries of the EU-28, specifically between the old established member countries (EU-15) and the new member states of Eastern and Southern Europe (NMS-13). Previous studies with a similar research methodology (Tselios 2011; Castellacci and Natera 2013) have implied that different national settings seem to produce different economic reactions to innovation and education, which will be taken as a point of departure here. Some countries and regions have shown to perform better and some worse than expected in economic terms in relation to their innovative and educational inputs (Rodríguez-Pose 1999; Crescenzi 2005). Thus, the underlying research questions of this paper can be summarized as follows: Which types of Granger causality relationships between education, R&I and economic development can be identified for the EU-28 in the long and short run? Do these relationships vary significantly between and within country groups composed of the old (EU-15) and new (NMS-13) member states? The research questions are explored as follows: firstly, we present a short overview of the empirical debate on causal relationships between education, R&I and economic development with a focus on European counties and regions; secondly, we introduce our chosen variables and data sources together with the presentation of some stylized facts; thirdly, we outline our empirical identification strategy; fourthly, we present the results with comparisons to earlier empirical literature; finally, the paper concludes with a policy discussion.",1

The rapid rise of public debt in an environment characterized by financial volatility and low growth increased the need for reliable and comprehensive considerations of public debt sustainability not only for the euro area countries, but also for the developing ones (Younsi and Nafla 2017). Recently, Tunisia has been facing several problems that could have seriously affected their debt sustainability. Ever since, the Arab spring has erupted in several countries leading to even more serious challenges that need to be taken into consideration when assessing debt sustainability (Abdelkafi 2016). Large parts of the economic literature define fiscal sustainability on the basis of the intertemporal budget constraint (IBC) of the government, which states that the present value of the outstanding sovereign debt needs, in any period, to equal the present value of all future primary surpluses. A myriad of studies have devoted many efforts to this issue. Hamilton and Flavin (1986) were pioneers in testing the present value budget constraint by evaluating the stationarity properties of public debt and primary deficits. In another approach, Trehan and Walsh (1991) investigated the cointegration relationship of public debt levels and primary deficits as an indicator of sustainability. Trehan and Walsh (1991), Hakkio and Rush (1991) tested the IBC fulfillment through the presence of a long-run cointegration relationship between government revenues and expenditures. On the other hand, Quintos (1995) distinguished between “weak” and “strong” sustainability by stating that a cointegration coefficient of 1 indicates strong sustainability, whereas a cointegration coefficient between 0 and 1 implies only weak sustainable public finances. In addition, a new and powerful sustainability test proposed by Bohn (1995, 1998, 2008) received substantial attention in the economics literature. It suggested that the analysis of the fiscal policy soundness should not be limited to the evaluation of the stationarity of the debt to GDP ratio (Greiner 2013a). Bohn (1998) tested whether the primary surplus relative to GDP is a positive and linearly rising function of the debt to GDP ratio. He sought to assess the sustainability of the USA public debt by examining it in a time series context. He showed that although the USA debt/GDP ratio has a unit root, and is thus potentially unsustainable, corrective action exists because the primary surplus rises whenever the debt/GDP ratio rises. Hence, so long as there is such a corrective policy response, the debt could become sustainable. Bohn (1998) argued that any positive response of primary surpluses to public debt increase should be interpreted as a corrective action towards sustainability of fiscal policy. The movements in primary surpluses in this context become a signal for true intentions of the government towards fiscal deficits. Bohn’s tests also allowed controlling for cyclical economic fluctuations. That is the case because some economies, especially developing countries, tend to experience higher macroeconomic volatility than more advanced economies (Agenor et al. 1999; Ghatak and Sánchez-Fung 2007; Augier and Wang 2013). A large number of studies attempted to test fiscal sustainability by using Bohn’s approach. These studies were carried out by Redžepagić and Llorca (2007), Fincke and Greiner (2011a), Fincke and Greiner (2011c), Greiner (2011), Burger and Marinkov (2012), Burger et al. (2012), Fincke and Greiner (2012), Tiwari (2012), Chandia and Javid (2013), Greiner (2013b), Lamé et al. (2014), Mahdavi (2014), and Bolat et al. (2016). In the Tunisian context, there is a number of studies that looked at the issue of debt and fiscal sustainability by using several methods. Gabsi (2004) used the accounting approach to test debt sustainability in Tunisia. He showed that, with the exception of the years 1986, 1991, and 1995, primary budget deficits are below the indicative sustainability thresholds. This helps conclude that fiscal policy in Tunisia was sustainable between 1986 and 2000. Mensi (2013) used the same approach adopted by Gabsi (2004) and found that fiscal policy in Tunisia was sustainable between 1986 and 2012, with the exception of the last 2 years. By contrast, Ayadi (2004), Ben Jelili and Ben Zaghou (1999) assumed that the sustainability of fiscal policy in Tunisia was rejected, while for Kanoun (2014), the fiscal adjustment process in Tunisia was sustainable during 1976–2010. Berthomieu (2004) analyzed sustainability of fiscal deficits for a sample of six South-Mediterranean countries.Footnote 1 They concluded that the inter-temporal budget constraint does not hold in Tunisia. Furthermore, by employing panel cointegration tests to assess the sustainability of fiscal policies in the same panel used as the previous study,Footnote 2 Ehrhart and Llorca (2008) showed that government spending and revenue in Tunisia are cointegrated. This implies that the fiscal policy in Tunisia is sustainable in the long run. Recently, Neaime (2010) examined the sustainability of the MENAFootnote 3 public debt and revealed strong sustainability of the Tunisian fiscal policies. We note that the majority of studies dealing with debt sustainability in Tunisia are using either stationarity or cointegration test. To our knowledge, no study has used time varying parameter model for testing fiscal sustainability in Tunisia. It should be pointed out that public debt sustainability also depends on the GDP growth. Moreover, knowledge is now recognized as the driver of productivity and economic growth, leading to a new focus on the role of information, technology, and learning in economic performance. This approach is called the knowledge-based economy. The objective of this paper is to test the sustainability of public debt in Tunisia using the new approach developed by Bohn (1998). Fincke and Greiner (2011b) extend this approach using time varying parameter model. Concerning the estimation technique, we resort to penalized spline estimation more flexible than the ordinary least squares (OLS) procedure. We do this because we take into account that the reaction of the primary surplus to variations in debt need not be constant but may be time-varying. According to this approach, a positive response of the primary surplus to public debt increase is sufficient for sustainability. If the government runs into debt today, it has to maintain primary surpluses in the future so that fiscal policy will be sustainable. Penalized spline estimation enables us to examine the nonlinear relationship between public debt and primary surplus. Furthermore, we apply an additional test that analyzes the stationarity properties of the budget deficits. This test was introduced by Trehan and Walsh (1991) who assume that stationarity of the deficit inclusive of interest payments is a sufficient condition for public debt to be sustainable. The use of this test in this paper is motivated by Fincke and Greiner (2010). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the next section outlines the theoretical framework, namely the Bohn’s fiscal sustainability model and the introduction of variables, followed by section 2 that depicts the empirical findings for Tunisia and the final section holds the concluding annotations and offers some policy implications.",7
10.0,2.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,25 March 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-017-0481-1,Direct and Complementary Effects of Investment in Knowledge-Based Economy on Innovation Performance in Tunisian Firms,June 2019,Adel Ben Khalifa,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"After the Second World War, the growth of “Thirty glorious years” (1945–1975) was made possible by the accumulation of production factors, within a context of full employment. In the globalized and increasingly competitive knowledge-based economy (KBE), with shifting structural boundaries, knowledge and innovation are now seen as the cornerstone of long-term growth, job creation, and economic development, in addition to the growing labor force. The recognition of the importance of knowledge in the production process has been in the rise since the early 1960s (Machlup 1962; Arow 1962; Becker 1964; Drucker 1969; Rosenberg 1976; Bell 1973; Porat 1977; Romer 1986, 1990). As a concept, “Knowledge economy” was first used by Peter Drucker, as a title of chapter 12 in his 1969 book The Age of Discontinuity, to state the growing increase of the share of the knowledge industries in the gross national product (GNP) of US economy (one quarter of GNP in 1955 and by 1965, it was taking one third of a much bigger GNP) (Drucker 1969, p. 263). However, it was not until the mid-1990s that the concept of “knowledge-based economy” becomes a popular concept with international organisms (such as OECD and World Bank) that invest effort in trying to find ways to harness it. Thus, a broad definition of the KBE, put forward by the OECD, was an economy which is “directly based on the production, distribution and use of knowledge and information” (OECD 1996, p. 7). In a joint study by OECD and World Bank, KBE is defined as “one where knowledge (codified and tacit) is created, acquired, transmitted and used more effectively by enterprises, organizations, individuals and communities for greater economic and social development” (OECD and World Bank 2000, p. 13). More recently, the World Bank (2007) emphasized that all sectors have became knowledge-intensive, not just those called high technology or science-based industries. In the macro level, OECD and World Bank (2000) argued that the transition to the KBE calls for (i) an economic and institutional regime that provides incentive for the use and creation of knowledge as well as for the start-up of entrepreneurial activities, (ii) investment in human capital to create and use knowledge and to enhance entrepreneurial/business competencies, (iii) investment in ICT (information and communication technology) infrastructure to facilitate the communication and the dissemination of information, and (iv) an efficient innovation system to create and use new knowledge and technologies. In the micro level, and this is what interest us here, Amable and Askenazy (2005) point out that KBE corresponds to a particular stage of capitalism characterized by the generalization to the whole economy of a specific production model organized around the human, organizational, and technological (i.e., ICT) complementarities (we will discuss this essay later). Moving toward KBE is today both an imperative and an opportunity for developing countries. It is an imperative (European Commission 2014) to realize, by means of innovation, a high rate of inclusive and sustainable growth and respond to the current and future challenges (graduate unemployment, poverty, inequality, etc.). Building a new development model based on knowledge and innovation is also an opportunity (Perez 1985, 1989; Freeman and Louça 2001). Thus, the new knowledge-based paradigm of growth is expected to increase the innovative capacity of countries through at last two channels. First, the new paradigm gives rise to new industries specializing in the production of new technologies (microelectronics and software, bio- and nano-technologies, space technologies, etc.). These industries have high added value, productivity, and income, increasing the economic growth and qualified job creation. Second, the new paradigm offers a set of new generic technologies linked to ICT and new organizational principles that can be used to modernize and rejuvenate existing traditional industries. The gradual diffusion of ICT and new organizational principles in the whole economic structure results in the fact that updated mature industries can again behave like new industries in terms of dynamism, productivity, innovation, and job creation. Besides, in the last decades, many mature industries have been modernized: even such a traditional activity as the clothing industry has been rejuvenated and placed on an innovative course (Hoffman and Rush 1988; Mytelka 1991). However, KBE also presents challenges, since development process requires high “social capability” (Abramovitz 1986) to diffuse and absorb foreign technological and organizational innovations. In Tunisia, the move toward knowledge-based economy is viewed from at least three main measures (Ben Khalifa 2013a; Ben Romdhane 2007). The first dates from 1986 with the introduction—in the context of structural adjustment program—of a range of institutional innovations expected to be necessary for the diffusion of the KBE. These institutions aim to go even further in the liberalization of the economy and in building market economy in a legislative framework to encourage foreign investment, accelerate privatization, develop the financial market, and strengthen integration in the European market. The second is related to the signing of several free trade agreements in order to strengthen integration into global economy. These agreements consist in the accession in 1990 to the GATT (which became World Trade Organization since 1994), the creation in 1995 of free trade zones (Bizerte and Zarzis), and the ratification of regional trade agreements. The most important agreement was signed with the European Union in 1995. It aims to create a free trade area by 2008. The third measure concerns the implementation, since 1996, of the National Upgrading Program (Programme de Mise à Niveau). This program includes a number of projects destined to companies and their environment to guarantee the success of the gradual liberalization process and opening up of economy to the international competition (ONUDI 2002; Baugault and Filipiak 2005). In the firm level, the program supports the restructuring process providing a premium for investment in the KBE (purchase of software and ICT tools, reorganization, quality certification, training, purchase of patents and know-how, technical assistance, etc.), fixed investment (equipment, modernization of production process, etc.), and financial restructuring. As for the environment, the program supports the modernization of institutions and infrastructures in several aspects: the institutional environment (administrative and legislative reforms, education, professional training, quality promotion, etc.), the financial and banking sectors, and the physical and material environment (communications, transportation, industrial and free trade zones, etc.). Other programs aimed at building the KBE and increasing the innovative capacity of the Tunisian economy are also set up (CMI 2014). These include the Industrial Modernization Programs that attempt to support investment in new technology and enhance organizational and managerial capacity of firms, Integrated National Research Program (it aims to link research, technical centers, and firms around a specific projects), Research Investment Premium, Research Valorization Program, and Incentive Regime in the field of Information Technology (a fund destined to innovative projects in the area of information technology). Besides, Tunisia has an elaborate innovation system and technical support to firms composed of a number of technical centers, research centers, technoparks, industrial clusters, and institute for standard and property right protection and other agencies for promotion of research, innovation, and enterprise creation. Until 2010, Tunisia was one of the best performing countries of MENA region and the most competitive economy in Africa. It was considered by the World Bank and IMF as a good “student” and as a role model to other developing countries (Nucifora and Rijkers 2014). However, the Tunisian Revolution that took place in January 2011 as a result of a high unemployment rate, particularly among university graduates, and deep regional disparity shows clearly the failure of Tunisian development model. Based on the exploitation of their comparative advantage of low wage in low-added value activities, Tunisian economy is stagnating in terms of productivity, diversification of product and market lines, and job creation (Nucifora and Rijkers 2014). The January 2011 revolution has shown that it is impossible to retain the same development model used over the last decades, notably in the knowledge and information era. Furthermore, the increasing wages and the power of the Labor Union (the union of Tunisian trade unions) after the revolution, Tunisia stands to lose its comparative advantage of low-wage costs. Tunisia needs a real transition to the KBE, a new model of growth after the failure of traditional economic policies, to generate a sustainable and inclusive growth. Only investment in KBE allows Tunisia to increase its innovative capacity, to combat price competition, to climb up the global value chains, and to leave the development model based on labor-intensive goods and which is a source of impoverishment and inequality, to a knowledge-intensive model that is more sustainable and equitable (BAD 2013). As mentioned above, the new development model does not distinguish high technology from low technology, particularly in a developing country like Tunisia. The use of high technology (i.e., ICT as a key factor of KBE paradigm) combined with the new organizational principles and skills, specific to the new paradigm, in all sorts of products, processes, and services can be more important, in terms of economic growth, job creation, and welfare improvement, than producing high technology (World Bank 2010). This idea is also in the heart of the Smart Specialization Strategy for innovation driven (Europe 2020) launched by the European Union in 2013 that wants the EU to become a smart, sustainable, and inclusive economy (European Commission 2014). “Smart specialization strategy” means the national or regional innovation strategies which set priorities in order to develop a “knowledge-intensive development model” that is able to create a “competitive advantage by developing and matching research and innovation’s own strengths to business needs in order to address emerging opportunities and market developments in a coherent manner, while avoiding duplication and fragmentation of efforts” (European Commission 2014, p 6). The smart specialization approach that attracted much attention by independent academics and institutions such as World Bank and OECD recognizes the importance of applying foreign general purpose technologies (such as ICT), skills, and organizational innovations in traditional activities to create new economic opportunities, reinforce the innovative capabilities of firms, and accelerate the caching-up process of regions and countries lagging behind (European Commission 2013; OECD 2013). Consequently, investigating the impact of ICT, new organizational principles and skills on the innovation performance of different Tunisian firms and how these factors interact is an obvious precondition for both business and policy-makers to design effective smart specialization strategy enabling the country to build a knowledge-intensive development model that is able to increase the innovative capacity of the firms and that allows them to move up toward the KBE. Thus, to our knowledge, there are no studies regarding the impact of investment in KBE in the innovative capacity of Tunisian firms. The few studies that have analyzed the determinant factors of the Tunisian innovation process are focusing on the role of R-D (Karray and Kriaa 2008; El Elj 2010; Tlili and Chkir 2011) that is less appropriate for developing countries in general and Tunisia in particular. Here, an innovative firm is defined as one that introduces a product and/or process innovation. A product innovation “is the introduction of a good or service that is new or significantly improved” to the firm, while process innovation is “the implementation of a new or significantly improved production or a delivery method” (OECD 2005, p. 48–49). The paper is structured as follows: “Background Literature and Hypotheses” section presents the background investigating the role of ICT, organizational innovations, and human capital as enablers of innovation as well as the interaction effect of these factors. “Methodology” section describes the methodology adopted in this study including the dataset and model specification. “Regression Results” section discusses the empirical results. In the final section, we conclude with the main findings for the determinant factors of innovation in Tunisian firms.",4

Reducing the cost of trade could substantially increase revenues and improve the well-being of people, especially in the developing world where such costs are the highest (Obstfeld and Rogoff 1995; Frankel and Romer 1999; Rodriguez and Rodrik 2000). In many developing countries and even developed ones, exchanges were mostly created in the informal trade sector (Akinboade 2005; Paz 2014). Informal cross-border trade is defined as commercial transactions utilizing residents and non-residents beyond the economic borders of two or several countries, transactions which are mainly not recorded by the customs authorities. This informal trade manifests itself in different ways in different countries, in different regions of the same country and even in different parts of the same city. It includes different types of activities, types of businesses, and different motivations for participation. This phenomenon is similar to a clandestine passenger. It accommodates public goods and services it consumes, but does not participate in financing. In its broadest sense, informal trade concerns all trade in goods and services. As a growing and worrying phenomenon, it affects both natural persons and legal entities (companies and even associations). This informal trade exists in key sectors (construction, trade, industry, agriculture, energy, health, recreation, services, etc.) and constitutes a breach of the principles that underlie our economic and social model (Maldonado et al. 1995). On the social front, the widespread phenomenon can lead to a loss of confidence with respect to the law and a weakening of the institutional quality policy (Jayne and Myers 2012; Burke and Myers 2014). The consequences it brings are also qualitatively and quantitatively substantial in terms of economic and financial structures that prevail. Thus, for example, in developing countries where tax collection is inefficient or non-existent or countries with an embryonic social protection, the effects are the same as those where state revenues are based on tax or those with high levels of social protection (Egg and Herrera 1998). In European countries which fall under the second category, though with notable variations, informal trade deprives public accounts (state, social security) from revenues by reducing the tax base, creating unfair competition for businesses, causing personal insecurity and loss of rights, and legal insecurity for users or consumers. In developing countries, the problem is of course different: flawed statistical production networks, segmented distribution, and inefficient public services. The price of fuel in Algeria, for example, is about one-tenth that of Tunisia. While this makes the oil more affordable for Tunisian households, total informal trade also leads to a loss for Tunisian authorities estimated at about 1.2 billion dinars (the equivalent of a quarter of total customs revenues). Smikni (2014) proves that unrecorded exports from Indonesia may exceed $ 200 million. Smuggling may have accounted for two thirds of this illegal trade and under evaluation of declared exports for the remainder. Ayadi et al. (2013) show that informal trade is an important part of bilateral trade between Tunisia, Libya, and Algeria (5% of total imports), accounting for more than half the official trade with Libya and more than total official trade with Algeria. The main reasons behind this broad-scale informal trade are differences in the levels of subsidies on either side of the border as well as the varying tax regimes. Farzanegan (2009) estimated the informal trade size for Iran during 1970–2007 using the MIMIC model. The results indicate that the penalty rate and quality of economic and political institutions can reduce smuggling, while tariffs and premiums black market increase informal trade. On average, smuggling in Iran was about 13% of total trade. To my knowledge, this paper is the first study that estimates the informal trade not only by region but also by countries around the world. This study uses the MIMIC model that was applied to the modeling of the informal economy (Schneider 2005; Dell’Anno et al. 2007; Schneider et al. 2010). In addition to the main effects of hypothetical consequences of smuggling, it examines the effects of the main causal variables through the relevant factors of institutional quality which is a new approach for the MIMIC model economy. My application of MIMIC technology takes also into account the quality of political and economic institutions. In this paper, we attempt to find plausible answers to the following questions: What is the size of informal trade at the aggregate level (percentage of formal trade) as well as the disaggregate one (by country) during the last decade? What are the main causes of informal trade? And, what kind of economic policy could be effective in reducing informal trade? To find answers to these questions we apply a MIMIC model that is used to estimate the size of informal trade using structural equation with a latent variable. The paper is organized as follows. In “Theories of the informal trade”, we review competing theories of why firms choose to remain in the informal trade; “Causes and consequences of informal trade” review the causes and consequences of informality; “Econometric methodology” presents the econometric methodology. “Data and estimation results” provide the data and the results of the estimate. Finally, “Conclusion and policy implications” concludes the paper.",1

Perret,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In 1992, Lundvall introduced the concept of the national innovation system (NIS) into economic literature providing a comprehensive frame of reference to analyze the innovation dynamics in economies. According to the OECD’s 1999 report on national innovation systems, regional innovation systems are the essential building blocks of any NIS. The analysis of an NIS is therefore inherently of a regional nature. At the core of every NIS, two concepts are of central importance: the generation and the diffusion of innovations and ergo knowledge; on the one hand, inside the system itself and on the other across the system’s borders. This concept is illustrated fittingly in OECD (1999). The present study picks up on the aspect of knowledge generation in the context of the Russian Federation (RF).Footnote 1 Over the last two decades, the RF experienced a transition from a Soviet centrally planned economy to a market economy,Footnote 2 However, it can still not be considered a fully developed knowledge society comparable to Western European economies where the terms of knowledge society or knowledge economy can be interchanged with the term NIS. Komkov et al. (2005) provides a first report on Russia’s transition to a knowledge society. In this context, the Russian Federation is an interesting subject not only because it has a much different history and followed a different development path than most established knowledge societies but also because it is politically and economically in a phase which many developed nations have long since left behind. An analysis of the RF therefore allows us to take a look at how an innovation system—or at least the knowledge generation mechanism—in this type of a developing economy under specific restrictions looks and works. It can thus be taken as an analytical template for other BRICS countries or countries at a similar level of development and comparable economic characteristics like Indonesia. Fritsch and Slavtchev (2006) argue that estimating a knowledge production function (KPF) allows to test the efficiency of an NIS. The link between knowledge inputs and knowledge output basically coincides with the knowledge generation process in an NIS. The KPF approach is thus a suitable tool to analyze the Russian innovation system.Footnote 3 However, Fritsch and Slavtchev (2006) is not the only study providing a research framework for analyzing the effectiveness of an NIS or more specifically the Russian NIS. Nelson (1993), Cooke et al. (1997), OECD (1999), and Carlsson (2007) provide a general discussion of the structure and dimensions of NIS; they offer a good starting point for finding aspects that are directly linked to the effectiveness of the NIS. Zabala-Iturriagagoitia et al. (2007), Bakhtizin and Akinfeeva (2010), and Savin and Winker (2012) provide specific research strategies for analyzing the workings of an NIS and its performance or potential, respectively. Finally, Khvatova (2008) provides an analysis of the effectiveness of the Russian NIS, however, delivering with her study less of an econometric rather than a qualitative analysis reminiscent of an SWAT analysis. While studies like Fritsch and Franke (2004), Lee and Park (2005), or Wang and Huang (2007) operate on a firm basis, this study tackles the question from a regional perspective. However, this study does not so much aim at simply applying the basic framework of the KPF to Russian data but tries to deduce in which areas the basic linear KPF framework needs adjustment to better fit the situation in the Russian Federation. In this context, a quantile regression approach is used to deduce the correct KPF framework underlying the Russian data. While the basic idea of quantile regressions is rather old, Koenker and Bassett (1978) have been the first to provide an applicable methodology, and the number of publications in economics implementing quantile regressions is still rather limited. In particular, regarding the study of NIS, this study potentially is the first one applying quantile regressions.Footnote 4 The study is structured in four sections. In the following second section, the basic knowledge production function is introduced. In the third section, a quantile regression analysis is performed to account for the stability of regression coefficients and thus the linearity of the KPF and the potential of omitted variables. Using the regression results, a non-linear version of the KPF specifically constructed around the Russian innovation data is deduced. The study concludes in the fourth section with conclusions also picking up on policy and research implications of this study.",6

These models can be divided into two main categories (Atman et al. 2005) such as credit pricing models and portfolio credit value-at-risk (VaR) models. Thus, credit pricing models can in turn be divided into three main approaches as “first generation” structural-form models, “second generation” structural-form models, and reduced-form models. The three different approaches, together with their basic assumption advantages, drawbacks, and empirical performance, are as follows: first generation structural-form models: the Merton approach, second generation structural-form models, reduced-form models, credit value-at-risk models, and some latest contributions on the PD-RR relationship.Footnote 1 It has been noted that default probabilities and default rates and average recovery rates are negatively correlated (Altman et al. 2005). Then, both variables also seem to be driven by the same common factor that is persistent over time and clearly related to the business cycle: in recessions or industry downturns, default rates are high and recovery rates are low. In addition, to examine the dependence between the probability of default and the recovery rate, Fischer et al. (2016) derive an analytic framework that allows for stochastic recovery rates and for which the corresponding risk figures can be obtained via saddle point approximation. They propose a straightforward approach for how to take dependencies between recovery rates and default rates into account. Then, the corresponding loss distribution has to be derived using Monte Carlo simulations. They illustrate the impact of both stochastic recovery rates and dependence between recovery rates and default rates on the level of risk figures for a specific benchmark portfolio. Eckert et al. (2016) introduce a credit portfolio framework that allows for dependencies between default probabilities, secured and unsecured recovery rates, and exposures at default (EADs). There is empirical evidence for dependence between these risk parameters and observations for the EAD, and since the secured and unsecured recovery rates are available only in the case of a default, we propose a multivariate extension of the selection model of Heckman in order to estimate the unknown parameters within a maximum likelihood framework. Finally, they empirically demonstrate the effects of the dependence structure on the portfolio loss distribution and its risk measure for a hypothetical loan portfolio. Rösch and Scheule (2014) offer a joint estimation approach for forecasting probabilities of default and loss rates given default in the presence of selection. The approach accommodates fixed and random risk factors. Their empirical analysis identifies bond ratings, borrower characteristics, and macroeconomic information as important risk factors. A portfolio-level analysis finds evidence that common risk measurement approaches may underestimate bank capital by up to 17% relative to the presented model. Schäfer and Koivusalo (2013) investigate empirically the modeling default probabilities. In their paper, recovery rates are often treated as an afterthought; they are modeled independently; in many cases, they are even assumed to be constant. They derive the functional relation between expected recovery rate and default probability. This relation depends on a single parameter only. In Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the same functional dependence also holds for jump-diffusion and GARCH processes. In addition, we study how to incorporate this structural recovery rate into reduced-form models, in order to restore essential structural information which is usually neglected in the reduced-form approach. Thus, the main idea for this study is to answer the following question: Is the probability of default dependent of the recovery rate and conversely? Then, we use the bootstrapped quantile regression and the simultaneous quantile regression for a sample composed of 17 Greek banks listed in Athens Exchange during the period through January 02, 2006 to December 31, 2012. To estimate this dependence, we utilize seven indicators such as the probability of default, the recovery rate, the number of defaults, the expected value of losses, the growth rate of GDP in Greece, and three dummy variables (the exit of another firm of the Athens Exchange, the new firm is listed in the Athens Exchange, and the date of the failure of Greece). The main empirical findings demonstrate that the probability of default and the recovery rate are inversely correlated. Based on these findings, the banks are obliged to maximize their recovery rate to decrease their probability of default. Then, the rest of this paper is structured as follows: The literature review is developed in “Literature Review” section. The dependence between the probability of default and the recovery rate is presented in “Dependence Between the Probability of Default and the Recovery Rate: Analytical Analysis” section. In “Data and Empirical Model” section, we describe the data, the econometric methodologies, and the model used in this paper. “Results and Discussion” section discusses and analysis of the econometric findings. Finally, the sixth section is considered to conclude.",3
10.0,2.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,21 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-017-0489-6,Entrepreneurial Competitive Intelligence Between Uppsala Model and Born Global Theories in the Case of North African SMEs,June 2019,Bel Hadj Tarek,Mighri Zouhayer,Ghodbane Adel,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Several studies have focused on explaining the process of internationalization and which are mainly divided into two branches work: the Uppsala model (U-model) and born global theories. The Uppsala model, which was developed by the Swedish school (Johanson and Wiedersheim-Paul 1975; Johanson and Vahlne 1977) in 70 years, stills today the reference in the study of the internationalization of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). For this purpose, internationalization is defined as a gradual process, which is performed by steps. The authors distinguish four steps: (1) the company has no regular export activities, (2) exports through an independent agent, (3) implementing a sales subsidiary, and (4) production in the foreign country. In contrast, born global firms are defined as “a business organization that, from inception, seeks to significant competitive advantage derived from the use of resources and the sale of outputs in multiple countries” (Oviatt and McDougall 1994, p. 49). According to Rennie (1993), born global firm concerns a company that integrates from the beginning of their business, constraints, and opportunities of the global economy and the acceleration of trade. In other words, born global theories concern over the large multinational groups and have become the model of development of these agile and ambitious entrepreneurs. The early and rapid internationalization process calls into question in particular the universality of traditional model stages of internationalization. This process is also known under the term “New Ventures” (Oviatt and McDougall 1994). Otherwise, Big Data has emerged as an important area of study for practitioners and researchers (Duan and Xiong 2015). Faced with this new world, Shi et al. (2007) highlighted the role played by decision support system that overcomes the limitations of outdated decision tools which are harmful to the future of business, notably due to their costs and losses in terms of time and information. More recently, other studies (Sasaki et al. 2014) have focused on the benefits of intelligent systems based on the awareness of unawareness. Based on these ideas, competitive intelligence in SMEs is a direct and logical consequence of a cross between economic war and information war (Tarek et al. 2016a). In fact, competitive intelligence appeared in the early 90s in FranceFootnote 1 and is rapidly transposed to larger companies with an international scope. However, this finding has not fully concerned SMEs. Indeed, the tests of conceptualization of the term of intelligence were strongly biased by the geographic context in which it occurs. To this end, in France, the majority of researches agrees about the key features and objectives derived from business intelligence which is intended to facilitate decision-making and require actions of collection, processing, analysis, dissemination, and protection of information related to the business environment. In the USA, the term is more focused on companies. We speak of “competitive intelligence,” incorporating the factor of competition and business competitiveness. While, this term was seen, according to the Anglo-Saxon approach as a synonym for “deep knowledge” confused sometimes with economic espionage, which in turn reflects the problem of its appropriation by SMEs. In other words, the approaches which have analyzed competitive intelligence differ and were conditioned by geographical bias. Nevertheless, despite these conceptual differences, the results regarding the positive effects of competitive intelligence on internationalization are unanimously confirmed theoretically although they are insufficiently verified empirically. This failure at the empirical level is largely explained by marginalization of one key variable of competitive intelligence, those related to business opportunities, and threats that trace both the offensive and defensive decisions. In fact, the concept of entrepreneurial orientation was strongly associated with the identification and exploitation of opportunities and the crossing of threats (Yuan et al. 2008). Therefore, in this paper, we propose a theoretical and empirical investigation that enriches the theme of competitive intelligence by integrating the concept of entrepreneurial orientation as an integral part of this later, able to boost internationalization. Given the different characteristics of SMEs in developed countries and developing countries, especially as regards the tangible resources (Ghauri et al. 2003), we consider that our paper has a valuable contribution since it contradicts born global theories (Rennie 1993; Knight and Cavusgil 2004) and aims to enrich the results of Uppsala model (Johanson and Vahline 1990; Johanson and Wiedersheim-Paul 1975). Moreover, in the majority of developing countries in general and North African countries, in particular, the management of information, business intelligence, and competitive intelligence has not yet taken place that deserves. Based on these ideas, we will try in what follows to raise the issue on the benefits of entrepreneurial competitive intelligence and its internal audit on internationalization based on the intensity of exports in the specific case of North African SMEs. In order to do this, we will try, along the lines of this research, to answer the following central questions: What is the most appropriate model of internationalization for North African SMEs? To what extent can entrepreneurial competitive intelligence contribute to the choice of this model of internationalization? We show in our paper that competitive intelligence approach is more appropriate with the Uppsala model due to its gradual, calculated, and oriented character, unlike the born global theories. Our paper is structured as follows: first, we will try to understand the concepts of business intelligence and entrepreneurial competitive intelligence as well as their differences. Then, we analyze the link between entrepreneurial competitive intelligence and internationalization. Finally, we will present our methodology, research findings, and discussion.",6

These three components are the major inputs for balancing growth and distribution of the population. Migration has dynamic characteristics, while the other two can be interpreted as static factors on the short term. Beside the migration, the technological intervention is of direct significance. The social reproduction is embedded in an institutional and technological context with territorial variety. The reproduction is never completely balanced; in practice, there is either underproduction or overproduction. The dependence upon solely strategic natural resources is associated usually with poor human, economic, and political development indices (Collier et al. 2003). On the other hand, the well-developed entities have better indices, but also have lower fertility rate. Therefore, the different locations can make trade-offs based on their needs, for what the migration is the key (Fargues and McCormik 2013). The changes within the societies can imply conflicts that should be handled with care. The newcomers and the already established society have to manage the coexistence, especially during extensive economic change (Martín et al. 2016). Conflicts and resistances within social relations are fractured by divisions of gender, class, and culture. Considering the level of involvement in the cooperation, being individual is not practical, not even in the smallest organizational entity, some form of collectivism cannot be avoided (Polanyi 1957), it is unavoidable in practice. The economic clusters have better information flow between related and supporting industries (Porter 1998). Firms improve better because of the concentration, and the competition gets more efficient that drives the innovation. One of the most important local factors is the fact whether there is sufficient level of skilled labor in the area. (In parallel, it has to be mentioned that some types of works are digitized already on such level that they can be conducted remotely in virtual environment.) The separation of tasks (division of labor) is within the labor process, it is about the allocation of workers to different groups (Gregory et al. 2009): The social division is the division between product sectors. The technical division is the division into tasks and the specialization of workers. The gender division is where specific jobs are almost solely assigned to men or women. The cultural division of labor is divided among the minority and the majority. The ethnic division’s employment is stratified according to ethnicity. The international division’s main characteristic is that the less-developed countries produce raw material, and the developed ones produce goods and provide value-added services. As per the spatial division, the specific sectors are concentrated in neighboring geographical area. The cultural and the ethnic divisions can be highlighted as taking the major role in immigration. The social interactions, like the structures of the daily routines in the economy, the life paths of people, the course how “common-sense” knowledge and experience is acquired, the socialization, the social reproduction, and the attached contesting social norms are also the part of the whole process (Knox and Pinch 2010). Most of the societies are interpreted as isolated entities that have interactions within themselves and/or with each other. In practice, this concept might have some drawbacks, because the multilevel and self-reflecting effects of the networks are oversimplified. Furthermore, the intercultural differences are rather in the focus, instead of the similarities. In order to avoid the possible social tensions, it is desirable to handle the related events as a complex mechanism. Immigration has different types and different dimensions (social, economic, timely). The immigrants’ motivation to become mobile can be self-driven or based on external influence. In every case at the end, the immigrants change their location, and their end-location’s community has to deal with the integration. Since the immigrants’ group is not homogenous, the integration mechanism has to be customized case by case. The absorbing environment can be operationalized based on the division of labor, by expanding it by knowledge management. Knowledge management is one of the most important factors to be considered (but not exclusive). The current research’s aim is to reveal a possible set of instruments by utilizing the knowledge management. With the proper application of knowledge management, a different dimension can be added to problem solving, and the core cause of the symptoms can probably be approximated as well in a more efficient way. In the next section, the potential methods will be outlined.",
10.0,2.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,10 August 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-017-0497-6,Knowledge Bias: Neo-feudalism and Other Reasons to Avoid Sharing Knowledge by Knowledge Workers,June 2019,Yoav Gal,Adiv Gal,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Knowledge sharing is a key factor in minimizing failure occurrences. But knowledge sharing is an innovative process that requires awareness of knowledge needs and making knowledge available to others, by constructing and providing a technical and systematic infrastructure. Knowledge sharing is also often linked in the literature with incentives. An incentive must be considered sufficient when it promotes full knowledge sharing, regardless of the incentive’s type. However, it was found that when the peer environment promoted knowledge hoarding, knowledge sharing dropped the most, even when incentives were initially deemed sufficient. Competitive individuals were found to be active sharers of valuable proprietary knowledge only when their competitiveness is team-oriented. To promote knowledge sharing, careful monitoring of perceived incentive sufficiency is suggested, especially in the case of non-monetary incentives (Wolfe and Loraas 2008). Knowledge sharing is also strongly connected to trust, which is one of the primary factors in the successful performance of complex projects. Elements of a favorable environment or climate for knowledge sharing are based primarily on collaboration and trust (McInerney and Mohr 2007). Any organization is based on multiple relationships, and therefore, mutual trust, shared values, and ethical standards are critical success factors in the new relationship-based business environment. To be trustworthy is to behave in a predictable manner: to do what you say you will do, when you say you will do it. In this context, the definition of trust gap is the difference in the organization between the number of people who can be trusted and the number of people who are trusted by their colleagues (Preiss et al. 1996, p. 174). In the management surveys that Preiss et al. (1996) conducted, most organizations acknowledge a trust gap of about 40%, on average. In the pyramidal structure of an old-fashioned organization, a few top managers make decisions for everyone in the organization. However, as organizations evolve and adapt to the concept of encouraging more people to think and make decisions, there is a tendency on the part of employees to trust only the very minimum number of colleagues whom they deem necessary to do their jobs. In addition, in the traditional organizational structure, many employees work in a managerial atmosphere of “Don’t think, just do your job,” etc. For them, doing what they are told to do is less risky than learning how to achieve a set of goals. However, an organization is a complex system in which information is tightly coupled to its decision-making processes and to its activities. Therefore, when conditions of trust do not exist, a decision that appears optimal according to local parameters may lead to a non-optimal global decision or even failure of the entire system (Armistead 1999; Axelrod and Cohen 2000; Dixon 1999; Sherman and Schultz 1998). Nor is it only that many organizations have trust problems; organizational knowledge is frequently weaponized. Evidence indicating negligent use of the feedback forms can slant the results and, in certain cases, can even be used as a means of punishment (Gal and Gal 2015a). Working in an organization these days is more likely to mean manipulating information from one editing transition station to the next, rather than working with raw materials. Editing transition means any change in the data or information which is part of the organization’s processes (Gal 2004, 2012a, b). This means that during the process of manipulating one’s information to deliver it to the next editing transition, one is not fully concerned with the task. Even worse, the manipulation of the information might be aimed at benefitting the knowledge worker’s selfish interests instead of the organization’s declared mission. Failure events in many organizational processes are common phenomena. One of the reasons for that is that the theories they relied upon do not take transaction costs into account. The larger the transaction costs are, the greater the effects of distorted factors become, which in turn causes an increase of friction in organizational processes. However, in the world of utopian and ideal organizational processes of common knowledge management (KM) theories, friction factors are usually not included and not sharing knowledge is surely one of the biggest factors that cause friction in organizations. Sharing knowledge relies on incentives and trust. As noted above, the literature shows that the average knowledge worker does not trust many others in his workplace. An assumption that should be examined derives directly from this fact, i.e., that knowledge workers usually tend to utilize strategies that advance their narrow selfish interests in the short term and that these do not require moral or ethical behavior. Each of the characteristic perspectives of the systems in economics, management, and sociology rely on the assumption that employees’ behavior will be moral and ethical. Nonetheless, this foregone assumption that employees are required to behave in accordance with moral and ethical standards in the organizational systems in which they work together does not exist in reality in the majority of knowledge systems. Examples of this phenomenon are presented below. Moreover, almost everyone proficient in today’s technologically advanced world is exposed daily to many instances of fraud and deception, broad in scope, almost as a matter of routine. The definitions below are fundamental to understanding the principal idea of this article. They are meant to find an agreement with the reader and enable a discussion centered on an agreed-upon, uniform base. We do not argue that this is the absolute truth or that other definitions do not exist. Nor do we maintain that under certain circumstances, examples can be found that deviate from these definitions. Rather, these definitions should be viewed as parameters of “if … then”. That is, that these are the points of departure, and the definitions derived from them are expressed in the discussion itself. Moral: Concerned with the principles of right and wrong behavior.Footnote 1 Ethics: Moral principles that govern a person’s behavior or the conducting of an activity.Footnote 2 Unprincipled behavior: Not acting in accordance with ethics.Footnote 3 Knowledge engine: A schematic model of the use of knowledge in the organization. As with any other process, it consists of inputs, processing, and outputs. The special mechanism about this process is that the individual basically conducts the work inside his/her brain. Thus, it is largely virtual, is very difficult to monitor, and is very easy to manipulate. Knowledge workers: Employed by an organization; the employee’s personal knowledge, experience, and expertise are the significant components in the employee’s success in his job. The term was first defined by Peter Drucker in his book, The Landmarks of Tomorrow published in 1959. However, more attention was paid to the concept when discussion focused on it in Drucker’s 1999 book, Management Challenges for the 21st Century (Drucker 1999). Today, various assessments estimate that knowledge workers constitute 75% of the workforce in a very broad range of businesses in industrialized countries. Tom Davenport (2005) addresses the issue of knowledge workers in Thinking for a Living. Knowledge sharing: The internal organizational process by which the knowledge worker shares his personal tacit knowledge with his colleagues, for the good of the organizational process, without personal, direct, and immediate benefit accruing to the worker. Tacit knowledge is personal knowledge that is difficult to define. The person who has it is often unaware of its existence, and does not know how to describe it precisely, but can retrieve and use it when necessary. Sharing knowledge in organizational processes enables colleagues who participate in the process to volunteer and share their expertise, without management or the organization requiring them to do so. Thus, they contribute significantly to achieving the objectives of the process, in the best way possible. Not sharing knowledge is a situation that can cause damage or mishaps during the organizational process. It is enough for one member of the team involved in the process of sharing knowledge to prevent it from proceeding because of narrow selfish interests. The ability to refrain from sharing knowledge without being disciplined for it stems directly from the fact that what is unshared is tacit knowledge. Old type of economy organizations/classic enterprise system: These are organizational systems that developed during the Industrial Revolution and were designed to serve the needs of manufacturing plants, following the Scientific Management school promulgated by Frederick W. Taylor, Max Weber, Henri Fayol, and others at the beginning of the twentieth century. The organizational goal of these structures is to increase the profits of the owners and shareholders. The worker was usually the least expensive component of production and could be replaced relatively easily on the assembly line, which consisted of expensive machinery. Most industrial organizations, whether coal mines or textile factories, were based on hierarchical management due to the ease of setting tasks and supervising lots of people doing the same thing. They changed slowly, because of the nature of the work and because these organizations and systems developed in a relatively slow-changing environment. They usually had structured, hierarchical management systems, with little flexibility or ability to adapt to rapid changing external environments. Accelerated knowledge economy: The reciprocal relationship between economic systems, organizations, politics, and social considerations that are directly or indirectly affected by accelerated technological changes. These changes often lead to breaks in decision-making patterns that developed over a long period of time. That is, they dated from the end of the eighteenth century, based on the theoretical infrastructure laid down by Adam Smith and David Ricardo and persisted until the late twentieth century, when computers and the technologies they introduced materially changed the way decisions are made.",3

The development trajectories of the pre-modern society have been challenged by the notion of sustainability, and the pursuit of human development needs to integrate social, economic, and environmental wellbeing of the ecosystems. Addressing these challenges and designing a sustainable post-modern society require an urgent integration of knowledge resources across different spatial context. Remøe (2010) revealed that the local, regional, national, supra-national, and global knowledge economies are emerging to respond to the challenges of the global economy. Addressing sustainable development and global warming requires an integration of the knowledge economies based on appropriate innovation models (Carayannis et al. 2012; Carayannis and Kaloudis 2010; Carayannis et al. 2017; Campbell et al. 2015). Sustainable development means meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs (WCED 1987). Sustainable development can be fully understood by joining the different forms of knowledge within the diverse spatial settings of the wider society (Cash et al. 2003). This idea is essential, because the need for an integrated and comprehensive worldview on sustainable development across the different levels of society has been recognised in many scholarly works (Van Opstal and Hugé 2013; Cash et al. 2003). However, there is currently no framework for understanding how the different geographies of knowledge support sustainable development. This paper fills this gap by revealing the intricate relations between these two concepts in a way that provides a comprehensive understanding of sustainable development (Robinson 2004). This paper argues that any model that seeks to understand development that meets the social, economic, and environmental needs of the present and future generations should integrate knowledge across the different geographical settings of the wider society. This is because integrating multiple worldviews and knowledge from different spatial contexts is vital, if development is to be truly sustainable (Van Opstal and Hugé 2013). Geographies of knowledge explain the spatial contexts in which knowledge is produced (Shinn 2002; Audretsch 2005). Geographies of knowledge are widely seen as representing the different knowledge economies in the wider society. The most commonly known geographies of knowledge are local, regional, national, and global (Cash et al. 2003). These spatial settings of the society matter, because they are not only for political and administrative purposes, but they also constitute units of knowledge production economies. Knowledge production economy does not only exist at the regional level, as largely emphasised by Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (1995). Beside regions, knowledge production economies can also exist at the local, national, and global levels of the society (Shinn 2002). Despite their separate spatial boundaries, these geographies of knowledge are intersected because of their spill-over effects (Audretsch 2005; Jaffe et al. 1993). This suggests that different knowledge economies at different geographical settings may influence each other in a way that supports our understanding of sustainable development. Though less attention is given to these geographies of knowledge (Shinn 2002), their spatial differences matter in the way knowledge is generated, developed, and applied towards sustainable development, especially at the local, regional, national, and global level. Although the process of knowledge production shows very distinctive geographies (Schoonmaker and Carayannis 2013), it must be noted here that, the idea of geography of knowledge is fundamental to the innovation process, as we cannot understand innovation properly if we ignore the central role of spatial proximity and knowledge concentration (Asheim and Gertler 2005). Thus, an integration of knowledge from different actors across the different spatial contexts is also crucial for innovation activities at the local, regional, national, and global economies, because knowledge from these spatial contexts can underscore innovation that supports sustainable development. Though knowledge from the different spatial contexts can fuel innovative processes towards sustainable development, exactly how they interact in a way that deepens our understanding of sustainable development is less understood. In addressing this gap in the literature, this paper attempt to answer the question of: How do the geographies of knowledge contribute to the understanding of sustainable development? This paper argues that these spatial dynamics are relevant for understanding the complex path of knowledge creation and application that support sustainable development. The reason being that though the knowledge-based economies and sustainable development nexus are well-acknowledged, their interactive effects although complex has been neglected in the mainstream literature (Sabau 2010). Nonetheless, what makes the linkages between knowledge-based economies and sustainable development complex is the multiplicity and diversity of spatial contexts in which they are embedded. This paper considers it expedient to develop an innovative conceptual model that captures and addresses this complexity of how the different geographies of the knowledge contribute to our understanding of sustainable development. This paper contends that this model is not only significant, because different contexts matter in the way knowledge is generated and applied (Black 2003; DeRose 2009). But more importantly, it provides theoretically relevant insights on how different geographies or spatial dynamics of the knowledge economies contribute to the understanding sustainable development. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The next section provides the theoretical background. The literature on geographies of knowledge and sustainable development are reviewed and synthesised to develop a conceptual model, with relevant research propositions. The main ideas and insights from the literature discussed and demonstrated how the proposed conceptual model and propositions were derived. The paper concludes by presenting the implications of the study for theory, practice, and policy. It also provides the limitations of the study and direction for future research.",3

Sandra Schillo,Fred Pries,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"The past decades have seen the academic “Ivory Tower” (Etzkowitz et al. 2000) open up as academic institutions have substantially increased their efforts to interact with the private sector and other stakeholders. Theories have mirrored this development, suggesting a transition from Mode 2 to the Triple Helix (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000) concept, which emphasizes the relations between university, industry and government. More recent developments recognize the importance of societal stakeholders in the Quadruple Helix concept (Carayannis and Campbell 2009; Carayannis and Campbell 2012) and incorporate consideration of the “natural environments of society” in the Quintuple Helix concept (Carayannis et al. 2012). This broadened understanding of the context of interactions at the center of the knowledge triangle (KT) is not limited to theoretical considerations; rather, it is reflected in the practice of knowledge interactions between researchers, the private sector and other stakeholders as well. One area of knowledge interactions in which these societal and environmental considerations have been particularly influential is related to the recent large-scale emergence of biofuels as complements or substitutes for fossil fuels. Initial efforts to commercially introduce biofuels relied on feedstocks that also serve as food for humans and animals were met by strong societal resistance, and their social and environmental sustainability was questioned. Alternative feedstocks were neither technically nor commercially feasible, so research and commercialization activities became central to achieving the environmental, societal, and commercial potential seen in biofuels. As technologies to utilize non-food feedstocks in biofuel production emerge from academic research in various forms of research outputs, our research explores the views of researchers and research users with regards to the research outputs and their utility. We consider the case of biofuels on the basis of interviews with two groups of respondents — researchers and research users. Research users include industry representatives, government employees in policy and regulatory functions, and respondents from non-governmental organizations. We find that researchers and research users show considerable commonality in their conceptualization of the accessibility and utility of research outputs, suggesting that Triple Helix relations can generally be established based on common grounds. However, we also find that there is less awareness of the requirements of stakeholders representing the societal and environmental considerations implied in the Quadruple and Quintuple Helices—even in this research area largely spawned by such considerations. The remainder of this document explores this topic by first reviewing the more traditional theoretical underpinnings of university-industry interactions and stakeholder considerations, and second the n-tuple Helix model, and in particular the Quadruple and Quintuple Helix models to emphasize the integration of university-stakeholder interactions within their environment. Next, we present the context of second generation biofuels research as a particularly striking case of the necessity to include societal and environmental considerations. Our empirical data, methods, and results are then presented and discussed, followed by a brief conclusion.",3

The Case of Eco-Innovations in Dunkirk, North of France",September 2019,Sophie Boutillier,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Innovation is the engine of economic growth and social change (Nelson and Winter 1982; Schumpeter 1911, 1942; Freeman and Louça 2001). Scholars usually study this topic in relation to large firms (Galbraith 1967; Chandler 1977) and the role of small and medium enterprise (Julien 1993; Audretsch 2006). The process of innovation in small enterprises is rarely studied. According to Schumpeter (1942) or Galbraith (1967), the activity of small enterprises should disappear, faced with the threat of industrialization and automation during the nineteenth and twentieth century, in opposition to Penrose (1959). We define small entrepreneurship by three main characteristics: (1) these entrepreneurs employ a small number of workers (up to 10 generally), (2) they develop their activity in low technological sectors (retail business, carpentry, plumbing, and so on), and (3) they create their enterprise where they live, generally to create their own job. Moreover, the activity of small enterprises is linked in many cases to local economic and social development, forming “industrial districts” (Marshall 1890), where big enterprises also play an important role. Small entrepreneurs are embedded in a given territory where they extract resources that they valorize, thanks to their social network (formal and informal) (Granovetter 1985). On the other hand, many researchers emphasize the positive role of the territory in promoting innovation, regarding synergic and positive links between the enterprise and the territory where they are embedded (Marshall 1890; Becattini 1990; Boutillier et al. 2016). They base their analysis on synergic relations between large and small enterprises (generally start-ups), but they do not say anything about small entrepreneurship in low technological sectors. They mainly underline the positive role played by small and large enterprises to support the economic dynamism of the territory, but in many real cases, the link between large and small enterprises does not exist. Indeed, we will talk about a “heavy industrial area in crisis”. The main originality of our paper is to link these relatively little-studied topics: the unsuspected capacity of small entrepreneurs to innovate and the negative role of the territory regarding the innovative process. The entrepreneurs interviewed in our inquiry developed eco-innovations in a territory characterized by no entrepreneurial dynamics and small number of big enterprises concentrated in heavy industrial activities, in an international context where new environmental challenges have been identified (since the Rio Conference in 1992), as the new engine of the economic and social development (Carayannis and Campbell 2011). Our article is based on a case study according to the Yin’s methodology (Yin 1994), with a statistical approach. We interviewed 50 small entrepreneurs in the town of Dunkirk, a heavy industrial area in crisis, located in the north of France, to identify which resources (in knowledge, financial and social resources) they are using to develop eco-innovations. These entrepreneurs are located in two main industrial sectors (building and energy). We have chosen this example because, in order to confront today’s climate problem, the French government has developed a program (the “Grenelle de l’environnement”) to facilitate the diffusion of eco-innovations in the French economy (for example, green building, alternative energies, and biomaterials, by means of tax reductions and the definition of new environmental standardsFootnote 1). Moreover, the territory of Dunkirk is dominated by a few multinational corporations (Arcelor-Mittal, Coca-Cola, Electricité de France, Air Liquide, Aluminum Dunkerque, etc.), with a high population of salaried workers. Our objective is to show how small entrepreneurs in this heavy industrial area can develop eco-innovations that they identify as new entrepreneurial opportunities? What are their motivations and their resources? Our article is organized as follows: first, we describe our theoretical framework to identify the role of entrepreneurs to change a heavy industrial area and to innovate. Second, we present our case study and we conclude by a discussion.",8

Empirical Evidence from Indonesia,September 2019,M. Shabri Abd. Majid,Sovia Dewi,Salina H. Kassim,Unknown,Unknown,Female,Female,"While the relationship between financial sector development and economic growth has been widely studied, in-depth investigation on the linkages between the financial sector development and real income has remained relatively meager. The issue of whether financial development improves real income, thus resulting in poverty reduction has been very much a subject of intense debate (Bittencourt 2009; Moreno 2011; Uddin et al. 2014; Devarajan et al. 2015), and amid the relatively thin literature in this area, there has yet to be any convincing evidence on the relationship between the two. For the developing countries, in particular, poverty reduction is considered as one of the main agenda in most of the countries’ development plans. Todaro (1997) highlighted that poverty is certainly a major issue in the developing countries; however, policies in promoting economic growth do not always result in improvement of the lives of the poor. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP 2014) reported that globally, 1.2 billion people (22% of the world’s population) live on less than USD1.25 a day. Increasing the poverty line to USD2.50 a day in line with the increase in the cost of living would raise the global poverty rate substantially to approximately 50%, or 2.7 billion people, indicating an alarming situation as about half of the world population is categorized as poor. Studies on the relationship between financial development and poverty reduction are particularly important for a developing country such as Indonesia where the poverty rate is still high. Based on data from the Central Statistics Agency of Indonesia (or Biro Pusat Statistik—BPS), the number of Indonesians living below the poverty line was 10.96% in 2014. The poverty rate has been declining by between 1.27–1.78% from 2004 to 2009; however, since 2010, poverty reduction slowed only in the range of 0.4–0.8%. Although the poverty rate is generally on declining trend, this has not been accompanied by the better distribution of income. The Gini coefficient which was increasing from 0.37 in 2009 to 0.41 in 2014 reflected the fact that income inequality in the country has actually widened. In addition, one of the important targets of the poverty reduction program set by the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000 has yet to be achieved entirely until its expiry in 2015. Thus, the effort to eradicate poverty was then continued by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with the target to end extreme poverty by 2030. The percentage of population living below the national poverty line was still high at 11.47%, substantially higher than the target set at 7.55% (Bappenas 2014). The various poverty alleviation programs are expected to be more effective if they were being supported by efficient resource mobilization, particularly financial resources. Healthy development in the financial sector is expected to attract these resources and enable efficient allocation of financial capital to the deserving economic units, regardless of their level of creditworthiness. With the rapid technological advancement that has changed the landscape of the financial sector, knowledge and awareness of the public on the financial products that are available and suitable for them is highly important. Increased digitisation and automation in the financial sector allow for greater customer reach, thus help to improve financial inclusion, especially among the lower income segment of the society. The use of domestic resource effectively is essential for economic growth and poverty reduction through the development of the financial sector. The financial sector mobilizes savings and channels them to the parties that need through credit, and thereby becomes a locomotive of growth of the real sector through the accumulation of capital and technology. The importance of the financial sector to eradicate poverty has long been recognized with several studies that have shown evidence that the development of the financial sector would be able to reduce the level of poverty (see, for example, Odhiambo 2010; Ho and Odhiambo 2011; Moreno 2011; Dhrifi 2014; Uddin et al. 2014; Shahbaz and Loganathan 2014; Akinboade and Kinfack 2014; Abosedra et al. 2015; and Miled and Rejeb 2015). The financial intermediation in Indonesia is being carried out by a variety of type of agencies, both banking and non-banking institutions consisting of capital markets, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, and pawn shops. The financial sector has recorded strong growth as indicated by the ratio of money supply to gross domestic product (GDP), which grew from 21.41% in 2009 to 37.3% in 2013. Similarly, the other indicator of financial sector growth, namely the ratio of domestic credit to the private sector also showed an encouraging performance from 36.96% in 2009 to 45.64% in 2013. However, empirical studies on the relationship between the financial sector growth and poverty alleviation, particularly in the context of Indonesia, have been meager. Thus, this study aims to fill the literature gap by focusing on providing an in-depth investigation of the relationship between financial development and poverty by specifically addressing the issue of whether financial sector growth could contribute towards poverty alleviation in Indonesia. The findings of the study are hoped to shed some lights for the policy makers to design an effective economic strategy to combat the poverty problem in Indonesia. The rest of this study is outlined as follows. “Financial Sector–Poverty Relationship: a Literature Review” section provides a selected literature review on the financial development-poverty nexus. “Data and Empirical Framework” section explains the data and highlights the empirical framework on which the data would be analyzed. “Findings and Discussion” section provides the results and their discussions. Finally, “Conclusions and Policy Implications” section concludes the paper by providing the recommendation and implication of the findings.",11

Howard,Albert N. Link,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The number of U.S. university science, research, and technology parks has been growing for more than 60 years. To illustrate this phenomenon, Fig. 1 shows the number of U.S. parks formed between 1951 and 2015, by year. Clearly, there was a surge in park formations beginning in the early 1980.Footnote 1 The post-early 1980 surge is also shown in the cumulative number of parks, by year, in Fig. 2; Fig. 2 is based on the 146 parks shown in Fig. 1.Footnote 2 While U.S. park growth is unparalleled, the number of countries involved in establishing science, research, and technology parks continues to increase. Number of U.S. university research parks founded between 1951 and 2015, by year Cumulative number of U.S. university research parks, 1951 to 2015 The United Nations Organization for Education, Science and Culture (UNESCO) estimates that there are more than 400 parks worldwide, not all of which are associated with a university, as are most parks in the United States. The UNESCO also estimates that the two countries at the top of the international list, in terms of number of parks, are Japan and China, each with more than 100 parks in total (UNESCO 2016a). In fact, the UNESCO has also documented that science park activity is occurring in countries in every continent except Antarctica. It is reasonable to ask why park growth is occurring worldwide. Building on discussions at the 2008 National Research Council of the U.S. National Academies world conference, Understanding Research, Science and Technology Parks: Global Best Practices, the number of parks might be growing worldwide because they are an important infrastructural element of the innovation systems of numerous countries. More simply (NRC 2009, p. 127): Science and technology parks are seen increasingly as a means to create dynamic clusters that accelerate economic growth and international competitiveness. Regarding terminology, Link and Scott (2007) documented, with respect to university-based parks, that science park was the term of preference in Europe, while the term of preference in Asia was technology park, and research park was the more prevalent term used in the United States. Today, it appears to us that the individual terms science, research, and technology as descriptors of parks no longer relate to the activities of tenants in a park along a spectrum of involvement in basic science to commercialization, but rather the terms are simply a means to differentiate the name of one park from another.Footnote 3 Various associations use their own terminology, and to us that terminology reflects more about the amenities offered by park administrators than a description of the activities of park tenants. The UNESCO (2016b) prefers the term science and technology park: The term “science and technology park” encompasses any kind of high-tech cluster such as: technopolis, science park, science city, cyber park, hi tech (industrial) park, innovation centre, R&D park, university research park, research and technology park, science and technology park, science city, science town, technology park, technology incubator, technology park, technopark, technopole and technology business incubator. The International Association of Science Parks (IASP 2016) prefers the term science park: A science park is an organisation managed by specialised professionals, whose main aim is to increase the wealth of its community by promoting the culture of innovation and the competitiveness of its associated businesses and knowledge-based institutions. The United Kingdom Science Park Association (UKSPA 2016) also prefers the term science park: Science parks nurture, support and provide their tenant companies with access to the very best information, knowledge and expert advice that helps to deliver their tenants future growth and expansion. [Parks] perform a key function acting as an interface between business and centres of knowledge such as universities, government funded laboratories, hospitals, and in some instances corporate laboratories, with the purpose of helping to commercialise ideas that arise from the UK’s research base. Finally, the American Association of University Research Parks (AURP 2016) prefers the term research park, and it defines a U.S. university research park as: … a property-based venture, which: master plans property designed for research and commercialization; creates partnerships with universities and research institutions; encourages the growth of new companies; translates technology; and drives technology-led economic development. As Link and Scott (2006) note, the common element in these definitions is that a park is an innovation-related infrastructure through which knowledge is exchanged, and a university is often a catalyst for that symbiotic relationship. Herein, we use the term research park not in an effort to parallel the preferences of the AURP, but rather to emphasize the formal name of Gateway University Research Park. This paper chronicles the early history of the development of the Gateway University Research Park (hereafter simply Gateway) at the North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NCA&T) and at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG). Gateway was founded in 2006, and it is one of 11 research parks in North Carolina (see Fig. 3). A brief description of each of these parks is in Appendix Table 4. Research parks in North Carolina. Source: http://www.nccommerce.com/sti/resources/research-parks, with the permission of the North Carolina Board of Science and Technology. Notes: Blue dots represent population. 1 dot = 500 people. Not all of the parks noted on this map are research parks in the traditional sense of the term as noted in the descriptions in Appendix Table 4 We document the institutional efforts of Greensboro’s faculty, administrators, and public leaders who moved the Gateway idea “from seed to harvest” in this paper in order to provide guideposts for other institutions to possibly follow that are contemplating establishing a research park.Footnote 4 To elaborate on the prior metaphor, the early history of Gateway documents that the initial “seed” for the park was contained in an initiative toward current regional economic development. That initial seed began to grow into the idea for collaborative research between the NCA&T and the UNCG. Finally, cooperation led to Gateway, the city of Greensboro, the Triad region of North Carolina, and the state of North Carolina reaping the “harvest.”Footnote 5 We emphasize the concept of cooperation not only because it is a cornerstone of the successful development of Gateway, but also because it might be a key guidepost element to which others relate. The NCA&T and UNCG are both part of the University of North Carolina (UNC) system, but each has a different history, a different character, a different historical culture, and different academic emphases. The NCA&T is a land-grant institution and an historically black university. Its strengths are in agriculture and engineering, by design. The UNCG was historically a woman’s college (until 1964) that excelled in education, the arts, and the sciences. It might be fair to say that for more than a century, the two institutions pursued separate paths toward educational and research excellence. However, due to a conflux of economic events and due to the leadership of forward-looking chancellors and campus leaders, a partnership between the two universities developed in the new millennium that has had, and will likely continue to have, an economic, educational, and cultural impact on Greensboro, and on the surrounding Triad communities that is for the common weal. The remainder of the paper is outlined as follows. In the “Early Development and the Birth of the Joint Millennial Campus” section, we discuss the early organizational development that led to the birth of the Joint Millennial Campus (defined below). In the “Building the Joint Millennial Campus, 2005–2008” section, we discuss key events associated with the development of the Joint Millennial Campus and Gateway University Research Park. In “The Growth of Gateway University Research Park” section, we reflect on the historical growth of the Gateway in terms of its key tenants and employees, and we encourage future scholars to elaborate on the economic development consequences of this milestone accomplishment known as the Gateway, and to possibly demonstrate that what is past is prologue.",4

Biryukova,Anastasiia I. Matiukhina,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Since the commencement of the new millennium, BRICS countries have demonstrated rapid services exports growth. These have been not only traditional types of services, such as transport and tourism, but also knowledge-based categories, comprising ICT servicesFootnote 1 that have gained momentum. During pre-crisis years, three BRICS countries, China, Russia and India, achieved 15% growth rates, while the world average equalled 9%. It is to note that invisible trade enlargement has not necessarily been accompanied by either products trade growth or countries’ industrial development. Vice versa, BRICS countries’ services exports have been increasing at a faster rate than that of goods, which has contributed to structural diversification of external trade. The direct impact of the ICT sector on the economy is associated with the penetration of information technology and services into remote areas of a country. Investments in ICT lead to the creation of new jobs and the improvement of social standards. The indirect effects of the development of the ICT sector are manifested in the growth of labour productivity, an increase in the inflow of foreign direct investment, the creation of innovative clusters and an increase in the competitiveness of the economy. The development of the information and communication technologies is an important factor in boosting the development economies. ICT services play specifically an important role among knowledge-intensive spheres, which are prerequisite for building a knowledge economy. The sector of services is an intermedium between theoretical and practical aspects of information technologies’ development. On the one hand, the evolution of services ensures that the information and communication technologies, which either have been or are being developed, are incorporated in the real sector of economy. On the other hand, as the segment is becoming the source of income for an increasing number of enterprises of different types of ownership, it spurs the development of new and innovative technologies and can, therefore, be considered as a driver for technical progress. For large and public corporations and governing bodies, information services represent an opportunity to guarantee more efficient functioning of interaction and management systems; for micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, these are a chance to enter the market and to compete against larger firms benefitting from their creativity. This study aims to contribute to the literature by determining the comparative development of ICT services in each BRICS country during the period from 2005 to 2015. The aim of this paper is to take a closer look at the services ICT landscape in BRICS group and to examine their cooperation in these fields. For that purpose, we combine three complementary perspectives: regulation policy and programmes, national statistics and trade development indicators. The findings indicate that the BRICS countries’ ICT markets are characterised by both common and individual features. All the countries of the group have recently undergone the painful process of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) restrictions’ cancellation but are still lacking regulatory framework transparency to ensure efficient capital redistribution in the sphere. The empirical findings also show that none of the group’s member countries may be admitted to fully realise their ICT markets’ development potential. As regards peculiarities, they are caused by two major types of factors: those engendered by different demand volumes (which, for instance, leads to different levels of broadband access development) and unequal possibilities to supply ICT services, which has been revealed by revealed comparative advantage (RCA) analysis. Finally, we examine whether the countries have been successfully cooperated in the field of services ICT. The most efficient BRICS countries’ collaboration in the sphere of ICT services has been fulfilling at bilateral basis. Uneven conjuncture of countries’ ICT service markets accompanied by similar historic development milestones undoubtedly appear to represent a possibility to leverage cooperation efficiency. We have organised the paper as follows. ‘Literature Review’ discusses the literature on BRICS, and ICT development issues in this group is reviewed. In ‘The Evolution of ICT Services’ Sector in Russia,’ ‘The Evolution of ICT Services’ Sector in Brazil,’ ‘The Evolution of ICT Services’ Sector in China,’ ‘The Evolution of ICT Services’ Sector in India’ and ‘The Evolution of ICT Services’ Sector in South Africa,’ we describe the most relevant features of the ICT services’ sectors in each member of BRICS group (Russia, Brazil, China, India and South Africa). Then, ‘BRICS Countries’ Trade in ICT Services: Commonalities and Peculiarities’ examines a range of questions concerning the BRICS countries’ trade in ICT services. The conclusions of the possibilities for BRICS co-operation in ICT services sphere drawn from these results are summarised in the final section.",16

Europe’s economic growth heavily depends on entrepreneurial activity (Feki and Mnif 2016; Wilson 2008), which may offer a faster recovery to countries challenged by economic recession (Papaoikonomou et al. 2012). Entrepreneurial activity is not only a matter of opportunity discovery and exploitation (Shane and Venkataraman 2000), but it is also a matter of intentional planning. Before one’s engagement to entrepreneurship, intentions are developed through cognitive processing of the environmental factors (Della Peruta 2014). Intention is a cognizant process prior to one’s actual involvement into any kind of activity (Liñán and Chen 2009), and entrepreneurial intention (EI) is considered as one’s will to get involved with entrepreneurship. EI is widely accepted as a valid predictor of entrepreneurial behavior (Bird 1988; Ferreira et al. 2012; Krueger and Carsrud 1993; Shapero and Sokol 1982) and has become a rapidly evolving field of interdisciplinary research (Liñán and Fayolle 2015). However, the realization of the intentions into entrepreneurial actions becomes complicated when entrepreneurial constraints or barriers are present (Choo and Wong 2006; Kolvereid and Isaksen 2006). The perception of barriers increases the uncertainty of the prospective entrepreneur (McMullen and Shepherd 2006) acting against entrepreneurial activity, throughout the different phases of the entrepreneurial career (Carayannis et al. 2003; Iakovleva et al. 2014). The perceptions of the contextual environment are very critical for the EIs of tertiary students (Krueger and Brazeal 1994), and the association of the entrepreneurial barriers with students EIs is very relevant, especially for countries challenged by the economic crisis, like Greece. In these countries, entrepreneurship may offer a solution to the problem of unemployment through the creation of innovative entrepreneurial start-ups. The barriers to entrepreneurship are often studied in the literature and their negative impact on the realization of entrepreneurial activity is indisputable. However, studies analyzing the impact of entrepreneurial barriers on students’ EIs are still rare (Campanella et al. 2013; Pruett et al. 2009). The ambiguity of the derived factors in combination to the differentiating power of the effects and the fuzzy role of demographics, put up an inconsistent image, requiring further examination. The necessity for further research in the domain of entrepreneurial barriers is also corroborated by Liñán and Fayolle (2015), stressing that the research on the impact of perceived barriers on EIs is underdeveloped. Additionally, the development of scales for measuring the impact of barriers and motives is suggested for the improvement of the predictive ability of the existing intentional models (Pruett et al. 2009). Finally, the incorporation of the barriers in the existing intentional theories, as possible precipitating events, could contribute to the development of a unified theory of motives, barriers, and intentions (Iakovleva et al. 2014), which could offer better interpretation of the influential factors, highlight differences between demographic groups and provide insights about the proper educational interventions. Regarding the fruitful IT sector, an increased demand in sophisticated ICT services expected, due to the evolution of Industry 4.0 (Hynes and Richardson 2008), will boost the Greek software development market. Therefore, a new generation of inspired and motivated IT entrepreneurs is required to undertake this challenge, armed with both technical and managerial knowledge and experience, essential for high-tech entrepreneurship (Park 2005). Since information technology is among the most knowledge-intensive industries with continuously shifting barriers to entry (Butler and Murphy 2009), scholars are concerned about the proper educational approaches to instill students with the ability to recognize and chase opportunities of technology innovation, taking full advantage of the possessed scientific knowledge and skills (Del Giudice et al. 2014; Doboli et al. 2010). However, there is very little research concerning entrepreneurship education in the field (Kaltenecker et al. 2015), although researchers claim that engineering students generally, do not consider entrepreneurship as an option (Maresch et al. 2016). As a consequence, the study of the perceptions of tertiary IT students, in regard to entrepreneurial barriers, is very relevant, as it may highlight critical factors for the formation of EIs (Liñán et al. 2011; Liñán and Fayolle 2015), which might hinder the exploitation of future opportunities. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article examining the effect of the entrepreneurial barriers on the development of EIs of tertiary IT students. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Firstly, a survey and categorization of the entrepreneurial barriers according to the literature is presented. Secondly, a statistical analysis of the data collected through a cross-sectional survey is conducted to identify the most influential entrepreneurial barriers regarding tertiary IT students. Thirdly, statistical regression is used in order to identify causal relations between EIs and barriers in comparison with the effect of self-motivation. Finally, possible differences in the perceptions of barriers between gender groups, and the effect of parental role models, are examined. Intention is the basic concept of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and denotes one’s willingness to exert a certain behavior (Ajzen 1991). EI is considered the will to get involved with entrepreneurial activity and according to the TPB is predicted by three motivational antecedents, namely personal attitude (PA), perceived behavioral control (PBC), and social norms (SN). EI is widely accepted as a valid predictor of entrepreneurial behavior (Bird 1988; Ferreira et al. 2012; Kolvereid and Isaksen 2006; Krueger and Carsrud 1993; Shapero and Sokol 1982) and has become a rapidly evolving field of interdisciplinary research (Liñán and Fayolle 2015). A large number of studies already proved the predictive ability of the TPB. The term role model, refers to a person or group of reference, used as a successful example, shaping the aspirations of younger people (Scherer et al. 1989). The presence of an entrepreneur in the family or in the social environment generally acts as an entrepreneurial role model. Role models are considered to have a positive effect on EI through self-efficacy (Chen et al. 1998), by positively affecting the perception of entrepreneurial abilities (BarNir et al. 2011). Although, there are some conflicts about the results (Krueger et al. 2000; Miller et al. 2009); nevertheless, the use of entrepreneurial role models is suggested for the promotion of entrepreneurial spirit of engineering students (Maresch et al. 2016). The barriers to entrepreneurship became part of the European political agenda since 2004, when in a brochure about entrepreneurship cooperation in EU; a number of factors, such as fiscal and monetary policies, regulatory and administrative burdens, legal entry barriers for specific businesses, time-consuming business registration procedures, inflexible employment regulation, and discouraging exit costs, to name a few, were referred as serious impediments to entrepreneurship (Martins et al. 2004). The interest of academic research in issues related to entrepreneurship and the entrepreneurial barriers seems to be growing every year and especially in periods of economic crisis. The barriers to entrepreneurship, referred in the literature, can be classified into internal or external, taking in account whether their emanating source is the individual (endogenous) or some environmental factor (exogenous). This classification proposed by some scholars (Ledyaeva et al. 2008; Sesen and Pruett 2014; Stamboulis and Barlas 2014) was chosen, because of its generality and simplicity. A short reference to the two categories of barriers recorded in the literature (based on previous research by the authors) follows: In the internal barrier category are included barriers related to the following: Personality traits such as lack of motivation (Iakovleva et al. 2014), lack of courage and volition (Birdthistle 2008), low self-efficacy (Boyd and Vozikis 1994; Zhao 2005), lack of confidence, and fear of risk and financial responsibilities (Finnerty and Krzystofik 1985; Giacomin et al. 2011; Sandhu et al. 2011) play a vital role on entrepreneurial start-up. Knowledge, entrepreneurial skills, and competencies play a vital role in entrepreneurial success (Carayannis et al. 2003). Lack of such capacities acts as inhibitory factors against the choice of an entrepreneurial career and a business start-up (Birdthistle 2008; Robertson et al. 2003; Shinnar et al. 2009). Entrepreneurial education, on the other hand, has a positive effect on the perception of barriers to entrepreneurship (Miller et al. 2009; Ribeiro et al. 2014). Negative attitude towards entrepreneurship is considered a barrier to entrepreneurship (Ledyaeva et al. 2008; Sandhu et al. 2011; Smith and Beasley 2011). However, personal attitude is one of the three antecedents of intentions towards entrepreneurship (Ajzen 2002), which refers to the acceptance of the idea of becoming an entrepreneur (Hui-Chen et al. 2014) and is considered a major driver of EIs. It indicates one’s commitment to the aim of establishing and running a business (Kolvereid and Isaksen 2006). Personal attitude is excessively examined in the literature, and we will not examine it any further in this article. Gender-related stereotypical perceptions, such as “gender appropriate occupations” (BarNir et al. 2011), are negatively affecting career choices. Discriminations towards female entrepreneurs raise financial or start-up difficulties (Akehurst et al. 2012) while lack of social support to entrepreneurial initiatives, taken by females, is met in certain cultures (Alvarez et al. 2011). Thus, gender can be also considered a barrier to entrepreneurship under certain contexts. The internal barriers to entrepreneurship are summarized in Table 1. In the category of external barriers are included the following factors: Funding is probably the most crucial problem to entrepreneurship (Finnerty and Krzystofik 1985). The lack of initial capital, financial difficulties, etc. are also referred to as barriers to entrepreneurship by students (Birdthistle 2008; Franke and Lüthje 2004; Ledyaeva et al. 2008; Shinnar et al. 2009; Smith and Beasley 2011). Informal factors, such as lack of entrepreneurial role models, can influence the image of entrepreneurship in certain cultures (Hawkins 1993; Pruett et al. 2009). Lack of social support (Baughn and Neupert 2003) and family obligations (Finnerty and Krzystofik 1985; Martins et al. 2004) are other informal factors affecting EI. Informal support is indirectly measured through subjective norm, a construct of the TPB (Ajzen 1991). The lack of institutional (formal) support is considered as a major drawback to one’s entrepreneurial plans (Giacomin et al. 2011; Pruett et al. 2009; Sesen and Pruett 2014; Smith and Beasley 2011). Formal or institutional support includes institutional funding, subsidies, consulting, and service support, referred as a barrier not only by actual entrepreneurs (Akehurst et al. 2012; Hulsink and Koek 2014), but also by students. Resource constraints, including human resources and infrastructures, are critical to business start-up. Lack of resources is considered a barrier to entrepreneurship, referred by actual entrepreneurs (Sandhu et al. 2011) and occasionally by students (Ledyaeva et al. 2008; Stamboulis and Barlas 2014). Market-related barriers include the lack of social network (Sandhu et al. 2011), lack of knowledge of the market (Shinnar et al. 2009), difficulty to contact or find customers (Birdthistle 2008; Ledyaeva et al. 2008; Stamboulis and Barlas 2014), tough competition (Franke and Lüthje 2004), lack of original ideas, and finally, difficulty of business opportunity recognition (Franke and Luthje 2003; Iakovleva et al. 2014; Miller et al. 2009; Pruett et al. 2009; Stamboulis and Barlas 2014). Law and regulation raise constraints, due to the complexity or the inconsistencies of the legal framework (Baughn and Neupert 2003). Time-consuming registration procedures (Iakovleva et al. 2014) and frequently changing labor regulations are frequently perceived as barriers to entrepreneurship by students (Franke and Luthje 2003; Franke and Lüthje 2004; Ledyaeva et al. 2008) and actual entrepreneurs (Choo and Wong 2006). Bureaucracy, administrative burden, and difficulties to comply with regulations are obstacles related to the affairs between individuals and the state (Finnerty and Krzystofik 1985) which usually cause some frictions (Martins et al. 2004). These kinds of barriers to entrepreneurship are perceived also by students affecting their EI (Franke and Lüthje 2004; Stamboulis and Barlas 2014). However, there are minor differentiations between countries (Pruett et al. 2009). Corruption (Ledyaeva et al. 2008; Stamboulis and Barlas 2014) and high taxation (Sesen and Pruett 2014) are barriers also included in the same category. Finally, the overall perception of the economic and political situation, expressing general business climate, stability, or uncertainty, is referred as hard reality (Finnerty and Krzystofik 1985), influencing the EIs of actual entrepreneurs, as well as students (Sesen and Pruett 2014). The external barriers to entrepreneurship are summarized in Table 2. A summary of the articles previously discussed, studying student perceptions of entrepreneurial barriers, is given in Table 15. However, from the nine articles examining the impact of various contextual factors on EI, only six conduct a factor analysis followed by regression in order to reveal underlying causal relations. These core articles are shown in Table 14. From the rest of the articles, eight use descriptive statistics to present the perceptions of entrepreneurial barriers, three articles use qualitative research, and two articles discuss the issue theoretically. Studying the articles of Table 15, we encountered a series of problems. The first problem was the arbitrary selection of barriers, resulting in ambiguous combinations. Most authors examined internal factors like attitudes, self-efficacy, self-confidence, knowledge, and experience, in combination to external ones. Franke and Lüthje (2003), for example, examined bank financing, regulatory obligations and business idea in combination to attitude and risk and found an overall negative effect on EI. However, in some cases, the entrepreneurial barriers were examined in ambiguous combinations, i.e., barriers with different sources of origin that comprised common factors lacking of conceptual consistency. As an example, Miller et al. (2009) used a one-factor solution for all the barriers they examined, Akehurst et al. (2012) mixed the lack of infrastructures in a common factor with the lack of training, while Sesen and Pruett (2014) used a common factor for economic climate and entrepreneurial competencies. This arbitrary mixture of internal and external barriers can create ambiguities about the interrelations and the significance of the constraints. Additionally, only few of these researches included items for all of the 12 categories of internal and external entrepreneurial barriers aforementioned. Thus, the development of a scale for entrepreneurial barriers, suggested by Pruett et al. (2009), is mandatory for the better understanding of their effect on EIs. The second problem is the diversity in the effect of demographics such as gender and role models. BarNir et al. (2011) examined the lack of role model as a possible influential factor on career intention and found a significant effect; however, the hypothesized difference in the impact of role models on intentions of men and women was not confirmed. Examining a mixture of internal and external barriers using a sample of American students (Miller et al. 2009), the barriers of business knowledge and skills, finance, law, and business idea were found to have a significant negative impact on EI, whereas the impact of role models was insignificant. Thus, it becomes evident that the effect of gender and role models varies depending on the specific setup and should be further examined. The third problem is the diversity in the power of the effects of barriers and motives. A number of papers examined different nationalities of students, seeking for cultural differences in the impact of barriers in combination to the motives towards entrepreneurship. The research on motivation was brought in the foreground of entrepreneurship research mainly by the TPB (Ajzen 1991). The authors, presented in the literature review, examined barriers along with various combinations of motives. Sesen and Pruett (2014) examined both internal and external barriers and found lack of self-confidence, an internal barrier, to be the most influential barrier among Turkish students, whereas American students were more influenced by an external barrier, namely, lack of support structures. In a previous research, Pruett et al. (2009) had examined the effect of internal and external barriers on EI. Specifically, they examined the role of knowledge, self-efficacy and support structures, and start-up and operating risks as barriers between American, Spanish, and Chinese students. The lack of knowledge was the most important barrier, with start-up and operating risks being less important. Sesen and Pruett (2014) also examined the motives of American and Turkish students and found significant differences. Turkish students for example were motivated by their desire for creation, profit, social status, and independence, whereas Americans were mostly motivated by their desire for creation and personal development. However, the overall impact of motives was higher (in terms of beta coefficients) for the American students. On the other hand, the impact of barriers for the Turkish students was very close to that of motives. In another sample examined by Pruett et al. (2009), independence and creativity were found to be the most influential motives for students. However, the effect of motives was not as powerful as the effect of barriers. By these examples, it becomes evident that the overall effect of barriers and motives varies, depending on the methodological approach of each study or due to differences in the socio-cultural and economic environment examined (Caloghirou et al. 2016). Since research examining the role of motivation as a predictor of EI is still underdeveloped (Carsrud and Brännback 2011), this inconclusiveness in the effect of barriers compared to the effect of self-motivation should be further examined. In this study, in order to evaluate the impact of motivation versus the impact of entrepreneurial barriers, the concept of self-motivation towards entrepreneurship was employed, which is positively related to the three antecedents of the TPB (Hui-Chen et al. 2014; Solesvik 2013). The purpose of this article is to increase our knowledge of the entrepreneurial barriers perception of tertiary students in the IT field. This will provide better understanding of the mechanisms behind the complex phenomenon of the realization of intentions into entrepreneurial actions, under the perception of entrepreneurial barriers (Kolvereid and Isaksen 2006). Students are the ideal research group, because they are one step before crucial occupational choices. The questions seeking for answers may include the following: Which of the barriers are more influential for students’ EIs? What is the role of self-motivation in the formation of EIs? Does the perception of entrepreneurial barriers vary by gender? Does the existence of entrepreneurial role models affect the perception of entrepreneurial barriers? Does the perception of barriers outperform the effect of self-motivation? According to the literature review, the barriers most commonly mentioned by students are those of the internal type. Few studies suggest that students are also influenced by external barriers such as finance, regulations, and lack of business ideas (Franke and Luthje 2003), because they have limited or no experience from the actual conditions of the market, and therefore, they ignore many of the entrepreneurial barriers reported by actual entrepreneurs. Their perceptions in many cases are based on the general perceptions regarding business creation and not on personal experience, and therefore, they cannot be considered valid (Campanella et al. 2013). However, no matter how valid they are, these perceptions influence the shaping of the students’ EIs (Krueger and Brazeal 1994). Under this scope we argue that: H1. Students’ EIs are negatively affected by the perception of barriers. H2. Students’ EIs are affected more by the internal barriers than the external barriers to entrepreneurship. Lack of motivation is considered as a barrier to entrepreneurship, reported by tertiary students (Iakovleva et al. 2014). Some researchers explored the causal relations between various motives and EI (Pruett et al. 2009; Sesen and Pruett 2014). However, their findings were somewhat precarious, with significant differences in the causal effects. Chang Hui-Chen et al. (2014), in an attempt to unify the TPB with the motivation-opportunity-ability theory, examined the role of self-motivation towards entrepreneurship and found it to be a major driver of the three motivational antecedents of the TPB and particularly of PA. Moreover, they acknowledged a direct effect of self-motivation on EI. Therefore, we presume the existence of a positive link between entrepreneurial self-motivation and EIs of IT students, and moreover, we argue that self-motivation towards entrepreneurship of IT students has a more powerful effect than perceived barriers do: H3a. Entrepreneurial self-motivation of tertiary IT students is positively related to EIs. H3b. Entrepreneurial self-motivation of tertiary IT students has a more powerful effect on EI than the effect of barriers. Entrepreneurship is traditionally considered to be a field of occupation dominated by males, but in the recent decades, female entrepreneurship has dynamically evolved (Wang and Wong 2004). Nevertheless, women are still experiencing difficulties in the entrepreneurial terrain due to stereotypes and family responsibilities (BarNir et al. 2011; Del Giudice 2014). Gender is a factor attracting a considerable amount of research on EIs, with conflicting results. A number of studies suggest that female respondents actually report decreased entrepreneurial aspirations compared to their male counterparts (Hundt and Sternberg 2016; Joensuu-Salo et al. 2015; Karimi et al. 2014a; Langowitz and Minniti 2007; Ledyaeva et al. 2008; Sandhu et al. 2011; Venkatapathy and Pretheeba 2014), whereas individual studies find no differences between the genders (Pruett et al. 2009). Additionally, in certain contexts, females show more willingness towards entrepreneurship than males (Saadin and Daskin 2015). The effect of gender therefore is not straightforward, and further investigation of the role of gender in EIs is required (Liñán and Fayolle 2015). Additionally, variations depending on contextual conditions like the domain of studies (Venkatapathy and Pretheeba 2014) raise questions about the EIs of male and female IT students. Regarding Greece, despite the high educational levels and the presence of women in managerial jobs, the gender gap still remains in entrepreneurship (Apergis and Pekka-Economou 2010). The reduced EIs of women may suggest an increased perception of barriers to entrepreneurship (BarNir et al. 2011; Liñán and Fayolle 2015; Shinnar et al. 2012), due to family responsibilities, gender stereotypes, and career breaks (BarNir et al. 2011; Del Giudice 2014; Liñán and Fayolle 2015; Shinnar et al. 2012). In order to examine the possible differentiation of the impact of entrepreneurial barriers on the EIs of male and female tertiary IT students, the next hypothesis is posed: H4. Female tertiary IT students have decreased EIs and increased entrepreneurial barriers perception, in comparison to their male counterparts. Among contextual factors, entrepreneurial role models have a significant impact on EIs (Peterman and Kennedy 2003; Pruett et al. 2009; Van Auken et al. 2006) and constitute a very promising field of research in regard to EIs (Liñán and Fayolle 2015). The existence of entrepreneurial role models in the family or in the social environment has a positive effect on EIs (Carr and Sequeira 2007; Wang and Wong 2004), through the formation of positive attitudes and beliefs (Karimi et al. 2014b; Krueger et al. 2000). This effect is achieved by providing “tacit knowledge” on opportunity recognition and business creation (Campanella et al. 2013), increasing the perceived desirability and feasibility upon starting a business (Krueger and Brazeal 1994). Women tend to be affected by role models from their close environment, whereas men are influenced more by socially promoted entrepreneurial role models. This may be due to the conflicting roles women have to deal with, if they choose self-employment (BarNir et al. 2011). Furthermore, successful entrepreneurial role models, used in different educational approaches, triggered an increase of EIs (Mueller 2011; Venkatapathy and Pretheeba 2014). In order to investigate the impact of role models on the perception of barriers of tertiary IT students, the next hypotheses are posed: H5a. Students with entrepreneurial role models in their social environment have increased EI. H5b. Students with entrepreneurial role models in their social environment have decreased perception of entrepreneurial barriers.",20

A well-planned transition process includes a process of technological change, social and economic transformation, policy and legal re-organisation among the others, which take place at different levels of aggregation such as international, national, regional and corporate. The discussion in the present paper focuses on how to achieve transition towards fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), which have been considered as a future vision for the automotive industry. A transition of the transport sector, overall, towards greater sustainability and eco-efficiency is high on the political agenda of many governments (Schippl, 2016). Manufacturers in the industry have been working on concepts and prototypes for more than a decade now, while having advancements in addressing the main technical challenges like battery life. In parallel with the technological developments, recent discussions about global warming and climate change caused by carbon dioxide emissions brought public support for emission free vehicles, which are perceived as an asset. Despite of advancements and public support, the introduction of FCEVs is still not at the desirable levels. Car manufacturers frequently announce the near time launch of FCEVs, which are postponed with the same frequency. Numerous business models and market projections have been made for the launch of FCEVs resulting in promising roadmaps. But it is obvious that these roadmaps reflected mainly the technology side while lacking a fully fledged consideration of the market side. The reason for this may be the fact that some of the actual and potential stakeholders are overlooked. Commonly, market roadmaps make assumptions of customers’ behavior, take into account competing products etc. but neglect the more or less ‘hidden’ stakeholders, which become obvious if one analyses the systemic impact of FCEVs as innovations within industry value chains in relation to the transportation sector in a broader sense. The present paper aims to make an attempt of a systemic analysis for a broader and more holistic view, which may portray the bigger picture, and help to understand the industrial dynamics better. The key argument is that the stakeholder base in the transportation industry, and in FCEVs in particular, is broader than usually thought. There are a number of other issues to be addressed for a successful and widespread launch of FCEVs. The roadmap presented in the study, entitled ‘FCEV Global Market Creation’, undertakes a broader analysis of Society, Technology, Economy, Environment and Politics (STEEP) at two stages. First, the STEEP systems are discussed and the stakeholders for each item are analysed. From this analysis, some potential barriers for the diffusion of FCEVs have become clearer. A more in-depth analysis may yield more insights for the implementation of the FCEVs. Thus, the second section of the paper provides a background for the study and motivations and main issues for the transition into FCEVs. Approach and methodology used for analysis will be described in the third section. Following, a systematic and holistic analysis of external drivers and stakeholders will be presented in the fourth section to uncover broader set of issues affecting the FCEVs. The final section of the paper will present a roadmap template to bring together demand and supply dynamics and strategies to be adopted for successful FCEV implementation.",18

As highlighted in the OECD (2014) Ministerial Council Statement, governments have to respond to the rising inequality as it could endanger social cohesion and hamper the economic resilience of their countries (Alfantookh and Bakry 2013). In their quest towards “resilient economies and inclusive societies,” governments have to put great effort to rebuild public trust through greater openness, transparency, and accountability. Hence, opening up data and analyzing it by public and private organizations hold the key to unlocking economic gains. Governments and public authorities should view open data not just as an opportunity to bring in transparency and accountability but also as an enabler of economic growth and a driver of innovation () Data is now woven into every sector and function in the global economy, and, like other essential factors of production such as hard assets and human capital, much of modern economic activity simply could not take place without it (Belle et al. 2015). The use of big data—large pools of data that can be brought together and analyzed to discern patterns and make better decisions—will become the norm for public and private institutions alike, enhancing productivity and creating significant value for the world economy by reducing waste and increasing the quality of products and services. Until now, the torrent of data flooding our world has been a phenomenon that probably only excited a few data geeks. But we are now at an inflection point. According to research from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) and McKinsey & Company’s Business Technology Office, the sheer volume of data generated, stored, and mined for insights has become economically relevant to governments, businesses, and consumers. The history of previous trends in IT investment and innovation and its impact on competitiveness and productivity strongly suggest that big data can have a similar power to transform our lives. The same preconditions that allowed previous waves of IT-enabled innovation to power productivity, i.e., technology innovations followed by the adoption of complementary management innovations, are in place for big data, and we expect suppliers of big data technology to have an ongoing impact on productivity as suppliers of other kinds of technology. All governments and companies need to embrace big data and its potential to create value for the citizens and their customers. A report from public CIO in 2015 has stated that retailers embracing big data see the potential to increase their operating margins by 60% and could reduce nation’s health care cost by 8% (Deal 2002). The use of big data is becoming a crucial way for government to lead by example to leverage data-driven strategies to innovate, compete, and capture value. Indeed, we found early examples of such use of big data in every sector we have examined. In healthcare, data pioneers are analyzing the health outcomes of pharmaceuticals when they were widely prescribed, and discovering benefits and risks that were not evident during necessarily more limited clinical trials. Other early adopters of big data are using data from sensors embedded in products from children’s toys to industrial goods to determine how these products are actually used in the real world. Such knowledge is used to create new service offerings and the design of future products. Data and analytics is the combination of two powerful computing trends in government. Public and private organizations are beginning to amass huge amounts of structured and unstructured data and are using the algorithms in analytics software programs to make more informed decisions in diverse fields for example healthcare, disaster management, crime and security, traffic management etc. This is resulting in saved time and financial resources while seamlessly improving quality services for agencies and citizens alike. At present, data residing in Ministries and Departments are in silos, in different platforms, which contribute to inconsistency and hence affecting the quality of information that is being generated from such systems. For the purpose of this study, two signals for big data activities have been identified in public sector in Mauritius, the “implementation of e-Health Project at the Jeetoo Hospital” and “Open Government Data Initiative.” These two trends have been identified using PEST analysis and analyzed using future techniques such as future wheels and causal layer analysis to diagnose the primary and secondary impact in the economy. Finally, for Mauritius to take advantage of this new avenue, a series of recommendations have been provided for the smooth implementation of these initiatives.",2

10.0,3.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,02 March 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-018-0521-5,A Processual Approach for the Quadruple Helix Model: the Case of a Regional Project in Uppsala,September 2019,Jessica García-Terán,Annika Skoglund,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The triple helix (TH) concept emerged from studies of how governments partner with universities and industries to accomplish a more innovative climate (Etzkowitz 2008). Carayannis and Campbell (2009, 2011) defined the quadruple helix (QH) as an extension of the TH model to account for the role of civil society and how people are invited to participate in the creation of knowledge and innovation. Theoretically, the helix model refers to structures and processes where the diversity of agents are arranged into “fluid and heterogeneous innovation networks” (Carayannis and Campbell 2011, p. 342) in which innovations are conceived to be stimulated by a co-creation process among the actors (Füzi 2013) and where a “fluid movement of knowledge” takes place (MacGregor et al. 2010, p. 186). Nonetheless, few helix studies address the interactions and events involved in QH configurations (university-industry-government and civil society) as a process (see Lindberg et al. 2014; Björk 2014). The purpose of this paper is to better understand QH configurations when it comes to their processual nature, i.e., how they emerge and evolve. To address this research curiosity, we turn to a project initiated by the regional office in Uppsala, Sweden. The regional office contacted the local university to integrate an innovation within renewable energy technology in the renovation of an old bridge. The purpose of working together with the university was, in addition to the renovation, to support a spinoff company and facilitate a commercialization of renewable technology in the region. Empirical material was collected over 2 years by following the planning of the renovation project. During this time, the actors under study were local authorities working for the regional office at Uppsala municipality, a group of researchers at Uppsala University, and a spinoff company holding the patent for a marine current power turbine. External consultants and members of the civil society were also included in the collection of empirical material as they later became involved with the project. The analytical interest in a processual perspective aligns with an interest in how collaborations develop over time, where specifically the interactions between actors are suggested to be complex in commercialization of energy-related innovations (Dougherty and Dunne 2011). The transformation of societies into more sustainable ones is additionally recognized as complex since it demands multifaceted knowledge production and dissemination (Grundel and Dahlström 2016), where a smooth step-by-step inclusion of the general public, the fourth helix, is of utmost importance (Carayannis and Campbell 2011). Hence, instead of looking at the QH as a model for systematic stimulation of innovations and commercialization, this article focuses on how a specific collaboration unfolds and how helices are shaped processually via micro-processes of change (e.g., see Tsoukas and Chia 2002). This contributes to both an empirical in-depth description of a commercialization process and a theoretical advancement of the processual nature of the helix model. To be able to craft our contribution, we turn to process studies of entrepreneurship (Steyaert 1997, 2007; McMullen and Dimov 2013; Hjorth et al. 2015). We relate to entrepreneurship since the entrepreneurial university inspired the helix concept in the first place (Etzkowitz 1983) and since the helix model focuses on how to foster an innovative environment for new firms, organizations, initiatives, and strategic alliances (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000), which are linked to the entrepreneurial process (Lindberg et al. 2014). The article starts with an introduction to the QH innovation model, followed by an application of the processual approach. Then we describe the method by which the material has been collected, as well as the analytical framework used to understand the micro-processes of change. Thereafter follows the analysis of interactions and events, presented as a narrative of how the helices unfold over time. Next, we discuss our findings and explore the theoretical possibilities and pitfalls for understanding the helix model processually. Finally, we pin down the practical implications for local authorities that are interested in directing similar entrepreneurial processes in dialog with the university and civil society.",10

Globalization represents opportunities, as well as barriers, when making business decisions. The globalization trend embodies ever-closer relationships among nations in terms of the production and movement of goods, services, capital, and labor (Stiglitz 2008). In effect, business organizations function without regard to national borders as alliances and outsourcing become common; they set strategies that are based on absolutely maximizing the returns in the medium and long runs (Go and van’t Klooster 2006). The national borders seem not to be so pronounced, and cross-border production and service networks are highly integrated at different levels of the global economy (Bianchi 2002). Furthermore, emerging markets are playing a more dynamic role in the global economy as they are growing at a faster pace and integrating into the international trade system. However, they are facing an increasingly complex situation to adapt to the global challenges (Law et al. 2014). This study examines the readiness of five nations that have applied to join the European Union (EU) as perceived by business owners and top managers within those nations. The EU classifies these nations as “five candidate countries”—Albania, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM), Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey (EU Newsroom 2017). The readiness of these nations is measured by their adaptation to the global business challenges. This study evaluates how well these nations are prepared to join the EU and for their managers to deal with businesses competitiveness in general. There are many studies that have collected information about these five countries using different sources, metrics, and definitions. The contribution of this study to the already existing scholarship on EU accession and the business environment conditions among these five nations is to gain insights from an analysis of consistent secondary material collected by the World Bank. This study fills the gap in the existing literature by using one reliably gathered survey across business owners and top managers from indigenous firms in each nation. The focus of this research is of local business decision-makers within all five nations and to uncover any significant problems facing these candidate nations to deal with the challenges of doing business as part of the EU and, by extension, to participate in the global marketplace. The negotiations for ascension are continuing with these five nations, there is debate as to when further EU enlargement may occur. The candidate countries are different and unlikely join together (Ionescu 2016). Their ascension efforts are operating at different rates—if at all—for numerous reasons according to experts (Gateva et al. 2016). Moreover, many hurdles and requirements have to be met by these nations before all the existing EU members support admittance of a new member. The decision to join EU is subsequently ratified by the European Parliament and then by each of the parliaments of the EU member nations. Nevertheless, even given a sense of “enlargement fatigue” that apparently has come to pervade within the EU (Phinnemore and İçener 2016), there is little evidence to suggest that the enlargement of the EU will soon stop (Sonmez 2016). This analysis does not focus on political disputes and the other aspects of political cooperation between the countries of the region, such as discussed by Sergi and Qerimi (2016). While on the long road to join, there are other issues beyond the scope of the present study. Among others, these include security interests in the EU as well as the humanitarian and political problems with migrants and refugees. The public attitudes and sentiment concerning future EU enlargement including religious aspects are also topics explored and discussed in other studies such as by Çarkoğlu and Glüpker-Kesebir (2016) as well as Azrout and Wojcieszak (2017). The study includes the following four sections: (1) The “Literature Review” section highlights relevant research in the field and concludes with the test hypotheses and defines the research question; (2) research methodology section explains the research model, data type, and collection; (3) “Data Analysis” section includes the research output; and (4) “Conclusions and Implications” and “Limitations and Recommendations” sections include the final conclusion, implications of the study as well as the limitations of the study.",1

For this reason, public authorities had to set a political agenda about searching for new approaches to innovation policy implementation. Innovation policy also became a regional issue, and almost all regional development strategies include aspects relating to science, technology, and innovation issues. Moreover, regional development strategies are based on regional foresight, which allows for choosing appropriate approaches to develop regional strategy in cooperation with basic actors including representatives of the research, educational, and innovation spheres. Regional innovation policy usually touches upon strategies of many different actors. Harmonization of all these interests requires special technique aimed at achieving consensus between regional economic agents. Foresight can be one of the most effective approaches to attain this goal (Georghiou and Keenan 2004; Meissner 2014; Kindras et al. 2014; Cervantes and Meissner 2014; Miles and Keenan 2002). Nowadays, regional foresight has become a common instrument of regional policy. Regional foresight is defined as “a systematic, participatory, future intelligence gathering and medium-to-long term vision building process aimed at present-day decisions and mobilizing joint actions” (Gavigan et al. 2001). This instrument is a widespread phenomenon in many developed countries and regions with well-formed innovation eco-system. In that case, regional foresight can be effective tool for strategic decision-making and budget allocation (Vishnevskiy et al. 2015b). However, it is important to note that regional foresight is not only a phenomenon for developed economies, but developing countries also use regional foresight for innovation policy forming. The role of foresight for developing regions can be even more crucial. It can help to create a well-functioning innovation ecosystem by organizing systemic foresight sessions aimed at establishing communication platform between different actors and elaboration of new forms of cooperation and support (Harmaakopi and Uotila 2006; Gertler and Wolfe 2004; Vishnevskiy et al. 2015a). But the literature review demonstrates research gaps in such a field as regional foresight implementation in developing economies and Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) countries. In fact, there are some articles which describe approaches to regional foresight implementation in BRICS countries, but these methodologies significantly differ from the common approaches to regional foresight and focus generally on forecasting and strategy planning (Shashnov 2007). The purpose of this article is to identify the basic features of approaches to regional foresight in BRICS countries and also to the development of a regional foresight methodology for its diffusion in developing countries. First, a literature review is presented and the main features of regional foresight are evaluated in accordance with such aspects as adopted integration strategy, the methodology, and level of compliance with the “Triple Helix.” The second part includes a description of the methodology of regional foresight in the Russian Federation in terms of case studies. Therefore, in accordance with the description of case studies, the main differences of the approaches are shown and some suggestions and hypotheses about the reasons for these differences are developed. For instance, such differences can be explained by a low-level development of innovation infrastructure, such as innovative clusters and technological platforms.",6
10.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,26 September 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-015-0310-3,"Public-Private Partnership Models for Science, Technology, and Innovation Cooperation",December 2019,Dirk Meissner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Increasingly internationalized R&D activities are challenging companies to pay more attention to the coordination and integration of related network style activities (Li and Yue 2005). In addition, companies are frequently considering the location-specific innovation potential when assessing locations for establishing industrial R&D facilities (von Zedtwitz and Gassmann 2002; Moncada-Paterno-Castello et al. 2011). Companies’ competitive advantages to a large extent are determined by the skills and know-how embedded in the corporate activities which encourages companies to affiliate their core R&D in close proximity to corporate headquarters (Carlsson 2006). Furthermore, outside technology sourcing has emerged an important element for company R&D (Shin-Horng 2004). Accordingly, companies are increasingly looking for incoming spillovers that are expected to be a measurable value adding result of science, technology, and innovation (STI)-related cooperation with public research institutions (van Beers et al. 2008). Cooperation partners also vary for companies, e.g., in principle companies cooperating with higher education institutes are more likely to address more fundamental research questions which also impose fewer intellectual property-related challenges than cooperation with more applied research institutions does (van Beers et al. 2008). Companies react with the adaptation of their innovation strategies and R&D activities: Instead of being isolated from access to R&D in companies, external R&D is an important contribution to value creation (Vishnevskiy et al. 2015). However, internal R&D is important in order both to absorb external inputs and on the other hand also actively contribute in a specialized area to new insights. This opening of innovation activities is additionally driven by technological changes and the development of new enabling technologies. While these provide new potential for innovation, they increase the complexity and require multidisciplinary competences and skills. Another important aspect is the multivariate use of knowledge and technologies (platform approaches to business). It is increasingly recognized that the success of strategic partnerships depends heavily on specialized actors that strive to add value to the benefit of both parties. In order to gain a focus on core competencies, the common behavior of complementary companies and new forms of cooperation between science and industry are important for achieving the further optimization of value creation and innovation. While in incremental innovations and innovations in non-technological areas (in-house) traditional research dominates, knowledge from external sources may still win out in importance, especially in high-risk, long-term-oriented research and radical innovations. The probability of a successful application and market innovation is significantly increased by the inclusion of scientific research. In addition, faster and more effective innovations will be implemented by target-oriented cooperation along the supply chain. It is estimated that more than half of the companies that rely on full cooperation in R&D and innovation have a better result than their competitors (IBM 2006). In recent years, an escalating demand for STI infrastructure has been observed on global scale (Mrinalini and Wakdikar 2008; Demirbag and Glaister 2010; Meissner 2014; Gokhberg and Meissner 2013) which is also due to the increasing complexity of technical activities and product development (Chiesa 2000). Moreover, the internationalization of R&D offers opportunities for countries to design an STI infrastructure which allows companies to take advantage of the respective national STI competences and capabilities and the related skills which eventually leads to the generation of positive spillovers for supporting the development of national economies (Baskaran and Muchie 2008). In addition, STI should help cope with social challenges, such as health and environmental problems (Muldur et al. 2006). The international diffusion of technology has established itself as an important factor for production (Muldur et al. 2006). The greater openness of economies and the accelerated development of technology increase the need for technology-related skills in countries and specific locations (Gackstatter et al. 2014; Proskuryakova et al. 2015). Expertise at the national level enables the innovation base of countries to optimally absorb global developments (UNCTAD 2005). Furthermore, innovation processes are characterized by increased market pressure through globalization, deregulation, and new social needs and changing behaviors for innovation. This creates the need to achieve a higher economic and social return on R&D investment to be temporarily competitive. Companies are also interested in shortening innovation cycles in order to extend the brief period of pioneering advantages. For this purpose, applied research provides an important contribution: It contributes to the development of new areas and enhances competitiveness by shortening the time from basic research to the actual use of the application mainly by intensified targeted STI collaboration. Public-private partnership (PPP) is becoming an increasingly important form of STI-targeted collaboration. During the last few decades, PPP style collaborations between public and private actors namely in the field of infrastructure and public services were established in many places as an alternative to privatization and state tasks (Advisory Council for Science, Technology and Innovation Ireland/Forfàs 2007). In recent years, additional programs and initiatives in R&D were launched in order to strengthen the cooperation of private and public actors (Audretsch et al. 2002a, b). It is increasingly assumed that application-oriented research collaboration effectively fill gaps in the innovation system, increases the efficiency of government policy and targets, and tackles new social challenges—especially if a long-term multidisciplinary approach is used. Accordingly, STI PPPs emerged (Adams and Jaffe 1996). Therefore, they can make an important contribution to the use of the innovation potential and competitiveness of a location or region (OECD 2005). These assumptions are based on the expectation that technical (technological) progress and innovation lead to economic growth rates, global competitiveness, and social well-being (Link 2006; UNCTAD 2005; Muldur et al. 2006). STI PPP is also considered to be one element of national technology strategies (Edler et al. 2002; Meissner et al. 2013). The STI PPP is a concept that captures the cooperation between the public and private sectors in various fields at regional, national, or international level and in different sectors such as urban planning, economic development, infrastructure development, R&D and knowledge and technology transfer (KTT), social policy, and environmental protection. Despite, or because of, the wide application of this concept in the field of intergovernmental tasks, fulfillment, and material privatization, there is no generally accepted definition of it. Therefore, STI PPP is defined primarily as a problem-solving approach that is characterized by a new culture of public-private cooperation (Bingisser et al. 2005). This STI PPP should be understood as a social construction, which can vary depending on the context, objectives, and stakeholders. Thus, the STI PPP that is present in industrialized countries for the time being, is there for dealing with competence and capacity problems of the public sector for the efficient provision of public infrastructure and the partnership’s performance of the established complex public tasks. In emerging and developing countries, STI PPP is also used, however, it is used with the aim to provide basic infrastructure. Among the companies’ motivations to engage in STI PPP is the ambition to increase tacit knowledge, which is considered especially important for technology system integration and the development of core R&D teams (Gassmann and von Zedtwitz 2003; Asakawa and Som 2008). In recent years, in particular, the industry-scientific, relationship-oriented STI PPP has emerged (Dearing 2007; Wissenschaftsrat 2007a, b). But even if one only considers STI PPPs that strive primarily for technological innovation, a shortened process for innovation and the R&D sector, there is neither a single nor a narrow definition. There is, for example, the following definition used in the context of research collaboration: “Public-private partnership is an institutionalized form of cooperation between public and private actors, in which both sides contribute resources to achieve complementary goals.” (Vogel and Stratmann 2000). Since the individual elements are not specified, a wide range of forms of cooperation can be captured in this definition. Accordingly, STI PPPs are infrastructure-based partnerships between public and private stakeholders with the objective of increasing knowledge and applications in the medium- to long-term prospect, in binding agreements and institutional arrangements that take into account the primary interests of each party, which can perceive risks and opportunities jointly and share and serve the common good in the long term. Against this background, STI PPP research cooperation is therefore defined as infrastructure-based partnerships between public and private players aimed at increasing and applying knowledge in the mid to long term in contractually agreed upon institutional setups which take into account the original interests of each party, determine and share risks and opportunities, and serve the long-term common benefit. Furthermore, the understanding of STI PPP can be extended to also include technology development funds which provide funds for universities and research institutions to support companies with technological capabilities, to leverage the innovative capacity of each region and in the establishment of technological clusters, the innovation of public goods and services to allow for and provide technological developments for the public sector and for social needs. Irrespective of context, long-term STI PPP research cooperation which is based on confidence building and the optimized coordination of cooperation is best suited to the sustained improvement and strengthening of a national innovation system. National science and research systems cannot stand in the way of globalization. This considerably increases the competition between the individual national science, research, and innovation sites at a global level. In such an innovation context, which is marked by feedback mechanisms and increased competitive pressure, resource-oriented, long-term and legally established forms of cooperation present a possible efficient and effective response to global challenges. It has been demonstrated in various studies and according to generally accepted expert opinions that such networks can have a supportive effect but that the main innovations come from direct interaction on a personal level. A high level of commitment associated with a long-term focus as well as the establishment of national and international networks are important in doing this. In addition, a sustainable skills base, promotion of interdisciplinary research, and synergy effects are expected by means of the institutional components, which will accelerate the innovation process. Although the effect of sustainable STI PPPs is often difficult to evaluate and most sustainable STI PPPs have only been set up recently, positive effects can be seen which encourage further intensive initiatives in this direction. A central component in this is the strengthening of KTT, which is often promoted via various KTT offices but would nevertheless be given further impetus, especially as STI PPP research cooperation has a direct influence on KTT and uses sustainable synergies. As sustainable STI PPPs are also targeting the strengthening of applied research and networking, they would be suited to taking direct action on frequently identified shortcomings in national innovation systems. At the same time, it should be ensured that the promotion of basic research will continue and existing (private) initiatives will not be eliminated. Given this background, the paper focuses on the following research questions: How do STI PPPs fit in the overall STI policy mix? How can different STI PPPs be characterized? Which impact can be achieved by STI PPPs? The paper develops a general taxonomy of STI-related cooperation in Taxonomy of STI Cooperation section followed by a dedicated taxonomy of STI PPPs for STI in Taxonomy of STI PPPs section. Conclusions section concludes the paper with a summary and discussion of the different taxonomies and their potential and limitations. The paper is the further development of an earlier work by Meissner D “Forschungskooperationen mittels Public Private Partnership—Argumente und Beispiele. Center for Science and Technology Studies, Bern 2007.” It advances the empirical work done earlier and further develops the taxonomy of STI PPP. The conceptual work was accompanied by in-depth analysis of 20 STI PPPs in nine countries which could be identified and classified as STI PPPs. A qualitative approach was chosen for analysis using a structured interview guide of the STI PPPs. European STI PPPs were interviewed personally at the site of the institution; institutions in Australia, Japan, and New Zealand were interviewed by phone. Following the interviews, institution case studies were developed and approved by the interviewees. Interview partners were the leadership of the institutions and also scientists employed in the institutions. The number of interviews per institution varied between three and eight interviews. The institutions cover biomedicine, communication technologies, digital enterprise research, greenhouse gas technologies, health technologies, metals research telematics, microelectronics, nanoelectronic technologies, optics, polymer research, semiconductor technologies, software technologies, telecommunications, and tribology. For reasons of confidentiality of information, the interviewees and the institutions names cannot be disclosed. The so developed case studies form the basis for developing the taxonomy and deriving main features of STI PPPs. As linkages between government, scientific, and economic actors are increasingly seen as an important basis for the performance and innovation of an economy, the various forms of interaction are elaborated upon in order to examine their advantages and disadvantages and their suitability as innovation policy instruments. OECD (2005) differeniates STI PPP into four types according to the different policy objectives, which are not necessarily mutually exclusive: Mission-oriented STI PPPs, which ensure the financing of early technology development. Market-based STI PPPs, aimed at scientific institutes that help companies build technological competencies. Industrial-scientific, relationship-oriented STI PPPs that promote technological developments, products, and services for the public sector and social benefits. Cluster/network-oriented STI PPPs, to increase the innovative capacity of individual regions and to develop geographical clusters technologically. Previously identified forms of political cooperation and the further promotion of entrepreneurial or scientifically initiated forms of cooperation are arranged along three dimensions (Vogel and Stratmann 2000; Becker 2004): Formality: There is a distinction made according to the depth of cooperation. This cooperation may be configured informally or be contract-based or extend to legal entities. Form of interaction: The parties may exchange information on research results on a relatively non-binding basis, in collusion, and carry out joint research projects or pool resources. Time horizon: Cooperation can be ad hoc (i.e., current), medium, or long term. Furthermore, a distinction can be made between three types of STI PPP according to their time horizon: Ad hoc STI PPP with a short- to mid-term focus; Test STI PPP with a pooling of resources and mid-term or project-related focus; Sustainable STI PPP marked by long-term cooperation with an institutional basis. In all three dimensions, one moves from non-binding to binding forms that require greater commitment and responsibility. In particular, the depth of cooperation and the time horizon often interact with each other, which means that, for example, closer cooperation implicitly can bring a long-term cooperation by itself. These three dimensions capture key elements of research collaboration because they illuminate the virtual or the institutional character, the exchanges, and the time horizon. The corresponding expression on these three dimensions is usually deliberately chosen in accordance with the objectives and then determine to a considerable extent the design and operation of research cooperation. If a company is interested, for example, primarily in scientific knowledge, informal networks are sufficient. But if a company wants long-term cooperation with a scientific partner, matching the goals and sharing resources and risks are then to the independent research institution’s advantage. With the variety of prevailing forms of interaction, it has to be considered that current contacts or conventional relationships are often classified in terms of client and contractor. They are distinguished in this understanding by a unilateral transfer or by a customer-supplier relationship that is too narrow to be considered an interactive conception of cooperation. The various features of cooperation demonstrate remarkable differences especially with respect to the formalization and time horizon of interaction. Hence, three types of cooperation emerge which are Information-oriented Action-oriented Resource-oriented cooperation.",29

One thing we can predict with relative certainty, in terms of the prospects of future economic development, is the increasing pace and scale of future changes. It is exactly the unprecedented level of economic dynamics and turbulence that brings to the fore of competition such a powerful weapon as business model innovation (BMI). Even in the recent past, a large corporation, having entrenched in a particular industry segment, could certainly count on many years of stable market position based on successive improvements of virtually the same mode of interaction with its customers. Today, such an approach often does not work. Currently, in almost every industry, irrespective of its maturity and size, it is highly likely that you will encounter competitive innovations which radically change the “rules of the game” in the market through the introduction of new business models (BMs). In this area, unlike innovative products and production methods (technologies), the research intensity factor is often not a key to success. In business innovations, it is not scientific breakthrough that frequently plays a decisive role, but rather an entrepreneurial idea, a discovery of new market needs and the “tailored” combination of ways to meet them with effective demand based on unconventional forms and methods of creating and delivering user value to target customer audience. In today’s environment, when the life cycle of even very successful business models is drastically shortened, BMI is becoming all the more important “modus operandi” for most of the players in global competition, especially if they are desperate to capture new markets or to build a strategic defense against rivals. Indeed, many of the fastest recent corporate rises are linked to innovative business models, including successes of such legendary giants as Apple, Amazon, Cisco, FedEx, Zara, Southwest Airlines, Virgin, and many more. Corporations that have become leaders in BMI are now coming out as global leaders in their industries. Conversely, even the largest companies in their markets, with a long history and outstanding reputation, very quickly and infamously disappear into oblivion, if they are late to replace their outdated business models by the new ones, lagging too far behind the successful BMI champions. This work aims to make three contributions. First, by relying on strategy-focused and innovation management-focused BMI studies, and linking the two approaches, this paper develops the “dynamic concept” of business models’ strategy dimension by bringing the two perspectives together. Second, the work examines how BMI can become a source of sustainable competitive advantage though all the main components of successful business models seem very visible and easy to copy. Third, by unpacking key elements of a business model, the paper discloses what BMI does really mean in terms of concrete changes and how these changes affect a competitive position of the firm. The first section of the paper discusses the state of art of literature, and the second section analyzes how sustainable competitive advantage is achieved through BMI. Consequently, the third section examines the changing business model elements, and the fourth section analyzes BMI impact on industry revolutions. The paper finishes with a concluding section. Throughout the paper, the conceptual considerations are accompanied by respective company cases.",18

Kostopoulos,Yiannis Spanos,Nicholas S. Vonortas,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"It is generally agreed that collaborative research and development (R&D) programs play an important role in developing a knowledge base, while at the same time contribute toward creating significant added value. Despite that, however, the achievements of the European Framework Programs admittedly have been more modest in terms of direct contribution to innovations. This is related to the so-called European Paradox, a term connoting a strong research performance but comparatively weak innovation and economic performance (e.g., Dosi, et al. 2006). Therefore, even though R&D is a core activity and a starting point (albeit not the only one) for innovation, the link between the two is not straightforward. The commercial exploitation of research results stemming from an R&D project is a complex process governed by a multitude of factors, including the internal dynamics of the project per se, as well as the motives and the innovation-related capabilities of the participants in the project, and the characteristics of the market environment toward which the prospective innovation is to be directed. In this paper, we report (selectively) results from a major European study that explored those complex links by examining the factors underlying the success of collaborative research and development (R&D) projects (Fisher et al. 2009). Data were drawn from a large sample of projects under the 5th and 6th European Framework Programs for Research and Development.Footnote 1 Specifically, based on the extant literature (e.g., Doz 1996; Hoegl et al. 2004), this study sought to identify determinants of the innovation impacts of publicly funded R&D projects along three broad directions, namely market-, firm-, and project-related factors. The basic proposition we wish to explore is that: (a) the ways a project is managed; (b) the resources, experience and capabilities of partners; and (c) market conditions significantly affect the innovation impacts of publicly funded collaborative R&D projects. To explore and test this basic proposition, we mainly utilized quantitative data (questionnaire survey responses) collected on collaborative R&D behavior and outcomes via a massive data collection effort in a pan-European scale for the purposes of the “Innovation Impact” project. In particular, the quantitative field survey consisted of two separate questionnaires, one for industrial firms and one for research organizations (i.e., universities, research institutes, etc.) that were known (through the CORDIS database) to have been involved in the European Framework Programs FP5 and FP6 R&D projects. Quantitative evidence was further supported by a qualitative analysis from a series of 70 in-depth case studies across sectors, EU countries, and types and sizes of organizations. The qualitative data is systematically used to explain the quantitative findings from explicit examples and opinions collected face-to-face from project participants. The cases were selected following the criterion sampling strategy (Eisenhardt and Graebner 2007) to reflect examples particularly illustrative for the emerging quantitative findings, thus enabling to shed further light on the latter. The case organizations were observed in depth, following well-accepted approaches to designing case studies (Yin 2008). Data was collected by multiple-respondent interviews, following a pre-defined interview protocol and documentary analysis spanning a period of 6 months. Extension and replication of the emerging findings were pursued until theoretical saturation was obtained (Charmaz 2003). Subject to stand alone reporting in the project, the results of the qualitative research will enrich the discussion and conclusions of the work at hand. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section presents the basic concepts utilized and the research model of the study. An overview of the determining conditions of R&D project success together with the basic theoretical arguments is provided in the third section, followed by the presentation of the results of the quantitative analysis. The last section presents a summary and conclusions.",5

These new challenges and opportunities would not have been as prominent on the agendas of senior administrators a decade or two ago as they are today were it not for a whirlwind of technological advances. Globalization is driven largely by information communication technologies, which have produced rapid changes to societies through the easy movement of money, financial instruments, culture, ideas, and people (Rizvi and Lingard 2009). Economic crises that were once localized to a single nation-state or region of the world now often rapidly spread across the globe through the interconnected nature of financial markets. Technologies like the Internet and social media have made it possible for individuals, families, and strangers alike to connect with one another instantaneously from thousands of miles away, helped to topple dictators, and allowed for the transfer of culture across national borders at speeds that were impossible only few decades ago. Technological changes in transportation have made it faster and cheaper for individuals to move across geographic locations in search of better employment opportunities, or to escape repressive regimes in their home country. At the same time, greater mobility and migration have not come without difficulties caused by new demographic configurations within regions of the world (Streitwieser et al. 2017). If immigrants are viewed as an unwanted or feared “other,” or if locals feel threatened by competition for jobs in the receiving country social unrest may ensue. The ease of movement of people can also have dramatic effects on the cultures of the receiving country, which inevitably cause social tensions as citizens in the host country feel uneasy about their society changing or they sense that they are forfeiting their national identity. Globalization and migration have also brought the concept of brain drain to the public’s attention, with the intellectual brain power of a country leaving in search of a better way of life often draining the economy of its best resources. Developing and developed countries are thus often particularly focused on reversing the effects of this talent loss by encouraging their expatriates to return home to help improve their economic conditions (Wildavsky 2012). To keep its citizens from leaving, countries like South Korea are spending hundreds of millions of dollars on education hubs such as the Incheon Global Campus to stem the flow of students out of its country (Incheon Global Campus Vision Statement 2017). Governments that have established education hubs are using these higher education nerve centers as a way to bring in foreign expertise into their country in an effort to stem brain drain. Globalization is also changing the world we live in at a pace that humans have not experienced before. Higher education institutions (HEIs) play a unique and vital role in the knowledge economy through educating and preparing students to work in the economy and developing innovations that advance knowledge. These rapid developments in technology and the knowledge economy are changes universities and colleges around the world must address proactively if they are to reap potential benefits. If HEIs are not proactive in their planning, these changes will be foisted upon them, and they will have to react to their new operating environment rather than being able to shape it. HEIs that proactively address this new operating environment will find opportunities that can be beneficial to their mission and their long-term financial well-being. On the other hand, institutions that are reactive will find their environment challenging to navigate. Colleges and universities that actively participate in the global knowledge economy will face new risks they need to understand before committing institutional resources to their international projects and aspirations. This paper explores how higher education institutions can utilize a framework for assessing the risks associated with international expansion. To do so, it borrows numerous risk assessment frameworks from other disciplines and adapts them to the context of opening international branch campuses (IBCs) in order to show how utilizing models from experiences in other fields can also be beneficial for HEIs. To explicate our argument and as our benchmark for assessing risks, we will analyze the riskiest of all form of internationalization (Girdzijauskaite and Radzeviciene 2014; Mazzarol et al. 2003; McBurnie and Ziguras 2007), which is the decision-making process underlying the establishment of an international branch campus.",11

Nikolaou,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Recently a significant debate regarding the relationship between corporate social and environmental responsibility (CSER) and financial performance has taken place (Nikolaou and Evangelinos 2008). In order to clarify the basic findings of the current literature, it is divided into two areas of research: (a) theoretical frameworks and (b) empirical results. At a theoretical level, many scholars have proposed conceptual frameworks to describe a potential positive relationship between CSER and corporate financial performance (Stanwick and Stanwick 1998; Lopez et al. 2007; Lopez-Gamero et al. 2009). However, some weaknesses exist for such frameworks mainly because they use various terms for CSER, such as corporate social responsibility, corporate citizenship, corporate sustainability, corporate responsibility, environmental business, business ethics and triple bottom line (Carroll 1999; van Marrewijk 2003; Carriga and Mele 2004). The divergences of these terms are explained by either a single-dimension (e.g. only the environment) or a multiple-dimensional approach on various sustainability issues (Dahlsrud 2008). Other significant weaknesses of the current theoretical frameworks are their inability express of stakeholders’ expectations and CSER activities (O’Riordan and Fairbrass 2008) as well as the lack of an outline of the mediating role of intangible assets and intellectual capital (IC) (Gardberg and Fombrun 2006). At an empirical level, the findings of current studies are inconclusive since they range from negative to positive (Aupperle et al. 1985; Freedman and Jaggi 1982; Waddock and Graves 1997; Preston and O’Bannon 1997; Roman et al. 1999). This vagueness seems to be associated with the lack of suitable measurement indicators (e.g. using traditional financial indicators—return on investment (ROI)and return on asset (ROA)—which only prove the overall corporate financial performance and does not deal with the consequences of CSER on financial performance separately the (absence of measuring intangible assets and uncertain causality of CSER and financial performance (e.g. CSER affects financial performance or the opposite) (Surroca et al. 2010). To overcome the weaknesses of the theoretical and empirical literature, some approaches have been proposed to link CSER’s variables with competitive advantage and firms’ performance, for instance, the resource-based view (RBV) of a firm (Branco and Rodrigues 2006), intellectual capital (Chen 2008a; Surroca et al. 2010) and the knowledge-based view (KBV) of a firm (Siltaoja 2014). A well-known modified version of RVB for corporate environmental management has been introduced by Hart (1995) who indicates that environmental investments (e.g. pollution prevention, product stewardship and sustainable development) of firms assists in building a competitive advantage (tacit and explicit knowledge) and gains social legitimacy (e.g. transparency, stakeholder management and collaboration). Particularly, the resource-based thinking highlights the capability of firms to constitute tangible (e.g. physical and financial) and intangible resources (e.g. reputation, employees’ knowledge, IC). Corporate resources play a key role in building sustainable competitive advantage essentially by reason of (its) their internal capabilities, which are inimitable by competitors (Barney 1999) as a result of outstanding features of firms such as being path dependent, causally ambitious and socially complex (Colbert 2004). Other scholars focus on green and social IC and KBV which is still in its infancy (Chen 2008a; Surroca et al. 2010; Siltaoja 2014). A limited number of studies have been carried out to shed light on different theoretical constructs through questionnaire-based research and accounting scoring and benchmarking techniques (Chen 2008a; Chang and Chen 2012; Polo and Vázquez 2008). The existing literature offers helpful insights mainly for green IC without a concrete and robust theoretical background. The majority of current academic works provide methodologies to record certain relationships between CSER and intellectual capital; nevertheless, a theoretical approach to describe such relationships is lacking. In other words, the gap in the research suggests that organizational knowledge creation derived from CSEER project implication is evaluated without a concrete theoretical background. This paper suggests an overall theoretical framework to outline the prospective relationships between CSER and corporate financial performance by mediating the role of the social and environmental intellectual capital (S-EIC), innovation and competitive advantage. This analysis is made through KBV and the intellectual-based approaches which offer suitable conditions to revisit the roots of CSER and indicate the critical role of firms in the modern market environment. The proposed framework suggests four key interlinked components CSER, IC, innovation and sustainable competitive advantage. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section outlines the review objectives. In the “Conceptual Framework—Proposition Development” section, the framework model and propositions have been developed. Management implications have been developed in the “Implications for Corporate Social and Environmental Responsibility Management” section. The results and conclusion of the proposed framework model is presented in the “Conclusion” section.",29

Woods,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Knowledge acquisition is essential if business firms desire to improve the efficiency of resource (input) usage and the productivity of their production processes. Repeated use of production techniques based upon existing knowledge will eventually lead to no additional improvement in productivity and output. This occurs once the learning curve has been fully exploited (Cortright 2001). Without updated production knowledge, firms will experience diminishing returns to the stock of their knowledge capital. Alternatively, when a firm creates new production knowledge, that knowledge has the potential of not only improving the firm’s productivity, but can create a natural externality resulting in positive productivity and output effects of other firms in the same industry. This is because newly created knowledge cannot be perfectly patented or kept secret (Romer 1986; Greenhalgh and Rodgers 2010; Berger 2013). This result suggests there is increasing returns to knowledge capital at the industry level when one accounts for knowledge spillovers from individual firms. This paper contributes to the literature by integrating two strands of research. Specifically, I integrate a learning model with two production models emphasizing the role of tacit knowledge capital (KC) in productivity and output growth at the firm level and the spillover effects of firm generated tacit KC at the industry level. First, I provide an overview of the firm-level Cobb-Douglas (CD) production function that serves as the basis for the development of the Solow growth model. Secondly, I discuss the nature of KC and why individual firms may experience diminishing returns to their existing stock of knowledge. Thirdly, I develop a model of dialectical learning (DL). Fourthly, I link Solow’s firm-level production function with Romer’s industry-level growth model. These models are specified with endogenous technical change incorporating tacit KC and DL. Dialectical learning is a learning method that attempts to update a firm’s tacit KC for the purpose of creating technical progress. This technical progress is required if firms’ desire to increase their productivity and output levels. Eventually, this updated firm-level tacit KC spills over to the industry-level production function leading to increasing returns to knowledge creation. By developing a conceptual framework attempting to address the above-mentioned relationships, I show how the design and implementation of an innovative learning activity creates the new knowledge needed to foster technical progress. This progress is associated with greater productivity and output levels of the firm and industry. Greater industrial growth results from increasing returns to tacit KC when one accounts for the positive externalities associated with the spillover of knowledge from individual firms. The “Linking the Cobb-Douglas Production Function to the Solow Growth Model” section transforms the firm-level Cobb-Douglas production function into the Solow growth model. The “The Nature of Knowledge Capital” section examines the characteristics of both codified and tacit KC. A model of how the DL process creates updated tacit KC is developed in the “Using the Dialectical Learning Process to Increase the Tacit Knowledge of the Firm” section. The “Incorporating Dialectical Learning and Tacit Knowledge Capital into the Solow and Romer Production Models” section links Solow’s firm-level production function with Romer’s industry-level growth model. These models are specified with endogenous technical change incorporating tacit KC and DL. The “Pathways to Increasing Returns to Tacit Knowledge Capital” section discusses some pathways of technical progress. These technological pathways from the firm to industry result in increasing returns to tacit KC. Some limitations of this research and concluding remarks are offered in the “Limitations and Conclusion” section.",4

Leal-Rodríguez,Stephen Eldridge,Emilio J. Morales-Fernández,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Within a knowledge-based economy, firms use knowledge as a strategic input resource in the creation of knowledge-intensive products and services (Seddighi 2015). In this environment, organizations must be prepared to adapt to the high levels of turbulence and uncertainty that can be experienced. Faced with these challenges, knowledge can easily become obsolete and firms have to face this complexity by constantly renewing their knowledge bases. Organizational learning has an important role in that renewal (Sanz-Valle et al. 2011). At the same time, innovation capability enables organizations to become more proficient in both exploiting opportunities and seeking new challenges (Matzler et al. 2013). Innovation allows firms to be more flexible in their structures, and as a consequence, innovative firms find it easier to adapt to a rapidly changing business environment. This adaptation enables firms to handle and leverage opportunities better than their competitors (Damanpour and Gopalakrishnan 2001) and is a source of sustainable competitive advantage. According to Senge (1990), fostering organizational learning mechanisms—the capacity to learn faster than competitors—is perhaps the only way of paving the way for innovation in firms and, hence, achieving this sustainable competitive advantage. Furthermore, Akgün et al. (2002) observe that organizational unlearning by itself is insufficient for the development and fostering of organizational knowledge and insight. They argue that, in order to be able to renew their knowledge bases, firms ought also to design, encourage, and support a process of organizational unlearning. Research with the aim of discovering the main drivers of learning processes and innovation at the firm level has been extensive. Several empirical studies have considered organizational culture as one of the main drivers of knowledge management, organizational learning mechanisms, and firm innovativeness and have addressed these relationships (De Long and Fahey 2000; Sanz-Valle et al. 2011). However, relatively little attention has been paid to the links between organizational culture, organizational unlearning, and innovation capability. There is, especially, little empirical evidence as to what extent organizational culture relates to unlearning and innovation. Therefore, the purpose and main contribution of our study is to explore the links among the different organizational culture typologies with organizational unlearning and innovation using the Competing Values Framework proposed by Cameron and Quinn (1999). Our paper first presents the theoretical background and the development of our research model and hypotheses. Then, the research method that we adopted to test our hypotheses is described. This is followed by a presentation of our data analysis and our findings. We then discuss the contribution of our findings, and the implications and limitations of our research are highlighted along with suggested directions for future research in this area.",8

However, there are two important aspects needed to be examined in employees’ behavior enhancement, such as the internal-external aspects of employees (people) and technology/work methods (Kreitner and Kinichi 2007). The internal-external aspects covers; the leader-member exchange, department, organizational commitment, job satisfaction, and organizational culture (Kreitner and Kinichi 2007; Peterson and Baker 2015). The aspect of work method includes technology, work process, work flow, and job design (Kreitner and Kinichi 2007; Parker et al. 2017). The employees’ strategic role behavior can be analyzed and transferred to other employees as a basis for realizing competitive advantage. Schuler and Jackson (1987) and Schuller (1992) emphasize that strategic behavior indicates that an organization is very possible to have long-term competitive advantage. Furthermore, Griffin et al. (2018) state that to achieve competitive advantages organization need to develop “organizational readiness,” a construct that describes the anticipatory expectations about organizational life that children develop as they absorb the cultural influences to which they are expected. Research about individual readiness to change in workplace had been done and got results in various. According to Peterson and Baker (2015), individual readiness to change refers to the individual’s internal and external resources that support behavior change. Individual readiness to change is a critical success factor because organizations only change and act through their members, and even the most collective activities that take place in organizations are the result of some amalgamation of the activities of individual organizational members (Vakola 2014). Organizational readiness to change is largely a function of the readiness to change of individual staff members. When staff members are willing and able to take responsibility for making changes, like likelihood of successful organizational change, is much greater. However, it is not necessary for all staff members to be ready to change in order to begin taking steps toward change. For organizational change to succeed, leader must work under the assumption development experiences that match his/her individual stage of change (Griffin et al. 2018; Li et al. 2016; Peterson and Baker 2015). According to Li et al. (2017), participative leadership which is similar to empowering leadership, plays role as an effective way for leaders to gain followers’ trust. Empowering leadership defined as the situation in which a leader distributes power, autonomy, motivation, and other job privileges unequally among followers. Furthermore, empowering leadership is suspected will support the individual readiness to change, but some previous researches showed different result. For example, some researchers state that empowering leadership will support individual readiness to change (Holten and Brenner 2015; Lee et al. 2017; Li et al. 2016, 2017). However, Griffin et al. (2018), Parker et al. (2017), and Vakola (2014) conclude that empowering leadership is not enough to increase the individual readiness to change. Mechanism is needed to be a prime driver to change individual readiness. It is formed by outcome or implementation consequences of empowering leadership. According to Al-Hussami et al. (2017), Griffin et al. (2018), and Li et al. (2016) conclude that empowering leadership will make employee feel free to determine the way to work and choose which technology are needed to do the work well. Research about public sector leadership by Fernandez et al. (2010) shows that leader takes role as agent of change for organizational members as sub-agencies which has positive impact on organizational performance. This research is conducted to enrich literature reviews on the needs of increasing individual readiness to change, especially for bureaucratic organization which tends to bond to governmental legislations. The variable proposed to be analyzed in this research is quality of work and quality of people. We argued that quality of work and quality of people are significant outcomes of empowering leadership. Empowering leadership is considered to be able to improve the relationship pattern between leaders and members to foster empowerment toward creativity and innovation (Zhang and Bartol 2010). Quality of people and quality of work methods will have an impact toward readiness to change which then enhance strategic behavior. Hence, this paper aims to contribute related theories by the importance of empowering leadership in increasing individual readiness to change through the dimension of people (leader and member exchange, employee engagement, and intrinsic motivation to innovate) and the dimension of methods (technology, job design, and innovation culture) which will then enhance strategic behavior. The rest of this paper is outlined as literature review and hypothesis, methods, result, discussion, and also conclusion and suggestion for future research.",12

While the influence of some of these factors has been researched, not all appropriate models and contexts have received attention, or at least equal attention, and there is also lack of interdisciplinary research in which the influence of soft factors in combination has been studied (e.g., Rungi 2019). For example, while performance in general has been widely researched (Richard et al. 2009), innovation- and learning-oriented absorptive capacity (ACAP) has received little attention (Stulova and Rungi 2017), especially regarding how it is influenced by individual-level traits and group-level organizational culture (McCrae 1991; Gupta and Govindrajan 2000; Matzler et al. 2008; Yoo 2013). Further, not all organizational-culture models have been studied to the same extent. For example, Goffee and Jones’s (1998) organizational-culture model is one of the least researched in a learning setting, despite its inherent suitability (Ngoc 2005; Yoo 2013). While traits and organizational culture have been widely researched separately, it is still not known which has the greatest impact. Most research has taken place in an industrial setting; however, these results are not necessarily generalizable to the field of medicine, a field that has, regrettably received little attention (Salge and Vera 2009). This has led to the following research question (RQ): In the field of medicine, do individual or group-level factors influence ACAP and, if so, to what extent? This research uses a quantitative survey of 25 innovation-oriented employees of one hospital in Estonia, a country characterized as being very innovative (World Economic Forum, 2017).",

Ierapetritis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Cooperative organizations were undoubtedly the most typical social manifestations of the Greeks under Ottoman occupation. They were based on the Byzantine guilds’ laws and provisionsFootnote 1 and continued to strictly preserve their traditions throughout the Ottoman sovereignty period (Enault, 1855: 408). All workers were strictly classified according to their professions and were firmly organised in order to preserve their social and national cohesion. The Ottoman sovereignty has led the Greek professionals and tradesmen to create tighter bonds, economic, social and political autonomies through which they sought, along with defending their professional interests, to serve the social sector according to the paradigm of the Byzantine societies.Footnote 2 The guilds during the Ottoman period were named either according to the Arab–Persian and Turkish names, i.e. isnaf or esnaf or ensaf and the Arab rufet or rufit or, less commonly, according to their Byzantine names syntechnía (guild), sýstima (system), somateíon (association), sóma (body), táxis (rank), tágma (order) (Chatzimichalis, 1983: 125) or their Latin and Greek names kompaníes (companies) and ospítia (houses) (Kordatos, 1955: 30–32). Members of these professional guilds were usually the representatives of the Community, the most fundamental institution of self-government, making these two institutions—the Orthodox Church being the second—the most important, operating since the first years of the Ottoman sovereignty. The obligatory participation of the guilds in community administration appeared, according to G. Kavvadias, first in 1614 in Serres where the General Assembly granted to the guilds the right to participate and be represented in it: “By unanimous decision, the people of Serres have selected and elected these ten people … and chose one person from each rufet …” (Kavvadias, 1996: 289). Almost 200 years later, the participation of the guilds in the community administration peaked in the system of the “Community of Melnik”, but in other communities as well, mainly through in Macedonia (Thessaloniki, Veroia, Naousa, Kozani, Siatista, Kastoria, Moscopole, Korytsa, Monastery, Kruševo, etc.). N. Pantazopoulos, trying to figure out what caused this phenomenon, states that: “As taxes were mostly paid by the guilds the communal lords came from or were suggested by them” (Pantazopoulos, 1958: 18).Footnote 3 The organization and operation of the guilds, both in the parts of Greece under Ottoman sovereignty and in the parts under Venetian sovereignty, were mainly found in towns that, in most cases, were administrative, commercial and industrial centres at that time. The state support that the institution of guilds enjoyed during the sixteenth century, contributed crucially to its uprising trend, which continued throughout the seventeenth century and peaked in the eighteenth century. In this period, the guilds reached their complete form, being both financially self-sufficient and independent in their operation. The first symptoms of decay for the institution appeared in the beginning of the nineteenth century, when the exclusivity of the professions–activities that they exercised was ceased. The abolition of this protective treaty, combined with the restructuring in production and the socio-economic reforms that were the result of the industrial revolution in the European markets, swiftly led to a chronic period of crisis in the institution and its gradual disappearance. The guilds did not manage to deal with competition, which was rising due to the development of the steamship communication (Salamanka, 1959: 28) and the more economical and higher quality European products both in the local markets and abroad (Papageorgiou, 1986). The present paper aims first, to bring to light the Greek guild, its internal organization and its geographical impacts and, second, to investigate the phenomenon of the cooperative community networks. In particular, this work will focus on the factors that favoured the development of the community networks, on the system of administration and organization of production, on the distribution system of the produced goods and on its geographical impact through the various forms it received. Following the presentation of the theoretical approaches of cooperative organizations is the research methodology, via presentation of four case studies, where the socio-economic, political and historic environments are taken into account; a geographical analysis of the institution is attempted and four studies of cooperative community forms that thrived within the Greek territory are discussed. The article ends with quotations of relevant conclusions.",2

Soares Echeveste,Aline C. Gularte,Unknown,Female,Female,Female,"Discussions on new management paradigms in innovation, cooperation, collaborative processes, as well as in the creation and transfer of knowledge, have been increasing steadily in academia, government, and business (Kramer et al. 2011; Lundberg and Andresen 2012; Robin and Schubert 2013). In order to boost development through innovation, technology, cooperation, and partnerships between regional actors, governments have been making continuous efforts to strengthen Regional Innovation Systems (RISs) and support activities and public policies related to innovation (Lundberg and Andresen 2012; Garcia and Chavez 2014). RISs have a regional knowledge infrastructure formed by various public and private organizations that focus on promoting innovation (Zhao et al. 2015). The dynamics of regional innovation is influenced by the actors’ ability to produce and transfer scientific knowledge and share skills and abilities through cooperation (Trippl 2008). In other words, the RIS is an innovation ecosystem that rallies public and private actors, including regional governments, who act as catalysts and supporters of innovation and help increase the competitiveness and productivity of a given region (Chung 2002; Cooke 2004). One of the RIS’s aims is to foster common standards for cooperation, sharing of values, promoting partnerships between government institutions, research companies, technology transfer organizations, training agencies, and private investors (Gerstlberger 2004; Andersson 2013; Garcia and Chavez 2014). In this context of collaboration, open innovation (OI) stands out as a strategy to reduce the risk, cost, and time entailed by innovation development, and improve the company’s capacity for innovation by leveraging ideas and resources. Moreover, OI fosters the commercialization or availability of technologies and innovations that are not fully exploited by companies and can be better exploited by business partners (Chesbrough 2004; Herskovits et al. 2013; Johannsson et al. 2015). It is worth noting that, due to the current level of maturity of OI research, theory on the implementation of this strategy is still limited and fragmented (Wikhamn and Wikhamn 2013). There are many gaps and emerging themes to be explored (Huizingh 2011; Kovács et al. 2015), such as OI implementation in RISs. In previous studies about RIS, Belussi et al. (2010) investigated the existence and the performance of an OI model in an RIS; Tödtling et al. (2011) study mechanisms and ways of reconciling OI and the relationship with regional cultures; Wang et al. (2012) analyze the impact of OI practices in the innovation system; Garcia and Chavez (2014) evaluate the strategic role and relationship between institutions as a critical process to generate knowledge and innovation; Lau and Lo (2015) focus on RIS influence upon the company’s innovation performance; and Lisowska and Stanislawski (2015) discuss SME cooperation with other institutions in the OI context. Few are the studies on OI related to methods, models, platforms, systems, and structures that meet the main elements or CSF for OI, and that include metrics capable of quantifying the efficiency and efficacy of actions in the implementation process, thus offering support and guidance to managers (Lee et al. 2010; Grönlund et al. 2010; Herskovits et al. 2013; Kathan et al. 2014; Çubukcu and Gümüs 2015; Santoro et al. 2019). In light of the research gaps presented, this article seeks to contribute to OI literature by proposing indicators that make it possible to assess the CSF that influence the implementation of this strategy in RIS companies. Therefore, since RISs are settings that enable the implementation of OI practices (Oliveira et al. 2017), the question we sought to answer was which CSF are needed to implement OI according to the companies of the RIS? The overall aim is to assess the CSF for OI implementation in RIS companies. In this article, factor analysis was used to group the CSF found in the literature into five main factors. These factors were converted into indicators to assess the CSF and verify RIS companies’ stance on OI implementation. Furthermore, cluster analysis was used to group the companies by similarity and generate three different clusters in relation to the CSF. The indicators created in this paper allowed us to identify which CSF the companies should target to improve innovation performance based on RISs’ collaborative strategies. The article is structured in five sections, including this introduction. The second section consists of a literature review. The third section details the methodological procedures of research. The fourth section presents an analysis and discussion of the results, and the fifth section presents final considerations.",12

Zhang,Brian M. Lucey,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"From a historical perspective, the labour force has always been somewhat mobile, with workers crossing regions, and nations, to find employment. Miller (2008), examining the transatlantic migration of the Irish, claimed that around seven million men and women left Ireland and crossed the Atlantic to the USA between 1600 and 1929. The deepening of globalisation in recent decades has further increased the mobility of labour. Since the late 1960s, there has been an acceleration of pace in the migration of labour force from developing to developed countries, represented by the USA and western European countries. Between 1990 and 2000, the number of emigrants from all developing countries increased by 93%, especially from Africa (up 113%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (up 97%) (Docquier et al. 2007). More recently, emerging economies such as China and India have taken the lead when it comes to sending immigrants to developed countries. According to the Census Bureau in the USA, China was the country of origin for 147,000 recent US immigrants in 2013, higher than the number from Mexico (125,000). Figures released by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in the UK also showed that China provided the most immigrants coming to live and work in the country in 2013. Measured by their educational level, migrants are usually categorised into three groups: low-skilled workers (those with no more than a primary education), medium-skilled workers (those with a secondary education), and high-skilled workers (those with at least a post-secondary education). The last group has been the focus of a bulk of studies which examine the impact of migration on the sending and receiving countries. Docquier and Marfouk (2006) defined skilled workers as working age individuals (aged 25 and over) with at least tertiary education, born in a given country but living elsewhere. The reason why the literature focuses on the mobility of skilled workers, which is also the focus of this paper, is mainly attributed to the increasing role of knowledge in general. In the face of global competition, the success of countries, regions, and firms has been increasingly reliant on the production and dissemination of knowledge. Our society, as many say, has shifted from a land-based, labour-based, and capital-based one to a knowledge-based one (Schoonmaker and Carayannis 2013). In the knowledge-based economy, high levels of human capital, measured as the share of skilled workers in the labour force, lead not only to higher levels of per capita gross value added (GVA), but also to faster long-term growth. Indeed, the importance of skilled workers has been recognised worldwide, and it is not surprising to see the publication of a 1998 report by McKinsey entitled ‘The War for Talent’ (Chambers et al. 1998). If there is a ‘war’ for talent, theoretically, some countries will win, while others will lose. There has seen a massive development in the stock of skilled immigrants in the USA, as Johnson and Regets (1998) claimed that, as early as in 1993, immigrants already accounted for 30% of doctoral degree holders conducting research and development activities in science-related fields there. All member countries of the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) taken into account, there were about 20 million skilled immigrants in 2000, showing an increase of 64% since 1990 (Beine et al. 2008). The loss of skilled workers who are endowed with a high level of human capital is, understandably, considered to be detrimental for a country, which is also said to endure the so-called problem of ‘brain drain’. Studies have examined the causes of the phenomenon and noted that determinants of brain drain include wage differentials between countries as well as personal reasons (Bang and Mitra 2011; Hatton and Williamson 2005). The notion that brain drain is mainly typical for developing countries is now in serious challenge when more and more developed countries are claiming to go through the same problem. In the early 2000s, the European Commission (EC) set out a range of measures intended to prevent Europe’s best scientists abandoning their careers in Europe in favour of more lucrative opportunities in the USA and elsewhere. These measures were introduced as a response to the findings of an EC’s report, which showed that 75% of researchers who spend time working in the USA would ultimately choose to remain there rather than returning back to Europe (European Commission 2003). Another survey by the Australian Society for Medical Research (ASMR) in 2000 suggested that Australia faced biomedical brain drain as native biomedical researchers were leaving the country in droves and not planning to return, with the main reasons related to low pay, poor job security, and limited research funding. In the case of the UK, usually one of the main destinations for skilled workers from the globe, there has recently been concern that it might face a brain drain problem thanks to the UK’s referendum in July 2016 to leave the European Union (EU). While there is a large body of literature examining how the mobility of skilled workers from a certain country influences its economic growth, little research focuses on regional differences within the same country or national differences between countries. On the former issue, a few exceptional studies have shown that, within the same country, skilled workers move from one region to another. Artz (2003) argued that, in the USA, metropolitan areas had gained college-educated workers at the expense of non-metropolitan and rural areas, posing a serious threat to the social and economic development of rural America. In Germany, Cuhls (2007) similarly noticed that the eastern parts had already lost many of their best people to the western regions. In a 2009 study focused on the UK, Cowling (2009) considered the geographical distribution of talent across the larger cities in the country and found that some cities had three times more highly educated workers than others. The mobility of skilled workers has become a complicated issue, causing regional differences within the same country as well as national differences between countries. This paper broadens our understanding of the latter issue—national differences between countries—a gap in the literature which this study aims to plug. In particular, it focuses on the brain drain/gain problem in the EU countries. All of the above factors, including globalisation, the mobility of skilled workers, and economic growth, are of great relevance to the EU in the following ways. Firstly, with the expansion of the EU, there have been increasing spatial disparities between its member states. Secondly, the mobility of skilled workers is widely discussed thanks to the freedom of movement for workers within the EU. While the positive relationships between the share of skilled workers in the workforce and economic growth have been widely tested in specific localities, there still lacks a comprehensive study examining the case for the whole Europe. This paper seeks to fill this gap, which is of great importance for policymakers. To be specific, the main aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it constructs an original brain drain/gain index as a proxy to the extent of skilled worker mobility at the national level. The index illustrates the change of situation in the EU countries over years, covering periods both before and after the financial crisis of 2008. On the other hand, it examines whether or not there exist some relationships between the extent of skilled worker mobility and the economic performance of all the EU nations. The analysis contributes to the literature and practice in many aspects. It combines a number of large-scale databases to come up with a novel national brain drain/gain index, as there is no single dataset including information on skilled worker mobility for all the EU countries. The index considers the combined effect of retention and attraction of university degree holders and captures the net difference between the following two indicators: (1) the number of graduates from higher education institutions located in each EU member state in a specific year and (2) the change on the number of people (aged between 25 and 64) with bachelor’s degree or above in each EU member state between two consecutive years. In addition, it runs a series of correlation tests to show how the index values and a variety of national outcome measures are related. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The “Literature Review” section reviews the relevant theoretical and empirical literature, and highlights the role of skilled workers in the knowledge-based economy, especially their effect on economic growth. The “Context” section briefly outlines the context of the EU and explains its expansion in the recent decades and the divergent economic performance of its member states. While the “Methodology and Data” section describes methodology and data, and the “Results” section presents the key findings and, in particular, shows the top and bottom performing nations in the brain drain/gain index, and examines the historical trends in the EU on this matter. The “Discussion” section further discusses the results such as relevant policy implications, while conclusions are drawn in the “Conclusions” section.",8
10.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,05 July 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-015-0271-6,Breaking with the Past in Smart Specialisation: A New Model of Selection of Business Stakeholders Within the Entrepreneurial Process of Discovery,December 2019,Diego Martínez-López,Manuel Palazuelos-Martínez,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The European Commission has repeatedly set out in a number of documents that Europe needs a comprehensive innovation strategy focused on investments in R&D and entrepreneurship (see, for instance, European Commission 2012; 2010a, b, c). The idea is to design and implement national and regional strategies so that the EU’s Structural Funds can be used more efficiently. The new policy approach known as “Smart Specialisation” aims at capturing not only which are the main assets of a territory in terms of competitive advantages but also developing them in a context of global challenges and rapid diffusion of knowledge. This new approach has been also integrated as an essential part for the EU’s Structural Funds over the period 2014–2020, with an “ex-ante conditionality” based on the existence of a Smart Specialisation Strategy for the territory (European Commission 2012). In such a context, the entrepreneurial process of discovery (henceforth EPD) plays a central role as one of the main defining features of the novelty of the smart specialisation approach (Foray and Goenaga 2013). The EPD marks a clear break away from past practices, as regards inter alia the involvement of stakeholders. In the past, decisions on research and innovation strategies were often designed by regional authorities using a top-down approach in which they would lead and define this process, with no or little consultation and involvement of regional stakeholders, particularly in the decision-making. The smart specialisation approach demands changing this culture and moving to a bottom-up process whereby the regional government acts more as a facilitator, rather than a sole leader of this process. This implies the swift to a process of ’collaborative leadership’ which should involve all relevant regional stakeholders in the quadruple helix in the decision-making, including public administration, the research and education world, civil society and in particular business. The interest in involving the latter would not only be considered as a way to increase the effectiveness of European/regional policies but it also reflects the idea that entrepreneurs are in pole position to start a discovery process of new and profitable economic activities, both from a social and private interest viewpoints. However, it is impossible (and excessively costly) in practice to involve all entrepreneurs and a selection will need to be made. The question then becomes how these business stakeholders should be selected if this was to be done in an efficient, transparent and fair way. This paper addresses precisely this question, by proposing one of the ways in which this selection of private business stakeholders can be made. There is definitely more than one efficient way to select these economic actors, but in most cases, this implies again a breakaway from past practices that only involved always the same actors, which are those actors that are better known and more directly connected to the regional authorities (a phenomenon that we can call the “usual suspects’ vicious circle”). The move away from past practices of stakeholder involvement concern several policy dimensions. In particular, the policy needs identified in this regard can be summarised in at least three crucial aspects. First, a better grounded analytical base seems beneficial to adopt any criteria to select stakeholders. Second, it is necessary to establish a method that it is measurable and based only on performance, so that it is as transparent as possible, and thus as fair as possible with all different stakeholders in the territory. All stakeholders, be them from large established activities or small emerging ones, should have the same opportunities and be measured only by performance, in a way that can be quantified, and thus compared (also to others in the region) in different periods in time. Third, we need a method that is not opened or subject to endogenous manipulations coming from firms behaving as rent-seekers, escaping from the aforementioned “usual suspects’ vicious circle”. This paper is also an attempt to bridge these policy needs, and studies precisely how to select the best entrepreneurs establishing a transparent and measurable criterion to do so. The criterion defined is the choice of the entrepreneurs who have defined an adequate resource allocation over time in a context of uncertainty. In particular, this is operationalised as the appropriate level of investment and labour hiring in new activities. The main contributions of this paper are as follows. In policy terms, it is a novel contribution in relation to a key question of smart specialisation, which is how to select business stakeholders in the process of entrepreneurial process of discovery. In this context, it presents a selection method, which can be used in practice, is transparent, ensures equality of treatment of stakeholders regardless of the previous history of connections with public administration and it is, above all, measurable, which is key to ensure both the transparency and the equality of treatment. In this sense, it provides an easy criterion to discriminate between “average” and “more efficient” entrepreneurs, avoiding the possibility of manipulation of firms behaving as rent-seekers when public resources are on the table. In terms of the actual model presented to select business stakeholders and the methodology used, the main contributions are threefold. Firstly, the model presented here incorporates new features which are relevant in terms of entrepreneurial activity, such as monopolistic competition (Andersson and Johansson 2008) and consumer behaviour. Secondly, in contrast to Hausmann and Rodrik (2003), the discussion in terms of entrepreneurship is broadened to consider not only labour as production factor but also private capital. The resulting new environment implies then a general equilibrium framework. And thirdly, it proposes the aforementioned simple new analytical methodology to broadly determine how accurate are the entrepreneurs in predicting a key variable in the economic performance of both individual firm and the overall economy, such as the total factor productivity (TFP). A clarification is needed here about the concept of TFP used in this paper. TFP has been traditionally seen as a residual coming from growth accounting exercises. However, this approach may hide a relevant interpretation of TFP as a measure of the efficiency with which the firms combine the production factors.Footnote 1 Consequently, as long as TFP is closely related to the aggregate knowledge and innovation capabilities available in the economy, it is reasonable to deal with TFP as an efficiency measure and one of the key determinants of entrepreneurial investment. The structure of the paper is as follows. After the introduction, “The Policy Context: The Entrepreneurial Process of Discovery Within Smart Specialisation and the Role of Stakeholders” section puts this article into the broader policy context, explaining its connection with smart specialisation, and more in particular with the entrepreneurial process of discovery. “The Theoretical Framework” section presents the theoretical framework of the model used to select entrepreneurs. Then, “A Simple Test on Entrepreneurs’ Expectations” section of this paper sets out a simple test to assess entrepreneurs’ expectations so that they can be measured and compared. Finally, the paper ends with some brief concluding remarks, policy implications and links to further research.",14
10.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,10 April 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-017-0485-x,Disabled People in the Stakeholder Theory: a Literature Analysis,December 2019,Guido Migliaccio,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The paper aims to investigate disability management in the promotion of a new vision of disability in society and, especially, in the economy (D’Amato 2009; Metallo et al. 2009; Scarpat 1987). In this way, the objectives of the paper are to disseminate the discussion on diversity and disability management, encourage ethical values to build a participatory and inclusive society and an economy in which everyone can play a productive role, and facilitate this process by diversity and disability management. Hence, this study involves macro- and microeconomic areas as well as the fields of business administration, accounting, relational psychology, sociology, labor law, and other areas that are associated with individuals with special needs: what is central throughout this study is that stakeholders for private companies and public organizations are considered. Particular interest in the development of this topic should come from public institutions that are oriented toward the integration of people with disabilities and private companies that can obtain direct benefits from renewed relationships with disabled people. Moreover, these associations may be relevant protagonists of the included path in economic stakeholders with disabilities. An inclusive society is a richer society of goods, services, and profits, especially in terms of positive human relations and diversity. The elimination of social disintegration favors positive social and economic relations by initiating a virtuous circle that increases the welfare of the population. The new inclusion theory responds to a need that emerges not only from people with disabilities and their families but also from non-disabled people who have to interact with disabled individuals with special needs on a daily basis. Above all, public organizations and companies need to address this issue, considering the growing number of people with disabilities and the new needs that must be met. Obviously, not all stakeholders in the development of this approach have similar sensitivities, nor are they equally ready to develop an inclusive society: the important role of scientific research is to augment the sensitivity of the people on a topic that is seemingly in the interests of a few. The hope for the development of such theories is to foster collaborative spaces that are currently relegated to a few rare voluntary initiatives or philanthropic organizations that are not sufficiently supported by a reference framework of values. Handicapped input can only be accepted if the reduced productivity is somehow compensated by economies related to the acquisition or employment of the factor itself. There may therefore be a space for a bias against disabled people in terms of their participation in the economic process as long as their disabilities affect their productivity. The assessment regarding the economic feasibility of productive input of people with disabilities should be formulated within a broader analytical framework that considers the effects throughout both the business system and the wider economic and social context in which the resource is employed. More than a billion people, approximately 15% of the world’s population, are estimated as living with some form of disability (World Health Organization 2011). Although these data are the subject of debate (Lucadamo and Simonetti 2009), it is clear that disability is an issue that must be carefully addressed. What must also be considered is that people with disabilities are a minority that is growing quickly, especially given the increase in life expectancy due to a better tenor of life and medical advances (Medeghini 2015). Studies related to disability are mainly related to ethics, sociology, pedagogy, and technology for a population of people with disabilities; therefore, economic problems are also considered—especially, but not limited to, its costs. The economic and social costs of disability are significant but difficult to quantify (World Health Organization 2011). They include direct and indirect costs: many of these costs can be reduced in a more inclusive setting. Comprehensive estimates of the cost of disability are scarce and fragmented because definitions of disability often vary; there are limited data on the cost components of disability, and there are no commonly agreed-upon methods for cost estimation, etc. However, the situation is better for data on public spending. The direct costs of disability fall into two categories: the additional costs that people with disabilities and their families incur to achieve a reasonable standard of living and the costs that are related to the disability itself. Public spending on disability programs is related to health and rehabilitation services, labor market programs, vocational education and training, disability social insurance (contributory) benefits, social assistance (non-contributory), etc. Indirect economic costs as a result of disability involve the loss of taxes that are related to the loss of productivity. Non-economic costs include social isolation and stress, which are difficult to quantify. The economic analysis is often merely lists the costs without also considering the benefits that can result from an inclusive economy. It is therefore necessary to formulate a more complete theory of the relationship between disability and the economy that must be inserted into the stakeholder theory. People with disabilities and their families, in fact, represent special stakeholders with special needs that the economy can and must meet. Research and new theories are essential for informing disability policies and programs, for efficiently allocating resources and, above all, for increasing public awareness and understanding of disability. In this way, the analysis should be performed using different perspectives (corporate and macroeconomic but also on ethical/economic and social scales) following the stakeholder theory (Freeman and Evan 1993). The adoption of a qualitative methodology (Myers 2013) is useful for developing a systematic literature review of the disability management. The sources used for the literature analysis are of a secondary nature. In this way, the paper emphasizes the effects of disability on business viability: disabled stakeholders are employees or business operatives and customers or users. The paper also discusses the effects of disability beyond the corporate level and in the general economic system. In the last part of the paper, there are some considerations about ethical and socioeconomic issues. Finally, the paper will reach a successful conclusion: despite deeply ingrained prejudices, disability does not necessarily lead to corporate diseconomies. The paper is structured as follows. After the “Introduction” and “Literature Review,” the “Methods” section and the “Analysis, Findings, and Discussion” section are presented. Finally, the “Conclusions, Limitation, and Future Research” section states the conclusions and avenues for future research.",7

Among the various motivations behind travel is the desire to practise sport in attractive surroundings (Weed 2009). In recent times, within some Mediterranean coastal areas with certain weather conditions, new types of bathers have been observed: surfers, who carve through the water and wave riding kitesurfers, towed by wind-filled kites (Machado et al. 2018; Frank et al. 2015; Esparza 2011). Attracting the attention of beach goers are skies crowded with huge kites, the strong sails of windsurfers and lines of small figures on the horizon, formed by surfers seated on their boards waiting for the right wave. These scenes can currently be seen along the shores of Sardinia. Sardinia is the second biggest island of the Mediterranean and a renowned destination for tourists seeking sea, sun and sand (Fadda and Sørensen 2017). Its growing flow of tourists began after the 1960s. Nowadays, tourism has become an activity fundamental to Sardinia’s economy, although public institutions face persistent difficulties related to its isolated situation and the phenomenon of seasonality (Fadda et al. 2016). To tackle the problem of seasonality, various different activities have been implemented to attract tourists during the off-season. These include capitalizing on the windy conditions experienced in this location in the western Mediterranean Sea. Many people, both locals and non-locals, practise some kind of water boardsport on Sardinian coasts. The number of riders has gradually grown, while several surf, kitesurf and windsurf schools have emerged near coastal locations which have the right wind and wave conditions. In tourism literature, there is an increasing research attention in studying island destinations (Parra-López and Martínez-González 2018; Dimelli 2017; Marmaras and Wallace 2018). Focusing on the seasonality that affects many seaside Mediterranean destinations and islands, the diversification of the tourist product has been recognized as an effective strategy to counteract seasonal flows of tourists (Karyopouli and Koutra 2013; Higham 2005a; Bartolomé et al., 2009; Andriotis 2005; Parra-López and Martínez-González 2018). Among various attractions, sports practices, sports events and outdoor activities have been found to affect the capacity of destinations to attract tourists, and to have important economic and social impacts on those destinations (Fourie and Santana-Gallego 2011; Higham and Hinch 2002). The aim of this study is to analyse the implications for tourism arising from these sport practices, in order both to evaluate their capacity to exploit tourist opportunities and to understand their respective benefits and limitations. This study focuses on the renowned sea-sun-sand destination island of Sardinia and on the water boardsports most commonly practised around the Sardinian coast that include surfing, kitesurfing and windsurfing. These sports are very closely related in terms of practical requirements: all necessitate the use of a board, are practised on water and need certain weather conditions (wind in the case of kitesurfing and windsurfing, and specific waves in the case of surfing) (Buckley 2010). During the last two decades, a specific branch of literature focused on surf tourism has gradually emerged and has seen a recent upsurge in publications (Buckley 2002a, 2002b; Ponting et al. 2005; Martin and Assenov 2012). While many different topics have been investigated—such as the economic impacts of this kind of tourism on well-known surf destinations and the socio-cultural consequences to local communities (Porter et al. 2015; Towner 2016), as well as the recent issue of sustainability in the development of local surf tourism (Machado et al. 2018) also in remote destinations (Towner and Milner 2017; O’Brien and Ponting 2013; Ponting and O'Brien, 2014)—the impact of these activities in terms of a prospective strategy for out-of-season tourism at mature seaside destinations has not previously received attention. Furthermore, except in relation to Portugal (Porter et al. 2015; Frank et al. 2015; Machado et al. 2018; Brochado et al. 2018), little research exists either on European locations or which compares different cultures and emerging surf tourism destinations (Martin and Assenov 2012). A better understanding of water boardsports through an overall analysis of businesses related to supply (i.e. schools and other services addressed to surfers) on one hand, and of demand in terms of surfers’ travelling behaviours on the other, may help to offer a deeper understanding of the potential of these activities to create a tourism segment in seaside destinations with seasonal externalities, particularly in the light of weather conditions these sports need, and may complement studies of surf tourism and island destinations. Adopting a dual approach focused on supply and demand, this study deals with the key factors to consider when developing a surf tourism destination within an emerging sport tourism location affected by seasonality problems. With regard to supply, all schools for boardsports located on Sardinia were first mapped, after which a web-based email survey was undertaken. At the same time, with regard to demand, a survey was conducted among riders who frequently visit the island to practise water boardsports. Surfing appeal, perceptions about location services and tourism governance factors were analysed in order to highlight the benefits, opportunities and implications related to water boardsports tourism. This paper is organized as follows: the second part reviews the literature about surf tourism and sports tourism, while the third section concerns the methodology and describes the context of the empirical analysis. Results, divided between supply and demand, are then presented. Finally, the conclusions, implications and limitations of the study are discussed.",5

Popov,Dmitry M. Kochetkov,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The knowledge economy has its origins in work by Joseph Schumpeter (Schumpeter 1934), who formulated the concept of economic growth based on the diffusion of innovation. Humanity entered a new stage in its development in the 1960s, as evidenced by the widespread of automation and the massive introduction of scientific inventions. This process was studied by globally recognized sociologists (Sorokin 1964; Bell 1973; Toffler 1980). They formed the concept of the post-industrial society based on free access to knowledge (research, first of all) and scientific and technical progress (STP). This concept gave rise to the widely used term “information society,” and it must be pointed out that “information” and “knowledge” are often used as synonyms. In our opinion, this is not entirely justified, since knowledge, in contrast to information, is always focused on solving a fundamental or applied problem. Besides, knowledge has an attribute of authorship. The Austrian and American economist Fritz Machlup (1962) conducted influential research on the classification of knowledge, classifying knowledge due to its application to areas of economic activities. D. Stigler (1961) considered knowledge as an economic category with an emphasis on information search costs. It was Peter Drucker, however, who disclosed the role of knowledge in the creation of added value in the 1970s (Drucker 1977). Drucker emphasized the significance of knowledge as the main economic resource of the new society. P. Romer (1990) proposed a theoretical model of economic growth, in which the key exogenous factor is the level of technology development and investment in R&D. L. Thurow in his work “Creating wealth” gives a set of applied recommendations for achieving a high level of social welfare through the knowledge economy (Thurow 1996). Many researchers believe the knowledge economy and knowledge-based society to be the most important (if not the only) way to solve social, economic, technological, and political challenges facing society (Melnikas 2011). In a broad context, the knowledge economy is an economic system where knowledge is a key factor (or resource) of production and economic growth (Kochetkov and Vlasov 2016). This definition implies a multitude of interpretations, among which there are at least three directions, i.e., the development of knowledge-intensive industries, the central role of fundamental knowledge in social and economic development, and the generation of knowledge within firms and organizations (knowledge management) (Powell and Snellman 2004). Let us note that the second concept is closer to us because grounding on the Schumpeter’s innovation cycle; we argue that a fundamental invention always precedes the development of knowledge-intensive enterprises and industries. The neoliberal paradigm treats knowledge generation as a specific production process with its inputs and outputs (Olssen and Peters 2005). In the process of knowledge generation, intangible assets are created that form the knowledge capital. This statement enables discussion about the knowledge capitalism as a new socio-economic formation. The role of institutions in the creation and utilization of new knowledge is also widely recognized (Adler 2001; Mokyr 2002). Thus, we can define the knowledge economy as an economic system based on the institutional mechanism for the generation of new fundamental knowledge and its effective utilization in social and economic activities. H. Etzkowitz proposed a popular model of the regional economy; this model, known as the “Triple Helix” is based on the partnership of university-business-government (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 2000; Etzkowitz 2002; Etzkowitz and Klofsten 2005). Later, researchers added new components to the model: civil society and public institutions (Carayannis and Campbell 2009); natural environment and environmental institutions (Carayannis and Campbell 2010). Cooke (2001) analyzed the dichotomy of regional innovation systems (RIS)—new economy innovation systems (NEIS). In political discourse, the EU Lisbon Presidency Conclusion ( 2000) stated the key aspects of knowledge-based strategic policy. However, the EU’s Lisbon Agenda is now considered a policy failure that did not get rigorously implemented and did not produce even a fraction of its desired results. The primary purpose of our study is a ranking of the Russian regions in terms of the knowledge economy development utilizing the original technique. It was called the Russian Regional Knowledge Economy Index (Russian RKEI). Analysis of the ranking results will enable further institutional analysis of regional policies and practices. The paper is structured as follows: after the introductory part, we provide a brief background, which includes a description of the Russian case and global indices of the knowledge economy. After that, we describe the ranking methodology developed; in the Results and Discussion section, we highlight the leading and backward regions regarding the knowledge economy and interpret the results obtained.",2

World ICT spending fell by around 4% in 2009 (OECD 2010). Nevertheless, the decrease of ICT investment has been lower than that of GDP worldwide, so that the ratio of ICT investment to GDP has increased. The 2009 decline of world spending in ICT is not as large in current US dollars as in 2001–02, owing to growth in non-OECD economies and the introduction of new products (OECD 2010). Worldwide, about 57% of the 2009 ICT spending was on communication services and hardware, 21% on computer services, 13% on computer hardware, and 9% on software; about 76% of world ICT spending is in the OECD countries (OECD 2010). The theoretical expectation for the impact of crisis on ICT investment is qualitatively the same as for all other kinds of investment. The main idea is that independent of the source of financing the general investment propensity decreases in periods of economic recession. Firms are confronted with demand uncertainty that makes investment more risky than in “normal” or boom periods. Demand uncertainty forces firms to a pro-cyclical behavior. Empirical evidence supports mostly pro-cyclical behavior (for R&D investment see, e.g., Ouyang 2011; Guellec and Ioannidis 1999). ICT use is according to previous literature an important driver of innovation activities and performance (Brynjolfsson and Saunders 2010; Kleis et al. 2012; Nambisan 2013; Lyytinen et al. 2016; Jha and Bose 2016). As a consequence, we expect that the drop of ICT investment during the crisis might cause a negative effect on specific ICT-enabled innovation performance. This would be the ICT-related effect of the 2008 crisis on innovation. Thus, the first research question we want to examine empirically refers to the possibility that an economic crisis could affect innovation performance through the ICT investment channel (i.e., by leading to lower ICT investment). In connection with this, it is also interesting to analyze firm’s ICT characteristics (concerning ICT inputs and ICT infrastructures) that are associated with ICT-enabled innovation performance. This is the second research question we want to pursue in this paper. Given that ICT constitutes a growth-determining factor of increasing importance and that economic crises are an inevitable trait of market-based economies, it is of general interest to know the extent to which the ICT investment channel strengthens or weakens the negative implications of economic crisis on innovation performance. In particular, in this study, we empirically investigate the effect of ICT investment reduction on six different types of ICT-enabled product/service and process innovation: (a) new products or services that contain ICT components; (b) new products or services for which ICT has played an important part in their R&D process; (c) new products and services for which ICT has played an important part in their market launch; (d) new processes that are supported by ICT; (e) new processes for which ICT has played an important part in their design; and (f) new processes for which ICT has played an important part in their implementation. Furthermore, we empirically investigate the effects on the above six types of ICT-enabled product/service and process innovation of three ICT inputs (two “internal” ones, ICT budget and ICT personnel, and also an “external” one, the use of ICT outsourcing services); of three different types of ICT infra-structures (both internal functions support and external environment transaction-oriented ones: use of standard ICT applications for supporting firm’s internal administration and production functions, as well as use of e-sales and e-procurement for supporting firm’s transactions with customers and suppliers); and finally of the awareness of the relevance of new ICTs. Our study is based on firm data from the glass/ceramics/cement industry in six European countries. The glass, ceramics, and cement industry is an important supplier of the construction sector, and as a consequence, an industry that depends primarily on domestic demand. In this sense, the state of affairs in this industry reflects the situation of a country’s part of the economy that is oriented to domestic demand. We find a statistically significant negative relationship between ICT-enabled product innovation and crisis vulnerability, as measured by the extent of the reduction of ICT investment during the crisis (pro-cyclical behavior), but only for new products or services that contain ICT components and are therefore directly affected by crisis-related decreasing product demand. Otherwise, the reduction of ICT investment does not appear to impact significantly ICT-enabled innovation performance in the sectors that have been investigated in this study, even though it is shown that ICT inputs (such as specialized ICT personnel and ICT outsourcing) as well as internal support ICT infrastructure (standard ICT applications, such as ERP, SRM, CRM, and SCM) are important determinants of ICT-enabled innovation. To our knowledge, there is no other study investigating these topics, so our paper has also the character of an explorative study in a new research field. We believe that our findings are interesting for both researchers and practitioners in the areas of ICT, firm management, and public policy-making. The paper is structured as follows: “Conceptual Background, Related Literature, and Research Hypotheses” section presents the conceptual background, related literature, and the research hypotheses. “Data” section discusses the data. In “Model Specification” section, the specification of the models is presented, while in “Econometric Issues” section, econometric issues are discussed. In “Results” section, the results are presented and discussed. “Summary and Conclusions” section concludes the paper.",10

Correctly established forecast indicators are crucial for appropriate planning of resource distribution, financial investments, and purchasing of necessary equipment, technical and technological means. Accomplished stages of performance and related prediction may be assessed based on: single criteria, system of established indicators, methods of multivariate analysis allowing the integrative evaluation. When estimating the performance based on single criteria authors (Blank 2002) usually consider such indicators as profit and profitability. However, this method does not allow the full-scale and effective assessment, because experts may be subjective in their evaluation choosing the most significant criteria in their own discretion. Thus, the reliable prediction of development is impossible here. Some researchers (Shabanov 2006) insist on using the system of indicators for performance assessment and prediction, but this method does not also provide the comprehensive estimation for the following reasons. Each branch of industry has its own specific features. Criteria for composing the system of indicators are chosen through expertise. The expert does not have a full, actual vision of the current situation in the organization. Thus, calculations of total effect of production or complex performance indicators are too subjective. Introduction of additional indicators in assessment of effectiveness is not reasonable, as some of them overlap and are absolutely meaningless eventually. This research suggest using multivariate analysis (correlation-regression analysis in particular) to calculate forecast indicators in modeling. Correlation regression analysis should be performed by the means of cluster analysis of panel data, which allows the better adequacy of regression models. Thus, it is possible to achieve the most comprehensive and objective research with the help of econometric model grouping agro-industrial organizations into clusters. Agro-industrial formations of regional importance are complex production and economic objects; study of their functioning and development prospects increasingly frequently involves methods of economic and mathematical modeling and the use of information technology. The use of methods of mathematical programming and a computer is an indispensable condition for the creation of a scientifically justified system for planning the national economy and organizing systematic management of social production (Nemchinov 1967). The transition to market methods of management, which resulted in a reduction in the role of the state, market liberalization, the reorganization of collective and state farms, changed the conditions for the activity of agricultural commodity producers. The progress of scientific research has slowed down. Decisions that affect the development of the agricultural sector did not have a scientific justification. The scope of used economic-mathematical methods and introduction of information technologies in the agrarian sphere of the economy in the analysis and design of events is the lowest (in contrast to other spheres of the economy) (Fedorova et al., 2015). To the above, we should add that the current situation in which the country found itself because of the economic sanctions of the USA and Europe and the country’s policy of import substitution is a weighty argument in favor of expanding scientific research to justify decisions on the development of the agro-industrial complex at all levels of government. Undoubtedly, the scientific methods of economic and mathematical modeling should be used in analysis, planning, and forecasting the development of the domestic agro-industrial complex; then, it is possible to foresee the state of success and competitiveness of this complex in foreign food markets (Nesterenko 2013). Economic processes are influenced by numerous and diverse factors that cannot always be taken into account or measured and that are characterized by elements of randomness and uncertainty. These factors are in complex relationships that lead to opposite effects. Proceeding from what has been said, the aim of our paper is to develop economic and mathematical models for analyzing and forecasting the performance indicators of organizations of the agro-industrial complex. The object of the study is organizations of the regional agro-industrial complex. The subject of the study is the quantitative characteristics of economic phenomena and processes occurring in agricultural production. The study is organized based on statistical data of pig-breeding organizations of the Ural Federal District. In this region, pig-breeding production is second in all meat demand, so the effective performance of pig-breeding industry is essential for regional economy. The investigated method in modeling of forecast performance indicators may be potentially used in other industrial and non-industrial branches of economy, abroad as well.",1

The core of such transition process is the intensity of innovation activities at both economy and society. The need to organize, regulate, and harmonize all innovation activities at the national level calls for national innovation System (NIS) that insures that innovation activities are systematic (Cooke et al. 1998). Nelson and Lundvall also argued that successful innovation is system based (Nelson 1993; Lundvall 1992). The emergence of the concept of the NIS was a result of collaborative efforts between Christopher Freeman and the IKE group in Aalborg (Freeman 1982; Freeman and Lundvall 1988). Freeman defines NIS as “The network of institutions in the public and private sectors whose activities and interactions initiate, import, modify and diffuse new technologies” (Freeman 1987). Whereas, Lundvall defines it “The elements and relationships which interact in the production, diffusion and use of new, and economically useful, knowledge ... and are either located within or rooted inside the borders of a nation state” (Lundvall 1992). In the other hand, Nelson (1993) defines the NIS in national framework as “a set of institutions whose interactions determine the innovative performance ... of national firms.” Later, Guan and Chen (2012) define it as “a set of institutions actors including universities and other research institutions, firms, intermediaries and governments that produce and implement innovation.” The innovation process is a complex process, that is institutionally constructed and developed (Della Peruta et al. 2016). Hence, there is a need to build NISs capable to activate and stimulate innovative activities and spread new technologies in all sectors of the economy. Such NISs should not be built on the basis of traditional hierarchal decision-making systems that fail to cope with the challenges posed by rapid market changes and intense competition (Del Giudice et al. 2016). Instead, they should accommodate the complexity and diversity of actors, functions, and relationships within national innovation systems (Nelson and Rosenberg 1993). The theoretical basis of the linkages between NIS and entrepreneurship can be traced back to viable systems approach (VSA) suggested by Golinelli (2010) who emphasizes the importance of system thinking in decision-making processes. Calabrese et al. (2017) stress the importance of system theories, as opposed to traditional managerial theories, in reducing uncertainty that individuals and firms face. They argue that systems for managing information flows play an important role in formulating entrepreneurial dynamics. Actors within NIS contribute towards creating a new technology or upgrading existing technologies, which in turn creates many new business opportunities. NIS constitutes an economic environment that is appropriate to increase and stimulate new innovation activities and boost the number of new enterprises. The impact of NIS is not only limited to new enterprises, but also it has a “positive effect on employment in both growing and shrinking small and medium enterprises” (Zimmermann 2008). Also, sharing knowledge among the components of the NIS makes it possible to commercialize knowledge that would otherwise remain uncommercialized. This will encourage more enterprises to expand in the field of innovative activities (OECD 2010). The size of this impact depends on effectiveness of the innovation system. Therefore, there is a direct relationship between the level of effectiveness of the NIS and the level of intensity of economic activities in the country. The intensity of economic activities can be represented by the number of new enterprises operating within the economy, through which we can judge, partly at least, the effectiveness of one aspect of the work of the NIS in the country. Despite the rich literature on NIS, studies on the relationship between NIS and entrepreneurship activities are rather scarce. A modest attempt to link NIS to entrepreneurship in three EU countries (Ireland, Finland, and Netherlands) comes with inconclusive results (Golden et al. 2003). Moreau (2010) examines the impact of proxies of entrepreneurship on innovative capabilities of large-sample Turkish small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Radosevic (2007) attributes this poor coverage of such interesting topic to the abstractions of institutional environment of entrepreneurship, the individual centric view of entrepreneurship, methodological difficulties in connecting entrepreneurship to macro-level analysis, in addition to the selection of appropriate proxies for both concepts. However, given that NISs aim at promoting innovation activities, and entrepreneurship is centered around innovation, a linkage between the public innovation policies and the firms’ innovativeness is expected (Cooke et al. 1998). This relationship does not mean that all enterprises within an economy and all components of NIS are working together to achieve specific goals (Nelson and Rosenberg 1993; Golden et al. 2003). Besides, not all enterprises are benefiting the same from the public innovation supportive policies, where the most benefiting enterprises are large ones, while small enterprises have less benefit (Cooke et al. 1998). This could be attributed to the weak interaction of those enterprises with public knowledge infrastructure. This study attempts to bridge this gap in the literature and link NIS to entrepreneurship by investigating the impact of NISs on the number of new enterprises in Baltic States. Taking into account that the process of constructing NISs differs from one country to another on the basis of differences in the economic, social, and political structures, different actors within the system and different institutional and organizational frameworks in the county. Moreover, success factors of such systems in creating new enterprises differ from one country to another. One Success factor could be the large spending on Research and Development (R&D) by the private and public sectors in one country, or the institutional framework supporting activities of small and medium enterprises existing in another, or the direct contribution of public sector in providing facilities to increase business activities in a third country. This paper contributes to the existing literature on NISs in many ways. First, it provides an analytical and comparative study between NISs in Baltic state countries. That is, it clarifies the structural differences between those systems as well as discusses the strengths and weaknesses factors of those systems. Second, it fills the gap in the research of NISs in Baltic States by investigating the impact of a number of factors of NISs in creating new enterprises applying ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions and principal component analysis (PCA). The results of this study suggest that there is a significant impact of NIS components on the number of new enterprises. However, this impact is formed in different ways in each country that reflect the special structural characteristics of those countries. This paper consists of five main sections. “Literature Review” reviews the literature on NIS and its relationship to macro-economic indicators. The “National Innovation System Structure in Baltic Countries” examines the structure of NISs in the Baltic States with a theoretical comparison between them. “Methodology and Results” contains a comparative and empirical study of the relationship between different factors of innovation systems and the number of new enterprises. “Conclusion and Recommendations” concludes and suggests recommendations.",5

A Blessing or Curse: An Application of Cointegration Techniques",March 2020,Sofien Tiba,Mohamed Frikha,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Sustainable development has been considered as the ultimate challenge during this third millennium as asserted through the UN background, which is adopted by the international community. Each UN member states are interested to beat and achieve the sustainable development goals (SDGs). In the SDGs’ framework, Africa was concerned by this dilemma as the whole globe. However, the sustainability issue constitutes a tale of the paradox for African countries. Indeed, African countries suffer from several controversial problems such as poor economic performance, allocating the resources to support the core of growth, ecological aspect, pollution, weak investment in education, and weak institutions. Hence, Africa as a whole has recorded on average an economic growth rate of 3% in 2015 (based on the statistics of the World Development Indicator Database (n.d.)). However, this weak economic performance is seen as paradoxical when we shed light on the resources availability. Africa has around 30% of world mineral reserves and 10% of oil and 8% gas world reserve (based on the statistics of the African Development Bank Group (n.d.)). The colossal availability of natural wealth exerts a negative impact on the economic performance of Africa as a whole. Further, Africa as the entire globe was concerned by the third millennium challenge of sustainable development. Hence, with its great capacities and potential (diamond, gas, petroleum), Africa lagged behind the world in terms of sustainability through weak economic performance, ecological problems, poverty, inequality, and weak institutional framework confirming the assertion “Africa is rich, but Africans are poor.” This weak performance is due to the absence of investment in human capital and/or the weak institutional framework of such problems are considered as structural for Africa. The negative relationship recorded above can be explained by the “Resources Curse Hypothesis” (RCH). For the first time, a negative relationship has been recorded between natural resource endowment and economic growth by the pioneering work of Sachs and Warner (1995, 1997, 2001), which is considered as the cornerstone study in stressing the resource curse phenomena. Based on the theory, the “resources curse” hypothesis stipulates that economies with a huge potential of natural resource abundance have more possibilities to perform worst in terms of growth than the economies with no or fewer natural resource endowment. Furthermore, the existence of a great body of literature that sheds the lights on the phenomenon of crippling economic performance generated by the negative impact linked to the excessive dependence on the natural resource (e.g., Costantini and Monni 2008; Shao and Yang 2010; Abou-Ali and Abdelfattah 2013; Apergis and Payne 2014). Also, it should be noted that the paradox of resource curse abundance has been extensively stressed in the non-renewable resources background (e.g., Eisgruber 2013). This controversial issue is strongly related to the human attainment and the quality of institutions. Hence, the theory was revealing the fact that the human development and quality of institution explain greatly the resource curse. Indeed, the extensive body of literature that looks at the RCH, pointed out the presence of the curse at both the individual and global scale (e.g., Sachs and Warner 1995, 2001; Gylfason 2001; Gylfason and Zoega 2006; Papyrakis and Gerlagh 2004, 2007; Mehrara 2009; Zhang et al. 2008; Shao and Qi 2009a; Shao and Yang 2010; James and Aadland 2011). Further, Sachs and Warner (1999) and Sala-i-Martin and Subramanian (2003), among others, also pointed out the failure of governments to carry out efficient policies, bureaucratic efficiency, and institutional framework is contributing to the resource curse. In the other hand, the literature proposed a justification of the curse phenomenon which is deeply related to the capacity to manage resources exploitation and the quality of institutions. The relationships between the role of institutions and the resource curse can be dealt into two phases: where the quality of institutions is influenced by resource endowment and established the intermediate causal relationship among resources abundance and economic performance, and where resource abundance affected the quality of institutions. In addition, other justifications are closely linked to the absence of sufficient investments in the human aspects. In particular, Gylfason (2001) recorded the fact that the resource endowment generates the “crowding out” effect in terms of human capital accumulation, reducing the incentives for investments in education or knowledge sectors. In this spirit, Costantini and Monni (2008) included the human development and the institutional regulations as relevant variables in their analysis. Therefore, their highlights pointed out the importance of the human attainment and the institutional rules. On the other hand, the globalization element gives an additional outlook which must be scrutinized and directly linked to the institutional background and human attainment investments. An important lesson that emerges from the resource curse hypothesis is that, in practice, it appears that the prudent path of saving resource rent, maintaining sound environment quality, and enhancing human development has been difficult to achieve. In this current study, we attempt to investigate the validation of the resource curse hypothesis for 22 African countries during the time span 1990–2013. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first study that looks at the emerging problems of the African economy through the inclusion of the human development and the institutional dimensions as aspects of the sustainable development issue, in which they justify the occurrence of such dilemma based on the theory. Hence, each assumption generates a set of implications for the policymakers and researchers in the resource economics field. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: after the first section above, which portrayed the introduction, we look at the second section which exhaustively surveyed this controversial problem. “Empirical Background” portrays the data and the econometric method. “Empirical Results” presents and discusses the empirical findings. “Conclusion and Policy Implications” concludes the paper and provides some policy implications.",25

As food is one of the most fundamental human needs for survival, the food issue has occupied a privileged place in the major economic trends since the sixteenth century (the mercantilist period) (Turki Abdelhedi 2015). The debate on food security is centered on different factors that affect the availability, access, utilization, and stability of food. The literature review shows the impact of some determinants on food safety, the signs of which differ from one variable to another. In fact, Wossen and Berger (2015) examined the effect of the climate change and the instability of agricultural prices on food security and poverty in Northern Ghana. They used developed data of the research program on water and food of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). They applied the micro-simulation and an agent-based model to show that there is a negative relationship between price instability and household food security. However, the work of Zawnaung (2013) dealt with other determinants to fight hunger and poverty. Using a Computable General equilibrium model, the presented simulation results show that effective public investment is the only way to improve the food situation in Burkina Faso, particularly for the urban poor. These results are in conformity with the recommendations of international bodies, such as the IFPRI, FAO (FAO 2012). Using the VAR approach, Applanaidu et al. (2014) focused on the dynamic relationship between food security in Malaysia and macroeconomic variables, such as the biodiesel production, the exchange rate, the public expenditure, the GDP, the index of food prices, and population growth. These authors showed that the Food Price Index and population growth have a positive impact on the endogenous variable. However, biodiesel production will have, in the long-term, a negative impact on the Malaysian food security. This study suggests the need to direct more and more public spending on agriculture and rural development. Unlike most authors, Negash and Johan (2013) showed a positive impact of bio-fuel production, notably those based on castor oil, on food security in Ethiopia. Their investigation is based on data collected from about 478 rural households in the early 2011. The results of this survey showed that castor production significantly contributed to the increase of farmers’ food consumption. Using the economic model of general equilibrium GTAP, Anderson and Strutt (2014) projected the economy of China by 2030. These authors focused on the past policies of China as well as of other economies to evaluate the interventions of the government to ensure food security and income inequality concerns. In this regard, they suggested improving rural infrastructure and providing social safety nets. The originality of our work lies in the identification of the potential factors of food security in the North African region, as most of the previous research studies have not dealt with the African tissue at the regional level. As far as we know, the focus has been only on the following countries (Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Malaysia, China). The purpose of this paper is to set up a link between food security and agricultural development in North Africa in order to check the correlation between agriculture and food security in this region. As a result of the financial and food crisis of 2007–2008 and in the context of the “Arab spring,” with North Africa in socio-political upheaval, the population of this region has become more and more threatened by malnutrition. For this reason, we will try to present a theoretical literature review about the importance of the agricultural sector for the physiocrats and contemporary economists. Empirically, we will then limit ourselves to the panel data econometrics over a period running from 2000 to 2010 to check the correlation between agriculture and food security in this region (North Africa).",26

This “missing link” (Braunerhjelm et al. 2010) between knowledge generation by universities, private research institutions, and business services as well as its commercial implementation in firms and (regional) economies has become the central issue studied within the KSTE (see Acs et al. 2013 and Ghio et al. 2015 for extensive reviews of the literature). Among the central results of this line of research is the existence and effectiveness of systematic barriers to knowledge commercialization despite its potential profitability to firms and welfare-enhancing effects for regional economies. These barriers have been denoted as “knowledge filters,” and a number of studies have been conducted to determine effective ways of penetrating the various filters hindering the efficient flow of new information (see, e.g., Acs et al. 2004; Acs and Plummer 2005; Mueller 2006; Carlsson et al. 2009). The research on knowledge filter has primarily focused on technological start-ups close to universities and research facilities, as well as their effectiveness in commercializing knowledge. Overall, the perspective predominant in these studies is that entrepreneurs play the central role in commercializing new knowledge, while incumbent firms often tend to be structurally incapable of penetrating knowledge filter (Acs et al. 2009a, 2013; Audretsch and Keilbach 2007; Audretsch 1995). By contrast, building on Cohen and Levinthals’ (1990) and Qian and Acs’ (2013) consideration of firms’ absorptive capacities, Qian and Jung (2017) emphasize that incumbent firms can constitute a meaningful complement for the effective penetration of knowledge filters and should therefore be supported by policy-makers. This implies a shift of perspective: from improving conditions for entrepreneurs commercializing new knowledge in a specific innovative milieu to considering mechanisms supporting incumbents through designing institutions that aim at upholding and increasing absorptive capacities in firms and the overall workforce. I argue that this shift of the basic perspective has substantial advantages for the design of policies aiming at the effective penetration of knowledge filters by extending the analysis to innovation systems characterized by low entrepreneurial dynamics yet substantial innovative capacities, an aspect scarcely covered in previous cross-national studies of national innovation systems (e.g., Audretsch and Caiazza 2016; Acs et al. 2016). In those innovation systems, incumbent firms can be considered the central driver of sectoral innovation. More specifically, when building upon the research on comparative institutional advantages—namely the Varieties of Capitalism approach (Soskice and Hall 2001)—it can be stated that the focus on entrepreneurs commercializing R&D-based innovations tends to disregard the working mechanisms of many innovative processes in “coordinated market economies,” i.e., most continental European countries. In these innovation systems, firms are comparably long-lived with a highly specialized workforce, whose fluctuation between firms is impeded, e.g., by high wages and strong employment protection, which fosters firm-specific investments in workers’ qualification. Overall, this system leads to firms, particularly SMEs, pursuing incremental, in-firm innovations, and continuously improving on niche products; properties captured by the term “German Mittelstand” (Massis et al. 2017). Consequently, in coordinated economies, the implementation of new knowledge in many sectors is conducted by incumbents focusing on incremental, low-key innovations, which are developed and implemented in close cooperation with customers and suppliers instead of formal R&D (Thomae 2017; EFI 2016; Jensen et al. 2007). To succeed in this specific innovation mode, firms rely on a high degree of absorptive capacity. Therefore, innovation policy in the respective countries and sectors does not primarily aim at increasing overall entrepreneurship to foster knowledge transfers. Rather, policy-makers are faced with the question of how to build, maintain, and improve institutions that succeed in increasing incumbents’ absorptive capacities. This paper’s goal is to describe and analyze institutional mechanisms capable of systematically penetrating knowledge filters and fostering absorptive capacities in firms without direct links to the knowledge production. While based upon the example of a specific German sector, patterns are identified that are transferrable to other countries and economic contexts. This research goal resembles and—to some extent—complements Massis et al.’s approach of broadly describing the “German Mittelstand innovation model” and providing transferrable implications for other economic contexts, albeit with a more specific focus on the issue of knowledge transfer. This is achieved by conducting an in-depth investigation into a typical sector of German SMEs characterized by the traits described above and providing a broad description of its institutional setup in terms of knowledge spillovers. Given the holistic nature of the research question, a qualitative approach is chosen, namely the analysis of 177 in-depth interviews with firm representatives. The interview protocols are coded and a quantitative descriptive analysis and a qualitative analysis of the institutional mechanisms at play are conducted. Thus, the institutions, entrepreneurial values, regulations, organizations, and economic incentives are described that systematically support knowledge spillovers to incumbents in the German Mittelstand. Building upon these results, I derive policy implications applicable to other national innovation systems and sectors concerned with implementing incremental innovations and give propositions for the further study of knowledge filters in the context of the KSTE. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In the second section, the theoretical context of this study is explained, while the third section describes the methodology and interview data. The fourth section presents the quantitative descriptive results (the “Descriptive results” section) as well as the qualitative analysis (the “Qualitative results” section) and an ensuing discussion with policy implications (the “Discussion and policy implications” section), before the final section concludes.",12

Knowledge is seen as one of the most unique success factors that organizations are to own and manage (Raudeliūnienė et al. 2016). Similar to the significance of technologies and mechanical machines during the industrial revolution, knowledge creation, knowledge management, and organizational innovations will play the pivotal role in the future of businesses (Drucker 1993; Attour and Barbaroux 2016). The creation and acquisition of knowledge as well as its efficient utilization will be for utmost need for maintaining or achieving the leading edge in successful markets (Yagi 2014). Under these conditions, it makes perfect sense to talk about successful products as being the coordinated and reified knowledge of some production enterprise. Knowledge creation and knowledge management is recognized to be of paramount importance to the competitive advantage of organizations in the current post-modern and global eon. Throughout the last two decades, a new range of improved business philosophies, approaches, and methodologies has been continuously developed (e.g., Bocken et al. 2014; Carlborg et al. 2014; Spieth et al. 2014). This development has been largely based on various combinations of business practices, management perspectives, and subject-related research. Examples of these approaches are innumerable and include organizational learning (Schilling and Fang 2014), total quality management (TQM) (Dale 2015), business process re-engineering (BPR) (Vakola and Rezgui 2000), quality circles (QCs) (Prado 2001), and so on. More recently, especially in the last decade, Knowledge Management (KM) has started to emerge as an area of interest in academia and corporate worlds (Gupta et al. 2000; Ahmad et al. 2017). There exists a rapidly increasing body of literature relating to KM (Kakabadse et al. 2003; Liao 2003), which cross level and cross-link many different disciplines and areas of interest to academics and organizational practitioners, especially those areas in which knowledge serves as a common factor or input, on a parity with labor, capital, and so on (Mariano et al. 2016; Omotayo 2015), being while a knowledge that is put in context and incurred to and from organizations and what could be referred to as corporate milieus. Many important questions and issues arise in regard to KM; most of them focus on the short- and long-term benefits that a business could exploit from the expertise of its specialists, produced in differing forms (i.e., prototypes, services, products, models) and derived from the knowledge creating crew (Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995). In this context, KM is important because it is assumed to increase the ability of an enterprise to find and act on the information that its employees already know. This type of KM is said to provide one of the only sustainable competitive and comparative advantages in the current global economy, being based on existing knowledge. Under this umbrella, the scope of KM may also include efforts and research to nurture the people, processes, and tools that enable an enterprise to invent new business and technical expertise. Examples of new business and technical expertise include satellite constellations (e.g., Disaster Monitoring Constellation created and managed by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd). If both dimensions (business and technical expertise) of knowledge management could be achieved and leveraged, an enterprise may envisage having durable comparative and competitive advantages. In terms of business and technical expertise, attempts to manage knowledge may occur by examining its diffusion (Kreng and Tsai 2003; Quaddus and Xub 2005; Bradley et al. 2006), through patents for instance (MacGarvie 2005). We have focused on an empirical base for the conduct of the research contained herein, to portray in a novel way how knowledge diffusion may take place in the form of specialist text (i.e., collections of commercial and research documents) amid knowledge workers (i.e., employees depending on specialist domain knowledge). Specifically, this research proposes a novel KM model of organizational cartography and applies it to empirically investigate the creation of new technical knowledge, and in particular how it diffuses (flow as well as adaptation), when text is chosen as the currency (symbol of exchange) for communicating descriptions of such specialist knowledge. Synthesizing elements from prior KM models, the proposed KM model aims to automatically acquire, visually represent, and collectively reason on textual content contained, thus conceptualizing a computationally mediated model to support knowledge acquisition and diffusion in organizations. Based on this model, we explore KM processes in the area of research and development ventures, particularly satellite engineering, that may require a cooperative and computer mediated environment. A multi-method approach using quantitative and qualitative data collated from Surrey Space Centre in line with a set of refereed and industry-related research. Forming the basis for the direction of this research, we adopt case study research theories for an observational study within an organization and analyze some of the specialist text stemming from it and its environment, in pursuit of grounding whether small to medium enterprises (SMEs) create dynamics of innovation. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Next section reviews prior literature related to existing KM models for knowledge diffusion. The “A KM Model of Organizational Cartography” section proposes a KM model of organizational cartography focusing on knowledge creation and diffusion. The “Empirical study” section presents our empirical study as an application of the proposed model. The last section concludes the paper.",

This transformation also concerns the economic performance of knowledge workers (hereafter: KW)—persons who are defined by, inter alia, their capacity to perform non-routine tasks, their high levels of education, and their use of information and communications technologies (ICTs) at work (Brinkley 2006; Pyöriä 2007). Because of their impact on economic performance, KWs are increasingly included in organizational strategic plans for improving productivity (Ramírez and Nembhard 2004, p. 602). In fact, authors like Drucker (2007) and Holtskog (2015) claim that KW productivity is a major management challenges of the twenty-first century. The characteristics of job and work environments affect many activities people engage in, also in non-work-related domains. In general, job satisfaction is related to overall life satisfaction: indeed, the relationship seems to go both ways (Frey and Stutzer 2010). Moreover, job characteristics are closely related to health status. Thus, there will be less cost to employers and society, as well as greater productivity, if employers take into account the factors that contribute to worker satisfaction (Brinkley et al. 2010). This leads us to ask: Do KWs differ from OWs with regard to what determines their work satisfaction? This article investigates the connections between knowledge work and job satisfaction in countries of the European Union. Despite the substantial body of research on job satisfaction, this sector has received limited attention in the empirical literature. Research has shown that KWs are allowed to exercise considerable autonomy and discretion in performing their tasks; moreover, they have better job security and higher wages than other kinds of workers (Huang 2011; Tampoe 1993). The latter are all factors consistently associated with greater job satisfaction (Torrent-Sellens et al. 2016; Wilczyńska et al. 2016). However, the literature has failed to inquire into other job characteristics related to work intensity, work organization and work–life balance, and their relevance for job satisfaction. This study fills a gap in the literature by investigating whether KWs differ from OWs with regard to what determines their satisfaction at work. We focus on variables addressing five conceptual dimensions: financial job characteristics, work organization, work intensity, working conditions, and work–life balance. Using data from 21 EU countries in the European Social Survey (2010), we apply multiple binary logistic regression models to test our hypotheses. Results indicate clear differences between KWs and OWs with regard to predictors of job satisfaction. Among KWs, job satisfaction is better explained by non-financial aspects than by monetary reward. Further, factors linked to career advancement opportunities, flexible work schedules, and work-to-family conflict emerge as more relevant in explaining job satisfaction among KWs than OWs in this EU sample. The article is structured as follows: [1] we describe the underlying literature background: studies on knowledge work and its relationships with job satisfaction; [2] we outline the characteristics of the European Social Survey (2010) and the data used in this article; [3] we develop the research hypotheses; [4] we present the empirical model and describe its main results; [5] we discuss our findings and offer some conclusions.",15

It is strictly linked with a human asset as the most critical source in organizations. Social capital provides a suitable context for exploitation and productivity of human resources in different organizations. The importance of studying social capital increasing while manipulating of other types of organizational capital is depended on it also. Social capital is the set of norms present in social systems that promote the level of cooperation of its members and reduce the level of costs of exchanges and communications (Field 2008; Quigley 1996). Even the social capital is favorable leverage in organizations and plays a much more significant role than physical, human capital and other components. It also provides an appropriate context for corporations to gain more effectiveness (Edwards 2010). Rapid changes in today’s organizations, including increasing international communications, price reduction rates, rising competition, and the widespread use of technology, have led to more competition and predetermined increasing pressure on the processes for fundamental changes in organizations and management (Chen and Hsieh 2006). Over the past few decades, IT has had a great deal of impact on the success and performance of many societies. Organizations and individuals in parallelism to the dramatic advances made in this regard, the fate of communities, organizations, and people are increasingly getting connected to this modern technology every day more than before. Apparently, in such a situation, recognition of the impact of IT has become increasingly important (Cannella Jr. 2005). The use of information and communication technology has led to an increase in employees’ knowledge and awareness as well as a richer job content (Legris et al. 2003). Managers of organizations, by recognizing the characteristics of social capital and by creating more organizational coherence among employees, cause a higher level of sharing and facilitating the flow of information and improve the efficiency of collective activities by increasing the empowerment of employees in the organization. In a corporation that suffers lacks social capital and IT capabilities, other capital remains low and dwindle. Social capital is changeable to other forms of capital, and its preservation and reproduction need time investment and money investment for socialization (Righi 2013). From managing human relationships, it should be considered that these relations are not the only sources of critical elements in organizations which are necessary for administration, but also the cultural, social, economic, and political environment in which it operates is crucial. Interaction and collaboration are an integral part of humanity which in the present century, man feels that he needs it sooner and nowadays it is conceptualized in the form of social capital (Westlund and Larsson 2016). Empowering human resources based on social capital and IT is a new way of managing predictable organizations in more complex and competitive world. Social capital is a manageable phenomenon that can be used with right policies in organizations for facilitation and coordination of employees in the organization and achievements of interest at a micro- and macro-level (Westlund and Larsson 2016). Social capital and IT play a very crucial role in the coherence between human resource and organization performances, and in its absence, other capitals lose their effectiveness; furthermore, in such situation, human resources cannot evolve, develop, and act more efficiently (Huysman and Wulf 2004). As banks and financial institutions are socio-economic units, they should be able to focus on the development of their social capital and IT capabilities to carry out affairs. In this way, they can perform more and qualified activities because these two assets are one of the critical organizational strengths that can help them to create and share knowledge and provide a corporate advantage. This research attempts to identify the factors that mediate the effects of organizational social capital on the performance of individuals, and with this aim, IT role as a crucial mediator was considered deeply. Financial institutions selected as a case study because they entirely rely on human capabilities and IT infrastructure to accomplish missions. Interpretive structural modeling (ISM) was used to extract the relationship among research primary factors, and by developing a model of the relationship between them, the causal relationships and their role were described. For this purpose, a group of practical financial institute experts was invited to identify the main factors intermediate the social capital and individual performance relationships. After that by snowball sampling method, managers and experts among financial institutes selected to answer the questionnaires. Research results may help organization decision-makers to examine the nature and intensity of the relationship between the status of social capital and the increasing effects on individual performance, and in this regard, consider the role of IT as a facilitator. After answering the research questions, some suggestions provided for future research.",

These external effects are called technology, or knowledge, diffusion (Keller 2004). Contrary to the understanding of an exogenously given technological progress held by the neoclassical theory, this argument paves the way for a room for economic policy that aims at raising the domestic knowledge stock by encouraging the domestic R&D sector and by promoting the absorption capacity of foreign knowledge, i.e., promoting the ability of domestic agents to recognize the value of new, external information; assimilate it; and apply it to commercial ends (Cohen and Levinthal 1990 and Liang 2008). In the literature on the existence of knowledge externalities, the commonly held argument is that domestic production and productivity growth depend, not only on the accumulation of the domestic R&D capital, but also on the R&D activities upheld externally, put it differently on the R&D capital stocks of its partners. It can be either through the means of imitation-enhancing in which imperfectly protected codified knowledge ends up being imitated by the domestic firms or through the means of idea-creating based on the premise that the accumulated knowledge stock is a primary input factor in the production of new technologies or ideas by the domestic firms (Seck 2012). On the measurement side, the approaches developed to measure technology diffusion differ in accordance with (i) the dimensions of technology they aim to measure and (ii) the level at which they try to measure diffusion (Comin and Mestieri 2014). In the empirical sphere, in contrast to a plentiful literature on total import-weighted technology diffusion at country level, a very limited literature is contributed for fleshing the diffusion of technology out by grounding on specific sectors, i.e., high-technology sectors. Acknowledging that it is dramatically high-technology sectors, e.g., software and computer service sectors, on which the R&D investments are concentrated, it becomes crucial to answer to what extent the technology benefits are gained by a country from the trade of certain process or product-oriented innovations of its foreign partners. In this regard, in our study, we specify the foreign R&D capital stock as the capital goods imports weighted by R&D intensity of the trading partner in the computer industry. Besides, the level of technology is measured at sectorial level. That is, it is expressed as the output produced in the computer industry. By doing so, we contribute to the existing literature in a way that both the output obtained from the computer, electronic, and optical industries and R&D expenditures on the same industries are used together in the analysis. It accordingly assessed the impact of both foreign and domestic R&D expenditures in computer, electronic, and optical equipment sectors on total domestic income received from the production of computer and its by-products based on the methodology suggested by Lichtenberg and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie (2001). This provides us, in turn, to see whether the argument that the domestic sector will reap more technology diffusion when it imports relatively more from the countries that invest more in R&D in the same sectors holds for the case of computer, electronic, and optical industry. It is used a panel of 18 countries over the period 1999–2011. The analysis is also extended by explicating the diffusion of computer technology stemming from particular geographical locations, i.e., from Asia and USA. In the rest of the paper, a brief literature review on diffusion of technology is given. Then, the sectorial data and empirical framework used are introduced, respectively. “Results” provides the estimation results. In the last section, we conclude.",

Since the 1970s, the ability to transfer information and knowledge has grown to be perceived as a crucial source of competitive advantage for companies in achieving success (Arrow 1974). As a consequence, knowledge management (and related topics) has been a subject of intensive scholarly interest focused on organizational learning as a cognitive process or as a function of behavioral change, adapting vision, goals, or decision rules of a company (Borgatti and Cross 2003; Caputo 2016; Del Guidice et al. 2016). During the last 40 years, multiple shifts of interest in knowledge management happened related to what is to be managed, controlled, or designed. Each of these shifts was connected to new challenges, perspectives, theories, and tools, whose purpose was to support and increase growth and performance of companies. Each of these shifts brought another layer of complexity into the organizational analysis, and also increased the scope of the analysis itself—from individual tasks through cooperation between people to organizations as a whole. Current computational performance and analytical tools allow us not only to analyze interaction within whole companies but also among networks of cooperating companies or online communities (virtual organizations) consisting of hundreds or thousands of people (Zanetti et al. 2012). Interaction between people creates structure and patterns. Understanding these patterns can be used for acquiring deeper insight about the nature of the cooperation, with possible implications for knowledge management and organizational intelligence, which is the aim of the current work. At the same time, organizations with hundreds of employees produce thousands of interactions every day. It is above the human cognitive capacity to fully conceive such amount of information, and, on the top of that, it is conceptually impossible to properly understand patterns of interaction without global perspective. While some patterns are obvious and part of a “common sense,” other patterns can be well hidden in the social fabric, yet important, valuable, and quite surprising—once revealed. We need to use a tool to obtain unbiased understanding of interaction patterns in an organization. The complex networks analysis is a suitable tool that allows to achieve such goal. Best to our knowledge, the current literature applying complex networks analysis (or, interchangeably, social network analysis) in knowledge management lacks a work that would provide a summarization or an overview of existing findings. Moreover, past studies are often descriptive in nature, finding relationships between phenomena. When it comes to practical implications, i.e., how can we make use of these findings to improve knowledge flow in an organization, it is usually up to a reader to deduce. In this paper, we have decided to address these two issues by (a) summarizing existing literature and (b) formulating specific suggestions that may improve knowledge flow in an organization. We have formulated these suggestions by reviewing results and discussions of existing literature, combined with our domain knowledge and experience. The paper is organized as follows: the “Historical Overview” section provides brief summary of historic evolution of main topic related to knowledge management up to present day. The “Towards Network Analysis for Intelligent Organizations” section introduces the network approach as a conceptual framework. The “Complex Network Analysis” section presents basic principles of collection and analysis of complex network data. The “Suggestions for Knowledge Management” section is aimed on concrete applications of network analysis for knowledge management and organizational intelligence. The paper concludes with the “Conclusion” section where future directions of research are also discussed.",33

Due to the increasing complexity of technology and markets, organizations cannot develop all required knowledge internally and therefore aim to collaborate with external actors. In particular, knowledge collaboration between universities and businesses has received considerable attention. Since the 1990s, the mainstream understanding of knowledge collaboration has shifted from a linear process (frequently termed as “Mode 1” or ivory tower) towards an iterative inter-organizational collaboration process. Researchers such as Gibbons et al. (1994) and Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz (1998) have proposed two knowledge collaboration models that explain the role of different organizational types in the collaborative production and utilization of knowledge. These are the Mode 2 and Triple Helix models respectively. In Mode 2, knowledge production focuses solely on applicability. It is context-driven and problem focused. Universities play a subordinate role in innovation systems compared to business firms, and are hence said to be on the “demise” path. Gibbons et al. (1994) contested the ivory tower knowledge production for linear innovation processes and concluded that production of new knowledge takes place outside the loci and disciplines of universities. In the Triple Helix modelFootnote 1 (THm) (Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz 1998), knowledge production focuses on the simultaneous interaction of theoretical, practical, and legislative knowledge of several organizational types. The university in THm plays the role of a “salient” actor that is central in innovation systems. These opposing views call for evidence to further identify the role of universities in knowledge development through collaboration. Should universities be allocated more or fewer collaboration opportunities? Should collaboration consortia involving more universities be valued more or valued less? This paper explores the differences of the two models and empirically investigates their relevance to identify the role of universities in the context of the European Framework Programmes. The role of universities in knowledge production and innovation systems (Edquist 2010) has been studied in the context of public-private research partnerships (Stiglitz and Wallsten 1999), agents of national economic competitiveness (Greenaway and Haynes 2000), patenting and licensing agents (Nelson 2001), and entrepreneurial academe (Mavi 2014) and led to different views on the relevance of universities in knowledge production and utilization. These different views are mainly based on conceptual debates rather than empirical investigations. They impose profound political implications (see, e.g., Carayannis and Campbell 2011; Schoonmaker and Carayannis 2013) on the role of universities in knowledge collaboration networks. “Generally, scientists are oriented towards the reputation-based reward system of open science, while industry scientists face the commercial imperative to produce exploitable results” (Perkman and Walsh, 2007 p.273). Consequently, the authors called for further empirical research on whether knowledge collaboration is affected by organizational types. Furthermore, considerable research has been conducted on knowledge collaboration in business alliances, B&B, (Hagedoorn et al. 2000) and in university-industry alliances, U&B, (Florida and Cohen 1999). However, little attention has focused on university and university (U&U) knowledge collaboration relationships. This can be attributed to the financial and strategic aspects of these types of inter-organizational relationships. U&B and B&B relationships are perceived as more financially substantive compared to U&U relationships. U&B and B&B knowledge collaborations are also perceived to be strategically more critical than U&U relationships, due to the possible unintended spillover of strategic knowledge (e.g., trade secrets) to competitors. Examples of U&U collaboration include co-authorship, co-patenting, academic mobility, collaborative teaching (e.g., transnational student exchange programs), and transnational support for innovation and technology transfer (e.g., international incubation). U&U collaboration also occurs in development programs by national, regional, or supranational authorities (Stiglitz and Wallsten 1999), for example, the Framework Programmes (FPs) for Research and Technological Development of the European Union (Caloghirou et al. 2001). Although there is ample literature on organizational learning and knowledge management, the nature of knowledge collaboration behavior between universities remains mostly unexplored and poorly understood (Bock et al. 2005; Milne 2007). We argue that various organizational-level factors have an effect on knowledge collaboration and that these depend on organizational type, e.g., university, business, and government. Therefore, organizational type may explain variations in the extent of inter-organizational knowledge collaboration. Our main research question is: do universities differ from business-orientedFootnote 2 organization types in the extent of their knowledge collaboration? We measure the extent of knowledge collaboration by its manifestations: (1) extent of involvement in group discussions; (2) extent of development of new ideas/skills due to collaboration; and (3) extent of learning to exchange ideas/skills (adopted from Davenport and Prusak 1998 and Muthusamy and White 2005). The empirical examination of the two competing models assists evidence-based decision-making by all organization types: universities and businesses in partner selection, consortia in formation decisions, and governmental organizations in the resource allocation and division of labor. We aim to answer the research question at two levels: At an organizational level, do universities have more extensive knowledge collaboration than business organizations? At an inter-organizational level, does a university and university relationship type have more extensive inter-organizational knowledge collaboration than a business and business relationship type? The next section describes the theoretical framework of inter-organizational knowledge collaboration. We examine the differences in organizational logic of a university versus a business-oriented organization and formulate our hypotheses. In the “Method” section, we describe our method, data source, and operationalization. The “Results” section reports the empirical results. The “Limitations and Implications” section concludes.",6
11.0,2.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,19 July 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-018-0546-9,"Economic Growth, Environment, FDI Inflows, and Financial Development in Middle East Countries: Fresh Evidence from Simultaneous Equation Models",June 2020,Mohamed Abdouli,Sami Hammami,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"It is known that economic growth and foreign direct investments are the most important factors which contribute to the environmental degradation of any country (Abdouli and Hammami 2016a, b). Foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows can provide direct funding capital to generate positive externalities to stimulate economic growth through technology transfer, productivity gains, and the introduction of new processes and managerial skills (Lee 2013). In addition, FDI inflows contribute to the financial development in host countries; this implies that FDI causes an increase in funds available to the financial system. Hence, these funds contribute to the development in financial markets, as well as the latter promoting economic growth (Levine 1997; Sahin and Ege 2015). In turn, it is also argued that foreign firms can use financial services for overdraft facilities, loans, or payments to their suppliers of intermediate goods (King and Levine 1993; Doherty et al. 2003; Alfaro et al. 2008, Al Nasser and Gomez 2009). In contrast, the increase of economic growth and FDI inflows leads to impede the environmental quality (Omri et al. 2014). Therefore, a better understanding of the complex interactions between environmental quality, FDI inflows, economic growth, and financial development should be the basis of developing sound economic policies (Abdouli and Hammami 2016a, b). The causal relationship between FDI inflows, environment, economic growth, and financial development has important policy implications based on the following four strands. First, if the causality between FDI inflows, economic growth, and financial development is a bidirectional causality, then FDI inflows contribute to the financial development; this implies that FDI causes an increase in funds available to the financial system. Hence, these funds contribute to the development in financial markets, as well as the latter promoting economic growth. In its turn, the latter sends positive signals to attract further FDI (e.g., King and Levine 1993; Tsai 1994; Doherty et al. 2003; Nguyen and Nguyen 2007; Alfaro et al. 2008, Tang et al. 2008; Al Nasser and Gomez 2009; Klasra 2009; Adams 2009; Anwar and Nguyen 2010; Saini et al. 2010; Ahmadi and Ghanbarzadeh 2011a, b; Omri and Kahouli 2014). Second, the existence of a bidirectional causality between economic growth and CO2 emissions (feedback effect) implies that the increase of CO2 emissions may adversely affect economic growth and vice versa. Then, the environmental degradation levels increase as a country develops but decrease when a certain level of average income is reached (environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis) (e.g., Friedl and Getzner 2003; Richmond and Kaufmann 2006; Managi and Jena 2008; Fodha and Zaghdoud 2010; Wang et al. 2011; Saboori et al. 2012; Rawshan et al. 2014; Omri et al. 2015). Third, the relationship between foreign direct investment and CO2 emissions implies that foreign direct investment is one of the most important causes of environmental degradation, in turn, the increase of CO2 emissions encourages FDI inflows (e.g., Shur and Jorgenson 2007; Acharyya 2009; Zhang 2011; Ming-Qing and Jia 2011; Mizan and Burhan 2012; Kahouli and Kadhraoui 2012; Lee 2013; Omri et al. 2014; Lau et al. 2014). Finally, concerning the relationship between financial development and CO2 emissions, the financial sector may provide higher financing at lower costs. This is also true for investment in environmental projects (Tamazian et al. 2009; Shahbaz et al. 2013a, b, c; Boutabba 2014). By contrast, the increase of financial development leads to an increase in CO2 emissions. This implies that prosperous and efficient financial intermediation seems conducive in helping the economic output to expand which results in more energy consumption and buying big ticket items like automobiles, houses, refrigerators, air conditioners, and washing machines, which cause higher CO2 emissions (Sadorsky 2011; Zhang 2011). So, we can conclude the following relationships: (i) a causal relationship emanating from FDI and CO2 emissions to gross domestic product (GDP); (ii) a causal relationship between GDP and CO2 emissions affecting FDI; (iii) GDP and FDI on CO2; (iv) a bidirectional relationship between FDI, CO2 emissions, and GDP; and (v) no causal relationship between FDI and CO2 and GDP and financial development (neutrality). The present study is different from the previous studies in the following way. First, this paper uses simultaneous-equation modeling to study the four-way linkages between FDI inflows, CO2 emissions, economic growth, and financial development in a panel consisting of 12 Middle Eastern countries. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, none of the empirical studies have focused on investigating the FDI-CO2-GDP growth-financial development links by using simultaneous-equation modeling with a growth rate in each country and in all countries. This model enables us to examine the interrelationship between economic growth, FDI, CO2 emissions, and financial development at the same time. Specifically, this study uses a model made up of four structural equations that allow us to examine the simultaneous influence of (i) the FDI inflows, CO2 emissions, and financial development on economic growth; (ii) the economic growth, CO2 emissions, and financial development on FDI inflows; and (iii) the economic growth on FDI and financial development on CO2 emissions; and (vi) the FDI, CO2 emissions, and economic growth on financial development. Our approach in this study is to estimate short-term elasticities and not to estimate long-term ones, taking into account our growth rate in the modeling approach. The paper is organized as follows. The next section describes briefly the reviews the related to literature. Section “Methodology and data” outlines the econometric modeling approach, describes the used data and descriptive statistics. Section “Results and discussions” reports and discusses the empirical results. Section “Conclusion and policy implications” concludes the article and offers some policy implications.",35

Tunisia achieved an average growth of 5% until 2009. However, back to 2010, Tunisian economic situation has been worrying, and actually Tunisia knows a serious economic crisis. The revolution did not cause this crisis but was responsible for its magnitude. Obviously, Tunisia transition affected the fundamentals of the Tunisian economy. For example, the Ministry of FinanceFootnote 1 announced that Tunisian budget deficit reached 6.9% of GDP in 2013, 5.1% in 2014 and 4.9% in 2015. It is important to note that in its economic history, Tunisia has experienced two other skids in addition to that following Ben Ali departure in January 2010. The first is associated to the social event of the “Black Thursday” of January 26, 1978, the second events with “bread crisis” in 1988 under the government of Mzali. In order to avoid such disruptions, countries should implement appropriate monetary or fiscal policies.Footnote 2 In fact, one of the key instruments through which the state exercises its influence is through fiscal policy. However, fiscal policy is constrained by the need to finance budget deficits. In fact, the deficit has to be sustainable, that is, the government is able to pay the interest on the debt. Therefore, the sustainability of fiscal policy is the solvency of the government. According to this mechanism, Tunisia adopted a fiscal policy stimulus after the failure of its monetary policy. Anyway “Monetary policy adopted by Tunisia showed its limits” estimated the former governor. After the revolution, the central bank and the government have diagnosed that the cause of the crisis was a breakdown in demand. Thus, expansionary policy, which is known as the “go and stop”, previously adopted by the United State Roosevelt after the 1930 recession, is adopted to revive the economy by increasing the demand. This leads to increased supply and therefore the recovery of the economy. This type of policy adopted in Tunisia requires compliance with three principles: first increase or “go” and temporary “stop” of public spending, then a targeting of spending especially investment, and finally respect for the debt solvency constraint in the medium term. Then, the aim of this paper is to study the sustainability of Tunisia’s fiscal deficit considering the political transition period. At our knowledge, it is the first study which focuses on the solvency of Tunisian government integrating this period. Economic literature has shown that fiscal deficits have initially been considered a purely macroeconomic phenomenon. However, in 1980, because of the emergence of political economy, the researchers examined the issue from both economic prospects and policies. Indeed, democratic transitions and fiscal policies have been the subject of several studies (Cammett et al. 2015; Diwan and Akin 2015; Neaime 2010 and 2015) and theoretical reflections nourished by different experience since the “carnation revolution” in Portugal and Greece to democratic transitions in Latin America and in Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Studies of these international experiences indicate that the transition process is uncertain and nonlinear and that the first decisions determine the nature of the path that the country would take. In addition, Chihi and Normandin (2013) establish positive comovements between external and budget deficits in a sample of developing countries from the 1960s onward. The both debt variables are also related to the debt rescheduling and default crises seen in Latin America, particularly in the 1980s, which coincide with some of the most severe political and economic shocks that the region has suffered in recent times (Sachs et al. 1985; Bittencourt 2015). MENA region and especially Tunisia remained mostly untouched by the wave of democratization that was initiated in Latin America in the late 70s, spread to Asia and Southern and Eastern Europe in the 90s and finally to some parts of sub Saharan Africa. The Arab Spring ignited some change in the region, but there is uncertainty regarding the scope, the pace, and the durability of the political transitions. Our study is therefore to the heart of many debates on the budget deficit and the democratic transition. The purpose of this paper is to study the sustainability of the budget deficit in Tunisia with a special focus on the impact of its political transition. The changes of regimes in Tunisia are an important point in our work. In fact, Tunisia as all other countries goes through political changes over time. Considering the “Polity score,” governing authority spans from fully institutionalized autocracies through mixed, or incoherent, authority regimes (termed “anocracies”) to fully institutionalized democracies.Footnote 3 In addition, for a long period, Tunisia realized sustained growth and Tunisian budget deficit achieved 3% of GDP in 2009 and 1% of GDP until 2010. Nevertheless, since its Arab Spring Revolution of 2011, the budget deficit reached a record level (5.5% of GDP in 2012 and 6.9% of GDP in 2013 and 6% of GDP in 2016), mainly financed by large external debts. Diwan and Akin (2015) focus on MENA region over a period of 50 years and study how spending and resources have evolved according to political change period. In fact, there is a link between democratic transition, political change and the change in government debt. Furthermore, the main indirect impact of political economy regime on fiscal accounts relate to the growth of the informal sector and low growth in the formal economy, which negatively influenced revenue. Similarly, one of the main factors of “fiscal bulge” is the political factor with the socialist regimes of the 50s which has been gradually replaced by regimes that implemented market liberalization reforms and who sought the political support of the business elite and of the middle class instead of their traditional constituencies of farmers, workers, and civil servants. However, this study is purely descriptive. The study of Ehrhart and Llorca (2008) examines the future prospects associated with fiscal policy while drawing on a retrospective analysis of the question of the sustainability of fiscal policy in Tunisia in a period from 1962 to 1997. This policy budget appears unsustainable, both in the short and long terms. This, rather pessimistic, it leads rather to advocate a further strategy to reduce public spending. As well, the study of Neaime (2010) analyzed sustainability of fiscal policy in the MENA region in the period 1960 to 2009. The empirical results have pointed to strong sustainability of fiscal policies in Tunisia in this period. So, Tunisia’s fiscal discipline over this decade has proven to be instrumental in maintaining sound fiscal policies and in keeping debt and budget deficits well under control. Note that, these last two studies used the econometric approach (i.e., the stationarity and cointegration study). Belguith and Gabsi (2017) studied the dynamics of public debt in Tunisia and showed his correspondence with budget deficits registered between 1986 and 2000. He examined the sustainability of fiscal policy in this period from an “accounting approach” and traces the main lines of a more active management of the public debt. The present study will review recent approaches used by fiscal sustainability analysis and will apply them to the case of Tunisia for the period 1970–2015. In fact, the literature on developed countries is large and growing; however, studies on the sustainability of fiscal policies on Tunisia are still very rare. This study, therefore, adds to the limited literature on developing countries by focusing, for the first time at our knowledge, on the issue of fiscal policy sustainability in the Tunisia considering the political transition period. To do this, we propose a sustainability analysis based on a retrospective analysis. In this analysis, sustainability is considered by an econometric approach and an accounting approach. More specifically, the econometric approach presents a global analysis of sustainability while the accounting approach expose a yearly analysis which will allow us to examine the budget sustainability before and after 2011. This paper is divided into two sections. We realize in section 1 the study of sustainability by the econometric method. We first study the stationarity of both debt and public deficit ratios on the one hand, and cointegration series of revenues and expenses on the other hand. Then, the second section is first devoted to the accounting study of sustainability. Then, we review the relationship between the fiscal crisis and the political crisis in a descriptive analysis. Finally, we make conclusions.",

Ferreira,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Innovation became recently a keyword in strategic management at both micro- and macro-level. Its importance has been studied extensively showing its significant positive impact on growth, competitiveness, and productivity (Hasan and Tucci 2010; Andersson et al. 2016). Following the broad discussion regarding economic benefits of innovation, governments around the world have seen innovation policies as crucial instruments to meet the common objectives of increasing growth, productivity, and competitiveness. As a response to the trend and a way to stimulate economic growth in the time of crisis, the new European Union (EU) strategy—Europe 2020—aims at creation of a knowledge-intensive economy and decreasing innovation gap between Europe, USA, and Japan. Smart specializations are one of the main instruments integrated into the EU policy framework designed to reach that objective. Smart specialization is a policy framework providing a methodology for definition of national and regional strategies in science, technology, and innovation. It is a crucial document providing a roadmap for EU policy makers in the area of innovation. As a key document defining public investment areas, it is expected to strongly influence the shape and direction of EU community, its competitiveness and position in the global economy. Taking into account the fragile, requiring austerity, economic situation of the EU, it is crucial to understand if the framework can effectively stimulate growth and lead EU economy out of the crisis. Literature suggests that due to a decision about its rapid implementation, the concept, its assumptions, and practical aspects were not studied sufficiently before its introduction (Foray et al. 2011). Lack of good understanding of the strategy among stakeholders (Komninos et al. 2014) can lead to misinterpretations of the concept and its objectives, as well as to resistance to its implementation (Hitt et al. 2015). Without a clear vision of the framework and its good understanding among policy makers and other stakeholders, the framework’s potential to reach its objectives will be limited. Due to the importance of smart specializations, too limited amount of studies (Foray et al. 2011), and a common confusion around the issue (Komninos et al. 2014), there is a high need to explore the concept and support its better understanding among European stakeholders and beyond. Therefore, the paper provides policy analysis examining the smart specialization policy framework, its conceptual basis, basic assumptions, and current developments in the field, to reach conclusions regarding its real potential to stimulate innovation and innovation-based growth. It specifically looks to answer two research questions: (1) what is the position of the smart specialization framework and its impact within EU innovation system and (2) what are the strengths and weaknesses of the framework. It provides two specific outcomes: (i) a conceptual model that will allow users to systematize the position of smart specializations within the EU innovation system and understand interdependencies within the system and (ii) implications for policy makers that can support them to overcome the weaknesses identified within the study. To provide quality implications, we are looking into theoretical and practical contributions and currently defined smart specializations to define which potential risks for the framework has been effectively addressed and which require significant attention and adjustments. This policy analysis shows the framework high potential to foster growth and competitiveness of the EU. Analyses of previous research and, currently declared at the regional level, smart specializations show that there is a strong discrepancy between the theory and practice. The suggested by the analysis lack of understanding or acceptance of the concept causes a risk of the strategy failure, due to three issues: (1) non-systematic approach to the specializations selection, (2) common duplication of smart specializations, and (3) high-level approach to specifying the investment directions in the regions. Therefore, EU authorities need to ensure policy makers re-education in the area and awareness and capacity building process to make smart specializations an effective tool to stimulate the EU growth and increase its competitiveness. To mitigate development gaps and stimulate global smart growth of EU economy, especially support for lagging regions in the process is of high importance. To reach the study objectives, the paper is divided into five sections. Following the introduction, the “Smart Specializations and Its Framework” section discusses the smart specialization policy, its framework, and presents a conceptual model of smart specialization position within EU economy. It specifically aims to define the position of smart specialization within the EU innovation system and significant interdependencies. The “Smart Specialization—Policy ANALYSIS” section focuses on analysis of the policy framework strengths and weaknesses, while the “Current Developments” section provides analysis of defined by the regions smart specializations and their relation to the smart specialization methodology to verify and extend conclusions from the “Smart Specialization—Policy ANALYSIS” section. The “Conclusions and Implications” section provides conclusions from the study and their policy implications.",5

Bayighomog Likoum,Mohamed Dawood Shamout,A. Mohammed Abubakar,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The strategic management and resource-based theory (RBT) literature has long discussed the importance that environment has on corporate strategy, processes, and firm outcomes (Ward et al. 1995). According to organizational contingency theorists, environment is a major source of uncertainties for firms (Lawrence and Lorsch 1967; Thompson 1967). Studies (e.g., Cui et al. 2005; Martin and Javalgi 2016) still highlight a need for more empirical research about the relative influence of other antecedents, such as market versus industry factors, or environmental level versus firm-level factors. Upon this foundation, this article presents an episodic process model that explains how market-sensing capability can give rise to firm innovativeness and brand management systems, which in turn may drive up firm’s performance. Laukkanen et al. (2016) study shows that firm’s market orientation and brand orientation can enhance business performance. In response to Laukkanen et al.’s (2016) call for additional research, this study integrated market-sensing, brand management systems, and firm innovativeness in a single model. This study utilizes RBT (Barney 1991, 2001a, b; Peteraf 1993) and dynamic capability (DC) (Eisenhardt and Martin 2000; Teece 2007; Teece et al. 1997) as theoretical underpinnings, specifically in explaining how a strong brand management system (BMS) instrument stimulates the attainment of competitive advantage against rivals. Brand management systems are a set of brand building activities firms undertake by nurturing their brand’s corporate management to enhance and maintain a long-term brand performance (Lee et al. 2008; Santos-Vijande et al. 2013). Studies have sought the role of brand management systems on business performance. For example, Lee et al. (2008) explore the role of market orientation as an antecedent of brand management systems that leads to brand performance. Subsequently, Santos-Vijande et al. (2013) examined the effect of market orientation and organizational innovativeness on brand management systems and performance. Studies (Li and Liu 2014; Ward et al. 1995) examined the effects of environmental factors (i.e., competitive environment, environment dynamism) on firms’ competencies, strategies, processes, and outcomes. As research on market-sensing capability, market dynamism, competitive intensity, and performance flourishes, there is an increasing need for a consolidated framework. For instance, Cui et al. (2005) found that competitive intensity and market dynamism have direct effects of knowledge management capabilities, which in turn enhances firm performance; however, market dynamism was more influential than competitive intensity. Prior study found that competitive intensity moderates the link between market orientation and hotel performance (Wang et al. 2012), and between service innovation and performance (Foroughi et al. 2015). Competitive intensity moderates the link between IT capabilities and corporate entrepreneurship, and between corporate entrepreneurship and innovation performance (Chen et al. 2015). González-Benito et al. (2014) found that environmental dynamism and competitive intensity moderate the link between market orientation and performance in opposing directions. The outcome of their study suggests that the effects of environmental factors (i.e., market dynamism and competitive intensity) are contingent on several socio-cultural factors; logically, firm innovativeness and brand management systems are an inclusive category, as these elements project the cultural climate of the firm. To have a full understanding of this phenomenon, this paper proposes that competitive intensity and market dynamism will moderate the link between firm innovativeness and firm performance, and between brand management systems and firm performance. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section outlines the literature which is pertinent to the development of this study’s propositions. Next, the study’s propositions are documented, which are followed by concluding commentaries and avenues for future research.",35

As Romer (1993) notes, developing countries have two different kinds of gaps, compare to developed ones, “Object” and “Idea” gap. Object gap refers to the lack of “factories, roads, and raw materials”. Non-accessibility “to the ideas that are used in industrial nations to generate economic value” stands for a meaning of idea gap. In fact, countries’ stage of innovation is directly related to their stage of development. Therefore, innovation growth and its diffusion within the countries are important issues in the development process. Investigating the most effective factors which affect innovation goes back to the major work of Schmookler (1966). He emphasized the importance of the demand-side factors to stimulate the innovation. The main point of his discussion was that a key determinant of innovation growth is the usefulness of new innovations. In another direction, economists like Romer (1990) and Weitzman (1998) consider the effect of supply-side factors more important than the other factors which affect innovation growth. Weitzman (1996, 1998) believes that the production of new innovation happens by the recombination of old ones. Alongside these theories, other economists suggest different factors which can have a dominant impact on both demand and supply-side factors. Acemoglu and Robinson (2000) consider the politicians as the potential power to prevent innovation change. They argue that politicians who believe to lose their power by technological changes may have an incentive to prevent it. In this regard, factors which determine innovation change can be divided into three categories as (I) demand-side factors, (II) supply-side factors, and (III) structural factors. Government’s promotion of innovation needs prioritization of these factors. Hence, this study attempts to empirically examine the effect of entrepreneurship, as one of the demand-side factors, FDI as one of the supply-side factors and institutional quality, as a structural factor, on innovation growth using cross-country panel data of developing countries over 2011–2016 to determine the importance of each one. The contributions of this study to the literature can be divided into three parts: (I) This study considers entrepreneurship as a demand-side factor of the innovation process, (II) also, it tries to test the political-losers hypothesis impact on innovation in developing countries by using WGIFootnote 1 as a proxy for institutional quality. (III) Moreover, this study tries to specify the most important factor which affects innovation in developing countries. To preview the empirical results, they show that entrepreneurship does not have any effect on innovation growth directly; however, its interaction with institutional quality has a significant impact on it. Which means that in low institutional quality, the effect of entrepreneurship may be limited and therefore does not influence innovation. However, as the quality of institutions begins to improve, entrepreneurship becomes effective. Also, the lagged value of innovation and FDI, as the supply-side factors, has a positive and significant impact on innovation during the period under study. In addition, improvement in the institutional quality has a positive and significant effect on innovation growth and the lagged value of dependent variable found to be the most effective factor in the innovation process. The rest of this study organized as follows: In the second section, “Literature Review” is presented and in “Theoretical Framework and Hypotheses,” we investigate theoretical framework and introduce three hypotheses. In “Methodology,” the methodology of data analyzing process is represented. “Data” and “Sample Construction” are dedicated to the nature of datasets and construction of the sample respectively. The estimation results and hypotheses checking are represented in “Estimation and Results” and the study’s conclusions are discussed in “Conclusion”. In “Research Limitations,” we mentioned the limitation of the study.",7
11.0,2.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,17 November 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-018-0569-2,"Economic Growth, Financial Development, and Income Inequality in BRICS Countries: Does Kuznets’ Inverted U-Shaped Curve Exist?",June 2020,Moheddine Younsi,Marwa Bechtini,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"In recent years, there has been a heated debate on the effectiveness of financial sector development on promoting economic growth and reducing inequality, and particular attention has been paid to the issue of what role strong financial sector development plays on income inequality reduction. On the other side, a desirable economic growth and development levels is always required to push an economy and thus improve social welfare of the citizens. However, several empirical studies highlight the crucial role of finance and strong well-effective financial system on improving economic development and growth, as they contribute to boost total productivity and promote market-driven dynamics (McKinnon 1973; Shaw 1973; Levine 1997; Levine et al. 2000). Likewise, many researchers suggest that strong financial sector development can contribute largely to mitigate income inequality (Li et al. 1998; Beck et al. 2007; Agnello and Sousa 2012; Jalil and Feridun 2011; Clarke et al. 2013; Hoi and Hoi 2013; Nikoloski 2013; Shahbaz et al. 2015; Satti et al. 2015; Zhang and Cheng 2015). Consequently, it is emphasized in the literature that strong financial system will certainly stimulate desirable investment level and economic growth progress. However, an active and well-developed financial sector may provide cheaper credit and easing access to financial services to various individuals that helps to improve entrepreneurial activities which hence create job opportunities and enhance the welfare of the society. Therefore, the accessibility of credit at lower cost may offer decisive support to financially poor families by allowing them to invest in health and education, thereby improving human capital formation in the economy, which will certainly assist the income distribution and poverty alleviation. A stable and effective financial system is also assumed to be a sign of healthy macroeconomic performance of every economy. Indeed, active and strong financial market adherents can perform a vital role in the enlargement of commerce and industry and thus strengthen the all-inclusive economy of a country. However, several studies show that scarce financial markets can be a source of income inequality and that financial sector imperfection generates income inequality, by assisting entrepreneurs and hurting lenders through its effects of decreasing the rental rate of capital (Westley 2001; Mookherjee and Ray 2003; Hye and Islam 2013; Daisaka et al. 2014; Satti et al. 2015). It is not surprising that income inequality has been on the upsurge worldwide and it affects almost all the developed, emerging, and developing countries, whereas social welfare of the people vary negatively with the country’s level of inequality. Furthermore, it has been argued that high inequality weakens the potency of the economy and promotes economic instability (Stiglitz 2012). There are many ways to combat income inequality; one way is to encourage financial sector development as along with other benefits it also plays a central role in channeling private saving to investment. Therefore, the article’s goal is to examine the impacts of financial development and growth on income inequality reduction and validate the Kuznets hypothesis, which illustrates an inverted U-shaped linkage between economic development and income inequality, and between financial development and income inequality in the BRICS countries, namely, Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. To this end, we use annual panel data for BRICS countries covering the period 1990–2015. We contribute to the literature by using different techniques, time period, and portfolio of regressors, which are relatively different as compared to previous studies. In addition, to analyze the impact of financial development on income inequality, we use two different approaches; the first one is to analyze the impact of different proxies of financial development separately. The second is to construct a financial development index for each country by applying the principal component method on the major four proxies of financial development available in the literature, that is, domestic credit provided by banking sector, domestic credit provided to private sector, broad money supply, and stock market capitalization. We expect that the outcomes of this study may help the policy-makers to alleviate income inequality through the development of financial system. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 draws an overview of the literature on economic development, financial development, and income inequality nexus. Section 3 describes the data and the econometric methodology used. Section 4 depicts the empirical findings. Section 5 concludes and suggests some policy implications.",45

Kotsemir,Concetto Paolo Vinci,Male,Male,Male,Male,"As observed in most countries, scientific performance has become the most important topic for science policy. There is an increasing trend in collaborations between individuals and organizations (Beaver 2001; Rosenblat and Mobius 2004; Goyal et al. 2006; Carillo et al. 2013). This collaboration considers researchers belonging to the same department and between institutions (Katz and Martin 1997; Adams et al. 2005). As recalled in Katz and Martin (1997) and Bonaccorsi and Daraio (2005), policy makers have supported initiatives to favour collaborations among researchers and academic institutions. In this paper,Footnote 1 our research question is what forms of collaboration are more effective at raising scientific universities in Russia. In particular, we select Russian universities that have ever been indexed in Interfax National Ranking of Universities for two years 2015 and 2016 to identify formal collaborations instead of informal ones. In this way, we try to learn whether the investigation of a single researcher is better than the university, as the unity of analysis. In order to satisfy our goal, we implement both econometric models for count data, and panel data model with clustered errors. Finally, we run also an instrumental variable model, where the number of students in mobility is used as an instrument for collaborations variable. The findings are particularly interesting: more external collaborations positively affect the universities’ performance, measured by the number of citations. The paper is structured as follows. “Literature Review on Influence of Collaboration on Research Performance” section reviews the impact of scientific collaboration onto universities’ performance. “Theoretical framework” section presents the data employed in the analysis. “Methodology” section develops the theoretical framework, and “Model Specification” section displays the empirical framework. The results of empirical investigation are showed in “Empirical Results” section, while “Policy Implications and Conclusions” section discusses the policy implication of analysis and deserves some remarks for further research.",8

Many studies articulated by (Ang 2007; Shahbaz et al. 2012; Kanjilal and Ghosh 2013; Apergis and Payne 2009; Alam et al. 2016; Baek and Pride 2014; Begum et al. 2015), the trade openness (Al-Mulali et al. 2015; Jebli and Youssef 2015; Arouri et al. 2014; Basarir and Arman 2014; Saboori et al. 2012), the population (Borhan et al. 2012; Ahmed and Long 2012) incorporated new factors expected to determine the environment quality, such as taking into account the energy consumption. By combining the corruption issue in the political field together with environmental issue in the economic field, many auteurs (Shleifer and Vishny (1993), Jain (2001) and Walter and Luebke (2013)) proposed new ways to consider the expected factor that affect the environmental quality. The corruption was a common issue in both developed and developing countries. According to a survey conducted by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)Footnote 1 the corruption appears with a greater effect on CO2 emissions in developing countries compared to the more developed countries. The corruption may spread in most governmental and legislative department and could potentially lead to the destruction and deterioration of the ecological system and environment quality due to worst environment regulations and high complexity of the environment issues. The impact of corruption on environment quality is becoming a substantial challenge for more sustainable economic development (Seldadyo and De Haan 2011; Wang et al. 2015; and Zhang and Da 2015). Corruption accompanied with various other institutional inefficiencies is commonly expected in the literature to crucially affect the country’s total factor productivity as well as the government’s concerns and the control for environmental quality. Lopez and Mitra (2000) attributed the real emission level far away beyond the socially acceptable limits of GDP per capita to suboptimal government decisions. A higher degree of corruption results in a greater deviation from socially acceptable standards. Moreover, the corruption could induce the degradation of the environment quality through the trade policies channel. Damiana et al. (2003) found that the level of corruption may likely affect the impact of trade liberalization on environmental policies stringency. A higher level of corruption results in a reduction of environmental policies stringency. Moreover, there is broad evidence that in many countries the impact of corruption on natural resources results in degradation in the environment quality. Hafner (1998) showed in this vein that, in many countries, the corruption stills a main driver of misappropriate use of land, forest resources, and tropical forest destruction. In the developing countries, the natural resources used such as the use of lands may be affected by inappropriate government policies driven under the pressure of special interest lobby groups. On the other hand, the corruption affects the most vulnerable firms by reducing their chance to access to several services and different investment. In this perspective, Paunov (2016) conducted a comparative study to examine the impacts of corruption on smaller and larger sized firms adoption of quality certificates and patents using firm level data for a set of developing and emerging countries. His results showed the existence of strong evidence that smaller firm’s exhibit higher sensitivity to corruption. He founded, also, that while corruption does not affect patenting, it induces a lower machinery investments for innovation. According to Chimeli and Braden (2005), there is a critical value for total factor productivity (TFP) (which follows from the country’s regulatory and legal constraints, cultural values, and corruption, among others). They showed that higher TFP means better environmental quality. However, empirical assessments of the impact of corruption on the environment in African countries are not significant, leading to some uncertainty regarding the magnitude and significance of any such impact. The aim of this paper is to improve the existing literature from three aspects. First, it provides a rigorous examination of the linkers between corruption and environmental quality in African countries. Second, it employs the simultaneous dynamics panel data, which may provide more complete results compared to the commonly used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression approach. Third, it quantitatively assesses the direct and indirect impacting mechanisms of corruption on CO2 emissions. The remainder of this paper is as follows. The second section overviews the literature reviews on the corruption-environment quality connections. The third section describes the data and the methodology. “Empirical Results” summarizes the main results. Concluding remarks are given in the end of the manuscript.",17

However, only a few studies have addressed the relationship between knowledge management (KM) and company internationalization while KM is a critical measure of acquiring competitive advantage in knowledge economy (Pan and Scarbrough 1999). Based on a resource-based view (Penrose 1959), KM focuses on what goes inside a firm. Thus, KM is placed in an important supporting role within the firm. KM is a coordinating mechanism that enables resources to be converted into capabilities (Nelson and Winter 1982). While knowledge is a resource in its own right, the way in which knowledge is managed and used will affect the quality of services that can be leveraged from each resource owned by the firm. KM is defined as the process of creating, sharing, using, and managing the knowledge and information of an organization. It refers to a multidisciplinary approach to achieving organizational objectives by making the best use of knowledge. Moreover, the goal of KM is to maximize organizational knowledge value through continuously create, accumulate and share organizational knowledge (Wiig 1997). KM was initially used to describe computer applications for information storage and retrieval (Wilson 2002). In order to achieve KM objectives, Information Technology (IT) should be incorporated to a firm’s daily operation in order that its members can access, store, retrieve, and make use of organizational knowledge without barriers (Duffy 2000). The conceptualization of KM has also to include innovation (von Krogh et al. 2001), it allows developing new knowledge from identified and defining problems. This paper focuses on the link between KM and SME internationalization taking innovation and IT important to effective KM and measuring the direct and indirect link between innovation and internationalization using IT as a moderating effect in order to show the complementarity between IT adoption and innovation. In fact, innovation, in conjunction with IT, can enhance company internationalization (Junnarkar and Brown 1997). A commitment to innovation is considered significant to the intensity of internationalization. Buckley and Casson (1998) demonstrated that innovation is critical for product mobility abroad. Furthermore, innovation represents a basis for competitiveness in both domestic and international markets (Jones 1999, 2001; Guan and Ma 2003). Research has also shown that the overall process of innovation stimulates export activities (Nguyen 2007). Considered from a resource-based analysis of the company (Barney 1991), efficient innovation depends on organizational capabilities. It has also been confirmed that accurate strategic deployment of IT is essential in developing successful strategies such as innovation or internationalization (Ray et al. 2005). In our research, innovation refers to a significant change in processes, technologies, products, or services. Managing businesses in multiple geographic markets is a complex (Williamson 1975) and expensive task. Thus, the coordination and information management requirements may outweigh the profits. Multimarket businesses enjoy fewer similarities among environmental elements (Aldrich 1979), and IT is often mobilized to control the coordination costs of complex information flows. These results imply that IT offers SMEs the competitive advantage to differentiate themselves in multiple markets through, for example, innovation. Although innovation, IT, and internationalization have been presented as key factors in the literature, their possible relationships have not been studied extensively. IT allows for greater adaptability to the environment (Das et al. 1991) and improves information flow (Hanson 1999), thereby developing international competitiveness. Thus, it has been generally acknowledged that the impact of IT investment is significantly positive (Dedrick et al. 2003). Prior studies have also found evidence that export performance impacts IT investment (Poon and Jevons 1997; Etemad and Wright 1999; Rialp and Rialp 2001; Knight and Liesch 2002). IT has provided new opportunities for SME internationalization by, for instance, offering direct access to foreign markets (Spigarelli 2003). Nonetheless, IT sustains internationalization due to the great cost of innovation. IT reduces the distance and cost of contact creation with potential foreign business partners, allowing SMEs based in several countries to benefit from direct access to local expertise. Despite the evidence for IT’s positive impact on innovation and internationalization, substantial questions remain. SMEs tend to invest considerable resources in IT. While their global returns on investment are positive, the variation across companies is considerable. Some companies make vast investments for little return, while others achieve more success. The issue for SMEs is in understanding this heterogeneity. Few empirical studies have analyzed how innovation interacts with IT resources to improve SME internationalization. Our research intends to increase the understanding of the relationships among IT, innovation, and internationalization. This study examines the impact of IT, through enterprise resource planning (ERP) and electronic customer relationship management (e-CRM) functions, on innovation and SME internationalization. Several studies have doubted the value of IT investment. Another issue is the measurement of the time gap between innovation and IT investment, and the internationalization payoff. The relationship between IT and innovation has been studied profusely (Cepeda Carrion et al. 2012; Koellinger 2008; Tarafdar and Gordon 2007). Previous results have demonstrated the great potential of IT on SME flexibility (Larsen and Lomi 2002). Moreover, Cooper (1998) illustrated the innovation opportunity for SMEs through the combined effects of IT price decreases, quality increases, and an IT-trained workforce. Finally, through the different storage, transmission, communication, and processing of information, IT improves companies’ problem-solving capability (Dewett and Jones 2001). This study makes the following contributions to theory. First, it uses two measures for IT—ERP and e-CRM—instead of considering general IT use, for consistency with previous research that has demonstrated ERP and e-CRM have different impacts on SME activities, such as internationalization (Laudon and Laudon 2006; Holsapple and Sena 2005; Gefen and Ragowsky 2005). The remaining question is not whether to deploy IT but how to deploy it. We separate the impact of IT implementation in different functional areas of the SME. Previous studies have been often performed at the SME level. Thus, we expect to provide original insights into the actual consequences of IT on SMEs. Second, previous research has demonstrated the influence of either innovation or IT on internationalization but few have addressed the effects of those factors, taken together, on SMEs. Third, we adopt a different approach from current analyses. Previous studies have associated IT implementation with the level of investment. However, according to Devaraj and Kohli (2003), the benefits of IT use should be measured separately from investment. This paper is structured as follows. In “Knowledge Management and SME Internationalization” section we discuss SME internationalization and the KM literature to define the theoretical relationships among innovation, ERP, e-CRM, and internationalization, and we also introduce our hypotheses. In “Data and Variables” section we present the data and variables. We give the results and conclude in “Results” and “Conclusion” sections respectively; in “Practical Contributions and Implications for Future Research” section we provide this study’s practical and managerial implications and its limitations and suggestions for future research.",29

The longevity of such conflict leads to almost a complete destruction of infrastructure and public utilities, weak functional capacity of state institutions, negative effects on the social capital (breakdown of trust among citizens), and human capital (brain drain and disruption of rehabilitation, training, and educational activities). The worst impact of such conflict is the fragmentation of the national identity, which is the main carrier of the unity of society and state. Once the conflict is over, the important question is where to start the reconstruction process and how the policy and institutional frameworks of the reconstruction process can be oriented towards building a knowledge-based economy. To address the above-mentioned research questions, this study analyses the economic and social reality in Syria before the start of the conflict in March 2011 and during the conflict using SCM and DSM. This study also evaluates the conflict’s impact on a set of economic and development indicators as well as knowledge output variables and the Global Innovation Index. Next, it proposes policies to accelerate reconstruction and transformation towards a knowledge-based economy simultaneously. This study considers the reconstruction as a functional process that serves the goals of the reconstruction process on the one hand, and serves the process of smooth transition towards knowledge-based economy to build a more competitive economy and a more interdependent and integrated society on the other hand. This study is divided into six main sections. Section one is the introduction; section two reviews the literature on the reconstruction and transition process in other countries to a knowledge-based economy and post-conflict reconstruction. Section three analyses the economic and social indicators in Syria before and during the conflict. Section four explains the data and study methodology. Section five proposes approaches for reconstruction and transition towards a knowledge-based economy in Syria based on analysis results and section six concludes.",7

The collapse of authoritarian regimes began in Tunisia and then spread to Egypt, Libya, and other countries in the Middle East. In its report (2014), the African Development Bank considers that the search for a higher level of development and the willingness of the people to improve their standard of living are the main factors that led to the overgrowth of revolutions in the Arab countries. On the academic level, these movements have revived the debate on the link between the nature of the political regime and growth. This question is all the more important because it goes beyond the sole interest of political scientists and constitutes a fundamental problem in the economic analysis of development. This issue is part of a larger literature that seeks to identify the causes and origins of growth. This literature, very vast and ancient, goes back to the time of the first industrial revolution, initiated by Adam Smith (1776), who was one of the true precursors to questioning the origins of wealth and how it can be increased. Through these questions, the author proposes an analysis of the determinants of economic growth. It demonstrates that there are mainly three major causes of the nation’s enrichment. These factors are the division of labor, the accumulation of capital, and the size of the market. The distribution of the production process allows each worker to become a specialist in his task, thus increasing his efficiency and productivity. Similarly, the accumulation of capital and, particularly, the investment in machinery make it possible to increase the specialization of workers, which should increase production (and hence wealth) per capita. Finally, a wider market will facilitate trade opportunities and increase the division of labor. Indeed, the larger the market, the more the specialized producer will find it easier to sell his commodity on the market and will be able to get supplies according to what he needs and does not produce. Later, with the emergence of neoclassical models in the second half of the twentieth century, the field of research has expanded. Rather, the emphasis was placed on the role of technical change and the improvement of the organization of production in economic growth. In this context, the Solow (1957) model, by assuming decreasing returns to factors of production, constant returns to scale, and efficient use of factors of production, shows, on the one hand, that capital growth leads to an increase in growth. On the other hand, poor countries end up having a higher growth rate than the rich countries. Finally, over the long term, growth stems from changes in the working population and technical progress. These two parameters are nonetheless considered exogenous to the model. The models of exogenous growth and mainly the model of Solow present the limit of having explained the growth by the technical progress without trying to know the origin of this progress. The theory of endogenous growth was then developed to account for criticism of approaches based on capital accumulation. The first model of endogenous growth is that of Romer (1986). This model considers the key determinants of long-term growth as endogenous. It emphasizes the importance of externalities to offset declining returns to capital and thus explains long-term growth. Indeed, certain types of investments produce external effects, and these externalities compensate for diminishing returns to scale. Investments that are subject to externalities include human capital (Lucas 1988; Ciccone and Peri 2006), public infrastructure spending (Barro 1990), and institutions (North 1990, 2016). Concerning this latter factor, a large literature highlights the central importance of the institutional environment in growth. Indeed, since the work of the “new institutional economy” which developed neoclassical tools to analyze the role of institutions in economic activity, many authors agree to highlight a fundamental role of institutions in the promotion of economic development and growth (North 1990; Acemoglu et al. 2001, 2002; Easterly and Levine 2003; Pande and Udry 2006). Literature often borrows the definition of institutions from Douglas North (1990). The latter defines them as rules conceived by society in order to structure exchanges in the economic, political, and social fields. These institutions are divided into formal and informal institutions. Formal institutions encompass all contracts, economic, legal, and political rules. These rules are written and explicit and are enforced by the State or its organs. On the other hand, informal institutions refer to the set of customs, conventions, standards, or codes of conduct in society. These rules are not written and are implicit in the sense that they are practiced endogenously by individuals belonging to the same group. In addition, whether formal or informal, institutions determine what actions members of society are allowed to do and specify prohibited activities (North 1990). Formal institutions can, in turn, be divided into economic and political institutions (Acemoglu et al. 2005). The former reflect the rules governing human exchanges in the economic field, while the latter indicate the rules relating to the organization of political life. In addition, there are several types of economic institutions that Rodrik (2005) classify as market-generating institutions, market-regulating institutions, market stabilization institutions, and market-legitimizing institutions. The market-generating institutions seek to ensure the protection of property rights, the enforcement of contracts and, more generally, the respect of the rule of law. Market regulation institutions, such as regulatory bodies, define the rules for the functioning of the market. Market stabilization institutions aim to ensure macroeconomic stability and crisis prevention (e.g., monetary and fiscal institutions). Finally, market-legitimizing institutions guarantee the protection and social insurance of individuals and manage the redistribution of income in society. The particular impact of political institutions on economic growth is in line with a wider and relatively new literature. This literature is known as the “new political economy” (Wagner 1987; North 1990; Olson 1993; Gamble 1995). In the broad sense of the term, the new political economy refers to the study of institutional phenomena, such as political, legal, or constitutional decisions in the analysis of economic activity. This branch of literature that dates back to the 1960s is new in the sense that it uses neoclassical analysis tools to integrate the behavior of political agents, voters, and state officials into the analysis of choice of economic policy. Indeed, neoclassical economic science rejects in its research the foundations, the decisions that affect the institutional framework. The latter is considered exogenous to the economic model. The new political economy thus constitutes a field of research which breaks with the traditional approach to integrate political variables in its analysis of economic phenomena. These variables are now considered endogenous to the economic model through the study of interactions between the economic sphere and the political sphere. More broadly, this literature conceives the choice of economic policies, public management, or problems affecting the economy, such as unemployment and underdevelopment, as a result of the satisfaction of the interests of political decision-makers (Wagner 1987). The models of political economy are part of a positive approach that analyzes the mistakes of leaders and agents of the State. The objective is to understand how economic policy decisions and forms of government explain economic choices and thereby growth. Modeling of political behavior will help explain various problems relating to collective choices (Arrow 1951), public choices and collective action (Buchanan and Tullock 1962; Olson 1965), inequalities (North et al. 2009), and growth (Bernholz 1984; North and Weingast 1989; Barro 1991; Olson 1993; Goldsmith 1995; Clague et al. 1996; Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Haber et al. 2008; Keefer 2008). If it is clear that several questions or themes rather focus on the field of political economy, this paper is inserted in the particular axis of the literature focusing on the political economy of growth. The models of the political economy of growth are based on the hypothesis of the existence of political conflicts in society. This hypothesis loosens the framework of the representative agent model and postulates that politicians are rational agents whose behaviors can be explained by political choices (Marx 1867; North 1990; Olson 1993). At this level, there are usually two types of politicians: opportunistic men and partisan men (Alesina 1988). The former pursue re-election objectives, while the latter have exogenous preferences for certain economic policies. Thus, a plausible explanation for the choice of economic behavior is that before the elections, opportunistic political decision-makers undertake to implement tax reduction and public spending policies in order to increase their chances of re-election. However, after the elections, these leaders instead instigate policies that serve their narrow interests and allow the expropriation of income and wealth. Defined by its object and its principles, the new political economy is not, however, a unified current of thought. Assuming that the political system influences economic activity, this branch of literature brings together several authors with divergent points of view. These discrepancies are naturally accounted for by the assumption that individuals who control political power seek to maximize their personal gains and not necessarily the income of the nation. More precisely, taking into account the divergence of the interests of politicians explains the debate about the economic efficiency of political regimes. In this sequel, the whole debate crystallizes around the economic merits of a democratic political regime as opposed to an autocratic regime. To define democracy briefly, we borrow Abraham Lincoln’s definition. The latter considers a democratic political system as “the government of the people, by the people, for the people.Footnote 1” Although this quotation is susceptible of several interpretations, it defines democracy as the political regime in which the people are sovereign and where power is detained or controlled by the people. This power is exercised through electoral competitions. In general, a democratic political system is a form of government characterized by the free participation of citizens in political life, by free and fair elections, and by a responsibility of politicians toward voters (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006). In practice, democratic institutions are distinguished by the existence of constraints on the executive power emanating from centers of powerlessness. On the academic level, many studies consider democracy as a meta-institution, an institution from which other institutions are born or strengthened (Rodrik 2000; Acemoglu et al. 2005). The debate about the link between democracy and growth is rooted in the question of whether or not a democratic political system is favorable to development and economic prosperity. To this end, the literature is split into two positions. The first considers that democracy is beneficial for growth, while the second challenges this relationship by arguing that, conversely, democracy reduces growth or at least does not explain it. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: the second section reviews the literature on democracy and economic growth. It describes channels through which democracy may influence economic growth. Particularly, it provides theoretical arguments in favor and then against a democratic political regime. The last section concludes.",15
11.0,3.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,12 February 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-019-0586-9,The Production of Academic Technological Knowledge: an Exploration at the Research Group Level,September 2020,Manuel Acosta,Daniel Coronado,Pedro Jesús Moreno,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Public research institutions have a key role in the knowledge-based society as they lead scientific research and generate patentable technology directly applicable to industrial productive processes (D’Este and Perkmann 2011). Furthermore, research universities have become the foundation for successful technology commercialization as well as boosters of the regional economy (Carayannis et al. 2015; Marozau et al. 2016). The objective of this paper is to explore the production of technological knowledge by using patents as indicator, but unlike most extant analyses of academic patenting that focus on the university level, we follow a latest strand of literature that consider the factors affecting the production of university outputs at the level of research group (e.g., Olmos-Peñuela et al. 2014; Aguiar-Díaz et al. 2016; Hormiga et al. 2017; Barletta et al. 2017). A research group is defined as a group of people, scientists, and non-scientists, which works for a certain time period to produce new knowledge. The group is a relevant part of a larger organization (university, department, etc.) and at least some of its members are employed by a university. Also, the team is recognized from outside as a separate entity (Barjak and Robinson 2007). Our interest in research groups as units of analysis is supported on several grounds. First, the groups are the key knowledge producing organizations within national science systems, and they are a reference when research and development (R&D) performance is evaluated (Barjak and Robinson 2007; Vabo et al. 2016; Ramos-Vielba et al. 2016). Second, in the last few decades, knowledge production has been increasingly developed within groups or teams of scientists. For example, the allocation of public research funding was traditionally through individual academic scientists; nowadays, competitive project funding has grown considerably and there is a greater emphasis on fostering organized research centers, networks, and interdisciplinary teams (Henze et al. 2007). In this respect, Etzkowitz (2017) points out that we are witnessing a shift in the center of academic gravity from departments of individual scholars to networks of research groups, particularly to capture larger funds. Third, a better understanding of the factors that exert an influence on groups engaged in technologically creative work has important policy implications. For instance, Etzkowitz (2003) argues that the internal organization of research universities comprises a series of research groups with firm-like qualities, especially under conditions where research funding is awarded on competitive bases. Our contribution focuses on two main issues. First, this paper fills a gap in the research on patent production at the research group level. Despite their importance in regional and national research systems for both the production of knowledge and as the basic unit for distributing public funds, the role of the research group as producer of patented technology has been neglected. Most of the previous research has identified the factors affecting the production of patents at the level of universities, laboratories, and regions (Azagra-Caro et al. 2006a, b; Lawson 2013; Romano et al. 2014; Coronado et al. 2017). Although there are some recent papers that stress the role of the research group in producing scientific outputs (Olmos-Peñuela et al. 2014; Hormiga et al. 2017) and some transfer activities (Aguiar-Díaz et al. 2016; Barletta et al. 2017), to our knowledge, there is no previous research explaining the generation of technological outputs (patents) at the level of research groups. Second, we test two hypotheses with relevant policy implications. The first hypothesis centers on the role of collaboration of research groups with private companies to promote the production of patents. Testing this hypothesis would cast some light on whether there is a crowding-out effect (diverting human or public economic resources to objectives other than research) at the level of research groups. The second hypothesis refers to the extent to which the scientific background of the group hinders or encourages its production of patents. Analyzing this fact is important because it would clarify whether or not scientific research and technological research are complementary outputs. To test our hypotheses, we draw on a novel sample of 1120 research groups affiliated to universities and other public research institutions in Spain. Our methodology relies on patent counts as an indicator of the production of innovation by public institutions. Several studies have already demonstrated that the analysis of patents is a valid and objective method for studying the processes of innovation and technology transfer (see the widely cited survey by Griliches 1990 and the more recent discussion by Janger et al. 2017 and Emodi et al. 2017). However, despite their known drawbacks, patent data provide a useful measure of a university’s capacity to be involved in innovation and technological activities. In addition, the accessibility of this type of data enables a more extensive form of treatment than that offered by case studies or interviews (Henderson et al. 1998). Importantly, given the nature of the variable, we estimate several econometric count models to identify the main factors affecting the production of patents by research groups. The paper is organized as follows. “Literature and Hypotheses Development” section includes a review of the literature dealing with the production of patents in public institutions and explains our hypotheses. “Data and Variables” section describes the data and the variables. “Model” section presents the econometric specification for testing our hypotheses. “Results” section provides the results. The main conclusions of the analysis are drawn in the “Conclusions” section.",11

It is a theoretical and practical understanding of a subject which forms the core essence of an organization’s assets. It is people’s capacity to generate and renew them to meet the opportunities and challenges. With a knowledge explosion that the past century has witnessed along with the development of information technology, KM has also evolved into a discipline of study since 1991 (Nonaka 1991). It is a major field of academic publications. Keeping in view the importance of knowledge in higher education, KM has evolved as a contemporary concept in the purview of higher education. The potential of a university is dependent on the knowledge pool and the knowledge pool is directly proportional to the experience of the people working in the organization (Kolb 1984). According to ministry of higher education of Malaysia, Malaysian KM system is a method that could improve institutional innovations. KM is a process of creating, analyzing, sharing, and organizing knowledge. These are key factors which contribute their share in improving the quality of education and research in higher education. KM is about making the right people have the right knowledge at right time. It plays a vital role in solving the current problems such as need to innovate and competitiveness faced by us in day-to-day transactions (Drucker 1993). KM is a subject of enabling teams, individuals, and the entire firm to collaboratively and systematically create, adopt, apply, and share knowledge for achieving the organizational goals (Young 2010; Nonaka 1995). It ensures effective distribution of staff and resources, and increases performance and productivity without increasing the cost (Kiessling et al. 2009). KM process includes six steps as outlined, congregate, constructing, recapitulate, analyzing, synthesizing, and decision-making (Arun Kumar 2012). KM has adopted different concepts from different disciplines. Post-independence, the higher education system in India has seen a phenomenal growth with a steady rise in the number of universities and colleges offering professional courses to educate and equip the Indian population with the skill and knowledge to face the competitive world. Eventually, the Indian higher education system has seen an upsurge and is one of the largest in the world currently. Today, India is having 868 universities in total functioning as central universities, state universities, national universities, and private universities. Universities imparting higher education have multiple roles to play such as knowledge creation, acquiring new knowledge, and nurturing an intelligent human resource pool through teaching, research, and extension activities. The main aim of higher education system in India is to impart skill-based and value-based education which can cater to the needs of the society (Adomavičiūtė 2016). Ever since independence, researchers have been keen to understand the importance of higher education in the proper functioning of the society. Ever since the 1980s, educational researchers have studied the relation between society, knowledge, and education (Adomavičiūtė 2016). Universities are repositories for knowledge. Education sector especially the universities are centered on the knowledge base and transfer knowledge to society. Universities are the hubs for knowledge creation. Education and research are the key contributions towards research universities today. Apart from this, they have become epicenters of innovation and knowledge creation (Carayannis et al. 2015). The higher educational institutions participate in research activities contributing significantly to knowledge creation. The universities are meant for teaching which enhance the scope of knowledge leadership. The universities in India also encourage extension activities such as conferences, group discussions, and guest lectures which promote knowledge sharing in the universities in Indian scenario. Knowledge creation, leadership, and sharing (See Fig. 1) are important parameters of KM which are used to assess the status of KM in universities and higher education institutions. Relationship between knowledge CSL Several researchers all over the world have contributed significantly to research on KM in universities. A research study showed the fact that the knowledge in Maejo University is at moderate level and the activity was held to just meet the government policy requirement, not to create a learning culture in organization (Songsangyos 2012). Iran higher education system underwent tremendous changes over 18 years. It was noted that KM can help to increase the level of academic performance in Iran (Hasani and Sheikhesmaeili 2016). Another study revealed that the knowledge (Singhsri 2007), transfer of skills, and experience between faculty members inside the Pay up University are at a moderate level and knowledge sharing does not affect KM process. KM (Tatnall 2013) is an important aspect in organizations like government institutions, business, and universities to improve their operations. In Malaysia, there are 20 public universities. The available technology and leadership are most important concerns, and divinity and language might have effect on KM in Malaysian universities as well as higher educational institutions. Knowledge sharing (Lin 2007) is a key strand in firms’ competitive advantage. Nowadays’ knowledge sharing is gaining an increasing attention among researchers and faculty (Riege 2005). The reason behind this is it gives a competitive advantage to the individual. The research grants obtained by virtue of knowledge sharing, organizing, and analyzing will help universities reach their long-term and short-term goals and objectives to improve the quality of higher education in India. A university employee who understands the prominence of knowledge sharing has a competitive advantage over his or her fellow colleagues in understanding their potential in achieving their career goals. Such employees mostly share knowledge for being connected with the competitive world outside. Knowledge sharing in educational institutions is of three types, i.e., group, individual, and organizational. Universities follow two types of knowledge-sharing practices, i.e., formal and informal methods. Organizing the knowledge is keystone in universities as well as research institutions (Lin 2007). Knowledge sharing (Cummings 2004; Wang and Noe 2010) is referred as knowing to help others and jointly solve the problems and create new ideas, policies, and procedures. Knowledge sharing helps in revamping and conserves the relationship between knowledge sharing and creating practices (Goh and Sandhu 2014). KM in Greece universities are using simulation model for benefits of strategy of quality standards to use stand in global competition (Trivella and Dimitrios 2015). In the recent years, KM has been gaining increased diligence among researchers and academicians. Distinctive higher educational institutions are vigorously engaged in KM activities and pursue research. It is currently changing into a renowned domain in education arena as a result of ought to disclose the intellectual power out there in institution for sharing experiences. Hence, it is clearly evident that KM processes show effect on the working of universities in maintaining their world class standards to impart quality education to students and pursue high-end research. The present study explains the importance of knowledge creation, leadership, and sharing in Indian universities. The study explains the relationship of these parameters of KM on each other. It throws light on the importance of KM in Indian universities.",2

Assuad,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Taking action toward a path of sustainable development (SD) requires decision-making from the individual, corporation, government, and society which considers both short- and long-term effects or outcomes (Klauer et al. 2013). In the decision-making process, each one of these described entities has a motivation to act. The source and goals of such motivations define the types of decisions that are made, eventually determining whether the individual, corporation, government, or society move toward SD. Because motivations lead to actions, and actions are the product of decision-making processes, it is important to understand the rationality behind such processes (Heckhausen and Heckhausen 2008; Kuhl 1986; Parker et al. 2010; Wade-Benzoni 2002). Moreover, as the motivation to act is such a relevant input into the decision-making process, one would expect it to be widely discussed and reflected upon in the SD literature. However, such a discussion is scarce; briefly discussed by a few authors some decades ago (Dunstan et al. 1993; Mebratu 1998) and then put aside in favor of defining and operationalizing SD. Nevertheless, this does not mean that motivations are non-existent, but rather that they are somehow implicit in the SD literature narrative. This paper aims to theorize about the implications of those motivations on the effectiveness on both short- and long-term decision-making. In order to do that, it first makes these motivations explicit by proposing a framework that systematized the most often cited literature around the questions why SD is important, what SD is, and how to practice SD. Some scholars have looked into the rationality behind SD decision-making (Bolis et al. 2017; Kallio et al. 2007) with the goal of suggesting ideal rational thinking, following a normative approach to rationality (Peterson 2009). In contrast, one of the purposes of this paper is to have a descriptive approach to analyze the possible consequences of the behavior resulted from intertemporal decision-making in the context of SD. Rationality in decision-making has been mainly studied by using the theory of rational choice, especially in the field of economics. This theory builds on the assumptions that the human brain has an unlimited capacity for computation and maximizes utility, as well as receives perfect information to make choices, choosing the optimal alternative (Tversky and Kahneman 1986). However, such a statistical understanding of rationality has been questioned as unrealistic; that is, not describing decision-making as a behavior but rather as an ideal (Tversky and Kahneman 1986). Therefore, the conception of other rationality types has emerged such as unbounded rationality or ecological rationality (Gigerenzer and Selten 2002; Simon 1978; Smith 2003). These alternative understandings see decision-making as an adaptation to the environment and are aware of the human brain’s limitations. Therefore, they are based not on logical definitions, but on biological and social evolution. To understand the rationality behind decision-making in SD, this paper recognizes the existence of different rationality types rather than assuming only one way of being rational (Bolis et al. 2017; Simon 1980; Smith 2003; Walliser 1989). Such rationalities are used according to the environment, level of uncertainty, and considered time frame for the outcome, with the assumption that the longer the time frame, the higher the level of uncertainty (Mousavi and Gigerenzer 2014). Essentially, SD deals with long-term decision-making that involves high levels of uncertainty, giving an inter-temporal attribute to the issue (Klauer et al. 2013). Therefore, the challenge becomes using the appropriate rationality for the right situation, according to the level of uncertainty or information available. Hence, using the wrong rationality leads to misguided and poor decisions that, in the context of SD, can have very expensive or extreme catastrophic outcomes (Bolis et al. 2017; Waas et al. 2014). Motivation is an important factor in the rationality of decision-making. It is “concerned with what behavior aims at and how a multitude of fears and desires combine to determine human action” (Selten 1998, p.414). Therefore, there is a relevant relation between the rationality of decision-making and the motivations to act (Kuhl 1986). However, in order to identify the motivations to engage in SD, one needs to understand the SD discourse, which is not an easy task. Almost all written material in SD starts by defining the concept and referring to the widely cited definition given in the report from the United Nations “Our Common Future” (WCED 1987). The United Nations definition is used as a base that is then adapted to the research purpose. To this end, SD is a framework for a discussion (Garmann Johnsen et al. 2015, p. 10), and can be used to mean almost anything the author wants it to mean (O'Connor 1994, p. 152). The majority of publications and actors have taken the task of discussing and debating what SD is and how it should be done. (Docherty et al. 2008; Dresner 2012; Turner and Council 1988a, b; Vasstrøm and Lysgård 2014). This shows the plasticity of the term regarding its wide range of interpretations and consequent diversity in action implementations promoted under its shadow. The discussion of what SD is has been fueled by the reasoning that there has to be a common point of departure and a shared definition to guide the actions that will lead to achieving a sustainable world. In other words, there must be an agreement on what SD is in order to figure out how to do it. However, the task of reaching a common understanding around this concept has turned out to be a very difficult one (Nagpal and Foltz 1995). More than 20 years after the concept’s inception, the quest of agreeing on what SD is and how to be sustainable still exists (Farley and Smith 2013; Santillo 2007). With all effort focused on defining what is/how to, the motivations behind agreeing on the importance of SD have been overshadowed. International institutions, governments, corporations, and individuals appear to agree that SD is important, and that something needs to be done. On the surface, there appears to be common agreement among practitioners and experts (academic and professional) about the motivations to engage in SD, but the core of this remains unspoken, that is, the motivations and triggers that make such wide agreement possible are implicit. The fact that such agreement exists in the SD discourse is both significant and valuable when contrasted with, for example, climate change or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Nevertheless, there seems to be a lack of reflection on the reasons why SD is important, and a clear understanding of why we all agree about it. Essentially, there is little written about the why in the available literature. And, in order to get an idea of the motivations to engage in SD, one has to look at earlier publications from the 1970s and 1980s (Catton 1982; Meadows et al. 1972; Ward and Dubos 1972) as more recent ones take this for granted by making it latent in their narratives (Garrity 2012; Rees 2010). Perhaps the reason that there is so much debate and disagreement on defining what SD is arises from not being completely aware of or reflecting why we think it is important to engage in actions related to SD. Therefore, this paper proposes an alternative way of understanding the SD discourse by focusing not only on the questions of what/how SD is, but also why we engage in it. An attempt to explain the why reveals the core motivations to get involved in SD initiatives. This focuses the SD discourse toward the reasoning behind its importance, which appears to be a common agreement, and allows for reflection around the motivations to act and the implications on decision-making. Analyzing the motivations when considering short- and long-term outcomes, therefore, will improve our understanding of the decision-making process that leads to actions toward a SD path. As a result, this paper identifies that the motivations to act originate from the fear of potential harm that will occur if human development continues using natural resources at higher rates than they can be replenished. However, the motivations to act have evolved, creating a mismatch between the different agents involve in SD decision-making. Therefore, these motivations need to be analyzed together with the perception of vulnerability some agents have toward the potential harm. This generates three scenarios that define the context for action. Two types of rationalities are discussed in those scenarios, exposing the potential problem of using the wrong rationality for long-term decision-making. As such, this research argues for using a humble approach when facing long-term decision-making with high uncertainty and advocates a bottom-up approach to decision-making in SD (see Fig. 1). Implications of motivations to act in effectiveness of SD intertemporal decisions In gaining an understanding of the influence the motivation for action have on intertemporal SD decision-making, this paper addresses an important theoretical gap at the intersection of research on rational decision-making and behavioral analysis. In particular, this paper contributes new insights on how the vulnerability to fear might relate to the perception of long- and short-term threats and the subsequently action (Lebel 2017; Sun et al. 2017). Moreover, I contribute to the SD field by proposing a novel perspective of the literature that gives an easy to navigate structure and it is holistic and integral (Mitlin 1992; Pezzoli 1997; WL 2000). The paper is organized as follows. “Research Methodology” section presents the methodology used, motivating the reasoning for this paper. “Framework of What, How, and Why” section provides a framework based on the most relevant literature in SD, which follows snowball and purposive sampling to give an overview of the development and state-of-the-art of the discourse. “Motivations to Act” section discusses the motivations to act. Meanwhile, “Rationality and Emotions” section analyzes the motivation perspective for rationality types with different time frames and the consequences of achieving a sustainable world.",3

The resulting report which is approved by the Member States, worldwide policymakers re-emerged their obligation to respect the MDG’s goals and desired to hold a high-level summit to go beyond the MDGs’ achievements. The eight MDGs ranged from bringing primary education universally to bisecting extreme poverty and stopping the propagation of HIV/AIDS, by a deadline of 2015 forming an agenda approved by all the globe’s countries and the international organizations of development. They devoted gigantic efforts in order to face the commitments toward the world’s poorest. For many decades, development seemed like a growth of welfare which is proxied by some macroeconomic measures such as output level and its growth rate. This complex methodology was closely criticized, where Amartya Sen (1988) has introduced the concept of the capability approach. The Sen’s capability approach is based on the individual capability to do if a good or service is consumed. The first Human Development Report published by UNPD in 1990 has employed the pioneering model of Sen’s capability approach toward shifting “the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people centered policies” (Ul Haq 1995), while the UNPD has published annually Human Development Report which portrays the Human Development Index. This index has taken into consideration the longevity, education, and wealth level in which the weights are equal. In addition, according to the HDI criteria, the countries can be classified along a scale which is ranged from very high to low human development. However, human development emerges as a negative externality of the environmental pillar. Indeed, the limited resources, if they are efficiently allocated, enhance the human needs which are open-ended. Besides, natural resources are consumed and pollutants generated over the stages of growth which affects the human attainment. As a result, human development without environmental concern will not be sustained, causing the growth to be also unsustained. Such a situation is likely to cause a detrimental impact on the well-being of the future’s generation as they are likely to have inappropriate resources for maximizing their well-being. Therefore, the sustainability issue required the achievement of the sustainability of the human issue. In the same way, there are many contributions explored in order to explain the origin of the environmental phenomena that arises and how they can be avoided. The sustainability theory reveals that the question is related to the manner of the management of the resources or assets’ portfolio of the developing globe. Accordingly, the developing globe, that is dealing with the arbitration between the future and the present well-being conjointly with the liquidating process of primitive wealth (e.g., natural resources), must follow an adequate saving-and-investing policy in the green economy through the clean technologies. This shed the lights on augmented national aggregates (e.g., genuine savings) which portray data on the matter to that each country of the developing globe is accumulating net wealth. The re-emergence of the environmental issue was appeared as a stylized fact of policy recommendations resulted from the Rio Earth Summit 2012. Other contributions to the sustainability theory underlined the results generated by polluting activities and high environmental degradation level for maintaining prosperity expansion. There is a robust causality among these two streams, which it appeared as a contradictory but seemingly robust fact of a significant negative link among economic development and ecological sustainability. This finding was characterized as confirming the “EKC hypothesis.” The lack of attention that accorded far to a key issue is as follows: The notion of sustainability was included in several fields and specialties. Theoretically, this assumption can surely be accepted, but practically this proposition is not true. Sustainable development is a further contestable concept regarding their embodiment. According to Hodge (1997), there are various manners of measurement that have been suggested which take into consideration the supervising and valuation of a sphere’s improvement toward sustainable development, constructed around differentiated theoretical, spatial, or temporal preoccupations. Thereafter, sustainable development can be seen as a controversial and dynamic issue and strictly linked to the decision-making process, furthermore, regarding the dynamic relationship between ecological security and wealth growth where there is an existence of a strong tradeoff between the two streams. At the beginning step of development, sustainability is a hard task to achieve because at this level the objective of the policymakers is to guarantee the capital accumulation conjointly with primary human needs, while environment quality seems to be a luxury good. Then, as development is achieved, i.e., human development, economic growth, and building institutions, African countries will invest more in the environment stream. Therefore, the ultimate challenge for the African countries is to maintain harmoniously the tradeoff between growth, environment, and human development.Footnote 1 In fact, the approach seems to be the most appealing for this specification. The relationship between growth and environment is widely treated via the so-called Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). The EKC profoundly touched by the human aspect as a pillar of sustainable development. In the same spirit, Costantini and Monni (2008) have investigated this issue by including the human aspect; their results revealed that the environment is greatly affected by the human dimension which is essential and useful to better understand this causal relationship. Even more, it should be noted the crucial perspectives given by the liberalization process which is strongly linked to the good governance mechanism and human dimension investment. Also, a major implication given from the EKC hypothesis is that, practically, to obtain an adequate saving level, maintaining sound environment quality and enhancing human development is a very hard task to beat. In our analysis of a modified version of EKC, we attempt to go further toward sustainable development by including other sustainability aspects such as governance pillar and social one. We investigate the relationship between GS− and the HDI through the use of a MEKC in order to better understand the sustainability phenomenon. Indeed, we considered a modified version of EKC by including the good governance and the human aspect in the analysis when we attempt to compute the sustainable development. Hence, the modified version of EKC is prerequisite to reach a unanimous consensus about the capability of the African’s countries to build suitable policies as a further step to beat the third-millennium challenge of sustainable development, regarding the resource abundance of Africa that underlines the great potential, with its colossal resource abundances such as geothermal, gas, and hydropower wealth. Even more, Africa as a whole has fixed ambitious integrated development strategies in order to take a part in abatement of pollutant emissions and the improvement of human capital, which we are motivated to achieve in this study in the case of Africa to examine a modified ECK; specifically, we investigate the quadratic relationship between the environmental quality (that is proxied by the genuine saving), human attainment, and governance which reflect some sustainable development aspects. For this purpose, our study uses the Johansen panel cointegration testing to investigate the existence of long-run relationship and we employed the panel error correction models through fixed effects models for 26 African countries; the time span for the data is 1990–2013. The rest of this work is structured as follows: “Literature Review” contains a brief review of the literature. “Empirical Framework” portrays the modeling strategy and data. “Empirical Results” reveals the results and discussions. “Conclusion and Policy Implications” concludes the work and gives some policy implications.",13
11.0,3.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,08 April 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-019-0584-y,The Impact of Market Power on Bank Risk-Taking: an Empirical Investigation,September 2020,Ferdaous Bahri,Taher Hamza,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The role played by banks in economic development is important enough to warrant a constant monitoring by investors and supervisory authorities, where the interest of the former is to meet their expectations regarding capital revenue and that of the latter is about establishing financial stability of the banking system. Therefore, market power is considered one of the principal indicators permitting the evaluation of the bank’s profitability and the economy’s financial stability. Particularly, market power in the banking sector has been the center of the financial world. Until present, the overall consensus states that market power is the origin of the prudent behavior of banks. Different industries are affected by competition, especially the banking industry. Indeed, the competitive behavior impacts directly both the financial stability and the market consolidation of the whole banking system. On the one hand, competition can contribute to the improvement of efficiency and productivity by enabling access to finance and reducing the cost of borrowing. On the other hand, competition authorities employ different tools to improve competition in the financial field: reducing entry barriers, allowing more bank branches, avoiding activity restrictions, and introducing or improving new lending markets, such as commercial paper or the corporate bond market. In other words, competition is considered as a whole set of objectives, including guaranteeing efficiency of the financial sector, providing access to financial services for different segments of users, and considering the possibility of tradeoffs between these objectives. There is no doubt that risk-taking by financial institutions is considered among the principal causes triggering financial crises and causing deep recessions (Jorda et al. 2013). Until now, what gives rise to such risk-taking in the first place is still unidentified. According to Bolton et al. (2015), the main reason can stem from management compensation, which regards the structure allowing managers to take advantage of good performance and do not support all the cost of poor performance. Other studies state that implicit or explicit government-guaranteed bank debt allows banks to run risks without carrying their full social costs (Kane 1986; Pennacchi 1987; Farhi and Tirole 2012). Others argue that behavioral biases lead financial firms to disregard the risk of adverse tail results (Gennaioli et al. 2012). In our research, we put forth and empirically analyze another explanation, which is market power. This is due to several studies having affirmed that the incentives to risk-taking are also affected by the market power (Keeley 1990). Thus, the main objective of this paper is to empirically examine the relationship between market power and bank risk-taking in five European countries (i.e., France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and United Kingdom) over the period 2002–2015. While some papers have used cross country data to study this relationship, we use a panel data and we extend prior studies that suffer from inherent endogeneity problems by implementing the Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) approach. Understanding the role of market power and how it impacts risk-taking is very crucial to the European banking industry. Therefore, this study contributes to the literature on several grounds. First, by studying the impact of market power on bank risk-taking for the European banks, the advantage of this dataset is to provide general conclusions regarding the theoretical considerations mentioned previously and associate these conclusions with the financial crises. To the best of our knowledge, a few studies have addressed the complex relationship between risk-taking and market power in the European context (Schaeck and Cihak 2014). The second main contribution is to test another route via which market power may have an indirect impact on banks’ risk-taking. More specifically, we study how the effect of the business cycle on banks’ risk-taking may change with the level of market power. Given the importance of this issue, Saadaoui (2014) examines the impact of market power on the relationship between the business cycle and bank behavior by using a sample of commercial banks in 50 emerging countries. More recently, Chen et al. (2015) stress the impact of the business cycle on the relationship between banks’ risk-taking and corruption. Third, despite the importance of the competition concept, few studies focus on the role of Basel III Accord in affecting the relationship between bank risk-taking and market power. This paper contributes to fill this gap by providing an overview into the possible effects of Basel III, which will start being implemented in 2013.Footnote 1 Although not yet applied, Basel III has created a broad debate among academics and practitioners (e.g., Ojo 2010; Peters 2013; Went 2010; Walker 2013), and throughout this study, we contribute to the on-going discussion on the consequences of Basel III Accord. Finally, the recent global financial crisis has produced a plethora of works that investigate its consequences. We contribute to this current area of literature by highlighting the effects of the financial crisis on European banks. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: In the first section, we present the empirical framework along with the hypotheses, followed by the empirical section describing the research methodology. The second section provides a description of the sample and the definition and measurement of the different variables, as well as the descriptive statistics and the regression analyses. The final section reports the results of the robustness test, before concluding the paper.",8

Asongu,Nicholas M. Odhiambo,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The mobile phone is transforming the lives of many by offering not just a means of quick communication but also enabling a previously unbanked fraction of the population in developing countries to have access to “mobile banking”-related services. Information and communication technology (ICT) is also being used by information sharing offices (ISO) to enhance financial allocation efficiency and financial sector development in the banking industry. The literature on the use of ISOs to enhance financial access has revolved around two main themes: the effect of decreasing information asymmetry (IA) and the relevance of creditors’ rights in consolidating mechanisms of reducing IA. In essence, one branch of the literature has been oriented fundamentally towards the relevance of better creditors’ rights in, inter alia: bankruptcy (Claessens and Klapper 2005; Djankov et al. 2007; Brockman and Unlu 2009) and bank risk-taking (Houston et al. 2010; Acharya et al. 2011). Another branch of the literature has focused on investigating how enhanced sharing of information by ISO can affect syndicated bank loans (Ivashina 2009; Tanjung et al. 2010); influence corrupt lending (Barth et al. 2009) and antitrust intervention (Coccorese 2012); mitigate the cost of credit (Brown et al. 2009); boost financial access (Asongu et al. 2016a; Triki and Gajigo 2014; Brown et al. 2009; Djankov et al. 2007); and decrease rates of default (Jappelli and Pagano 2002). The literature has substantially focused on developed nations and the emerging economies of Latin America and Asia, while the corresponding scholarship on Africa is sparse. In essence, some studies have focused on nine African countries (see Barth et al. 2009); four (Love and Mylenko 2003) and none (Galindo and Miller 2001). More recently, Triki and Gajigo (2014) assessed 42 countries for the period 2006–2009, whereas Asongu et al. (2016a, 2016b) examined 53 countries within the periodic interval of 2004 and 2011. The engaged literature can be improved in four main ways, notably by (i) focusing on African countries; (ii) investigating the complementary role of the mobile phone in information sharing to enhance financial sector development; (iii) engaging previously unexplored dimensions of financial sector development in the financial development literature; and (iv) accounting for initial levels of financial sector development. We engage the points substantively in the same chronological order. First, both the broad (Houston et al. 2010; Tanjung et al. 2010; Ivashina 2009; Galindo and Miller 2001) and African-centric (Asongu et al. 2016b; Triki and Gajigo 2014; Singh et al. 2009; Asongu and Nwachukwu 2018) literature on information sharing have not substantially explored the role of reducing information asymmetry (IA) in financial development in Africa. The neglect of the IA dimension is not very surprising because data on information sharing were only available from 2004. In the related literature, Love and Mylenko (2003) have concluded that private registries promote bank lending and reduce constraints to financial access while the corresponding effects from public credit registries are not very significant. Galindo and Miller (2001) maintain that credit registries are better drivers of financial development compared to credit bureaus. Singh et al. (2009) find that African countries with information sharing offices are rewarded with higher levels of financial access. Triki and Gajigo (2014) conclude that relative to public credit registries (PCR), financial access is more positively sensitive to private credit bureaus (PCB).Footnote 1 Asongu et al. (2016b) establish that ISOs have negatively affected financial access for the most part, while Asongu et al. (2016a) have found financial development dynamics to be less positively sensitive to PCR, compared to PCB. This study is closest to the last three inquiries that have recently employed PCB and PCR as proxies for information sharing. A common gap in the attendant studies is the failure to consider the relevance of information technology in the relationship between information sharing and financial access. This study bridges the identified gaps by involving information technology in the investigated relationship. The intuition and theoretical underpinnings supporting the relevance of information technology are substantiated in the “Theoretical Underpinnings, Propositions, and Testable Hypotheses” section. Moreover, instead of focusing on financial access as in the corresponding literature, this research is concerned with financial sector development. Furthermore, the positioning of the study is also in response to recommendations for more scholarly research on the effects of ISO (Singh et al. 2009, p. 13). Second, the motivation for investigating the complementary role of the mobile phone in information sharing to enhance financial sector development builds on the high potential for mobile phone penetration in information sharing on the continent.Footnote 2 As recently documented by Penard et al. (2012), while mobile phone penetration has reached saturation and stabilization levels in high-end markets (in Europe, North America, and Asia), there is still room for its development in Africa. Third, introducing the notion of financial sector development is motivated by the fact that, for the most part, the literature on banking development has been skewed towards bank concentration and bank participation (see Asongu 2015a; O’Toole 2014). Moreover, as documented by Aryeetey (2005), Adeusi et al. (2012), and Meagher (2013), the role of the informal financial sector has been neglected in financial development literature, partly because studies for the most part have examined the role of financial sector reforms on financial access (see Arestis et al. 2002; Batuo and Kupukile 2010). In the light of the above, by introducing the informal financial sector into the mainstream financial system definition, the study unites two branches of research by on the one hand, improving the macroeconomic literature on development within the financial sector and on the other hand, responding to an evolving branch of development studies on channels of microfinance and informal finance. In addition, the proposed approach is a pragmatic means of disentangling the impact of information sharing on various financial sectors in an economy. The propositions for financial sector development (which are discussed in-depth in the “Theoretical Underpinnings, Propositions, and Testable Hypotheses” section), improve the financial development literature in three key areas, notably by (i) providing a financial system definition that incorporates the previously missing informal financial sector; (ii) disentangling the mainstream definition of the financial system into its semi-formal and formal components; and (iii) introducing the concept of financialization within the framework of development in the financial sector. Fourth, the relevance of a modeling approach that accounts for existing levels of financial sector development builds on the intuition that blanket policies on the complementarity between mobile phones and ISO in financial sector development may not be effective unless such policies are contingent on existing financial sector development levels and tailored differently across countries with high, intermediate, and low levels of financial sector development. Hence, the adopted empirical approach is a quantile regression estimation technique that enables the investigated complementarity to be assessed throughout the conditional distributions of financial sector development. The selected approach deviates from the existing literature that has been based for the most part on mean levels of financial development, inter alia: Triki and Gajigo (2014) and Asongu et al. (2016b), who respectively have employed Probit models and the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). In light of the above, this research adds to the existing body of literature by engaging hitherto unexplored dimensions of financial sector development and investigating the role of mobile phones in information sharing for financial sector development. The rest of the study is structured as follows. The theoretical underpinnings, propositions, and testable hypotheses are presented in Section 2. Section 3 presents the data and methodology. The empirical results are presented in Section 4, while Section 5 concludes with future research directions.",5
11.0,3.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,01 May 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-019-00605-4,Sustainability Challenge in the Agenda of African Countries: Evidence from Simultaneous Equations Models,September 2020,Sofien Tiba,Mohamed Frikha,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"With the increasing widespread consciousness that looks at the ecological issue, also, the image of our blue planet provided by the Apollo astronauts has inspired the majority of grassroots organizations around the globe to give voice to their shared, damaged environment. In the same spirit, many events have launched such as the first Earth Day in 1970 and the publication of Rachel Carson’s book Silent Spring in 1962 which lead to unifying these grassroots organizations into national and international coalitions. The sustainable development question was considered as the ultimate aim of the current millennium for each society which is seen as a necessity good for the global community at a cosmopolite scale. Furthermore, the sustainable development issue has been the topic of several debates over the past two decades; thus, our work attempts to bring numerous insights from several backgrounds to shed further light on the crucial role of good governance in the development paradigm. With the publication of the report that belongs to the United Nation’s World Commission on Environment and Development (WCED 1987), the sustainability concept seems like a mantra of the third millennium. Allowing the considerable rise of external pressures has occurred at local as a transnational scale, from the entire worldwide to incorporate good governance as core activities into their blueprints and strategies in order to take a proactive role in monitoring the long-term effect of this factor into the development manifesto. Some emerging questions are related to this phenomenon such as climate change increase and inequity conjointly with the excessive use of production factors in the developed and developing economies which seek more resources and paradoxically produced a deep disparity in terms of equal access to resources and the standard of living. These developments have raised considerable criticism of traditional economic thinking and institutional frame practices. Three decades after these launched events, several reports have recorded the emergence of the ecological issue on the agenda of the world organizations. Global warming seems to be a daily issue. Obviously, the regulations seem to be inefficient responses regarding the depletion of the non-renewable natural resources. The sustainable development dilemma is a problematic issue producing several debates at the national and transnational scale aiming at fixing an adequate way to allocate colossal amounts reacting to the increasing demands for sustained development. In spite of the yearly major investment in the entire globe in the SDGs, also the general background of sustainable development has not known well its goals and wished well-being level. Our work goes further beyond the background of sustainable development as a discourse. Indeed, this phenomenon is considered as a holistic notion including good governance to the other three pillars. In the same spirit, numerous actors point out different facets of this phenomenon depending on their “needs.” On the other hand, some actors deal with access to natural resources or it is seen as simple standards of living and different consumption patterns. Obviously, not surprisingly, there are a few contributions that deal with the important insights of generating structural change in terms of good governance aspect toward reaching the main goal of the millennium. Consequently, our current work sheds more lights on the ability of good governance to influence economic, social, and ecological as an integral dimension of sustainable development. Moreover, the world actors enunciated several prominent insights and concepts linked to good governance as a sustainable development dimension from the earliest moments of the UN Human Environment Conference in 1972. However, academic and policymakers tend to discuss the development manifesto in the background the UN agenda in 1987 in its resulting report entitled Our Common Future. As this study moves toward the same path with the United Nations, the millennium goal in terms of development manifesto is well underway. Our work also goes on the same pathway of the United Nations celebration of the millennium goal that heralded development manifesto’s meteoric rise in the background of the worldwide negotiations controversy. The followers of such vision argued that the achievement of development needs momentum actions that will further concretize this notion and go from a discourse to movements, reinforced by a set of world agreements and enforcement mechanisms in order to build a set of instruments, bring the attention of world media, and stimulate further voluntary actions from all levels to beat such challenge. Thus, the consciousness of the importance of the concept of sustainability has an increasing pattern of its emergence. Obviously, this form has continued in the future, even with the existence of wealth recession. The world institutions will play their key role in terms of encouraging the local and foreign actors to go beyond the slogans to effective actions. The aim of our work is to examine the four-way linkages among the pillars of sustainable development (i.e., economic, social, ecologic, and institutional) using the simultaneous equation models by including the governance as a fourth pillar. Further, we attempt to build a composite index to measure such manifesto in order to unify the globe around a specific and clear definition of this notion and to reach a verdict consensus about his measure and the way of computing. The motivation that lies behind this present study is that the challenge of the third millennium is the path of success that the entire worldwide tries to satisfy their needs and Africa also is concerned by this issue. Many African countries have launched large-scale integrated development programs in order to decrease the environmental degradation, providing the creation of employment, developing the industrial sector, and the improvement of human capital, which we are motivated to achieve in this study in the case of Africa. Methodologically, our study uses the simultaneous equations panel data models to investigate the four-way nexus for a sample of 26 African countries covering the spanning time 1990–2013 estimated by the GMM estimator. The model allows examining simultaneously the linkage between environment, governance, social well-being, and economic growth. In addition, we employ the principal component analysis to construct the composite index. While, to the best of our knowledge, no surveys have focused on investigating the nexus between the three pillars of development through the use of the simultaneous equations models by including the governance dimension as the fourth one. Based on the four structural modeling regressions results, our insights will go beyond of understanding the dynamic four-way and its implications on this issue and providing new tools which serve the discourses about such concept, which satisfy countries’ needs while preserving the environment for future generations for African countries. The algorithm of the article is as follows: the “Literature Review” section portrays a brief literature review. The “Empirical Background” section outlines the modeling background. The “Empirical Results” section portrays the findings’ discussion. Concluding remarks and policy implications are given in the “Conclusion and Policy Implications” section.",15

Accordingly, if democracy’s “raison d’être” is ideal equality, it is conducive to seek the nature of that equality. The issues at stake relate then to unveiling the relationship between democracy and economic development, II, and poverty. Moreover, II and poverty have been increasing in countries that are mostly democratic, like the USA, Australia, Germany, and Bulgaria.Footnote 1 Such phenomena call for attention about the mechanisms that benefit, in a fair way, society’s different stakeholders. However, for some authors (e.g., Barro 1996; Rodrik 1997; Sandalcilar 2013), democracy’s effects on economic growth remain unclear and the results on this relationship are mixed. Nevertheless, in some cases, an authoritarian regime may offer a more efficient economic development than a democratic regime can. Authoritarian regimes are able to economize more through higher tax rates and other tools (Sandalcilar 2013). In recent years, several countries, mainly Asian, have known sustained growth rates, without necessarily being democratic. China is perhaps the most convincing example. The reduction of income inequality and poverty requires good financial and political will (Younsi and Bechtini 2018). In a democratic regime, policy makers try to propose convincing proposals and practical solutions, to defend the socio-economic interests of different social classes and to help the poor to invest. In contrast, the adoption of these democratic proposals and practices often require complicated and cumbersome procedures. This may provoke social problems in terms of income inequality and poverty. Therefore, good communication and effective cooperation between politics and finance play a decisive role in solving problems. Several authors have attempted to test the relationship between democracy and income inequality (e.g., Muller 1988; Lee 2005; Acemoglu et al. 2015). Others focused on the relationship between democracy and poverty (e.g., Moon and Dixon 1985; Pande 2003; Ross 2006). The results of these studies are mixed, and authors called for more theoretical and empirical investigations to better understand the nature of these relationships. As a complement for this background, this research takes into account the role of PI and tests the relationship between democracy and income inequality and/or poverty. The relationship between FD and income inequality and/or poverty has been examined by the theoretical and empirical literature using different estimation techniques. Some studies (e.g., Jeanneney and Kpodar 2008; Uddin et al. 2014; Jauch and Watzka 2016; Rashid and Intartaglia 2017; Zahonogo 2017) examined this relationship in a panel of countries or in a single country; and take into account the time and/or the geographical dimensions. On the other hand, fewer studies have focused on the relationship between FD and income inequality and/or poverty, by integrating the institutions quality as a variable. To our knowledge, no study has tested the relationship between FD, democracy/autocracy and income inequality and/or poverty. Our contribution is, among other things, to test this relationship by referring to banking and stock market indicators using several estimation techniques. Our study examines two separate samples; a panel of 93 democratic countries and a panel of 31 autocratic countries observed over the period between 1980 and 2014, focusing on poverty indicators, and between 1980 and 2012 focusing on income inequality. The results indicate that FD and democracy contribute directly and positively to narrowing the gap between the poor and the rich and to reducing poverty. On the other hand, in autocratic countries, FD and democracy contributed to exacerbating the gap between the poor and the rich and to increasing poverty. The interaction between FD and PI does not reduce income inequality and poverty for democratic countries, while it shows beneficial effects in reducing income inequality and poverty in autocratic countries. In another way, financial innovation is widely recognized. Miller (1986) and Merton (1992) have highlighted the importance of new products and services in the financial sector. Financial innovations occur because market participants are constantly searching for new ways to make greater profits. The aim of financial innovation is to make different services offered by financial system cheaper and more available. With financial innovations, market participants attempt to minimize risk and to maximize return. They imply financial innovation transforms a static economy to a dynamic one through capital formation, encouraging private investment, financial intermediation, and a higher level of saving propensity. In turn, a higher level of economic growth can be achieved. This raises the question of the importance of the financial innovation in reducing poverty and inequality. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: The second section presents a review of the literature on the different relationships between FD, PI quality, income inequality, poverty, and economic growth. In the third section, we describe our methodology. The fourth section presents and discusses the results. The fifth section concludes the paper.",14

It is a fact that cannot be denied that social media has become ever-present in our daily lives and reaches out to all age groups. Social media basically involves the use of computer-mediated tools or online communication channels to help people to create, share, generate and exchange information in virtual communities and networks. Some of these popular social media include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Twitter, just to name a few. Two common characteristics of these sites are that they are Web 2.0 applications and that they make much use of user-generated content (UGC) such as text, images, and video. Indeed UGC is the essence of these social media sites. Easy access to social media sites has been made possible due to an Internet connection that is now affordable, reliable, and easily accessible. Another factor that has greatly contributed to the wide-spread use of social media sites is the possibility of now being able to access these sites on mobile devices such as smartphones, mobile phones, and tablets. Indeed a number of countries enjoy a good 3G connection or even better and Internet users are now no longer confined to a restricted place to use social media sites. It can even be said that the notion of pervasiveness and ubiquity is present. The information exchanged can be used for leisure, recreation, advertising, marketing, information, and other numerous purposes. However, one aspect that is yet to be explored in the educational sector is to what extent social media can be used to promote innovation teaching and stimulate interest in learning. Studies have shown that Internet users spend more time on social media sites than any other sites and this is especially true for our youngsters, who are part of generation Y, techno-savvy learners. One aspect that differentiates social media from traditional media is the notion in which information flows. Typically traditional media focused on transferring information from one source to many receivers, adopting the “sage on the stage” learning model. With the adoption of social media all participants can become both a producer and a consumer of information. In general, this implies that the network of users using a particular social media site can harness an enormous amount of information to be consumed by the community. If we apply the same logic to the field of education, massive amount of collective intelligence can be created and consumed by the users of social media sites. Besides, the learning process can occur in a community where the learning can take place in an informal setting. This research attempts to explore how social media can be beneficial for the learning process whilst identifying the possible hurdles to be overcome to implement it successfully. It also adds a whole new dimension to the learning process where learning for the twenty-first century cannot be confined to within the four walls of a classroom. Indeed we are evolving in a highly digitized world where globalization is the key for future generations. As a case study, the authors will try to foresee how social media services can be used to exchange learning materials and user-generated contents amongst learners of different countries which share different background, different culture, and different ways of learning. This research will eventually introduce how social media can be used in Mauritius and Reunion Island to bring this concept of transnational advocacy. To shed light on this innovative combination between social media and education, a pertinent question raised is: Is there a true hope that this combination will bring benefits for learners as well as teachers, or is it only a passing hype? Indeed, many obstacles must be overcome before being able to successfully adopt social media in a learning context, both technically speaking, as well as from a usage point of view. Some of these challenges include—will young learners feel more motivated to learn if social media is adopted in the learning process? Will educators be willing to modify their way of transmitting knowledge to include social media in the teaching process? Is adopting social media sustainable, given the curricula, the amount of time required to develop them, and the current resources available? Are users really ready to blur the line between their social media life (which they choose to have) and education (which is generally an obligation)? What is the cost behind this trend, not only in monetary terms, but also in terms of time invested, privacy concerns, and security aspects. And finally, can this mode of education be deployed at the scale of one, or multiple countries, without causing inequalities? Thus, this research aims at assessing this opportunity under the prism of these questions by presenting the concept, the challenges and problems, and the possible solutions to take advantage of it, especially in the frame of islands such as Mauritius and Reunion. To reach this goal, social media will be presented in the first part. This will include a discussion on the features of social media, especially those mechanisms that can be exploited to facilitate the adoption of information technologies to assist the learning process. Exploring this context is what will be explored in the second part. E-learning has been used widely since many years in various ways, environments, and manners. Although it is built on a solid theoretical basis, it evolves rapidly, that is why it is interesting to depict its most current state. Finally, the third part of this research will deal with the merging of the two concepts, social media and E-learning. To do so, a general overview will be presented, and then experiments will be evoked and discussed to be ported to the frame of transnational collaboration.",5

This strand of discussion has been considered within the knowledge spillover theory of entrepreneurship (KSTE) (Acs et al. 2009a; Audretsch and Keilbach 2008; Audretsch 1995; Acs et al. 2013; Ghio et al. 2015, for literature reviews). From a policy perspective, the existence and role of the barriers to effective knowledge commercialization, denoted “knowledge filters,” have been investigated in order to assess and recommend strategies of penetrating those knowledge filters. This aims at fostering knowledge spillovers and thus, ultimately, increases (regional) economic competitiveness and growth (see e.g., Acs et al. 2004; Acs and Plummer 2005; Mueller 2006; Carlsson et al. 2009). Apart from entrepreneurial activities, i.e., the creation of new firms commercializing knowledge, the pivotal role of incumbent firms for knowledge spillover has recently been emphasized. Their ability to absorb, implement, and disseminate new knowledge has been described as having a similarly high relevance for knowledge spillovers as newly founded firms (Qian and Jung 2017). This might be particularly important for national systems of innovation characterized by a lower entrepreneurial dynamic, yet a higher ability to promote incremental innovation by smaller and long-lived small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) (Proeger 2018). In the process of digitizationFootnote 1, national institutional systems of innovation are challenged by the radical changes stemming from digital transformations on all societal levels (e.g., Hinings et al., 2018, Loebbecke and Picot 2015). Digitally innovative entrepreneurial ecosystems are becoming the central source of radical innovations transforming societies and business worldwide, serving as a transfer mechanism efficiently bridging the knowledge gap from research to market adoption (Sussan & Acs, 2017). However, the ensuing broad dissemination of that knowledge leading to substantial economic gains in terms of increased competitiveness and growth requires successful knowledge spillovers to incumbent firms on a large scale. Economies unable to absorb radical digital innovations and implement them within their specific fabric of incumbent firms will fail to reap the economic benefits and ultimately loose competitiveness. Therefore, from the perspective of (regional) policy makers aiming at establishing knowledge spillovers in the domain of digitization broadly across firms outside of those digital entrepreneurial ecosystems, incumbent firms and their specific absorptive capacities occupy a central role. Considering previous results (e.g., Bahrat & Chaudhury, 2017), it can be assumed that incumbent SMEs—constituting a central segment of firms in most economies—are likely to be an important impediment for increasing digitization due to their lower absorptive capacity for new knowledge. We thus suggest that SMEs’ reluctance to conduct digitization measures is essentially an issue of knowledge filters hampering the efficient flow of knowledge from innovative entrepreneurial sectors to SMEs. To support policy makers in designing institutions to penetrate those knowledge filter, a more specific understanding of the different knowledge filters hampering digitization in SMEs is required. In this study, we contribute to this research goal by exploiting a novel dataset of German SMEs from the “German Mittelstand” (De Massis et al. 2017) participating in a federal innovation program detailing their degree of digitization in different intra-firm domains. The questionnaire is used as a support mechanism by professional association of the German craft sector for the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy and is conducted by innovation consultants with firm representatives (for an extended description and analysis of the program, see Runst et al. (2018). Our dataset encompasses data on 200 German SMEs of different sizes as well as market and regional backgrounds. The respective firms participated in an extensive questionnaire on all aspects of their firm’s level of digitization, which includes communication with customers and B2B sales, internal firm processes, development of digital business models, degree of employee training, and IT security. Using this unique dataset, we analyze domain-specific digitization effectiveness as well as its structural drivers and interpret those patterns as a measure on the effectiveness of their penetration of domain-specific knowledge filters. Additionally, we look at the relationship between digitization effectiveness in different intra-firm domains. These analyses allow us to provide policy and managerial implication for decision-makers interested in designing institutions fostering digitization-related knowledge spillovers in SMEs. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Chapter two explains the research context of this paper; chapter three explains the dataset, while the fourth chapter shows our analyses. Finally, chapter five provides a concluding discussion and policy implications of our results.",15

The knowledge economy is one of the most important concepts that apply economic management processes to acquire knowledge. Hence, economic theories, related to economic institutions’ inputs, processes, and outputs have been applied to educational institutions. If goods and services are the outputs of administrative processes in economics, the knowledge and skills acquired by students are the outputs of educational institutions. Therefore, the economic character of the concept of the knowledge economy relates to the similarities in the processes applied by the educational institutions. The knowledge economy’s inputs and outputs are the knowledge and skills acquired by learners. Economic institutions deal with materials, money, goods, and services as inputs and outputs. In addition, government educational institutions are becoming self-reliant institutions and, similar to economic institutions, are implementing economic policies (Joseph and Payne 2011). Knowledge is now regarded as both a global and local economic asset and the basis of both national and international competitive advantage. Accordingly, education at all levels and, more especially, higher education with its potential to enhance productivity through research and through its partnerships with the industrial and economic sectors is seen to be the global panacea to economic policy (Peters and Humes 2003). The term knowledge economy is associated with other similar terms such as knowledge-based economy and knowledge management; the differences are in the application of these terms (Ibrahim et al. 2018). The concept of the knowledge economy was accompanied by the advent of globalization processes that brought about new concepts in economics, technology, and knowledge (Craig and Gunnn 2010, p. 109; Jowi 2012, p. 163). Since the end of the twentieth century and through the beginning of the twenty-first century, knowledge has become more about size and ways of presentation. This is especially so since electronic and smart devices have become widely available. In this area, the responsibility lies more with the educational institutions in order to provide their students with this knowledge about the appropriate coverage and, then, to employ them both effectively and developmentally. Therefore, for universities, the knowledge economy measures have become a global necessity in establishing their abilities ability to acquire the appropriate knowledge for students and, consequently, to make best use of this knowledge in the labor market (Bejinaru 2018, p. 267). While there are many positives to the application of the knowledge economy to university education, it is necessary to be aware of the negative repercussions to universities if they are changed into institutions similar to economic institutions (Jesson 2010, p. 79). Many studies have dealt with the extent of the knowledge economy and the skills of university students. According Soraty’s (2005) study, the Arab countries’ higher education institutions need to develop their inputs and dimensions to suit the knowledge economy’s requirements Of course, this general provision needs to be examined at the micro-level in educational institutions and the solutions developed in proportion to the nature of each institution. Bejinaru’s (2018) study aims to identify the necessary level of students’ competencies according to the knowledge economies’ requirements. It shows that the students are aware of what is important to them since they rate highly strategic thinking and problem solving issues and, thereafter, show an average rating on collecting and organizing information. The half-down rated skills are creative thinking and learning because, given the time allocated to study, the risks and implied uncertainty, they require more cognitive effort. With regard to the micro-level employment of knowledge economy skills in university courses, Abu Tineh and AlKassap’s (2016) study shows that the use of knowledge economy skills has a positive effect in improving learning outcomes from the courses. At a larger level, some articles have studied these skills at a specific university from the viewpoints of both faculty members and students. For example, Al-Arede’s (2012) study was based on measuring the level of application of knowledge economy skills from the academic staff viewpoint. In the same way, the findings of Ibrahim et al.’s (2018) study show that the dissemination of the knowledge economy and the faculty member’s role in spreading the concept of the knowledge economy has positive impacts on university education. However, there is a negative impact on the university from supporting and encouraging innovation and supporting student projects. Ozaizi and Hodabi (2018) explain that the Sana’a University’s faculty members rate current knowledge economy as being very low. At the same level, the findings of Happ et al.’s (2018) study demonstrate that, when beginning higher education studies in business and economics, there is a heterogeneity in students’ knowledge of economics. This highlights the importance of designing target-oriented teaching methods that take into consideration the study-relevant (prior) knowledge of new students. On the other hand, there are studies, such as Connell (2015), Cheeseman et al. (2014) in the case of Australia, From and Olofsson in the case of Sweden, Shah (2012) in the case of Pakistan, Chen (2012) in the case of China, and Suciu et al. (2011) on Romanian universities that analyze the economic aspects of knowledge economy at the state level as a whole. In particular, the findings of Rababa and Hayajna’s (2016) study analyze the aspects of the knowledge economy in Jordanian universities. The study shows that there are administrative challenges in applying knowledge economy skills. In addition, other studies considered other specific topics of knowledge economy in universities such as the issue of scientific research. Nazih’s (2016) study deals with the scientific research conducted at Med V University-Souissi and to what extent it suits the characteristics of the knowledge economy. Having regard to the indexed publications, brevets, citations, etc., his study’s findings show the weakness of scientific research at this University. Developmentally, as shown by Alarfaj’s (2019) findings, some studies have worked on developing higher education curricula to suit the requirements of the knowledge economy. These studies ended by presenting a paradigm for the development of the curricula in light of the requirements of the knowledge economy and the needs of the labor market. In the area of international and regional and cooperation, Kitagawa’s (2004) findings show that researchers, university administrators, and policy makers need to be more aware of the range and levels of universities’ regional engagement universities and the factors that influence those forms of engagement. By capitalizing on resources available within the global knowledge economy, universities, along with their partners, have to develop strategies and instruments appropriate to their own needs. From consulting experts on the subject, Bosetti and Walker’s (2010) paper draws upon the experiences and perceptions of ten United Kingdom university vice-chancellors on the challenges that they face in providing leadership and strategic direction for their institutions in the twenty-first century. In relation to this study’s community, it can be said that many Jordanian society studies on have studied educational institutions such as universities (Taher et al. 2011; Al-Arede 2012; Rababa and Hayajna 2016 and Al-Smadi 2018), schools (Roozbeh 2010; Al Basheer et al. 2012; Hawaldah 2018), government (Elsheikh et al. 2008), and economic institutions (Al-Jaghoub 2003; Al-Jaghoub 2004; Al Maietah 2010; Almarabeh 2011; Ayoub et al. 2017 andRamadan et al. 2017). From the Jordanian vision, the Education Reform for a Knowledge Economy (ERfKE) project, implemented by the Ministry of Education (MoE), is expected to modernize the economy through four components. These are the following: reorientation of educational policy objectives through governance and administrative reform; transformation of education programs and practices to achieve learning outcomes relevant to the knowledge economy; supporting the provision of quality learning environments; and promoting learning readiness for early childhood education (Erickson 2009; Kubow 2010). However, in reality, Jordanian universities face significant administrative and economic challenges to achieving these goals (Taher et al. 2011). In relation to linking this to the university’s functions, Al Zboon et al.’s (2009) and Hawaldah’s (2018) findings show that Jordanian educational experts and university graduates have a high level of awareness of the knowledge economy processes. However, the university’s role in acquiring these skills must be ascertained because of the contribution of other factors. Hence, the role of university education has to appear to provide the students with the skills of the knowledge economy. Therefore, some studies (Al-Smadi 2012) have pointed to the need to develop the capacity of Jordanian universities to operate within the knowledge economy.",2

Asongu,Nicholas M. Odhiambo,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"It is a proven fact that in this contemporary époque, for nations to survive the challenges of globalisation, they need knowledge-based economies (KBEs) (Tchamyou 2017; Parcero and Ryan 2017; Vadra 2017). KBEs which are essential for competition in the twenty-first century have been at the centre of key policy reports from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Bank during the past decade (Tchamyou 2017; Amavilah et al. 2017; Gama et al. 2018; Asongu 2017a; Asongu and Tchamyou 2019a). It is within this policy framework that the relevance of KBE has been mastered by North America, Japan and Europe, which have inexorably been determining the pattern of economic development in the international arena. While other developing countries in Latin America and Asia have been catching up with calculated moves that emphasise the importance of KBE in the pursuit of their regional and national goals (Tchamyou 2017; Chandra and Yokoyama 2011; Dahlman 2007; Shahabadi et al. 2017)Footnote 1, the overall index of knowledge economy (KE) in Africa has been decreasing since the beginning of the third millennium (Anyanwu 2012). In order for African countries to brace the challenge of globalisation, appropriate policies are needed to catch up with frontier countries (Asongu 2016). Unfortunately, the existing literature has failed to provide a logical structure for the policies and strategies with which to enhance the knowledge economy in Africa. This paper bridges the underlying gap by summarising what we know so far about measures with which African countries can accelerate their march towards KBE. For the most part, the literature has highlighted the need for more scholarly research on KE policies in order to reduce the gap between backward countries and benchmark nations (Asongu 2017b). To the best of our knowledge, no study has systematically reviewed the existing KE literature in order to provide policymakers with the much needed policies and strategies essential for the catch-up process. Therefore, there is a need for research that could bridge the identified gap by organising what is known so far in the KE literature on catch-up lessons and strategies. It the light of the foregoing, the research question answered by this inquiry is: what evidence is documented in the recent literature with regard to policies and strategies with which the progress towards knowledge-based economies can be consolidated in Africa? The knowledge economy policies and strategies are structured along three main pillars of the World Bank’s knowledge economy index: education and skilled population, economic incentives and institutional regime and information and communication technology (ICT). The rest of the study is organised in the three main dimensions of the World Bank’s Knowledge Economy Index. The methodology of the systematic review is provided in Section 2. Section 3 and Section 4 are focused, respectively, on education and information and communication technology. Section 5 discusses economic incentives and institutional regime. We conclude in Section 6 with a summary of policy recommendations and future research directions.",14
11.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,15 November 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-019-00623-2,Micro-Foundation of Knowledge Creation Theory: Development of a Conceptual Framework Theory,December 2020,Sunday Bolade,Stavros Sindakis,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The increasing turbulent environment now forces knowledge management (KM), though an emerging field, into the heart of the mainstream services, research, innovation, and new product development (NPD) across sectors and industries. Thus, it is fast gaining increasing attention and support from both the academic and business communities as more organizations now create KM desks, and economic sectors demand knowledge-creative workers to help them navigate the current turbulent, market environment via creating a blue ocean market space. Unfortunately, however, this mission remains a mirage. This is particularly so because, at both governmental and business fronts, leaders fail to deliver results as a proof of possessing knowledge (Denford 2013). Also, employees lacking in tacit knowledge tend to lag, while those lacking in superior explicit knowledge are strategically weak to evolve functional path to innovation and economic growth (Durcikova and Everard 2002). Worst still, the academics, which supposed to provide the panacea to shortcomings of the government and business leaders, is wrought with misconceptions of different status (Serenko and Bontis 2013). The extant literature is flawed with several misconceptions that are capable of misleading e.g. the tokenization of the organization as a living organism capable of engaging in reasoning and thinking led to the organizational theory of KC (a theory that sells continous typological conversion and portrays KC process as a thing that can only be achieved in a group), the notion that the knower and the known can be separated led to calling of user’s manuals, formulas, and policies as knowlede. So, how can knowledge benefit the society when the extant literature is embodied with misconceptions and confusions (Storey and Barnett 2000; Jakubik 2007). For instance, here is the comment of Jakubik (2007): The knowledge landscape is very complex and controversial. In many cases ‘knowledge’ is defined and understood differently by the authors. In the Literature, there are many types of knowledge identified (e.g., tacit knowledge, tacit embodied knowledge, tacit not-yet-embodied knowledge, self-transcending knowledge) or the same knowledge could be called differently (e.g., tacit knowledge, know-how, knowing, experiential knowledge, implicit knowledge, sticky knowledge). All these make the understanding of knowledge very confusing. (p. 6) In the same manner, critique from Gourlay (2006) unequivocally flawed the main assumptions when he said “knowledge is not created by some relation (or ‘interaction’) between two kinds of knowledge but through human activities or practices” (p. 1428), while Cook and Brown (1999) critiqued that one form of knowledge cannot be converted into the other, neither tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge nor explicit knowledge into tacit knowledge (Jakubik 2011). So, we argue that (1) typological conversion cannot be a basis for KC theory; (2) that the psycho-sociological perspective of the Nonaka’s theory is socially situated, thus, does not reflect individualistic effort; and (3) that Nonaka’s (1991, 1994) proposition that both the knower and the known are separated negates the general belief that knowledge is created and resides in the head. On the bases of these, we believe that there is a dare need for a new theory that fills these gaps. Therefore, through the objectives of this paper, the following research question: Is knowledge a result of a social process, organizational process, or psycho-cognitive process? Will be investigated against the fact that knowledge is the abstractive substance of interpretation given to the transformation of information via transformative interaction between information and the triad of the mental model (experience, beliefs, and reflection), intelligence, and context. To this end, this paper’s objectives are (1) to assess the state of misconceptions surrounding the current knowledge creation theory—Nonaka’s organizational knowledge creation theory—against the general belief that knowledge is created in mind and that it resides in knowers head, (2) to propose a paradigm shift for knowledge creation by providing insights into personalized KC process via exploration of psycho-cognitive perspective (PCP) on KC theory. This is a new paradigm, different from the psycho-sociological perspective and, to the best of our knowledge, never been deployed in KM literature to the level used in this paper. The new paradigm, as a proposed perspective, explains how new ideas are produced and how the depth of understanding (as a function of the mental model that birth expertise) develops. The PCP is even crucial for clarifying issues related to how knowledge is created in communities, a concern raised by other authors such as Cook and Brown (1999), Tsoukas (2000), Zboralski (2009), Sun (2010), and Henttonen et al. (2016). Consequently, this paper will, in addition to providing psycho-cognitive perspective that is capable of providing the microscopic account of how the mind and the brain work harmoniously to afford knowledge, also addresses concerns raised by authors (e.g., Deary et al. 2009) bothering on whether general cognitive-ability differences account for better performance that is based on mental tasks, irrespective of content, or whether the differences are hidden in a mental faculty that stimulates cognitive tasks generally, and whether it involves verbal or nonverbal types of mental work. So, in the sections that follow immediately, various misconceptions and gaps in knowledge creation literature were highlighted. In “The Micro-Foundations of Knowledge Creation: Psycho-Cognitive Perspective” section, a theoretical proposition, based on brain and mind sciences, was deployed to theorize individualized/personalized knowledge creation. The “Linking of PCP on KC to Nonaka’s Theory” section provides details about the mental model and its role in granting understanding, hence, knowledge. Then, a conclusive summary of the process was given.",9

A sequel, an international symposium themed The Economic Epic of Earth’s Evolution and co-hosted by the West Coast Headquarters of the United States National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine and the University of California, Irvine (UC Irvine) on February 7, 2014, generated this opportunity’s centerpiece: a resort business model that engages scientific research to chart a new geography, diplomacy, and conservation legacy for the knowledge economy (UC Irvine 2014). These two events marked cherished milestones in a most rewarding professional-cum-personal journey. They also acted as springboards towards further consolidation and rigorous vetting of a mission I have pursued since the 1990s: a mission to lay the foundations for a new economic geography structured by transnational bridges of knowledge that value the presently economically uncharted yet uniquely unifying territory of the earth’s evolutionary and ecological fabric and the priceless knowledge resource woven into this fabric. This endeavor has involved two parallel foci. One focus has been shaped by my assertion that the knowledge-based economy’s premise on investments in research parks, scientific cities, and knowledge-based industries leaves out a dormant mega-reserve of the strength and sustainability of this twenty-first century economy. This mega-reserve, I have argued, is contained in the still largely unspoiled landscapes and seascapes of our planet, involving such features as rainforests, coral reefs, and other spectacularly biodiverse habitats. I view these extraordinary natural environments, most opulent in the world’s tropics, as treasuries of the knowledge mineral—the “raw material” of potential scientific knowledge that could define this new economy as profoundly as oil has shaped the industrial economy, not replacing oil but vastly outperforming it in endurance and lasting benefit to humanity. The following comparison is crucial to this daring prediction. The global volume of oil, or mineral ores, is just a sum of their deposits across the world. In contrast, the knowledge mineral grows in volume and, importantly, worth in the context of transcontinental evolutionary and ecological relationships that have a great potential to yield scientific discoveries and to revolutionize basic scientific research. And, unlike oil or mineral ore deposits, which are depleted over time, these transnational veins of the knowledge mineral actually increase in volume and value the more they are explored and used. The implications for sustainable development and conservation are profound. A new economic outlook could emerge for some of the world’s poorer nations that collectively hold a lion’s share of the mega-diverse natural environments harboring huge untapped possibilities for scientific exploration that can lead to new knowledge and wealth creation. Transnational conservation projects could acquire an unprecedented momentum and investment draw by becoming integral components of novel economic blocks whose member nations could rise as prominent players in the knowledge economy. However, these outlooks entail a critical pre-condition. They must elevate the open-ended scientific exploration that will drive them above its current dependency on and struggle for government funding, to the command of stature in the world of corporate and private investments—a stature fuelled by rewards other than immediate profit-making. This position, which underpins the other core focus of my mission, has grown from my reflections on the work in economics that defines the distinctive properties of knowledge as a public good (see Nelson 1959 and Arrow 1962 as the classic references) and from a question I posed to myself: Is there an industry of global presence and of an existing or potential business model that could defy the established paradigm of the incompatibility of “private profit opportunities” and “knowledge as public good”? I have answered this question by positing that the international tourism industry, led by the resort industry, could deliver this singular exception. Central to this perspective is the disclosure of the unmatched potential of the resort enterprise to reap major business dividends from investments in geographically unrestrained, monopoly-free basic research endeavors and, in the process, uniquely to facilitate the transformative scale of the economic model that treats the knowledge-rich natural capital as a lifeline of the global knowledge economy. In a recent article, I endeavored to deliver a comprehensive presentation of the aforementioned two foci: of the original economic and business models that were shaped by this process and of the key publications, endorsements, and other recognitions of these two models’ joint capacity to shepherd transnational units of sustainable development cemented by science diplomacy and guarding giant pools of natural riches as their most precious stock (Ayala 2017). Emphasizing the “strategic synergies” that intertwine these economic and business models, I assert that tourism-based economies and knowledge economies, viewed in conventional terms as two dramatically different scenarios of economic development, can be combined to yield a major new economic model since they share a resource base of critical importance to their strength and growth potential—a resource under threat and gradually disappearing throughout the world. At both the conceptual and applied levels, the article seeks to complement existing directions and achievements in environmental economics, international conservation, and other relevant fields, guided by the aspiration to introduce new angles and catalysts of their confluence towards facilitating sustainable prosperity that is powered by knowledge and nurtured by heritage. The present article expands on the business model and its ambition to awaken the extraordinary potential of the global crop of environmentally progressive resorts and ecophilanthropy-minded private estates collectively to provide a logistical and investment foundation for building transnational knowledge economies that draw strength from and strengthen the world’s premier natural heritage reserves. Part I of this article, titled “Nature’s Connectivity as a Development Philosophy,” chronicles the business model’s evolution, the academic credentials it entails, and the assurances it acquired when tested in a variety of geographical and cultural settings. It unfolds from two powerful sources of inspiration that opened my eyes to major untapped reserves of the resort product and the international resort industry, namely, hotel concepts native to Japan and Spain (Ayala 1991a). This retrospective provides the foundation on which, in Part II, I introduce the “Transnational Resort: The Power Broker of a Genuinely Global Knowledge Economy.” With references to the latest relevant trends in the industry, this blueprint extends the notion of luxury to a provision of a striking new intellectual dimension that opens new frontiers for “legacy investments” and bases the criteria for flagship projects on their capacity to stimulate economically savvy science and conservation collaborations among nations, corporations, and institutions not yet perceived as strategic partners in the current scenarios of international trade.",
11.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,09 December 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-019-00625-0,Tales of Serendipity in Highly Cited Research: an Explorative Study,December 2020,Carter Bloch,Mads P. Sørensen,Mitchell Young,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Research and innovation have been attributed a growing role in maintaining global competitiveness and socio-economic progress; in particular, major research advances are seen as important catalysts for innovation and growth. This has heightened focus on monitoring scientific excellence and how it can be fostered (OECD, 2014; Sørensen et al., 2016; Young, 2015). While there clearly is a renewed interest in scientific advances, studies of science have long been concerned with new discoveries, how they occur, and their impacts. For example, the pursuit of new discoveries was a focal point in much work on the sociology of science in the 1950s and 1960s by Robert K. Merton and othersFootnote 1. Merton (1957) argued that the main driver of research advances is priority of discovery and the recognition of the scientific community as being first to create an advance, while Hagstrom (1965) emphasized the intrinsic satisfaction of making a discovery. Merton and Barber (2004) review a number of personal accounts and opinions by researchers that emphasize the unanticipated nature of many advances, arguing that deliberate and planned research may oversee important discoveries, or that discoveries may be substantially different from what was planned—for which they introduce the term serendipity. In defining this, they quote Irving Langmuir (former director of General Electric laboratories in the 1940s and 1950s): “You can’t plan to make discoveries. But you can plan work that will probably lead to discoveries [ …] you can organize a laboratory so as to increase the probabilities that things will happen there. And in doing so, keep the flexibility, keep the freedom.”Footnote 2 This distinction between planning work processes and constructing work environments is important to further work on serendipity. Serendipity can be defined as “the act of finding answers to questions not yet posed” (Stephan, 2010). However, serendipity can also be linked to the discovery process in different ways (Murayama et al., 2015). Roberts (1989) distinguishes between “pseudo-serendipity,” “the accidental discovery of ways to achieve an end sought for” and “(true) serendipity, which describes accidental discovery of things not sought for,” though he notes that both can be equally important in the contributions that they make. Yaqub (2018) seeks to characterize the different variants of serendipity and how it is perceived by examining examples of serendipity documented in Robert K. Merton’s archive of notes and materials. From these known examples of serendipity in the archive, he identifies four types of serendipity based on the motivations (did the research have a specific problem in mind) and outcomes (did they solve that problem or an unexpected one) of the research: Walpolian serendipity, targeted search solving unexpected problems; Mertonian serendipity, targeted search solving expected problems via unexpected routes; Bushian serendipity, untargeted search solving immediate problems; and Stephanian serendipity, untargeted search solving later problems. Even with this recognition of a potential role for serendipity, our knowledge of how scientific advances occur is fairly limited. Heinze et al. (2009) examines 20 cases of highly creative research accomplishments within nanotechnology and human genetics. They analyze group level and broader organizational and institutional factors. The case studies confirm widely held beliefs that small group size and autonomy are important for scientific excellence, and also found that intensive within-group communication was vital, though close contact with external groups were also important. Hemlin et al. (2008) also consider the role of research environments in promoting scientific creativity. They develop the concept of “creative research environments” and outline a framework that identifies the main institutional, individual and group-related factors that act to promote scientific creativity. Stanley and Lehman (2015) use computer science research into artificial intelligence to develop a theory about “non-objective” search and discovery, which has a number of implications for understanding how research advances come about. They argue that advances are more often the result of searches for novel findings as opposed to research driven by broad-reaching objectives. Given this, an over-reliance on goals and objectives can be counterproductive: “Objectives might sometimes provide meaning or direction, but they also limit our freedom and become straitjackets around our desire to explore (Stanley and Lehman: 3).” Murayama et al. (2015) explore the role of managerial and organizational factors for serendipity. They examine whether the pursuit of serendipity has a positive effect on the quality of research and how increased division of labor and management influences researchers’ ability to pursue unintended findings. Their analysis is based on a survey of researchers, both authors of top 1% highly cited papers and a randomly selected control group, in the USA and Japan. They find that the pursuit of serendipity leads to greater citation impact, and that managers that are also leading scientists have positive impact on serendipity. In contrast, professional research managers are associated with higher productivity, but at the cost of less opportunity to pursue unexpected results. This paper approaches serendipity differently than the authors in the brief literature review above in two respects: first, the cases are not preselected for serendipity and second, by introducing a temporal element through a narrative approach, we explore the micro-level of elements that occur within the research process, the when and how of serendipity. In contrast with Yaqub (2018) who begins with known examples of serendipity from Merton’s archive, we approach the topic with a small number of cases that have not been preidentified as serendipitous; instead they are preselected by their high-citedness. Through a narrative analysis, we seek to learn more about how the first authors of 12 highly cited papers have experienced the research process behind these papers and especially the role of planned and unplanned factors. We look at their perceptions of the process from idea to outcome, key turning points, and factors that influence how the process unfolds. By interviewing the lead authors of highly cited papers, we hope to generate insights for refining future studies of serendipity and the role of planned and unplanned factors in highly cited research. The aim is to learn not only about the role of serendipity in the 12 concrete cases, as the lead authors of these papers have experienced them, but also to explore how serendipity can be understood and characterized, about possible variations within existing typologies and additional types of serendipity, and the stages in the research process at which serendipity can occur. We examine the above listed questions through the narratives of first authors of 12 highly cited papers. We believe that their perceptions of how the research progressed, the experience of key turning points and the conditions for the research are important in illustrating what motivates and influences researchers’ pursuit of new discoveries. However, it is important to emphasize that our study should be seen as an explorative step in refining how to go about researching these questions. Thus, we hope our study will inspire other researchers to examine these questions in more depth. Especially, we imagine that the typology, presented in the “Discussion” at the end of the paper, can be developed further and tested empirically in larger samples by other scholars. We have chosen to focus on the narratives of highly cited research for a number of reasons. First, high-citedness is valued by both researchers and policy communities and is also the subject of indicators of excellence, making it very relevant to learn more about the research that lies behind highly cited work. Second, while papers can be cited for a number of reasons and high citation is no guarantee of quality, high-citedness nevertheless reflects strong visibility and is often associated with important research results. As described below, we have manually eliminated articles that were highly cited for reasons that prima facie did not have to do with quality or novelty, i.e., review articles or software. Third, we view highly cited papers as an interesting subset of research work that is restrictive but at the same time holds more variation than, for example, if we were to limit ourselves only to high profile work that has been recognized through prizes and related review processes. Finally, it is also interesting how researchers themselves perceive the fact that their paper is very highly cited, a point that is explored in the analysis. The next section outlines the approaches used in the analysis. Following this, we present the results of the study and give examples of how serendipity shows up in the examined cases. The final section concludes with a discussion of implications for future research into serendipity’s role in highly cited research. Although serendipity has been researched for more than 60 years, we still know very little about its role in highly cited research. We hope that our paper will inspire others to examine this question further. Only in this way can we redesign funding schemes so that they are open to serendipity, when this phenomenon occurs.",1

Knowledge based on research and development is also a chief support of economic growth according to the economic-growth literature (e.g., Romer 1986; Jones 1999). The focus of the current study is to identify factors that drive researchers’ sheer determination to engage in scientific research and hence publications of scientific articles year after year. There is a growing concern regarding a number of universal cultural dimensions found significant for economic development based on cross-country case studies. The apparent one is individualism—Gorodnichenko and Roland (2011, 2017), Hansen (2013), and Williams and McGuire (2010) found a positive effect for this cultural dimension on economic prosperity in the United States (US) and other areas of the world. Nevertheless, effects of the cultural dimensions on the development of scientific knowledge have not been scrutinized by past studies. The absence of this investigation is a significant research gap because scientific knowledge is a chief determinant of economic development and institutional quality. Policy making requires detailed analyses and understandings of the causes of specific socioeconomic problems, as coined by the textbook knowledge in macroeconomics (Snowdon and Vane 2005, p. 7). This paper contributes to the literature by revealing the cultural dimensions—in comparison with the dimension of individualism—found to promote scientific development based on a multi-country case study. This paper follows the concept of “collective mental programming” articulated by Hofstede (1980), considering the cultural characteristics at the societal level. This context is in line with the data characteristics used by the aforementioned literature with regard to individualism. Based on Gorodnichenko and Roland’s (2011, 2017) study, individualism is theorized as a deeply rooted factor of economic growth, asserting it as a cultural drive that fosters innovation in exchange for monetary and social status rewards. Accordingly, Hansen (2013) shows that the second generation of US immigrants earns higher annual salaries owing to the US high degree of individualism. Furthermore, the degree of individualism also contributes to economic creativity according to Williams and McGuire (2010). Other cultural dimensions are either found less robust or with a negative effect. Nevertheless, the research gap in this paper implies that the findings of past studies cannot be generalized to the case of scientific-knowledge development. As scientific knowledge is a distinct development, its progression is hypothesized to be influenced differently by the cultural dimensions. In the models, confounding issues are justified by the direct-vertical socialization theory (e.g., Bisin and Verdier 2000) while regarding culture as a difficult-to-change phenomenon amid the concept of collective mental programming (Hofstede 1980). This strategy treats culture as purely a long-term socialization of cultural characteristics from parents to children, and its effect on scientific-knowledge development is not influenced by environmental, institutional, and economic factors. This approach is consistent with Hansen’s (2013) epidemiological approach in separating cultural effects from formal institutions. For ensuring empirical robustness, however, this paper also controls for the degree of human development as a possible confounder. Furthermore, the modeling design is consistent with the aggregating nature of the cultural data in terms of tracing the impact of cultural characteristics at the societal level, rather than of individuals (Hofstede 2001; Schwartz 2008). Correlations are generally low and medium among the independent variables and are hence not expected to distort the regression results. The findings show a mix of positive and negative effects from seven cultural dimensions. Six are found to have a positive effect, including individualism. In particular, the hierarchy dimension, due to its emphasis on ensuring responsible and productive behaviors (Schwartz 2008), is found to be the most powerful factor of scientific-knowledge development in this multi-country case study. In contrast, the interaction of hierarchy and its polarized cultural dimension, egalitarianism, is found to have a negative effect on scientific-knowledge development. Because hierarchy has a long history in all countries, although differing by degree, understanding the influence of this cultural dimension on scientific-knowledge development is essential for policy makers looking to promote scientific knowledge for economic and institutional evolutions. The remaining sections of this paper are as follows: empirical framework, results and discussions, and concluding remarks.",1

In fact, the idea that globalization promotes democracy goes back to Kant (1795). Two stands of literature can be identified. The first group of studies argues that indirect relationship exists between globalization and democracy: globalization, by enhancing the efficiency of resource allocation, leads to the economic development that fosters demands for democracy (Schumpter 1950; Lipset 1959; Hayek 1960; López-Córdova and Meissner 2005). The second group finds evidence that there is a direct link between globalization and democracy: the key democratizing forces associated with globalization depend on each country’s relative factor endowment. Globalization helps to consolidate democracy in labor-abundant countries by making coups by elites less likely. In contrast, in capital-abundant countries, globalization tends to amplify the gap between rich and poor. Elites are more willing to accept the costs and risks of repression in an attempt to limit citizens’ political power, making authoritarianism more likely (Doces and Magee 2015; Ahlquist and Wibbels 2012; Yu 2010; Eichengreen and Leblang 2008; López-Córdova and Meissner 2008; O’Rourke and Taylor’s 2006). Note that, the research studying the relationship between globalization and democratization uses a variety of measures. More specifically, trade openness is principally used as the aspect of globalization driving democracy, which is the aspect we consider in our paper. In this paper, we focus on the direct link between globalization and democracy. Nevertheless, we do not maintain the “limited” proposition that only relative factor abundance influences patterns of trade and then conditions the political effects of trade.Footnote 1 We argue that the key democratizing forces associated with trade openness depend on each country’s demographic dynamic. Our argument emerges in the so-called “demographic transition”—a process which involves first a decline in mortality rates and then a reduction in fertility (Lee 2003). In fact, countries are at different stages of their demographic transition. Some countries are aging quickly while others are reaping a “demographic dividend” from a younger population (Eberstadt 2012). Literature on the relationship between demography and trade has identified this international difference in population dynamics as a factor determining comparative advantage of trade. More specifically, Yakita (2012) shows that countries with an aging populationFootnote 2 are not necessarily net exporters of capital-intensive goods. In addition, demographic change also has significant effects on capital flows and trade balance. Lührmann (2003) has shown that economies with high and rising elderly dependency ratios can register net capital inflows and trade deficits. We believe that this interaction between trade and demography could provide a more compelling theoretical argument about the relationship between trade and democracy. Research on the impact of globalization on democracy has neglected demographic aspects, which have essentially been developed independently with little or no crossovers. Globalization-democracy and demography-democracy relationships respectively have lived separately, but one obvious link is that demographic aspect may affect trade and democracy nexus. By combining different strands of literature, this paper aims to disentangle the relationship between globalization, democracy, and demography. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the role of demography in the relationship between globalization and democracy. We challenge not only the view that globalization impacts the transition to democratic politics, but we also maintain that there is another major societal phenomenon, the demographic transition, that plays at least as important a role in democratization and particularly on globalization-democracy nexus. To this aim, we use the threshold methodology of Hansen (1999). This methodology allows us to determine demographic thresholds through changes in the estimated relationship between globalization and democracy, considering the possibility of endogenous sample separation, rather than imposing a priori an arbitrary classification scheme. In addition, in order to control for potential endogeneity of trade, we use the extended version of Hansen’s panel threshold model proposed by Kremer et al. (2013) in which lagged values of regressors and generalized methods of moments (GMM) procedure are used to avoid the potential endogenous regressor problem. Based on a panel data of 97 countries between 1993 and 2013, our results confirm in general the existence of non-linear relationship between globalization and democracy. We identify two regimes of demographic transition, “late demographic transition regime” and “early demographic transition regime,” and prove that countries’ specific characteristics in each regime determine the impact of globalization on democracy. Our results are robust to alternative measure of democracy but less robust to those of demography. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: “Theoretical Background” presents the theoretical background on the links between globalization, democracy, and demography. “Empirical Strategy” describes the empirical model and the data. “Empirical Results” discusses our econometric results, “Robustness Check” gives a supporting evidence of the obtained results, and “Conclusion” summarizes our findings and gives some concluding remarks.",2

Universities are no longer positioned as institutions of higher learning only but are seen as one of the key factors of technological development, competitiveness, and economic progress. As a result, policymakers at local, regional, national, and European levels are aiming to promote and stimulate the level of collaboration between the universities and their industry partners. As a consequence, many universities around the globe have turned to academic entrepreneurship in order to commercialise faculty research. Academic entrepreneurship can be defined as all commercialisation activities outside of the normal university duties of basic research and teaching, such as spin-off firms, consulting, sales, testing, large-scale science projects, contracted research, and external teaching (see Klofsten and Jones-Evans 2000). The emergence of the knowledge economy is not confined only to high-technology services, it has spread across all sectors of market economies since the 1970s, and this shift to knowledge-based economic activity is considered to be the driving force underlying the emergence of the entrepreneurial economy (Audretsch and Thurik 2001). Despite growing evidence that commercialisation of the academic research may face numerous challenges, literature offers little explanation of barriers which prevent academic-industry collaboration (Bruneel, D’Este, and Salter 2010). Although there has been an extensive research into academic entrepreneurship, Wright (2014) argues that our understanding is limited because it does not allow us to understand ‘both the heterogeneity of academic entrepreneurship and the heterogeneity of the context in which it occurs’ (p. 329). This gap is surprising, as there is a growing recognition in entrepreneurship research that entrepreneurship ‘can be better understood within its historical, temporal, institutional, spatial, and social contexts’ (Welter 2011: 65). From this perspective, the socio-economic context where entrepreneurs are embedded is seen as a key factor which has an impact on the extent of entrepreneurship as well as the way entrepreneurs behave (Welter and Smallbone 2011). Our study aims to address this gap and explores the barriers to academic entrepreneurship in the former socialist economy which has undergone a turbulent transition period—Croatia. Croatia started entrepreneurship development from a very different perspective compared to other countries of the European Union (EU), such as in terms of the tradition, history, entrepreneurship cultures, entrepreneurship education, and perception of the institutional support (Kwiek 2012). Hence, such case selection enables us to evaluate different contextual influences on the level of academic entrepreneurship development. We apply Van Dierdonck and Debackere (1988) framework and investigate the influence of cultural, institutional, and operational barriers. As the academic entrepreneurship has been underexplored in a transitional context and hence under-theorised, a qualitative methodology was adopted, an approach traditionally used for such a research position (Miles and Huberman 1994). In-depth interviews with university administration provided a rich and detailed investigation of different activities and revealed different socio-economic factors which inhibit and foster the level of academic entrepreneurship. Our findings demonstrate significant differences between Croatia and both former transition economies and Western economies in terms of the level of academic entrepreneurship development, which can be explained in large part by the following: (1) the inability of Croatian universities to transform themselves to encourage commercialisation activities and (2) considerable differences in the level of entrepreneurship development, where overall institutional frameworks in Croatia are still not supportive of entrepreneurial development. More importantly, our study demonstrates that the transfer of successful policies and lessons from the ‘West’ to countries who have recently joined the EU may be highly problematic because those universities do not have strong world-class research, have limited resources, weak commercial networks, and low levels of entrepreneurial activity. The paper is organised in six sections. The first section gives an overview of previously conducted research in the field of academic entrepreneurship, and the case study of Croatia is presented in the second section. In the third section, we discuss the adopted research methodology and methods, and present research findings in the fourth section. In the fifth section, research results are discussed, and in section six, we discuss study limitations.",9

Even though the original concept of open innovation involves mostly business to business interactions (Chesbrough 2003), numerous followers (even Chesbrough and co-authors) expand it to a plethora of links with science, communities and also within triple- and quadruple helices. If so, following the patterns of open innovation should basically be one of the key elements of knowledge management systems in universities. It is due to the fact that universities sharing or selling their intellectual property become natural partners, allies or suppliers in securing in-bound innovation in companies. This notion of understanding knowledge management in universities is well developed and implemented in the most innovative economies of the European Union. The old member states such as Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the UK, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, France or Italy have benefited from this for a long time (e.g. Kauffeld–Monz and Fritsch 2013 or van Geenhuizen 2013). Others struggle to follow. But in most of the new accession countries (especially former socialist countries), the issue is still problematic (e.g. Draghici et al. 2016, Erdős and Varga 2013 or Žížalová and Čadil 2013). Transition from a centrally planned to market-oriented economy is really tough in the case of research and development. It takes much more time and effort than the transition of an industry or a social sphere. Universities were traditionally perceived as places of teaching and learning rooted in quality research. Obviously this is still a primary role of every university. But in the last decades, much pressure was put on academia to become more entrepreneurial, in simple words, to make earnings out of commercialised knowledge. Open innovation is actually a way of thinking that is or could be natural here. Anyway, this phenomenon—directly linked to the concept of open innovation (being a core of this paper)—has not been really widely covered in research literature. Search in the Web of Science Core Collection, using the template: “open innovation” univ* [name of the country/first letters*/adjective]; all years returned following numbers of scientific works per country in April 2017: Austria 1, Belgium 0, Bulgaria 1 (conference proceeding), Croatia 1, Cyprus 0, Czech Republic 1 (conference proceeding), Denmark 1 (conference proceeding), Estonia 0, Finland 7 (6 conference proceedings), France 4 (1 conference proceeding), Germany 4 (1 conference proceeding), Greece 2 (1 conference proceeding), Hungary 1, Ireland 4 (1 conference proceeding), Italy 7 (3 conference proceedings), Latvia 1 (conference proceeding), Lithuania 0, Luxembourg 0, Malta 0, Netherlands 6, Poland 1, Portugal 6 (2 conference proceeding), Romania 4 (conference proceedings), Slovakia 0, Slovenia 0, Spain 15 (3 conference proceeding), Sweden 4 (conference proceedings), UK 4, European Union 3 (conference proceedings). As it is argued in the “Positioning Universities in the Notion of OI” section, with regard to knowledge management and commercialisation universities first of all follow the outside-in pathway. They should put every possible effort to become partners of primal choice for industry players who open their innovation funnel. It is so because apart from founding spin-off companies (which is anyway usually done in an open innovation domain), universities have no other options to convey their knowledge to industrial applications. Making use of the opportunity of a business partner opening the innovation funnel can be modelled as two types of targeted open innovation processes. One is a focused technology knowledge transfer process. The other is a targeted open innovation participatory research process (Laine et al. 2015). Thus, in the business world, the universities need to position themselves as reliable players who may increase the chance of R&D project success in the following aspects listed by Vanhaverbeke et al. (2014): higher speed of knowledge transfer using scientific knowledge, higher volume of knowledge transfer through more frequent science-related additions and greater business value of knowledge transfer through higher speed and introduction of cutting-edge science. For this reason, scrutinising the way universities in the new member states perform is interesting both in terms of understanding knowledge management processes as well as in terms of provoking future-oriented thinking in less-developed economies within the European Union. The paper adds to the state of knowledge by presenting data on Polish technical universities and by offering discussion over their open innovation capacity. The study covers two key aspects: (1) universities delivering solutions as partners/suppliers in outside-in innovation processes of companies and (2) universities as facilitators of open innovation ecosystems or key players in the ecosystems. The aim of the paper is to answer the research question whether there is a link between those two, i.e. whether actions undertaken by Polish technical universities to boost their presence in open innovation ecosystems have an impact on the dynamics of the commercial use of their intellectual property. The paper proposes and applies a method of structured self-assessment concerning open innovation capacity is. It is primarily based on interviewing the university authorities. Results are cross-checked by accessing financial statement data concerning R&D contracts (under the Polish law on public information). This allows a qualitative and quantitative approach to the research question.",13

In his book, From Higher Aims to Hired Hands (2007), Rajesh Khurana lays out the charges. Accreditors in particular, he argues, have fallen short of their responsibility to enforce meaningful standards within management education. Because of this dereliction, Khurana continues, business schools have lost control over their own destiny (pp. 333–334). Business schools are now under “tyranny of the rankings,” a rule characterized by the sophistry of marketization and the absence of a shared purpose. In his concluding comments, Khurana appeals the rejuvenation of the intellectual and moral foundations of management. This, he urges, has to be a collective effort, encompassing all of the stakeholders of management education, not least those internal governance bodies we recognize as accreditors, and this opens the door for the state to reengage with management education via quality (and risk) assurance. In this paper, we argue that quality management processes are still putting business schools at risk 11 years on. Business schools have reproduced quality management by default, and thereby contributed to the stability of management education. In so doing, they have become products of those structures, dependent upon them for their power, legitimacy, and fitness. In settled times, this is a competitive advantage, as rules provide a handrail for social and economic fitness. In unsettled times, thought of here as times of increased uncertainty, we contend that dependence on established frameworks will hinder adaptation. This penalty will come in the form of institutional laggardness, in which actors are likely to cling to the status quo. For reasons that we will explain later, this can jeopardize the majority of accredited, but so far unranked business schools.",3

The first cultural travelers, the travelers for the “Grand Tour,” can be considered as a precocious form of cultural tourism, which today has been constituted as an activity with a different character and objectives from the other forms of tourism. Successful collaborations often link cultural monuments, archaeological sites, museums, hotels, and the city tourism offices. A great number of museum visits depend also on travel agencies and organized cultural visits. Museums work in partnership with tourist agencies and the hospitality industry to attract visitors. Cities around the world are likely to be destinations for organized tourism, when they cultivate relationships with the tourist industry. As it is described by Richards, “in spite of the fact that “cultural tourists” have been common in Europe for hundreds of years, it is only in the last two decades that cultural and heritage tourism have been identified as specific tourism markets” (Richards 1996, p. 265). Over the last decades, the museums have changed, trying to be more visitor-oriented than traditional institutions that mainly gather and exhibit objects. The contemporary role of museums has a lot of different aspects. “Marketing approaches have been used to increase visitor numbers and to encourage, change and expand the museum role from one of custodial emphasis, to one of marketing. Hence, museums are developing marketing techniques to help museums to become more successful” (Gilmore and Rentschler 2002, p. 745). Greek museums, in the midst of the economic recession, face the agony of surviving and in addition track the challenges for sustainable development. During 2014, more than 20 million tourists arrived in Greece (www.sete.gr) and reinforced economically the country. Cultural tourists could empower decisively the museums, the archaeological sites, and the Greek tourist destinations in total. The aim of the present survey is to investigate the level of visitors’ satisfaction and the dimensions of quality perceptions of tourists who are visiting Greek museums, along with their intention to recommend and revisit the museum in the future. The stakeholders of tourism in Greece could benefit from the knowledge of the parameters that visitors evaluate as important reasons of satisfaction and provide quality services in accordance to tourists’ needs, in order to make them comment positively for the place (word-of-mouth) and return back again and again.",8
12.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,05 November 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-015-0317-9,Editorial Note: an Integrated Approach,March 2021,Elias Carayannis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this special issue, we have tried to select a group of papers which offer a wide variety of subjects and treatments, in local, regional and national levels, trying to integrate and spherically approach the issues described above, also discussing the corresponding limits and prospects. More specifically, the selection of this special issue’s papers highlights issues such as: innovation, knowledge and regional growth, technical efficiency regarding regional innovation and industrial policy, attitudes towards entrepreneurship, regional planning systems, work participatory regimes, endogenous and external factors on development and prospects of built environment, as well as museums and tourism policy, consisting the core engines of the European economy. The first paper, by George M. Korres, Elias Kourliouros, and Aikaterini Kokkinou, titled ‘A Survey on Innovation, Knowledge and Regional Growth’ focuses on innovation activities, as essential contributing factors to regional dimension and growth. The paper analyses technological infrastructure and innovation capabilities affecting not only regional growth but also the whole periphery and economy, with technical change and innovation activities having an important role for growth and sustainable development. More specifically, the paper reviews the role and economic impact of invention and innovation activities and investigates the relationship between productivity, technical change, welfare, growth and regional development. This paper also attempts to analyse the theory and the effects of innovation in regional growth and in particular to review some of the main models on innovation and regional growth. Within this context, it is also aiming to emphasize and review the appropriate techniques, the most common methods and particular problems. The second paper, by Aikaterini Kokkinou, titled ‘Technical Efficiency, Regional Innovation & Industrial Policy: A Stochastic Frontier approach’, taking into consideration the slowdown and the effects created by the current financial crisis in the European Union, attempts to define efficiency enhancement, mainly through innovation and industrial activities. The paper puts strong emphasis upon the interfaces between innovation (R&D) and industrial policy planning and technical efficiency enhancement, along with the appropriate fiscal instruments and incentives. This paper aims to provide insights into the level of technical efficiency and policy planning, in an attempt to reach a better understanding of the contribution of alternative policies to technical efficiency growth. Special focus is put on the appreciation of the ways in which policies change and adapt in the presence of new constraints of changing configurations of the knowledge-based economy combined with the emergence and adaptation of institutional structures, especially these of high technology and high value added, especially within the financial crisis framework. The main findings of this paper suggest the great importance of the interaction between the alternative policies planning and estimate any implication for technical efficiency, focusing on the current financial crisis effects. Moreover, this paper investigates the impact of industrial and innovation policy at strengthening the competitiveness of producers by promoting competition, ensuring access to markets and establishing an environment which is conducive to innovation and R&D, taking into consideration that lack of innovative capacity stems, not only from deficiencies in the research base and low levels of R&D expenditure in European Union but also from weaknesses in the links between research centres and businesses and slow adoption of information and communication technologies. The third paper, by Charalampos Botsaris and Vasiliki Vamvaka, titled ‘Attitude toward entrepreneurship: Structure, prediction from behavioural beliefs and relation to entrepreneurial intention’, investigates the associations among behavioural beliefs, the dimensions of attitude toward entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial intention using a structural equation modelling approach. Two hundred twenty-seven Greek tertiary education students (114 males, 113 females) participated in the study. The paper findings show that the various entrepreneurship outcomes, linked to the behavioural beliefs, are distinguished into intrinsic (intangible/psychological) and extrinsic (tangible/physical) and that attitude toward entrepreneurship is best represented by a two-factor model consisting of both instrumental and affective attitudes than a model consisting of only a single attitude factor. The paper results have further revealed a pattern of differential effects of the attitude dimensions on entrepreneurial intention, with affective attitude having a stronger predictive value than instrumental attitude. Evidence was also obtained for the validity of the Fishbein and Ajzen’s expectancy-value model of attitudes, which postulates that belief strength and the corresponding belief strength/outcome evaluation cross-product each contributes significantly, positively and independently to the prediction of attitude. The findings further show that the dimensions of attitude toward entrepreneurship exert a differential impact on entrepreneurial intention, with affective attitude appearing to be more strongly related to intention than instrumental attitude. The fourth paper, by Elias Kourliouros, George M. Korres and Aikaterini Kokkinou, titled ‘The Greek Regional Planning System in the 1980s: A Historical Socio-Economic & Political Analysis of Planning Deficiencies & Problems’ examines and analyses spatial planning in Greece, an always problematic public policy issue, widely addressed by a large amount of literature. However, much of it, as it will be illustrated in this paper, has tended to grasp the surface aspects of planning and to neglect the underlying structural forces that have shaped and re-shaped it. This paper copes with these matters by sketching out the main lines of an alternative explanatory framework. More specifically, the paper examines the developments in planning philosophy, planning tools and legislation, which, even though, were expected to open up new grounds in the country’s spatial organization prospects by ‘injecting’ a modernization culture in the planning system; however, in fact, regional planning had remained largely ineffective and therefore it fell into disuse. Even though the paper focuses on early 1980s developments, providing a historical character, however, some of the examined issues and processes have continued till nowadays. More specifically, the paper highlights the basic trends of the regional distribution of economic activity in Greece during the 1980s, examines the major tools and legislative measures of the regional planning system and addresses their deficiencies in practice. Moreover, it also reviews the existing approaches and advances an alternative one based on an analysis of the deeper social and political forces and relations that have underlied regional planning in Greece during the 1980s, concluding in policy remarks. The fifth paper, by George O. Tsobanoglou and Eirini Ioanna Vlachopoulou, titled ‘Work Participatory Regimes in the Greek Archipelago: Current Challenges at a time of financial crisis’, deals with European Union policy on islands suffering from disadvantaging external natural and economic circumstances. As the need for public participation in decision-making increases, in order to address economic and social cohesion issues, both national and supranational authorities should take action to reinforce community involvement in policy. This research, using information from case studies from Greek islands, investigates the obstacles in promoting public participation in insular areas from a European perspective. The study was based on qualitative research methods and an extensive literature review. In areas with low cohesion, attempts for participation failed. In other areas, where social cohesion was maintained, there was mistrust towards local authorities but the members of the community were eager to collaborate with the researcher to promote participation. It was evident that there is urgency for adoption of national and European policies focused on the needs of the insular communities, with respect to their unique circumstances. The sixth paper, by George Sidiropoulos and Dimitrios G. Ierapetritis, titled ‘The development status and prospects of a medieval settlement in the Eastern Mediterranean: The case of Mesta, Chios’, treats the diachronic evolution of Mesta, a medieval settlement in Chios island, with the aim to investigate the circumstances under which the urban landscape managed to remain nearly intact until today. Scientists from different disciplines have studied the medieval settlements of Chios; however, very few have focused on the evolution of their urban landscape. This research is based on anthropogeographical and other urban-geographical characteristics of the settlement through the nineteenth and twentieth century, which are recorded with the use of computer-aided cartography (ArcGIS) and intends to (a) study the changes in the urban development of the settlement, (b) provide evidence to justify these changes, (c) study the current institutional framework on the protection and promotion of traditional settlements, (d) to examine the initiative taken for the protection and promotion of this historical settlement and (e) introduce further suggestions for the protection, conservation and development of the settlement in modern reality. The seventh paper, by Emmanuel V. Marmaras, titled| ‘The formation of the Cycladic built environment stemming from endogenous and external factors’, on the one hand, examines the case of the Cycladic urban environment, investigated as a result of a complex procedure, where the leading role was for the secluded island societies influenced by their own strong cultural past, while simultaneously receiving external effects from the various dominating powers. On the other hand, the rules of indigenous customary law, concerning land ownership and land uses are explored. On a second level, the paper aims to look at the architectural and urban elements of the Cycladic-built environment, searching for those customary laws that formed the built and public space. In any case, this approach does not aspire to interpret the complexity of traditional Cycladic settlements formation but to reveal through a specific glance an aspect of this phenomenon and thus to contribute in an effort of systematic analysis. The eighth paper, by Eleni Mavragani, titled ‘Greek Museums and Tourists’ Perceptions: An Empirical Research’, examines that the role and the importance of the museums in the cultural and economic development of cities are prominent. Marketing strategies could help museums to fulfil their mission and to maximize visitors’ satisfaction. A quantitative research was conducted among tourists who visited five Greek museums, in five cities. The scope of this research was to investigate the level of their satisfaction and their intention to recommend and revisit the museum in the future. The importance of visitor’s satisfaction is illustrated by the emphasis on word-of-mouth communication and the relationship between satisfaction and the desire to make recommendations for the service provider. Museums’ directors and the Greek authorities should take advantage of the existing opportunities of marketing techniques, by designing a clear and effective marketing strategy, aiming at fulfilling museum’s mission along with visitor’s satisfaction. Offering our thanks and gratitude to the issue authors, the members of the Journal of the Knowledge Economy editorial board, as well as Springer publisher for making this special issue possible, we strongly wish that this issue will act as a focal point for further theoretical and empirical research on the issues raised, rendering a creative think tank for knowledge dissemination and scientific dialogue.

Foray (2004) emphasises the knowledge economy should not be confused with the economics of research or the economics of information, but instead cover a much wider range of issues that have been explored in philosophy. These include recognising the difference between knowing how (procedural knowledge) and knowing that (declarative or descriptive knowledge), as suggested by Ryle (1949), and knowing why (theory), and knowing who (social networking), as added by Lundvall and Johnson (1995). And it should recognise the difference between explicit and tacit knowing, as the interaction between these two ways of knowing are essential for new knowledge creation (Polanyi 1966). Theories of human problem solving and effective learning along the lines of Herbert Simon provide a link between Ryle and Polanyi. Although the creation of new knowledge depends to a large degree on targeted research and development (R&D), it also includes the issues of experience, learning and perception. New knowledge does not emerge from planned actions, but is an uncertain and not projectable result of individual actions or interactions in networks. The targeted user not only makes use of this knowledge but the group of relevant users includes others not accounted for in the process of generation of knowledge. Knowledge disseminates from generators and owners to users and between users in a process that includes the intended transfer of technology as well as spillovers without (adequate) remuneration. Finally, the dissemination and subsequent application of knowledge has the potential to generate new knowledge via new and possibly unanticipated uses and adjustments of existing knowledge. All these are implications of the particular goods-character of knowledge: whereas the value of physical capital diminishes with use by tear and wear, knowledge tends to improve with more users applying the knowledge and adding their own ideas for adjustments and alterations. Knowledge as intellectual property with commercial value, however, is rivalling in use—giving rise to the institution of protection of intellectual property rights. The generation, use and diffusion of knowledge is characterised by a high level and ever rising complexity in the system governing the process. This reinforces the need to think about alternative concepts that capture the multi-level linkages between a growing variety of systems and agents that result in a ‘heterogeneity of networks’. The concept of ‘network alignment’ has been introduced to elaborate both the challenge and the inherent difficulties in governing collective action in systems of innovation, which are regarded as being sources for network failures or ‘network misalignment’. One important conclusion is that we have to develop concepts which are not restricted by limited complexity (such as the ‘value chain’), but research must be directed to alignment problems, which eventually enhances our capacity to understand knowledge and the knowledge process in all its forms and diversity.",
12.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,19 March 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-016-0372-x,Knowledge in Microsocial Milieus: the Case of Microfinance Practices Among Women in India,March 2021,Arvind Ashta,Chandralekha Ghosh,Frank Lentz,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"With the increasing participation of banks and non-bank financial institutions in supplying microcredit and the increase in competition between them, attested by multiple lending, it is evidently interesting for microfinance institutions to go in search for new borrowers. For this, they need to create awareness by tapping into the social milieus of the poor. A milieu is a social environment. The phrase microsocial milieu (Boutillier and Uzunidis, 2014) therefore repeats the word social for emphasis. Examples of microsocial milieus to which one may belong include family, schools, professional activity, and churches. Each person may belong to many different milieus and as a result, contradictions are created in the system. In fact, deviant behavior acts as a motive for change. Social milieus could have impact on lifestyles such as drug use (Legleye et al., 2008) and diseases such as cancer (Thouez, 1984). The social milieu created in a hospital may also impact the treatment of psychiatric patients (Greenblatt et al., 1959). There is already some work on how social networks to which one belongs influence our credit/borrowing decisions (Wydick et al., 2011, Piot-Lepetit and Nzongang, 2014, Okten and Osili, 2004). There is research also on how belonging to economic groups may enhance social behavior (Sanyal, 2009) or create identity conflicts which may restrain development (Mokhtarnia, 2011). Thus, an explanation for persistence of poverty may be based on the group dynamics which keep a person within his zone of comfortable routines and social ties, part of the social milieu. Exiting from poverty would require new information or stimulus for change. The social milieu may help in diffusing of innovation or it may retard this innovation. For example, early adopters were found to be less integrated into their social milieu than are later adopters: social distance may make them willing to accept the economic and social risks of being innovative (McEachern and Hanson, 2008). Actors act within their social milieu and its norms but with some degree of autonomy. Systems theory would look not only at soft and hard norms but also at places and actors and how they interact with each other. Social network analysis looks not only at diversity of actors but also at their relationships in their social milieu. The network includes the actors which help a person maintain his identity and provides him support as well as information (Smith, 1999). For example, network analysis may explain how people seek information from their network on health services to better look after their health (Song and Chang, 2012). This network of direct and indirect ties would be their social milieu. “In the case of intersystem innovation partnerships, the organizational relations have to be kept flexible through weak ties to a broad range of innovation partners” (Kaufmann and Tödtling, 2001, p 696). This view argues for letting partners keep their own way of doing business (routines) rather than converting them so that diversity is maintained. This diversity of partners is essential in fostering new analytical knowledge and radical innovation in high technology industries as opposed to synthetic knowledge which is more learning by doing and incremental innovation in engineering industries (Asheim and Coenen, 2005). Agency is explained within the innovation systems by incorporating institutional entrepreneurship theory which allows more appropriate organizational forms to evolve (Hung and Whittington, 2011). Since microcredit borrowers are poor, often illiterate, we want to study the influence of social ties and social milieu in awareness of microcredit and entrepreneurial opportunities. The question is evidently of practical as well as theoretical importance. While it is widely believed, following the seminal work of Granovetter (1973), that weak ties are more enabling than strong ties, there is some debate on whether the poor have the requisite weak ties of a bridging nature that could enable them to overcome poverty (Lybbert, 2008). To study the different kinds of ties, we asked a sample of microfinance borrowers, all women, on how they obtain information on key aspects of their microbusiness: clients, suppliers, and financing. The “Literature Review” section elaborates on out literature review on social ties and on microcredit. After that, we explain our research methodology including a note on microcredit in India and the details of our sample in the “Research Methodology” section. We present our findings on information sources used by microcredit borrowers for their business and classify these sources in terms of strong, medium, and weak ties in the “Findings” section. In the “Analysis: Knowledge and Social Milieu” section, we cross-analyze the use of different kinds of ties based on the borrower characteristics of our sample. The “Discussion and Conclusion” section provides a brief discussion and concludes.",3
12.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,07 June 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-016-0381-9,"Globalization of R&D, Accumulation of Knowledge and Network Innovation: the Evolution of the Firm’s Boundaries",March 2021,Zeting Liu,Dimitri Uzunidis,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The last three decades have witnessed the profound changes of the behaviors of multinational companies (MNCs). The internationalization—and the globalization—of their activities nowadays concerns not only the commercialization and production but also the Research and Development (R&D). Although according to a number of scholars the internationalization of production is not a new phenomenon, it is undeniable that the difference between the terms “internationalization” and “globalization” is not just semantic but includes major divergences, so as the question of internationalization of R&D activities. While at the beginning of 1980s, when the phenomenon was emerging, it was clear that the relocation of R&D activities were only intended to adapt the product to local market. Gradually, we start to witness a genuine integration of R&D activities on a global scale. The networks of cooperation between firms, between firms and/or research centers located in various countries around the world have been developed since the last 20 years. This latest change has become particularly remarkable since the second half of 1990s with the development of the knowledge economy (private R&D expenditures increased considerably): on the one hand, more and more upstream R&D activities of MNCs have been carried out abroad; on the other hand, certain developing countries start to be important enough as destinations of offshore R&D activities of MNCs, alongside with developed countries. The creation and accumulation of knowledge become increasingly collective, crossing the borders of national economies, forming networks of technological cooperation around the world in order to collect quantities of information which can be transformed into innovations. Whereas the terms of “networked innovation” or “cooperative innovation” have been widespread long before, the term “open innovation” has imposed itself since 2003 when Henry W. Chesbrough has published his now famous paper to describe the phenomenon of networked innovation by the scientific community. The major interest of the evolutionary theory (Arena and Lazaric 2003; Dossi and Winter 2003; Uzunidis and Laperche 2011) lies in the historical influence on the decisions of economic agents in general and firms in particular. Firms are part of a history that includes not only their own ones but also the whole economic history into which they are inserted. In this opaque environment, the firm discovers only progressively the framework of power relationships (its competition position vis-à-vis other firms). Furthermore, these decisions depend on the internal relations of the firm as well as its environment. In a context of constant transformation, the firm is unable to maximize its profit rate and has to search internally (in terms of its competences, production techniques, organizational procedures, or routines) the solution that it needs. By developing the cooperation relationships through various forms, the firm also looks for collecting knowledge, technologies, and competences that are not owned internally. This process is part of a dynamic history of an increasingly complex division of labor. Inserted in a constantly transforming economic environment, the firm thus participates in the transformation of economic environment which by a synergy effect in return transforms its own organization. The development of these R&D activities in the globalized networks transforms MNCs and the capitalism. From a vertical hierarchical organization to a decentralized organization of network, MNCs—from industrialized countries as well as emerging economies—expand their activities to every continent. In consequence, the morphology of capitalism changes, from a concentrated capitalism metamorphosing into a network capitalism (Castells 1998). In this paper, we will use an evolutionary approach to analyze the determinants of the globalization of MNCs’ R&D. By associating the theories of international economics and innovation management, we will therefore develop a new methodological framework to better understand the globalization of innovation process by building on synergies between different actors (firms, institutions). The paper is organized in two parts. We firstly reconsider the concept of the firm in particular the MNC to better understand the innovation processes and the environment where firms operate. Secondly, based on our analysis, we will distinguish the endogenous determinants of the globalization of MNCs’ R&D (linked to the function of technological resources creation and the improvement of competence) and the exogenous determinants (related to the changes of the processes and the environment of innovation). Our analysis shows that with the ongoing quantity of different types of knowledge flowing between the firm and outside actors around the world, the boundary of the MNCs become more and more blurred.",7
12.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,30 June 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-016-0391-7,Large Firms’ Knowledge Capital and Innovation Networks,March 2021,Blandine Laperche,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Innovation means the development and dissemination of new combinations of production factors and it usually takes the form of technological developments (products, processes), new markets, and/or new organizations. Innovation does not just happen. It is the result of costly and risky investments made by various organizations and institutions as well as of complex strategies of formation and protection of resources designed to take part to this process. In this paper, we study the large firms’ strategy to innovate and put forward a central element—the knowledge capital (KC)—which can be defined as a set of scientific and technical knowledge and information produced, acquired, combined, and systematized by one or several firms for productive and more broadly for value creation purposes. It is the backbone of their permanent innovation strategy. Many concepts have been developed in recent years to describe, analyze, and assess the management of the firm’s innovation process. Without being exhaustive, we can for example refer to intangible assets, intellectual capital (OECD 2013), absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Zahra and George 2002), and open innovation strategies (Chesbrough 2003, 2006). In the literature, the concepts of intangible assets and intellectual capital are mainly used in a resource management perspective and in an attempt to better measure and report the investments made by firms in such immaterial resources (software, patents, data, know-how…) (Walliser and Mignon 2015). They are less analyzed as being strategic resources that contribute to the process of value creation (Zambon and Monciardini 2015). Absorptive capacity and open innovation are concepts developed and used in the resource-based theory to study the role of internal and external resources in the firm’s innovation process. Adopting an economics of innovation perspective, one aim of this paper is to study the relations between these complementary concepts in order to propose an analysis of the current characteristics of the innovation process at the meso-level (within firms but also networks of firms and institutions) and the contribution to the various forms of knowledge, embodied in more or less material support, to the process of value creation. We assume that the intellectual interest of the KC concept is to gather the processes or elements described by the above concepts and as such to contribute to a better understanding of the current characteristics of innovation processes. As a matter of fact, the concept of KC is very useful to study current issues related to innovation. In this paper, we illustrate this by focusing on the nature of networks usually built by large companies and gathering other companies, organizations, and institutions. How is the KC of large companies generated and protected within innovation networks? What are the consequences on the dynamics of innovation and the structure of market in knowledge-based industries? The first part of this paper comes back to the definition and theoretical roots of the KC. It also compares the KC with other related concepts. In the second part, we highlight the interest of using the KC concept to study current issues related to innovation: the nature of networks and the role of intellectual property rights.",6

Advances in information and communication technologies (ICT) and increasing competitive pressures have led firms to decentralize R&D activities. Modern innovation strategies are now focused on harnessing the potential of a wide range of internal capacities (e.g., R&D, marketing, production, and intellectual property rights) and a variety of external resources. Over the last decade a fundamental change has occurred in the way innovation is organized. It tended to be concentrated at or near headquarters but is now much more decentralized within the company. Equally significant, innovation activities that used to be carried out in-house by innovating firms themselves are carried out by independent suppliers of knowledge intensive business services (KIBS) or are transferred to key suppliers (Lema et al. 2015, p. 1377). Major changes in innovation models stem from increased openness in the work performed by commercial firms’ R&D laboratories, exemplified in particular by integration and collaboration among users and suppliers early in the innovation process (e.g., during the design phase). These open and collaborative approaches to innovation rely on knowledge sharing among public and private stakeholders who interact and develop new ideas by (re)combining tangible and intangible assets (Barbaroux 2014; Clarysse et al. 2014). Deploying interactive and collaborative organizational forms such as business ecosystems (Moore 1993) entails modifying the knowledge management processes developed by firms during various phases of the innovation process. Entrusting all or part of the development of new knowledge concepts during the ideation stage (or invention phase; Arthur 2007) to a third party (e.g., a research laboratory or supplier) raises additional challenges associated with knowledge codification and transfer (Cepeda and Vera 2007; Teece 2007). For example, the knowledge created, even partly, through external relationships should be combined with a firm’s internal knowledge. This, in turn, requires the implementation of integration mechanisms that depend on specific capabilities (such as knowledge absorption capacities; Cohen and Levinthal 1990). In addition, the collaborative conceptualization and conversion of new concepts into operational technologies requires new modes of managing partner interactions based on flexible governance structures, transformational leadership, and a balanced integration of knowledge sharing and knowledge control (Amin and Cohendet 2004). Finally, the adoption of interactive and collaborative innovation models impacts how firms manage ideas and knowledge during the commercialization phase. Firms must find ways to deploy appropriation regimes that fit with the characteristics of interactive innovation models in terms of knowledge sharing, protection, and valorization (Teece 2010). By and large, the trend toward increasing levels of collaboration and interaction has altered the way the invention and commercialization phases are managed by innovating firms. If one assumes that “knowledge and innovation are inseparable” (Fidel et al. 2015, p. 1426), then one should consider that knowledge management is inseparable from a firm’s innovation model and strategy. However, despite significant advances in the literatures on innovation management and strategic management, there remains a need to improve our understanding of the specificities of knowledge management processes and practices supporting the different phases of new collaborative and interactive models of innovation, i.e., business ecosystems. Defined as an inter-organizational arrangements or a space of opportunities (Koenig 2013), business ecosystems mobilized an extensive literature in strategic management. Researches mainly investigated the nature and logics of knowledge management processes and organizational competencies supporting the birth of a business (Loilier and Malherbe 2013; Attour and Della Peruta 2014; Attour and Ayerbe 2015; Attour and Barbaroux 2016). When considering the overall lifecycle, the research question is often focused on the role of the focal firm and on the importance of the governance mechanisms in relation to the processes of knowledge management and value creation (Iskia et al. 2014). The aim of this paper is to fill this gap by analyzing the knowledge management processes associated with the different phases of a business ecosystem’s lifecycle. The research question is the following: which knowledge processes are involved in the birth, expansion, leadership, and renewal phases of a business ecosystem, and how are these processes linked together to shape its lifecycle? To explore this issue, we develop a case study of a specific business ecosystem: a near-field communication (NFC) platform called the Sophia-Zen project. The rest of the article is organized as follows. We begin by defining the different phases of a business ecosystem’s lifecycle and identifying the associated knowledge processes mobilized by the different actors participating in the ecosystem’s development. Then, we present the research methodology and describe the research context, as well as data collection and analysis procedures. In the two sections that follow, we present the findings of the case study and discuss major implications related to the role of knowledge processes during various phases of a business ecosystem’s lifecycle. In the final section, we describe the limitations of our study and suggest promising avenues for future research.",7

Testing New Criteria or Facets: “Data Scientists” and “Data Platforms”,March 2021,Maurice Baslé,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Krugman (1998) and Florida (2002, 2005) have focused on the factors of cities’ attractiveness. The usual competition between town centers and cities has been illustrated with methods surveyed by OECD (OECD 2006). In accordance with the teachings of the theories and of the methodologies, cities were until 2010 usually rated and ranked on a large variety of factors (see for example, ranking of French cities for the creation of new enterprises, magazine l’Express Entreprise; ranking of European cities by l’Express; ranking of European cities for living). This has given rise to the usual promotion of cities by means of dashboards of “attractiveness’ indicators.” Alongside the internal and external attractiveness factors, the indicators were, for example, quality of the infrastructures, the individual “talent” and the local collective resources in education and health, ease of access to commercial markets in the country, the presence of qualified staff, efficiency of telecommunication networks, and transport connectivity with other foreign cities. All criteria that have been modeled and tested as crucial factors of territorial attractiveness in the literature (Poirot and Gérardin, 2010). Because of the emergence of the digital society, we could observe a transition towards a new transactions and sharing economy (Nguyen Dang, Dejean S. (2014), UNESCO, 2013). This structural and technological change has structural effects on employment and productivity so on general attractiveness. The article insists that there should be one condition sine qua non for signal the new attractiveness: having the ability to extract value from public and private territorial data through organizing the data activity by different channels: collecting data from multiple sources, developing platforms of interoperable data, and promoting data analysis and activities involving the use of public data on public services. The article proposes the following proposition: the presence of these activities of valuing data will constitute an evidence for a new strategy for location of a firm or for a family: investors must have a look on the location of populations and skills which are most likely to be comfortable with data sciences (the data scientists), and used to be familiar of data-platforms, etc. So, the article will expose that the question of cities’ attractiveness is becoming a question of location of the places of the new process of valuation of a shared knowledge by the Territorial Data processing. We will explain why, as the new economy emerged with new internet users, with a lot of new Internet platforms of distance selling (Evans, 2011), cities must begin a new promotion campaign: e-administration services’ places and new public data-based services (transportation for example), data-scientist capacities, and the use of data platforms of territorial data could now enhance local productivity and welfare. Two new criteria of attractiveness should be tested: Does the local quality of the process of extracting and of using the value extracted from big territorial mix of public and private data is a new asset for attractiveness? If confirmed in the future by some empirical evidence of economic impact, the announcement of a bigger capacity to learn and decide by the use and processing of territorial data collected in different areas of local public services (transports, education, and quality of environment…) will be a new factor of cities’ attractiveness: cities that organize the mixing and processing of data on interoperable platforms equipped with tools for extracting value from data (for example extracting the value from predictive data regarding the actions performed by the Fire Services in a city such as New York) will be viewed as minimizing social costs and being more productive and reliable. They will not usurp their title and “smarter cities” and will have a greater attractiveness. If the testing is positive, nowadays, an attractive city will definitively be a city that has really adopted a new way of organizing the Data valuing process through the use of public-private platforms of interoperable data (“Datathèque platforms”) and with the aid of data sciences and data scientists. So, in a near future, the label “smart city,” if correctly awarded, will signify the “use of data sciences for producing local public utilities”. The two new criteria for attractiveness will be the number of data scientists involved and the number of partnerships involved in exploiting Datathèque platforms. In the first section, we will cover the traditional indicators of the attractiveness of the cities. In the second section, we will examine the possibility of a new facet to be shown for the attractiveness of a city after the digital revolution and, finally, in the third section, we will present our two new indicators of cities’ attractiveness for complex and smart cities in a digital society (Datathèques-services platforms and data scientists’ location). Finally, the purpose of the article is to reveal and to propose to researchers to check that, in our digital word, attractiveness of the cities is now founded on new criteria.",4

Indeed, we think that this kind of network requires more rupture, instability, and disequilibrium, that is dilemmas (Cohendet et al. 1999; Nonaka 1990). This dual need also corresponds to the two hemispheres of the brain. The left hemisphere is related to rationality, consciousness, and logical reasoning, while the right hemisphere is more concerned with creativity and imagination. This dichotomous logic seems to be the engine of knowledge-based network (Boari and Lipparini 1999; Rychen and Zimmermann 2008), in which notions such as oxymoron are concept that help understand the phenomenon: chance and necessity, useless and useful, rational and irrational, immobility and development, statics and dynamics, and movement and stationary equilibrium are all founding couples of the process within the meaning of a dazzling madness channeled according to constraints of viability. This dichotomy is explained by different elements that we propose to develop and we will be able to demonstrate conceptually that the key is the solution of dilemmas. In this article, we formalize the knowledge-based network using organizational mutations governed by non-deterministic dynamics and viable constraints. In our model, network is viewed as a locus where knowledge is continuously built, managed, combined, tested, and selected between all of the participants of the network. This continuous process of creation and shaping of knowledge is driven by problem-solving activities. Action and knowledge deeply interact within the network. The knowledge-based network must constantly create, maintain, and resolve dilemmas. In that, the network undergoes evolutions that it must manage by preserving a viable behavior as solution between many dilemmas. We want to express here the idea that, in this logic of viability, the network does not seek an optimal structure but tries rather to preserve coherence between differences. Our assumption is that a network evolution is viable if it checks a constraint (called viability constraint) related to the dilemmas. The first part is devoted to some conceptual developments that will be helpful for the model in the second part.",3

Several authors show that innovation and financial development are essential variables for ensuring economic growth and the competitive advantage of countries. We can categorize past studies in this field into three strands, but empirical evidence remains mostly controversial and ambiguous. The first strand focuses on the link between innovation and economic growth. Many studies find a strong empirical relationship between innovation and economic growth (Howells 2005; Sinha 2008; Hassan and Tucci 2010; Fan 2011; Cetin 2013; Maradana et al. 2017; Pradhan et al. 2018). The second of research examined the relationship between financial development and economic growth. The role of financial development in economic growth has been considered as one of the fundamental principles of the economy (Levine 1997; Rajan and Zingales 1998). These studies show that the development of economic activity will increase the need for financial services, thus improving the financial system (Dimitris and Efthymios 2004; Fung 2009; Pradhan et al. 2018). The third strand of research examined the relationship between innovation and financial development. This literature postulates that the financial system fosters innovation by providing essential financial services. The works of Hsu et al. (2014), Pradhan et al. (2016), and Pradhan et al. (2018) confirm the hypothesis that financial development drives innovation at the country level. Despite the volume of work, the effects of innovation and financial development on economic growth are still at the heart of the economic debate. The financial crisis of 2008 has shown how much these sectors of the economy are interdependent and that a cross-examination is needed to analyze this interdependence (Dosi et al. 2016). However, little is known about the specificities of the links between finance, innovation, and economic growth, and the main works have often studied these themes separately, while they are strongly intertwined in macroeconomic functioning (Dutraive 2016). Previous work on these themes suffers from two major limitations. First, many previous empirical studies of these relationships are based on cross-sectional data, which cannot properly address country-specific problems. Second, much of the previous work is largely derived from a bidirectional causal analysis and may therefore suffer from bias of the omission of variables. In these studies, the Granger causality test was widely used to identify causality in a bidirectional setting on chronological or panel data. One of the main reasons for the lack of consensus is that the Granger causality test in a two-variable setting may be biased (Stern 1993). However, it was clear that the results obtained by performing a bidirectional causality test may be invalid due to the omission of an important variable that may affect the two variables included in the causality model (Omri et al. 2014; Le and Tran-Nam 2018). This study therefore attempts to fill this gap by examining the causal link between financial development, innovation, and economic growth using a multivariate panel approach, known as the panel vector autoregression model (PVAR), proposed by Love and Zicchino (2006) to examine the relationship for a panel consisting of 27 OECD countries. Multivariate models incorporate other variables to ensure robust results that can alter the statistical relationship established in a two-variable setting (Bartleet and Gounder 2010). The study attempts to answer two critical questions. Does financial development (economic growth), which stems from economic growth (financial development), contribute to fostering innovation in the OECD country? Which sector leads to the process of improving innovation capacity—the financial sector or the real sector? The main contribution of this study is twofold. First, this paper used panel VAR approach (PVAR) to study the three-way linkages between innovation, financial development, and economic growth for a panel consitsing of 27 OECD countries. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the empirical studies has focused on investigating the three-way linkages between innovation, financial development, and growth using the panel VAR procedure. The main contribution of this procedure is that it combines the classical approach of VAR models with the approach of panel data. The use of panel data addresses issues related to data availability and increases the number of data by including country information (Boubtane 2018). This methodology also has the advantage of involving several endogenous variables explained by their delayed values and will allow us to analyze both the impact of (Abdouli and Hammami 2017) innovation (INN) and financial development (FD) on the economic growth, (Abrigo and Love 2016) economic growth and financial development (FD) on innovation (INN), and (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006) economic growth and innovation (INN) on financial development (FD), using the System GMM estimator developed by Blundell and Bond (1998). The latter makes it possible to control the problem of endogeneity and makes the results coherent and robust (Acheampong 2018). In this paper, forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) and impulse response functions (IRF) are used to predict the impact of a positive shock of economic growth on innovation (INN) and financial development (FD) in the short and long term. Second, and following the work of Omri et al. (2014) and Abdouli and Hammami (2017), the form of growth was applied to all variables. As a result, all the variables are stationary, which allows us to avoid the problem of cointegration. In this sense, the approach adopted in this study is to estimate short-run and not estimating the long-run one, given the characteristics of our growth form modeling. The paper is organized as follows. “Literature Review” section presents a brief description of the literature. “Data and Methodology” section describes the econometric modeling approach and describes the data used. “The Estimation of the VAR Model for Each Country” section discusses the empirical results of the VAR model for each country. “The Estimation of the VAR Model for All Countries” section presents the empirical results for all countries. “Conclusion and Policy Implications” section presents the conclusions and offer some policy implications.",35

Bell (2010) considers that students increasingly aspire to education beyond a bachelor’s degree. Researchers have tried to explain some of the reasons for this increase – e.g., status attainment (Sewell et al. 1980) and its attendant benefits, as well as factors influencing the decisions behind it. Viewed from a broader perspective, higher education is regarded as important for the development of successful economies, as it provides opportunities for all those (male and female) willing to participate in knowledge production and hence allows everyone to benefit from a successful economy (Brennan and Naidoo 2007). One of the main objectives of higher education, therefore, is to create a knowledge society where experts, professionals, and knowledge workers in particular are seen to be enhancing economic and social development (Brennan and Naidoo 2007). The aspiration for higher education is, therefore, key to the successful creation of a knowledge society with a knowledge-based economy. Higher education has received heightened policy attention all over the world in recent decades (Brennan and Naidoo 2007, as has the aspiration of students to acquire higher education. Consequently, models have been developed to understand students’ educational aspirations. Prominent among these models is the college choice model (Hossler and Gallagher 1987), which involves three primary sequential stages: predisposition, search, and choice. The second is the student outcome model (Ethington and Smart 1986; Pascarella and Terenzini 2005) which takes into consideration individual student characteristics, institutional environment, and outcomes. The third is Carter’s degree aspiration model (Carter 1999, 2001, 2003), the features of which are similar to the first two models but with an emphasis on graduate degree aspirations. The past few decades have witnessed women in some developing countries making giant strides in the education arena and demanding social reforms to ensure equal educational and occupational opportunities. The percentage of women enrolling into and earning degrees has also increased substantially (Kelly and Slaughter 1991), including in traditionally male-dominated fields. However, this proportional increase is not sustained up to graduate school level. According to Perna (2004), women receive more first degrees than men but experience a gradual reduction in participation rates at subsequent levels, thereby obtaining fewer first professional and doctoral degrees. Several factors may account for this reverse trend, but scholars are generally of the view that the individual decision process plays a critical role. What then are the factors influencing the decision of women, specifically female graduate assistants, to attend graduate school? Although some models have been developed regarding the undergraduate and college decision process in the last few decades (Hossler and Gallagher 1987; Carter 1991, 2001), fewer exist for the graduate-level decision process, particularly targeting this segment of women in developing economies. Unlike undergraduate and college, the decision process at graduate level tends to be more complex, as it relates to career and life accomplishments, which may have more impact on subsequent status attainment. According to Olson and King (1985), the decision process at graduate level depends on several variables – including potential income streams, employment, and possibly an inestimable opportunity cost that are not present at undergraduate level. Also of importance are the roles students, especially female students, are expected to play after graduation in some social and cultural settings. Building on research that has examined students’ graduate aspirations (Ethington and Smart 1986; Carter 2003; Pascarella and Terenzini 2005; Pascarella et al. 2011), this study looks at graduate education aspirations as they relate to women and specifically targeting a section of women (female graduate assistants) in a developing economy. The study develops and tests the appropriateness of some identified causative factors in existing literature as well as some other factors, not included in most models but considered important in the context of Saudi Arabia, that influence the decision to attend graduate school. We propose a causal model. This incorporates three primary predictor variable sets or sources of influence on the decision of female graduate assistants to attend graduate school: (1) background characteristics, (2) college experience, and (3) resource availability. Thus, the study evaluates the extent of influence these identified predictor variables (e.g., national culture, marital status, pre-college aspirations, cost, etc.) have on the decision to attend graduate school in the context of Saudi Arabia. This study’s emphasis is on the background characteristics variable set. Specifically, the main research questions are as follows: first, does national culture influence the decision process to attend graduate school; secondly, to what extent does marital status influence the decision to attend graduate school? The results show different levels of relationship (including none) to the decision to attend graduate school. This study contributes to the higher education aspiration literature in several ways. First, we extend background characteristics to include the national cultural dimension, by providing evidence that it plays a vital part in the decision process to attend graduate school. Second, we extend and further clarify the gender (sex) factor to include marital status in a setting where culture plays a mediatory role. Is being married a limiting variable to educational opportunities and career rights? According to Mattarima and Hamdan (2011), the position of women in Saudi Arabian society has changed, and their contribution to the development process is more important, but in spite of this achievement, women’s positions and education still face some challenges in Saudi Arabian society, which prefers that women contribute to family life rather than professional life. Existing studies identify this as greatly affecting graduate education aspirations (Eagan and Newman 2010; Varhegyi and Jepsen 2009). We extend this line of research by providing evidence that the cost is not particularly influential in settings where the government plays a large role in the education sector. Finally, we add to the literature and extend information on how this decision is made by a working group (full-time employed female graduate assistants in universities) in a developing economy where culture/religion plays a dominant role. The study looked at the decision process before students attend graduate school and not the process of attaining a graduate degree in the form of teaching methods or good teaching practices. It proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature and hypothesis development and describes the research design. Section 3 reports the empirical results and presents our conclusions. Section 4 presents further remarks and research limitations.",5

(2017). In that work, the CDR index was considered for how it reflected on mindset toward entrepreneurship and community economic transformation (Ridley et al. 2008). It was argued that countries that neglected the need for either capitalism, democracy, or the rule of law have lower gross domestic product. Furthermore, until there is a change in that mindset, entrepreneurship does not succeed. This is despite massive natural resources. No formal measurements were made. All depictions of CDR and its implications for per capita real gross domestic product adjusted for purchasing power parity (G) were based on approximate trends. This paper presents a formal measurement of the CDR index based on published country market capitalization, ranking in democracy, and ranking in corruption (Goel et al. 2016; Czap and Nur-tegin 2012, see also Couttenier and Toubal 2017; López et al. 2017). Rule of law reflects government effectiveness indicators such as the prevention of theft, the protection of property rights and contracts, the control of corruption, regulatory quality, political stability and absence of violence, access to justice and efficient court proceedings, the status and role of legal professionals, administration of justice, and management of courts. With the exception of corruption, these variables are complicated constructs, the details of which are not understood by the average investor. Despite their presence, rules can be broken and corruption can persist. And everybody has a strong perception of corruption, when and where it exists. It is this perception that informs their willingness to invest time, money, and effort. Precise breakdowns and measurement are impossible. But it is generally agreed which countries are more or less corrupt. Therefore, despite what might have been small differences in component scores, the country ranking can be the same. In this paper, the transparency international corruption perception index is chosen to represent the opposite of rule of law. We investigate the individual relationships between G and capitalism as measured by market capitalization, G and democracy as measured by country democracy ranking, and G and rule of law as measured by country rule of law ranking, ceteris paribus. Democracy ranking is a proxy for new pathway creations that connect human capital thoughts, ideas, imagination, and creativity. Rule of law ranking is a proxy for stability that attracts capital. It is not uncommon for national policy to focus on the discovery of natural resources. However, this research reveals that the relationship between G and the CDR index is undeniable, irrespective of a shortage or abundance of natural resources. Countries with a low CDR index fare poorly in G even when they are rich in natural resources. Natural resources can exacerbate the social ill effects of little or no democracy and injustice due to little or no rule of law (Norman 2009; Frankel 2012). So much so that countries are better off embracing a national policy that focuses on raising their CDR index. There are also benefits associated with diversifying from natural resources (Cullen 2017). Different economic schools of thought suggest different determinants of economic growth. Classical and neo-classical economics favor only market forces of demand and supply, producer’s urge for profit maximization, and consumers’ motive of utility maximization. Keynesian economics criticizes the classical school for its sole reliance on market forces and for ignoring recessions and the possibility of market failure due to factors such as the savings paradox. It favors government interventions via fiscal and monetary policy formulation and implementation to restore the competitiveness of the market. Institutional economics emphasizes the impact of institutions via various socio-economic cultures (Hamilton 1919; Hodgson 2000). Schumpeter (1911, 1928, 1954) was the first to present a model that includes entrepreneurship. Micro-combinations and suggestions for their aggregation into industries were offered by Houthakker (1955). The fixed proportion production function was proposed by Leontief (1906–1999). Schumpeter (1911, 1928, 1954) was the first to present a model that includes entrepreneurship. Solow (1956) suggested that growth be determined by an aggregate production function of capital and labor, where capital is the stock of installed equipment. But said capital is not the same as C that is assigned to entrepreneurship. The measure of market capitalization assumes that investors act rationally and without bias, and current value is discounted future earnings, thereby taking into account the impact on G in current and all subsequent years. Therefore, the Solow (1956) model is not useful for determining growth due to entrepreneurship. Whereas the Solow model is presented as an aggregate production function, Ridley and Ngnepieba (2018) show definitively by mathematical proof that there is no such thing as an aggregate production function. They show that under certain abstract configurations of production units, an aggregate production function that is equivalent to the sum of individual production units is theoretically possible. But these configurations are limited, restrictive, and short of a miracle, most unlikely to occur in practice. It is a fallacy of composition (Cohen and Harcourt 2003). In this paper, we take an interdisciplinary approach, combining elements of neo classical (capitalism) and institutional economics (democracy and rule of law) to explain G. All wealth is shown to originate in human capital of ideas and imagination. The mean square error parameter estimator for a Cobb-Douglas type function \( G={\alpha}_0{K}^{\alpha_K}{L}^{\alpha_L}e \), where the fixed part of capital stock (K) and labor (L) are complementary, and e is random error associated with uncertainty, yields well-known high correlations between actual and fitted values. But, this function cannot account for new wealth creation from human capital represented in C, and C and L are not complementary anyway. Exogenous catalysts D and R augment C but are not complementary and \( G={\beta}_0{C}^{\beta_C}{D}^{\beta_D}{R}^{\beta_R}\varepsilon \), where є is random error, yields very low correlations. On the other hand, this paper proposes G=βCC + βDD + βRR + βCDRC · D · R + ε, where ε is random error, includes an interaction term, and yields very high correlations, irrespective of government spending, natural resources, country size, location, culture, and other commonly held beliefs. A negative coefficient βCDR resolves prior conflicting research on the relationship between G and D. It exhibits ideal ordinary least squares (OLS) properties of parameter significance with no unwanted correlations. No structural equations, two-stage least squares (2SLS) or instrumental variables (IVs), are required for efficient prediction of G. The macro-economic C, D, R and micro-economic K, L derivations of G are reconciled into a single mathematical function. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. “Literature Review” is a literature review of determinants of economic growth, with a focus on scholarly work that analyzed capitalism, democracy, and rule of law as individual determinants of economic growth. “The CDR Index” discusses data and construction of the CDR index. “Graphical Analysis” and “Macro-economic Statistical Analysis” contain graphic and regression analyses. A vexillological chart is used to identify countries. “Parametric Global Invariance” and “Entrepreneurship” relate the macro-economic cross country statistical model findings to parametric global invariance, and entrepreneurship. “Reconcilling the Macro- and Micro-economies” reconciles the macro- and micro-economic models. “Conclusions” contains concluding remarks and suggestions for future research.",3

Innovation is a vital, multi-dimensional instrument for any organization. The profitability of any innovation depends on the degree to which firms can capture the rents generated by their innovations (Arrow & Hurwicz, 1958). This is called as “appropriability regime,” a term introduced by Teece, which can be either rigid or flexible in its attributes. (Teece, 2006) Hence, one can speculate that the strength of the appropriability regime of an industry depends upon factors such as the number of patents, the value of first-mover advantage, and the ability to maintain confidentiality (Teece, 1986; Gulati & Singh, 1998). Concerns over innovation and its success in a market platform are important especially in the food industry since nearly 50–75% of the new products introduced in the market become failures later on (Dijksterhuis, 2016). Also, only 1–2% of the products are of radical changes, whereas the rest almost is of incremental change (“me-too” product) (Winger & Wall, 2006). But this phenomenon seems to be continuing even now particularly within the food sector in India with the vast majority of the development has taken place only in food retailing and delivery space. The food industries around the world have made substantial changes and in precise have become overwhelmingly competitive and many business model innovations have also been developed and adopted simultaneously so far (Amit & Zott, 2010). India is slowly adapting to sustainable changes as well. With the rise of various food product alternatives and biotechnological advancement within the food industry, companies are increasingly taking into account, the environmental sustainability, and social security aspects as well. Moreover, the food-service sector is increasingly becoming rampant in India in both urban and rural ecosystems. But the question as to where India stands amongst these evolving landscapes and what business and startups growing in these arenas must look forward in the future to establish themselves as stronghold firms are of vitality today. The Indian food processing sector is one of the fast-growing industries in India with an average annual growth rate of around 8.41% just between the years 2014 and 2018 (Bhatia et al., 2020). Being one of the largest food processing sectors in the world, its output is expected to reach almost USD 535 bn by the year 2025–2026 (Bhatia et al., 2020). This is attributed to the fact that the Indian market is changing  its consumption patterns due to rapid urbanization, changes in workforce gender composition, and also rapid consumption rates (Bhatia et al., 2020). But to keep up with these changes, the food industry must be receptive to adopt innovation with changing times. It is also a general notion that the food industry as a sector has low R&D spending and this is true for the Indian food sector as well when compared with the rest of the industries (Török, 2018). The present study is exploratory and is based on secondary data collected from various journal databases and reports published in indiastat.com and WIPO. The study has attempted to explore the status of the Indian food sector within the context of innovation. For that, the objective of the study is divided into sub-objectives as per the following: What are the different types of innovations and how they are interlinked with each other? What are all the barriers to innovation for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) of the Indian food sector which hinders its growth? Where does the Indian food sector stand in terms of patent and R&D expenditure in comparison with other sectors? What support mechanism is available for SME innovation in the Indian context presently and on which aspect it should be more focused in the future?",5

IPRs were intensified worldwide from the 80s and 90s, when we witnessed a process of trade liberalization and an intensification of companies’ integration into the global economy. This period coincided with the phenomenon of outsourcing and the emergence of global value chains which represents a reorientation of multinational companies’ strategies (Gereffi 1999), and has different impacts on different national economies. Along with the distribution of productive activities by multinational companies (what is called production fragmentation), there is also the distribution of R&D activities on a global scale; however, they are still pretty much concentrated in developed nations—that is, the USA, Japan, and (east) Europe (Chesnais 1996; Chesnais 2010). The distribution of tangible and intangible inputs necessary to global production activities and their results obeys specific strategies defined by multinational companies which control global value chains. This means that the overall picture of learning and competence building, “knowledge fencing” and catching-up becomes more critical, and it depends on countless strategies structured by the leaders in different global value chains. There is a large body of literature that already presented the limits of IPRs, the impacts of foreign direct investment (FDI), and trade liberalization for companies in a catching-up process in less industrialized nations such as in Vaitsos (1972), Penrose (1973); Lall (1980); Correa (1997); Maskus (2000); Sell and May (2001); Coriat (2002); Michalopoulos (2003); Chang (Chang 2003, 2004, 2009); Sell (2004); Lai (2007); Branstetter et al. (2007), and Kascheva (2013) just to name a few. Our objective here is to give emphasis to the fact that IPRs, on one hand may encourage inventive activities and industrial innovation; however, on the other, promote an extra impediment to companies’ learning, especially for those with reduced resources to access protected knowledge and those that integrate global value chains in activities with low value added. Therefore, IPRs generate additional costs for catching-up companies. We do not intend to make a comprehensive compendium of all literature available regarding the pros and cons of IPRs, which is too large to be reviewed here and it had been done elsewhere. In short, we aim to answer the following questions: Is domestic knowledge production an important feature of relatively more developed nations? Our hypothesis is that new knowledge creates cumulative advantages for those who create it and for those who have access to and have capacity to absorb and use it. In consequence, domestic knowledge production is a crucial asset for economic development. Results presented in this paper show that national efforts to increase the production of new relevant knowledge whose proxy is the percentage of patent applications by residentsFootnote 1who are closed linked with nations with high GDP per capita levels, suggesting that there may be a bi-directional correlation between these two variables. Prior to launching into the discussion, we shall present the structure of our paper: Firstly, we introduce our interpretative framework, i.e., for the individual company, IPRs increase the appropriability conditions but in a macro perspective, it reduces the nation’s learning opportunities. After, we propose the methodology we use to test our hypothesis. To test it through a Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA), we use secondary data from the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and from the World Bank, then we show the model estimation results. Finally, we present some discussions and concluding remarks.",9
12.0,2.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,10 March 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00772-3,Platform Patterns—Using Proven Principles to Develop Digital Platforms,June 2021,Marvin Drewel,Leon Özcan,Roman Dumitrescu,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In the course of digitization, the concept of digital platforms or IT platforms has been the subject of a veritable hype in recent years (Engels et al.,, 2017) and is experiencing an impressive renaissance (Linz et al., 2017). Digital platforms are putting established companies across industries under pressure. Former well-established enterprises like Nokia or Blackberry are now dominated by platform enterprises like Apple. Based on these changes, van Alstyne et al. have formulated the somewhat bold thesis that “only those who understand the principle and transform their business model will survive” (Alstyne et al., 2016). Up to now, this thesis has been mainly applied to the business-to-consumer (B2C) sector. There, digital platforms such as Uber, Airbnb, or Amazon have radically changed their industries and displaced formerly established companies (Libert et al., 2016). At present, such a development is also apparent in the B2B sector and here in particular in mechanical engineering and related sectors such as the electronics industry, automotive industry, or medical technology (Lerch et al., 2019). Leading companies are stepping out of their core business and develop own platforms. Additionally, agile start-ups begin to build platform solutions and services for digital platforms (Koldewey et al., 2019). Driven by digitization, such platforms can link actors who have never been in contact with each other (Altman et al., 2013). Following Parker et al., the disruptive potential of digital platforms is based on two major economic advantages: (1) marginal costs and (2) network effects. These advantages enable companies to expand their platform businesses with relatively low investments compared with traditional businesses (Cusumano et al., 2019; Parker et al., 2017). Marginal costs describe the additional costs that occur if an additional unit of a certain product or service is being produced (O'Sullivan & Sheffrin, 2003). For instance, if the Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. decides to expand to a new market, they need to invest in new buildings and new personal staff. Contrary to this, if Airbnb decides to expand to a new market, they do not need such investments. The new accommodations are provided by private home owners who also act as staff for the consumers of Airbnb. The additional costs for these new accommodations are almost not existing which allows platforms to expand their business with minimal costs, once their platforms are established and running (Alstyne et al., 2016). The network effect describes how the consumer value of a product changes when the number of consumers of the same product or complementary products changes. A distinction is made between the direct and indirect network effect. The direct network effect was described in 1986 by Katz and Shapiro and states that a product’s value changes with the total number of consumers of that product (Farrell & Saloner, 1992; Funk, 2009; Katz & Shapiro, 1986). Often referred examples for this effect are telephones and fax machines. Within the context of digital platforms, the direct network effect occurs, e.g., on social media platforms such as Facebook. The indirect network effect occurs when the value of a product changes as soon as the number of consumers of another product changes without a direct relationship between these products (Shapiro & Varian, 1998). The indirect network effect is characteristic for two- or multisided markets. Thereby, an increased number of participants on the one side of the market tends to increase the number of participants on the other side of the market. This effect is the driving force behind digital platforms like Airbnb or Uber. Positive network effects are the foundation for digital platforms. Thus, the more participants a platform has, the more attractive it becomes for other participants. This is referred to as self-reinforcing “chain reactions” which—once initiated—lead to the rapid growth of digital platforms. This is the reason why for each market only a very limited number of platforms can economically exist (Eisenmann et al., 2006). An analysis of the historical development of the most valuable companies worldwide impressively visualizes the disruptive potential of digital platforms (Fig. 1). While classic companies dominated the ranking in 1995, six of the ten most valuable companies were platform companies in 2018.Footnote 1 It is striking that the number of valuable platform companies has increased rapidly in recent times. The ten most valuable companies from 1995 to 2018 by market capitalization in billion US dollars (fortiss Gmbh, 2016; Kempe, 2011; Payment & Banking, 2019) Companies can conduct classic activities along an input/output process and create a platform ecosystem while doing so. For example, the development, production, and distribution of Apple’s iPhone follow a classic value chain. At the same time, Apple has created a platform ecosystem around its iOS operating system in which the iPhone is embedded. With the introduction of the iOS platform in 2007, Apple was able to capture a significant share of the global smartphone market within just a few years. Apple’s core business is the sale of hardware components, which accounts for 80% of its revenues. However, the success of the company and thus also the sale of the hardware is significantly influenced by the platform character of the company (Reillier & Reillier, 2017). In the following section, we will discuss the way digital platforms work in order to understand the reasons for the success of digital platforms.",6

The socioeconomic and geopolitical framework describing commuting renders the analysis and thus the comprehension of this phenomenon a very important procedure for the effective and sustainable transportation planning and policy (Evans et al. 2002; Van Ommeren and Rietveld 2005). The multivariate nature of commuting obviously sets the holistic microeconomic analysis of this phenomenon to be a particularly complex procedure, a fact that has favored so far mostly the decomposition approach in the research field. Many aspects of the commuting phenomenon have been studied so far by regional researchers, such as suggestively are transportation (distance and time) cost (Van Ommeren and Fosgerau 2009; Tsiotas and Polyzos 2013a), travel stress (Koslowsky et al. 1995), travel accident probability (Ozbay et al. 2007), transportation and route alternatives (Murphy 2009; Liu and Nie 2011), and productivity changes (Van Ommeren and Rietveld 2005). One of the modern scientific sectors capable in providing a modeling toolkit for the macroscopic geographic and socioeconomic analysis of spatial communication systems is the so called (complex) Network Analysis (Brandes and Erlebach 2005; Barthelemy 2011). This recently established analytical framework, and in particular Social Network Analysis (Easley and Kleinberg 2010), became extremely popular during the rapid sprawl of the Social Network Sites (SNS) (Kalantzi and Tsiotas 2012) through the World Wide Web (WWW) (Berners-Lee et al. 2007; Tsiotas and Vafopoulos 2010), which managed today to overcome the initial borders of its maternal science, Sociology, and to introduce an individual scientific sector cited by many researchers as Network Theory (Zuckerman 1999; Easley and Kleinberg 2010; Borgatti and Halgin 2011). Network Theory interprets communication systems as networks G(V,E) (Easley and Kleinberg 2010; Borgatti and Halgin 2011; Tsiotas and Polyzos 2013a), which are being represented as a set of interconnected entities, called vertices or nodes V(G), with their connections, called edges or links E(G). Whether considering that the existence of communication systems is diachronic in human history (Apicella et al. 2012), then a network does not suggest a modern concept. Nevertheless, the modern post-Social Network Theoretic aspect of networks, expressing the everyday life’s experience of “being connected” (Christakis and Fowler 2009), has transformed these communication structures into a modern way of thought. According to the above conceptual consideration of networks, the interregional commuting system can also suggest a network, since at this level of scale it refers to a set of interconnected cities that daily communicate by exchanging commute labor potential. This article proposes a Network Theoretical model for the interregional commuting analysis, which estimates the number of commuters that operate in a commuting network, based on the conceptual framework provided by the Web-Science for the structural decomposition of the Web, as it was presented by Tsiotas and Polyzos (2013b). The proposed model is being constructed on the interregional communication system consisting of the 39 non-insular prefectures of Greece, and its applicability and effectiveness are tested on real commuting and socioeconomic data. The conceptual width of the model’s components renders generality to the utility of the proposed model that is believed to be capable to constitute an effective tool for the principal analytic manipulation of a network under an insignificant loss of information. This paper is organized as follows: “Methodology” presents the methodological part: the conceptual framework for network analysis is described, the interregional commuting model is constructed, and the necessary quantitative framework is presented. “Results and Discussion” presents and discusses the results of the analysis, under a regional economic perspective. Finally, in “Conclusions,” conclusions are given.",3

Innovation generally requires the exploration of new ideas as well as realization of new approaches for national development (Capozza and Divella 2019; Ma et al. 2019; Alawamleh et al. 2019; Pradana et al. 2020). In the firm level innovation literature, there is tendency to consider innovation as a linear process largely related to scientific and technical knowledge developed in Research and Development (R&D) laboratories (Capozza and Divella 2019). However, it is observed that innovation is also dependent on firms’ ability to enhance the knowledge of their employees and protect their intellectual property from competitors (Jensen et al. 2007; Capozza and Divella 2019). Therefore, the progress of firms is presumed to depend on their ability to manage knowledge. Then again, management of knowledge requires not only improving human capital capabilities of firms but also protecting their intellectual property. This is because intellectual property right is conventionally believed to be a medium of encouraging innovative activities especially for firms in developing economies that are generally considered less innovative (Falvey et al. 2006). These firms can be encouraged to innovate by granting them inventor temporary monopoly power for their new discoveries. More so, companies willing to innovate need employees with expertise and knowledge to develop such new ideas (Pradana et al. 2020). Therefore, to achieve such innovation goal, firms particularly in developing countries need not only competent employees but also those who are ready to apply their knowledge and expertise in their organizational activities (Costa Jr and McCrae 1992; Pradana et al. 2020). This is because employees with skills, knowledge and expertise create chances for firms in developing countries to innovate new products, services, ideas and practices that would enable them to compete in the highly developed and technologically driven markets in the advanced economies (Sun et al. 2020). Nonetheless, most firms in developing countries like Nigeria are characterized as small and medium sized with limited financial and human capabilities which lessen their ability to innovate and compete favourably with their counterparts in the developed economies. In most situations, they lack in-house strength and have weak linkages with advanced technologies and knowledge institutions (Ilori et al. 2000; Adeyeye et al. 2013; Oyewale 2005; Sun et al. 2020). On the contrary, evidences have shown that developed economies that have invested in human capital have improved their labour capabilities towards discoveries and creation of new ideas which in turn improve firm’s performance especially in innovation related activities and the general performance of their economies (Ma et al. 2019). Our focus in this paper is to examine the impact of human capital on knowledge production activity of manufacturing and service firms in Nigeria. In particular, the paper aims to explore the firms’ strategies for intellectual property protection and interaction of human capital components and innovation. The study is framed within the knowledge-based production model—which is built on human capital components that lead to innovation among firms. Thus, this study contributes to the body of literature in a number of ways. First, in contrast to earlier studies, this paper examines the impact of human capital on intellectual property protection strategies. This aspect of the literature on human capital and innovation seems to be overlooked by previous studies as majority of the studies focus on only one or few strategies which cannot give adequate information on human capital and innovation nexus especially for studies on developing countries like Nigeria (Adeyeye et al. 2016; Capozza and Divella 2019; Sun et al. 2020). Thus, with its particular focus on the complementarity among the different strategies of protecting intellectual property among firms, this paper adds new knowledge to the existing literature. Second, assessing the impact of human capital components influencing innovative activities using country-specific analysis remains a crucial task. This is because majority of the previous studies are on developed and emerging economies (Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Zahra and George 2002; McGuirk et al. 2015; Sun 2015; Pradana et al. 2020; Sun et al. 2020) or use cross-country and panel studies for developing countries (AlShekaili and Boerhannoeddin 2011; van Uden et al. 2014; Capozza and Divella 2019). Their findings cannot be generalized due to the heterogeneous nature of firms across the countries. Again, the process of transforming human capital to innovation depends on country’s knowledge management practices especially among firms. For instance, the government of Nigeria in the last decade has advanced various measures and laws towards enhancing innovative activities among government and private sector employees through routine training, workshops and other opportunities such as loan. This practice is essential in promoting innovative activities. Third, our findings expand the innovation literature by providing a more profound and robust analysis of different strategies of intellectual property right and their link with human capital. The remaining parts of the paper is structured as follows: “Literature Review” reviews related literature; methodology and results and discussions are treated in “Methodology” and “Results and Discussion”, respectively, followed by conclusion and policy recommendations in the last section.",8

In the era of economic sharing, not only does domestic R&D investment have an impact on R&D innovation, but international trade has a profound impact on it (Rodil et al., 2015). On the one hand, international trade is conducive to promoting the free flow of technology between countries and benefiting more countries and enterprises; on the other hand, it has strengthened market competition and expanded the scale of market, so that there exists an opportunity for “innovative producers” to improve their market competitiveness through international trade. It not only helps to cover the R&D cost of enterprises, but also gains the dynamic benefits that are difficult to achieve only in the internal market. This paper will study the impact of the competition effect of international trade and technology spillover on R&D innovation by taking spatial interdependence into account. In order to achieve the goal of integrating spatial features between countries into research framework, this paper draws lessons from Fisher and Wang (2011), and uses a structured approach to derive and construct a spatial econometric model based on economic theory. The main contributions of this paper are shown as follows. Theoretically, we expand the Schumpeterian model of endogenous growth, and analyze in-depth the influence of international trade on R&D innovation through international competition and technology spillover. Empirically, by adopting a structured approach, we build a spatial econometric model based on theoretical models, which is not only conducive to capture the indirect impacts of technology spillover caused by international trade (Lumenga-Neso et al., 2005) but also beneficial to the “mutual” verification of theoretical and empirical results. Moreover, the research approach combining theory and evidence in this paper provides an effective and credible framework for further discussion of the impact of international trade on R&D innovation.",6

Among other things, OI has gained popularity because an increasing number of private firms engage in OI and adapt such practices (van de Vrande et al. 2009). The attractiveness of the OI paradigm is that it is based on the premise that valuable ideas and knowledge can emerge from internal as well as external sources and can enter the market from inside or outside the firm (Chesbrough et al. 2006). In line with Chesbrough, we thus define OI as “the use of purposive inflows and outflows of knowledge to accelerate internal innovation, and to expand the markets for external use of innovation, respectively” (Chesbrough et al. 2006: 1). Whereas the “first process is called inbound open innovation,” the second process is called “outbound open innovation” (Huizingh 2011: 1): Both cover a variety of practices, which makes open innovation a rich concept that can be implemented in diverse ways by firms (Vanhaverbeke et al. 2017). Inspired by Dahlander and Gann (2010), who also acknowledge the richness of the OI concept, we define inbound activities (typically also termed outside-in or inward) as activities where firms’ “source and acquire expertise and knowledge” whereas outbound activities (typically also named inside-out and outward) refer to how firms’ “attempt to sell ideas and resources in the marketplace” (Dahlander and Gann 2010: 700) or reveal new knowledge and business potential. Despite the increased use of OI, for example due to its richness and wide applicability for many and different firms, managers still ask how they can work successfully with OI in a way that enables firms to exploit their current capabilities and simultaneously explore fundamentally new competencies (Giannopoulou et al. 2011; Huizingh 2011). Therefore, knowledge of how firms practice different forms of OI—inbound or outbound—while simultaneously reaping the value these forms create (West and Bogers 2014) is still lacking. To be able to contribute to this relevant area of OI, we suggest in the following that OI researchers reconsider how OI research currently approaches the idea of exploiting current capabilities and simultaneously exploring fundamentally new competencies. Furthermore, we suggest to support an emerging area of research focused on the project level as this level seems promising to unveil more fine-grained knowledge of how firm managers can cope with OI (Bonesso et al. 2014). In the OI literature, the notion of exploration and exploitation is typically applied in two ways: (1) with a process perspective related to the inbound-outbound OI dichotomy or, more recently, OI continuum (Dahlander and Gann 2010; Felin and Zenger 2014), according to which inbound OI typically is described as knowledge exploration and outbound OI typically is referred to as knowledge exploitation (van de Vrande et al. 2009; Giannopoulou et al. 2011) and (2) with a relational perspective where exploration is referred to as a collaboration strategy, according to which firms should collaborate with new partners in the search for external knowledge, and where exploitation is referred to as a collaboration strategy in which firms should collaborate with existing partners in the search for external knowledge (Dittrich and Duysters 2007; Harryson 2008; Chesbrough and Prencipe 2008). Based on March’s original framework of exploration and exploitation (March 1991; Lavie et al. 2010), we demonstrate in the paper that the two OI perspectives, regarding the creation of exploitation or exploration activities (the process and relational perspectives), do not sufficiently capture the idea behind March’s notion. The idea of exploiting current capabilities and simultaneously exploring fundamentally new competencies is closely linked to the notion of exploitation and exploration, coined by James March (1991) (Li et al. 2008): A notion in which exploration is associated with “search, experimentation, flexibility, discovery, risk taking and innovation,” and where exploitation is associated with “refinement, selection and production, efficiency, implementation and execution” (p. 71). March introduces exploration and exploitation in relation to organizational learning (Lavie et al. 2010), and as OI builds on the basic premise of being able to learn and adopt new knowledge, its application in OI research is relevant (Dahlander and Gann 2010; Huizingh 2011). Thus, for firms, the key is to simultaneously combine exploitation and exploration activities in order to stimulate the continuous flow of current and new knowledge. In the paper, we thus define exploration and exploitation as exploration processes lead to variation, risk-taking, flexibility, discovery, or creation and innovation, whereas exploitation processes lead to improvement of existing competencies, processes, and products with the aim of making best use of what an organization and its actors already know (March 1991; Lavie et al. 2010). By grounding the distinction of inbound and outbound on whether firms approach their OI activities from a long-term explorative perspective or approach OI activities from a short-term and exploitative perspective (Vanhaverbeke et al. 2008), we also contribute by softening the widespread typology of pecuniary and non-pecuniary proposed by Dahlander and Gann (2010). Rather than becoming a question of whether OI activities are based on either pecuniary or non-pecuniary interactions (Dahlander and Gann 2010: 702), the emphasis is on how firms can reap various forms of value (both pecuniary and non-pecuniary value) in the short and long run by practicing different forms of OI activities. Furthermore, our approach to OI differs from the level of the firm, in which most OI research commences (Vanhaverbeke et al., 2014; Hossain and Anees-ur-Rehman 2016). To gain more knowledge of how firms practice different forms of OI (inbound or outbound), we approach OI from the project level as OI research has shown that OI at the firm level typically is a consequence of various OI initiatives at the project level (Bahemia and Squire 2010; Jingshu et al. 2014). Innovation activities in private firms, due to their different forms, are commonly managed at the project level as this level functions as “tools of innovation” that supports managers to “quickly react to and leverage on external opportunities” and at the same time balance the need for “the long-term accumulation of a firm’s knowledge stock” (Bonesso et al. 2014: 92). Accordingly, we suggest to commence in the project level, as this level is promising in the sense that it enables firm managers to better cope with exploitative and explorative OI activities simultaneously (Tushman and O’Reilly 1996). In addition, the project level shows how firm managers use the opportunities available to collaborate in various ways with outside players, such as suppliers, customers, competitors, lead users, research institutions, and organizations that “either have solutions that can improve the company’s innovations or that can exploit solutions the company has developed” (Huizingh 2011: 6). Thus, the project level may potentially become a strategic tool through which firms can build and strengthen their ambidextrous abilities, providing a strong fit between their current knowledge base and the changing context surrounding them (Vanhaverbeke et al. 2008). Even though the project level has gained increasing attention from OI researchers in recent years (Hossain and Anees-ur-Rehman 2016) and seems promising to unveil more fine-grained insights (Bonesso et al. 2014), knowledge is still lacking as to explain how value is captured at the project level (West and Bogers, 2014). For that reason, the increase in studies at the project level happening in the last years should be further supported (Bonesso et al. 2014; Hossain and Anees-ur-Rehman 2016). How firms at the project level practice and reap value from simultaneously exploring and exploiting different forms of OI activities (inbound and outbound) thus remains under-investigated in OI literature and consequently, we know very little about how different OI activities co-exist in firms and are managed (Giannopoulou et al. 2011). By drawing on well-established concepts in the OI literature (inbound and outbound), this paper contributes to theory development in the research field of OI as follows. Through refinements in the current OI research, a typology of four OI project approaches is developed that explain how firms can exploit their current capabilities and simultaneously explore fundamentally new competencies through the use of purposive inflows and outflows of knowledge. The four OI project approaches are categorized according to the strategic objective of the project. Here, the focus is on the project’s relative emphasis on exploration (long-term focus) versus exploitation (short-term focus) and the opening up of the innovation process as either inbound or outbound. Furthermore, the clear denotation of the typology contributes to clarify the terms and their reciprocal interplay used in OI literature. Moreover, the practical relevance of our approach to exploration and exploitation in OI research is illustrated through the case of LEGO showing how various OI activities at the project level can be managed at the same time, creating value in the short and long term for firms. Thus, the typology prepares the ground for a better understanding of how to manage OI in firms, which is often called for in the OI literature (Ollila and Elmquist 2011), and qualify the increased research focus on the project level. The goal of the paper is therefore to come up with a typology that supports OI researchers in unveiling more fine-grained knowledge of how firms can strategically practice different forms of OI at project level whilst simultaneously reaping the value these forms create. The paper is organized as follows. First, the current use of the notion of exploration and exploitation in the OI literature is introduced and discussed to show the present use of the two concepts. Based on the current OI literature and the original idea behind March’s notion of exploration and exploitation, a typology of four generic project approaches to OI is suggested. Then, the practical relevance of the typology is demonstrated through the LEGO case, showing how managers cope with different forms of OI strategically at the project level, which allows firms to be strategically flexible when it comes to deciding which OI activities to invest in, as part of their attempts to secure sustainable competitive advantage in the short and long run. The conclusion highlights the potential of the typology in future OI research, particularly the research stream attentive towards the attractiveness of the project level, and gives managerial implications as the typology also shows how different forms of OI can strategically be managed by emphasizing the project level.",1

On the other hand, an increase in FDI inflows and human capital deteriorates environmental degradation, which, in turn, affects negatively the economic growth (Abdouli and Hammami 2016a, b). The existing literature also shows an interconnection between FDI inflows, economic growth, environment, and human capital. This implies that there exists a straight circle link of FDI inflows, economic growth, environment, and workers where hosting countries experience a continuous inflow of FDI overtime over time by increasingly attracting higher value-added MNEs, low economic growth, bad environmental quality, and the absence of human competence. The relationships between FDI inflows, environment, human capital, and economic growth have been intensively analyzed in the prior studies. These studies can be classified into four strands. The first strand investigated the effect of foreign investment, environment, and human capital on the economic growth (e.g., Kawakami 2004; Kuo and Yang 2008; Fleisher et al. 2011; Omri and Kahouli 2014; Abdouli and Hammami 2015; Su and Liu 2016). The second strand of studies tested the impact of economic growth, FDI, and human capital on the environment (e.g., Fu 2008; Lan et al. 2011; Ren et al. 2014; Omri and Kahouli 2014; Zakarya et al. 2015; Abdouli and Hammami 2016a, b; Baek 2016). The third strand of studies focused on the impact of economic growth, environment, and human capital on FDI (e.g., Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles 2003; Li and Liu 2005; Noormamode 2008; Majeed and Ahmad 2008; Heyuan and Teixeira 2010; Omri and Kahouli 2014; Abdouli and Hammami 2016a, b). Finally, the fourth strand of studies shed light on the influence of economic growth, environment, and FDI on human capital (e.g., Noorbakhsh et al. 2001; Checchi et al. 2007a, b; Zhuang 2008; Adefabi and Adetunji 2011; Yildirim and Tosuner 2014; Völlmecke et al. 2016). This study has gone ahead from these strands and examines the relationship among FDI inflows, economic growth, and human capital and CO2 emissions across the Mediterranean region. Besides, our study goes further than previous studies in several directions. We explicitly address the problem of cross-sectional dependence across the Mediterranean countries. This could be possible through the pollution effects, the capital flight, and the decrease of economic growth, as well as the problems encountered by human capital. Furthermore, we incorporate and analyze the role of FDI inflows by MNCs and human capital as important factors, which affect economic growth and CO2 emission in this region. In order to test the connections among economic growth, FDI, CO2 emission, and human capital crosswise the 15 Mediterranean countries over the period 19,906–2013, we have determined the stationary and the order of cointegration using the panel unit-root and panel cointegration tests, then we applied the fully modified OLS (FMOLS) and dynamic OLS (DOLS) estimators. The empirical results found the existence of a positive link between the FDI inflows, economic growth, and human capital, and CO2 emissions. The plan of this paper is as follows: “Literature and Review” examines the literature review, followed by “Methodology and Econometric Method” which presents the econometric modeling approach; “Data and Descriptive Statistics” describes the used data, and “Empirical Results” depicts the empirical findings and the final section, concludes, and offers some policy implications.",44

Farrell et al. (2007) summarize the story:  Generally, in a highly competitive industry without binding capacity constraints, a firm’s rewards are relativistic: they stem from being better than its rivals and are not very sensitive to the industry-wide level of unit costs. Thus, if one firm invents a lower cost production technique that can be adopted by all without paying, no firm benefits much (although consumers do). Thus, neither a participant nor a pure upstream inventor has much incentive to innovate. This is the economic rationale for patents, because they allow differentiation so that one firm can earn nonzero profits. Other textbooks that motivate the existence of patents using this model include Stiglitz (1993, pp 474–475) and Landsburg (1995, p 359, with profits “much reduced” but not zero). This section discusses the empirical evidence that IP behaves differently in complex and discrete products. At the discrete extreme, a new pharmaceutical or chemical may be entirely described by one molecule, which can be synthesized using relatively well-known techniques; at the complex extreme, an SEC filing by a defensive patent aggregator reports a count of 250,000 patents that read on to smartphones of 2011 vintage.Footnote 1 Complex inventions are not a recent development: Lampe and Moser (2013) counted 4576 patents for sewing machines in the 1890s. The distinction between complex and discrete industries has a long history in the empirical literature. Cohen et al. (2000) surveyed 1478 research and development labs, and found that  firms commonly patent for different reasons in “discrete” product industries, such as chemicals, versus “complex” product industries, such as telecommunications equipment or semiconductors. In the former, firms appear to use their patents commonly to block the development of substitutes by rivals, and in the latter, firms are much more likely to use patents to force rivals into negotiations. From a survey of a hundred firms by Mansfield (1986, p 174), “\(\dots \) the results indicate that patent protection was judged to be essential for the development or introduction of 30 percent or more of the inventions in only two industries—pharmaceuticals and chemicals.” Levin et al. (1988), Bessen and Meurer (2008), and Kim and Vonortas (2006, pp 245–246) also provide empirical studies that support the claim that patents in complex and discrete industries are in accord with these characteristics. Webster and Jensen (2011) found that “invention owners get some spillover protection from complementary patents embodied in the final product or process.” The model of “The Value of a Nonexclusive Design” provides a theoretical explanation for these empirical results, demonstrating how a complex invention can have “production chain protection,” lowering the dependence on patents in industries built around complex products. Table 1 summarizes these empirical observations about how the value of a patent differs across different uses in different contexts. The bulk of this article (“The Value of a Nonexclusive Design”) focuses on a theoretical explanation for the case of the use of patents to exclude competitors in the context of complex inventions. In this case, as the complexity of the product grows arbitrarily large, the relative value of the patent to a producer approaches zero. From this key result, two contrasts naturally follow. First, the “Patent Thickets” section considers patents for licensing, and Corollary 8 shows that for an arbitrarily complex product, the ratio of licensing value of a patent for a lagging firm to monopoly-maintaining value for a leading firm goes to infinity, thus providing an explanation for the contrasts in the second row of the table. Second, for discrete inventions, the number of production steps is not large, so patent value to a leading firm does not approach zero, meaning the first row need not follow the second.
 Consider the common case of two sibling firms, one of which produces a product or service, and the other of which holds the IP needed for production. The producing sibling must pay some royalty to the IP holding company, and that payment will be based on some model of R, the valuation of the contribution of IP to profits. Grubert (2003) found that high R&D companies are more likely to shift revenue from high-tax to low-tax countries. If the producing sibling is selling the gadget in a high-tax country, and the IP-holding sibling is in a low-tax country, the firm could shift revenue to the low-tax country by overvaluing the royalties owed by the producing subsidiary to the IP-holding subsidiary. How much value can be shifted in this manner is, by definition, based on an implicit estimate of R. Since Grubert’s paper, several countries have implemented an IP box (in some situations known as a patent box) that provides a lower tax rate for income derived from intellectual property, providing another incentive to pass profits to an IP-holding subsidiary (Evers et al. (2015) and Klemens (2017)). In the USA, the 2017 tax reform introduced a preferential rate for overseas income paid to IP held by US companies relative to the rate for overseas income brought in for other operations. These shifts of revenue are not small: Griffith et al. (2010) estimate via simulation methods that an IP box lowers IP-associated tax revenue in European countries to between 40 and 85% of pre-box revenue, depending on the country and assumptions. The full legal and technical considerations that go into how much revenue can see lower taxes via an international transfer or IP box is far beyond the scope of this paper, but the first step in all cases is the question of how much product value can be attributed to IP. If the firm claims that R ≈ 1, it can shift almost all of its income. European operations for the online retailer Amazon are centered in a company in Luxembourg, while IP is held by another Luxembourg company (Lux SCS) that benefits from a very low IP box rate. A 2014 European Commission investigation regarding the validity of the structure for tax purposes found that Amazon’s operations corporation deducts all expenses from revenue, then “the part of the [Amazon operations corp] profit that is not attributed to other functions is paid out to Lux SCS in the form of a royalty” (Almunia 2014, §66). Out of $15 billion in 2013 revenue, operations transferred $2 billion in pre-IP profits to Lux SCS, leaving it with $33 million in taxable profits for itself. The transfer is a clear assertion that nearly all profits are attributable to IP. Another European Commission inquiry was made regarding the relationship between furniture maker IKEA’s operations corporation in Netherlands (Inter IKEA Systems) and its IP-holding company. The inquiry asked whether the license fee was a disallowed transfer of cash to an entity solely for a more favorable tax treatment, rationalized using an argument akin to the textbook model: “The mere legal owner of the [intellectual property] cannot be entitled to receive all the residual profit of the franchise business after paying a limited return to [the operator] for its allegedly routine functions.”Footnote 2 Amazon and IKEA are used as examples because details of their arrangements are publicly available in tax investigation reports, and their use of the textbook model to value IP is strongly indicated (and rebutted) by the public record, but there are abundant comparable stories from an abundance of other firms. A large portion of the theoretical IP literature is concerned with the development of a new invention or process, often paired with an assumption that once it is developed, application is costless. The empirical literature finds otherwise, that adapting to a newly developed technique is far from trivial. For an intangible that improves production of goods, there is typically some learning or systemic adjustment required (Arrow 1962; Gruber 1994). Bessen (2015) explains that “a new technology typically requires much more than an invention in order to be designed, built, installed, operated, and maintained. Initially much of this new technical knowledge develops slowly because it is learned through experience….” For example, the first run with a new technique may mostly produce defective products, but over time, the producer may find ways to drive the defect rate toward zero, raising productivity accordingly. Case studies by von Hippel and Tyre (1995) described mechanisms for learning by doing, including the discovery of unforseeable problems and information hidden by the complexity of designing a new system, and recognizing patterns in production. On the consumer side, products typically go through an adoption phase, often modeled via the Bass diffusion model (Bass 1969), describing how familiarity with a product and its associated trademark make their way through the population. Modern goods are often networked, meaning that their value increases with the number of other users of the same good (Choi 1997); as with learning by doing, the value of the final product increases over time, and a new entrant will have to build a new network to expand the value of its new product. Even with full knowledge of a new invention, post-implementation learning by doing is a largely separate problem that a lagging firm cannot costlessly lift from the leading firm. A competitor with another factory still needs to train workers and adapt its workflow in the same way the first mover did; a competing product needs to work its way up the Bass diffusion curve; a competitor needs to convince customers to switch from the leader’s network to their lagging network. As von Hippel and Tyre (1995) conclude from case studies, “it would be very difficult to eliminate doing from learning by doing.” One might expect that the lagging firm could gain know-how by hiring employees away from the leading firm, but an analysis of defect and production data from Levitt et al. (2013) found that productivity improvements were less tied to the employees and more to improvements in the production line embodied in adjustments to factory procedures or physical capital, meaning that workers who move to another firm will bring only a fraction of the learning by doing gains with them. The empirical literature finds that the spillovers from learning by doing are relatively small. Irwin and Klenow (1994) estimate that “a firm learns over three times as much from an additional unit of its own cumulative output as from an additional unit of another firm’s cumulative output.” They cite another semiconductor study (Tilton 1971) who states that “much [learning] is either uniquely applicable to a particular operation or can be transferred to another facility only with technical assistance from the firm having the know-how.” By these rationales, one would expect that the learning by doing speeds of leaders and laggers would be comparable; the model here simplifies this to the assumption that they are identical. Adding a cost of up-front research to the model will not affect the results in this article. This article assumes that the decision has been made to enter and the R&D costs already spent, after which the up-front costs are no longer relevant. It therefore leaves for future research questions of strategic entry and strategic balance between up-front resarch and ex post learning costs.",1

Adopting internal and routinized technological strategies would allow firms to experience cumulative patterns of technological learning, and therefore, to benefit from path dependency and increased possibilities of economies of scale and scope (Arthur 1989; Bogliacino et al. 2017; Malerba and Pisano 2019). This would be particularly important in the light of the new techno-economic paradigm, in which innovation is the main strategy to create and sustain dynamic competitive advantages based on internal technological and innovative capabilities (Silverberg et al. 1988; Dosi et al. 2017). Still, adopting innovative strategies and creating technological advantages seem to be a particular challenge for firms in developing countries (Mathews 2002; Viotti 2002; Xiao et al. 2013; Suárez 2014). During the last decade, Brazil faced a period of macroeconomic stability, which has enabled firms to perform long-term investments and to build innovative capabilities. The implementation of industrial, as well as science and technology policies, has provided firms a large set of instruments and mechanisms that could reduce costs and technological uncertainty in the development of new processes and products (Turchi and Morais 2017). According to the Brazilian Innovation Survey (PINTEC), approximately one third of the innovative firms received some sort of governmental support in the 2012–2014 period. This is expected to have favored learning and competence building, avoiding discontinuity, and fostering cumulativeness. However, these expectations have not been met. Since the early 2000s, different studies have characterized Brazilian National Innovation System (NSI) as incipient (Albuquerque 1999) and oriented toward passive learning strategies focused on the absorption of foreign technology (Viotti 2002; Goedhuys and Veugelers 2012). Therefore, national innovative efforts have been focused on internal adaptations and incremental innovations, lacking active learning strategies to the creation of technological capabilities and the cumulativeness of past innovative efforts. Despite that, studies have also indicated that the most prominent Brazilian firms were characterized by large productive and technological diversity, as well as there are leaders capable of generating endogenous knowledge (De Negri and Salerno 2005; De Negri and Cavalcante 2015). Following these lines, several studies have addressed the innovative capabilities of Brazilian firms (e.g., De Negri and Cavalcante 2015; Goedhuys and Veugelers 2012; Santos et al. 2014; Frank et al. 2016, to name a few), but less efforts have been carried to address innovative cumulativeness in shaping firm’s strategies. The problem is not the relevance of the theme, but the difficulty in operationalizing the usage of the microdata from the PINTEC until very recently. This article aims to contribute on this matter by using the database in an unprecedented way to analyze Brazilian industrial firms’ technological innovative strategies. The study considers intrafirm technological cumulativeness as a determinant of innovation, while controlling for some strategies’ determinants (innovative expenditures, R&D strategy, and cooperative arrangements), besides the scale effects. The empirical investigation employs firm level data from PINTEC for the years 2008, 2011, and 2014, providing information on the innovative strategies of Brazilian industrial firms.Footnote 1 While most of innovation research conducts cross-sectional analyses, the present article contributes to the literature by putting together panel data analyses that allows to track Brazilian industrial firms throughout time, as well as to evaluate causality of time-lagged variables. Moreover, situating the discussion from the perspective of a prominent developing country, whose industry presents clear difficulties of international insertion, is another important contribution. Assessing the importance of cumulativeness on the innovation process and accounting for its weaknesses on the national scene helps to understand the current scenario. Besides, it provides information that allows comparing other productive structures from developing countries. For this purpose, the reminder of this article is organized in six sections, including this introduction. Section 2 presents a theoretical framework considering firm growth’s strategies focused on cumulativeness and innovation. Section 3 details information for Brazil through international comparison and firm capabilities evolution. In section 4, the methodology is presented – logit and logit panel models –. Section 5 outlines the results. Finally, section 6 concludes.",4

The number of unique city pairs is increasing every year, exceeding 18,400 in 2016, almost double compared with that of 20 years ago (IATA 2017). Ticket prices are very elastic, changing rapidly in response to customer demand, but decreasing on average due to cost decreases via more efficient operations (IATA 2017). Political crises at the far ends of the globe, including terrorist activities and militarized hostilities among countries, might cancel several flights in an instant. Airlines have to be on a constant watch due to such irregularities. However, irregularities are not the only problem. Competitors’ actions are rapid and although their effects are seen in a rather long time, sometimes they are irreversible. Hence, airline companies need to anticipate. Customer interest also changes over time. Tourism boards hold marketing actions around an area and alter the travel decisions of customers from time to time. Offline travel agencies, especially where ethnic populations or large enterprises exist, have the power to affect the decision-making process of customers, and this is mostly based on the incentive rates these agencies receive from airlines or airports. Air traffic taxes, fuel prices, exchange rates, results of sports matches, and many other factors affect airline companies’ decisions and strategies. In Turkey, air travel is expanding at a rapid pace. At the end of 2014, the number of planes belonging to the top five Turkish airline companies was only 369, but increased by 30% to 477 planes by the end of 2016 (SHGM 2017). There is almost no competition in the domestic Turkish market from foreign companies. However, international flights are a different matter. As Hub and the direct connectivity of Istanbul airport, which is the sixth most connected hub worldwide and the fourth in Europe, and which has seen more than 500% growth in hub connectivity within last 10 years (ACI 2017), is a helpful factor that is lessening the harshness of competition (Piltz et al. 2018). But high fuel prices compared with Gulf and European carriers (IATA 2017), fluctuations of exchange rates, a growing number of competitors, and political instability in the Middle East are increasing the risk factors for airlines based in Turkey. In such an ever-challenging and ever-changing environment, Turkish airline companies have to be doing market surveillance, i.e., gathering, filtering, documenting, and analyzing information to get intelligence and to support the strategic decision-making processes based on this knowledge (Bisson and Tang Tong 2018). Thus, to survive in such a complex and fierce competitive environment (Akca 2018), air travel companies should be on constant watch for technological developments, political situations, fluctuating costs, and other market factors. This can be handled through competitive intelligence (CI) practices (Tarek et al. 2017). Stefanikova et al. (2015) posit that CI has become a necessity for all sectors. CI has received various definitions and has been often assimilated to competitor intelligence, marketing intelligence, business intelligence, or scanning (Bisson and Dou 2017). Soilen (2016) deems that the definitions of CI and marketing intelligence (MI) are quite similar and overlapping, addressing the same phenomenon, but studied by different academic disciplines. Ettorre (1995, p. 17) enhanced that “marketing intelligence was about staying one step ahead of the competition by gathering information which could be converted to actionable intelligence and which can then be applied to both short and long term strategic planning.” Interestingly, very little research about competitive intelligence in the airline industry has been done. The research that has been undertaken deals more with business intelligence that is commonly based on internal and structured data and information. Hence, this study aims to build for the first time a behavioral and operational diagnostic typology of competitive intelligence practice of an airline company (in Turkey) and is one of the very first research about CI in the sector. Thus, we used the model of Wright et al. (2012) in the aim to identify and classify CI behavior and attitudes of this airline company (in Turkey), which could aspire this company (among others) in the sector and beyond to perform competitive intelligence at an optimal level. Congruently with Wright et al. (2012) our investigation is based on the less restricted CI definition of Rouach and Santi (2001, p. 553), i.e., “CI is the art of collecting, processing and storing information to be made available to people at all levels of the firm to help shape its future and protect it against current competitive threat: it should be legal and respect codes of ethics; it involves a transfer of knowledge from the environment to the organization within established rules.” The remainder of our paper is organized as follows: the first part encompasses a review of literature about of competitive intelligence definitions and its importance, followed by CI in the airline industry. Then, the methodology is provided including the sample, procedure, and analytical approaches.

SMEs from least-developed countries (thereafter LDCs) are also more involved in technology competition. They need higher and safer protection for their product and knowledge assets. In this context, it becomes increasingly important to have an accurate picture of the degree of SME involvement in the patent system and to examine what are the drivers of their patenting behaviour. For small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), intellectual property represents an under-investigated issue (Agostini and Nosella 2017). With this paper, we would like to fill this gap through a study on patenting in relation to SME behaviour in LDCs. Patents are the most commonly used statutory IPR, but SMEs often neglect using these (Thomä and Bizer 2013). Some studies have broached the subject of patenting activities in SMEs and have linked it to performance. For instance, Hanel (2006) states that SMEs have higher patenting rates, but larger companies generate more patents (per firm). Andries and Faems (2013) found that both large firms and SMEs can use patenting to increase turnover. Despite finding that patenting is less frequently employed in innovative SMEs, their study showed that when patenting is used in SMEs, it has a positive effect on ‘innovation and financial performance’. The paper by Spithoven et al. (2013) stated that SMEs differ from large firms in their patenting activities since they only patent the innovations that are likely to be successful. Because large firms possess resources and personnel on a large scale, they are able to patent all their innovations. By contrast, SMEs face financial and organisational barriers which impede systematic patenting. Kalanje (2006) argues that the barrier of cost and lack of resources is a reason why SMEs patent less than large firms, and that the patenting process can hamper innovation, but when used appropriately, it can be a source of revenue and consequently affect firm performance. Eppinger and Vladova (2013) assert that ‘resource shortages’ and ‘lack of intellectual property management practices’ are a couple of the barriers faced by SMEs. We can therefore deduce that firm size and the barriers faced by SMEs when engaging in IP mechanisms, such as patenting activities, determine the frequency of patenting activities. We have noted that a large element of the literature deals with SMEs’ patenting in developed countries, leaving aside SME conduct in LDCs. This paper wishes to fill this gap by identifying the key factors that drive SME patenting. We address this topic as follows. The “Determinants of Patenting: Literature survey, Research Question, Hypotheses” section reviews the literature that is focused on patenting determinants in the context of SMEs and presents our research question and hypotheses. The “The Data Set, Building the Variables, and First Descriptive Statistics” section is dedicated to outlining the data set and the main variables. In the “Models and Econometric Strategy” section, we set out the models and the econometrical strategy. The “Estimation, Results and Main Findings” section summarises the results and findings.",1

To this end, the search for equality in well-being measured by the utility proposed by the welfares tradition is strongly criticized because it does not hold individuals accountable for their responsibilities, preferences, or choices. Roemer (1998) used this pioneering work to explain the notion “inequality of opportunity” in two steps. First, he distinguishes between “circumstances,” which are factors imposed on individuals and variables under control named “efforts.” Then, he explains that the inequalities observed on the indicators of well-being reflect the differences of the circumstances and the variables under control. Equal opportunities exist when welfare’s distribution within groups of same circumstances does not vary between groups formed on the basis of the same circumstances (Ferreira and Gignoux 2013). On the other hand, there is unequal opportunity when the distribution of welfare indicators depends on the circumstances of individuals (Belhaj-Hassine 2011). Circumstances depend on current contexts but include parent status, gender, ethnicity, place of birth, and physical and mental characteristics inherited at birth. As for its policy scope, it should be noted that since the work of Roemer (1998), the general trend has been to encourage governments to tackle inequalities in opportunities rather than inequalities in variables under control. When they want to fight inequalities linked to individual efforts, the public authorities must apply an adequate tax policy in order to reduce social gaps and to make enable groups that are disadvantaged by their poor performance to be present in all public bodies and in all training schools for the preparation of future leaders. According to Belhaj-Hassine (2011), such strategies that directly target the equality of well-being indicators result to reduced incentives of individuals’ efforts demotivating investment in human resources and annihilates innovation. In general, it is more appropriate to tackle inequalities of opportunity rather than inequalities under control. This literature is based on social justice and distinguishes between just inequalities and unjust inequalities. Some inequalities can be considered fair if the circumstances are fair and other inequalities will be considered unfair if the circumstances that explain them are unfair (Peragine 2004; Ferreira and Gignoux 2013). Welfare literature shows that there is a negative link between inequality of opportunity and economic growth (World Bank 2005; Marrero and Rodriguez 2013). From the point at which the origins of inequalities (circumstances versus efforts) influence individual motivations and political orientations, they have an impact on the economic performance measured by growth. In others words, inequalities due to circumstances lead to under-accumulation of human capital since they discourage individuals from investing in human capital. On the other hand, the inequalities due to the efforts encourage individuals to invest in human capital and thus have a positive long run effect on growth. In this sense, we can mention a recent literature of inequality of opportunity in the absence of consumption data in MENA region adapted by Assaad et al. (2019), and a very impressive literature adopted by Trannoy (2019) which he uses a philosophical perspective of equality of opportunity and address the issue of whether outcome inequalities are legitimate when they come from differences in talent. Given the importance of reducing inequalities of opportunity in order to ensure the social and economic stability of nations, we find interesting to deal with this issue in the context of a developing country where the gap of regional development index is very high, namely, Tunisia (Appendix Table 11), which experienced a period of demonstrations ended in a revolution against the political and economical dictatorship favored by a feeling of inequality between regions and citizens. In this setting, we assess the extent of inequality of opportunity in early childhood in Tunisia. We draw a recent literature and methodology developed by De Barros et al. (2008), Paes de Barros et al. (2009), Roemer (1998), and Shorrocks (2013) in order to quantify inequality using the dissimilarity index (Paes de Barros et al. 2009). Then, we decompose inequality accounting for the contributions of each circumstance using the Shapiro decomposition (Shorrocks 2013) based on recent Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MCIS4) and Labor Market Panel Surveys for Tunisia (TLMPS) databases. Before estimating inequality of opportunity, we make some graphical analyses to assess economic intergenerational mobility in Tunisia. Our results indicate that the influence of parental background, especially for wages and income, is important. For example, in 2011, we can see that 64% of individuals whose parents are illiterate are more likely to be the poorest compared with 62% to be the richest if parents get to university (Fig. 1 in Appendix 1). In 2014, 33% of illiterate parents’ children belong to the group of the poorest, while 69% of children whose both parents get to universities can be of the richest group (Fig. 2 in Appendix 1). Our results are different from previous works in the Tunisian context such us Jemmali and Amara (2014). For example, these authors only supported inequality of opportunities in access to educational services between the western regions and the interior regions before 2011. Unlike this work, we show firstly that these inequalities remain important and dominate the whole country and not of the particular regions in Tunisia. Then, we raise problem of access to housing services such as electricity, sanitation, and drinking water. Thus, it has a “trap of inequality” which persists throughout this period and which has a bad repercussion in the society. Before presenting these findings in the “Main Results” section, we first present a conceptual and theoretical framework for the inequality of opportunity (“Conceptual Framework”). While in the “Data and Methodology” section, we find stylized facts, and in the “Conclusions and Recommendations” section, we conclude.",3

Economic growth through increased labour productivity requires jobs with higher added value and development through increasing reliance on knowledge intensive jobs is often the key for progress in both advanced and emerging economies. Powell and Snellman (2004) highlight how heavily development in knowledge-based economies relies on intellectual capabilities rather than on physical inputs or natural resources, meaning that efficiency in creating and using the intellectual capital is crucial for growth. Clarke (2001) emphasises that while creation, transmission, and use of information and knowledge is important, the effectiveness in gathering and utilising knowledge is a critical determinant of success. While increasing knowledge intensity has meant a significant change in the structure of economies and in the nature of work, social norms on how work ought to be organised has not always followed these socio-economic transformations. As different people have different expectations for when, how much, and how they would like to work, it is particularly important to arrange work so that the personal abilities of each employee are used efficiently and sufficient flexibility and autonomy is granted. This is not just a question of statutory and employer-level working time regulations, as the attitudes and potential jealousy of colleagues and other constraints on job autonomy may matter a lot for decisions on working time. The time arrangements of work have been studied from different angles, including analysis of benefits from the perspectives of both the employee and the employer (e.g. Kauffeld et al. 2004; Golden 2009). However, little attention has been paid to the question of what type of individual is more likely to be satisfied with flexible work time arrangements and what type with fixed working time, and what the drivers are of other constraints on the desired freedom in working time decisions. This study aims to help to fill this gap in the literature by focusing on some time-related aspects of job autonomy that may contribute to more efficient use of human capital in knowledge work. The focus of the paper is creative R&D employees as the driving force in the process of knowledge intensification and innovation. As enhancing economic growth through innovation is one of the main challenges in modern economies and innovation largely depends on human capital, then improving the time freedom of employees and their satisfaction with their working time arrangements may contribute considerably to the more efficient use of the creative potential of R&D employees. The research questions addressed in this study are: RQ1. What type of individuals and under which working arrangements are more likely to be satisfied with flexible and what type with fixed working time? RQ2. Which individual and working time–related factors have an adverse effect on the creativity of the employee? RQ3. Which working arrangements make what type of individuals more likely to feel that they are flexible to decide about the speed of their work? RQ4. Which individual and work related factors contribute to the working day not starting and ending at the time preferred by the employee?",2

Even though Africa is the fastest growing continent, over 70% of the world’s poorest people live there, as poverty and inequality remain the largest hindrances to sustainable development (Sampath and Ayitey 2016). Addressing these development challenges and designing a sustainable post-modern African society require urgent interconnection between development stakeholders. Sustainable development does not only address the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of the future generations to meet their own needs (WCED 1987; Utting 2000), it also offers industries, governments, and universities in Africa a unique opportunity to support the development process on the continent. Sustainable industrialization plays a significant role in the sustainable development of African economies (Moshi 2014; Sampath and Ayitey 2016). The notion of sustainable industrialization, where industries consider the environment and at the same time secure socioeconomic gains, is the central pillar of industrial sustainability. Industrial sustainability involves collaborative efforts among key stakeholders to reduce the negative environmental, economic, and social impacts of industries (Jansson et al. 2000). Recent studies have examined how industries in Africa can promote sustainable industrialization and development through effective partnerships with academia and governments (Olayide 2015; Oguntoye and Evans 2017). Thus, addressing unsustainable development in Africa is possible through sustainable industrialization. Arguably, an alternative solution towards sustainable development could stem from innovation-driven and knowledge-based industrialization. Understanding and achieving sustainable industrialization based on innovation and knowledge are possible through the triple helix approach (THA). Firmly rooted in the innovation literature, THA can be described as a framework that considers innovation and knowledge as emergent products of complex but collaborative interactions between universities, governments, and industries (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 1995; Carayannis et al. 2000; Leydesdorff and Meyer 2006). The triple helix of industry-university-government interaction, although has received less application in understanding industrial sustainability, is further considered as a useful framework for studying development at the regional and national level (Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz 1998). Triple helix has received a considerable attention in studies that seek to understand knowledge, innovation, and development issues in developing countries (e.g., Rapini et al. 2009; Saad and Zawdie 2011; Mroczkowski and Miller 2017) and developed countries (e.g., Leydesdorff and Etzkowitz 1998; Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff 1995; Carayannis et al. 2000). Despite its huge application in innovation and knowledge management research, THA has received less theoretical and empirical application in understanding industrial sustainability, especially in Africa. One of the biggest challenges facing African economies resides in the relatively limited capacity to manage the interactions between industries, universities, and governments towards sustainable development and sustainable industrialization (Sampath and Ayitey 2016). Some studies have suggested that the reason for Africa’s slow sustainable development can be attributed to weak application of triple helix (Olayide 2015; Sampath and Ayitey 2016; Oguntoye and Evans 2017). Though these studies have proposed that the actors within the triple helix framework should work together towards industrial sustainability, an exploration of the contexts within which the actors function is less understood. Moreover, the question of how industries, universities, and governments can foster industrial sustainability requires more theoretical understanding. Dei (1993) suggested that there is the need to increase theoretical research aimed at exploring existing level of understanding. Towards an improved understanding of industrial sustainability and THA, this paper attempts to answer the question of: How does THA contribute to the understanding and promotion of industrial sustainability in Africa? The present paper explains that African countries can effectively promote industrial sustainability if the key stakeholders can understand existing contextual enablers and barriers. This study provides theoretically relevant insights on how THA contribute to the understanding of industrial sustainability. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides the theoretical background. The literature on triple helix and industrial sustainability are reviewed and synthesized to develop a conceptual model. Relevant research propositions are then developed from key ideas and insights from the literature. This paper concludes by presenting the implications of the study for theory, practice, and policy. The paper also provides the limitations of the study and directions for future research. This theoretical exploration is the groundwork for an empirical study that would gather evidence to validate the proposed conceptual model and research propositions.",11

An Empirical Investigation,September 2021,Atif Awad,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The importance of human capital in the economic process is well documented both theoretically and empirically (Gyimah-Brempongand and Wilson, 2004; Hartwig, 2010; Qadri and Waheed, 2014; Awad et al. 2014. Awad et al. 2015; Ogundaria and Awokuseb 2018). The development of human capital enhances economic growth in several ways, for instance, improving workers’ skills and, hence, their productivity; reducing income inequality; and minimising population growth. The expected positive labour productivity influences from the investment in human capital make it a matter of priority for development policy in the MENA region. However, the term human capital is multifaceted and complex. Human capital has been defined as the set of knowledge, skills, capabilities and abilities that are embodied in people and which people have learnt over time, via training, education, work experience, health care and migration (Schultz 1961; Becker 1964). Consequently, human development can be grouped into three key ingredients: education, health and know-how/training, and its stock could rise through the accumulation of higher education, improved health status and contemporary learning. However, due to the difficulties in measuring new learning and training, education and health statuses have been frequently used as proxies for human capital development in preceding empirical studies that have addressed the human development and economic growth nexus. As we have mentioned previously, scholars have identified several channels through which an improvement in the health and/or education of an individual can directly or indirectly stimulate economic progress. For instance, evidence shows that an appropriate level of education and good health can reflect in a more productive labour force which manifests in more output per head of labour and, hence, higher growth in total output. Increased productivity implies an increase in overall wages and, thus, a better standard of living (Bloom et al., 2004, Awad et al., 2014; Awad et al., 2015). Likewise, when workers become more educated and healthy, they become better able to innovate and adopt new technologies, (Awad et al., 2014; Awad et al. 2015; Ogundari and Abdulai 2014; Ogundaria and Awokuseb 2018). Of the two frequently utilised proxies of human capital, education is frequently recognised as a key element of human capital development. This may be due to the fact that in this era of globalisation and the tendency to use advanced and sophisticated technology in the production process as a cost-saving tool, education plays an essential role in offering the highly skilled human capital that is required for these tasks. Accordingly, less attention has been allocated to the influence of health status on economic progress. Furthermore, most of the present empirical analyses on the human capital-economic growth nexus have concentrated only on the one-to-one relationship between education and economic progress on the one hand and health and economic growth on the other (Samir et al. 2006; Awad and Youssof, 2016; Ogundaria and Awokuseb 2018; Aka and Dumont, 2008). The way of dealing with the two components of human capital, in these studies, gives an impression that there is an implicit assumption that the two measurements for human capital are a perfect substitute to each other. From a theoretical point of view, and according to Galama and Van Kippersluis (2015), Skill-capital theory (Becker, 1964; Ben-Porath, 1967) suggested that an association exists between rises in life expectancy and educational achievement. More specifically, longevity raises the return to investment in education capital by increasing the horizon over which gains can be accumulated. The health-capital theory also expects an association between educational achievement, health and longevity, albeit in the other direction. The claim is that more highly educated people are more competent producers of health investment in different ways (Lleras-Muney, 2005; Glied and Lleras-Muney, 2008). Education could also influence working environments and lifestyle preferences (e.g., Cutler and Lleras-Muney, 2010), and higher educated people place a higher value on health relative to wealth (Galama and Van Kippersluis, 2010). The interrelationship between health and education has been supported in several empirical studies (Conti et al., 2010; Li and Liang, 2010; Van Kippersluis et al., 2011; Meghir et al., 2012; Clark and Royer, 2013; Fortson, 2011Awad et al., 2014, 2015; Oster et al., 2013; Ogundaria and Awokuseb 2018). In fact, when reviewing previous studies on the economic growth-human capital nexus, we realised that only a few studies have investigated the joint impact of both the health and education indicators of human capital on economic growth. Thus, we expect that numerous preceding studies on this matter may have suffered from omitted variable bias. This is because neither health nor education is a perfect substitute for the other, as a proxy of human capital. On one hand, considering the joint influence of the education and health indicators of human capital would allow for more precise estimates and interpretation on assessing the contribution of human development to economic growth. However, on the other hand, it would help them to overcome the omitted variable problem in preceding studies (Glewwe et al., 2014; Aka and Dumont, 2008; Ogundaria and Awokuseb 2018). A more precise review of the human capital-economic growth nexus literature that emphasises on the MENA region shows that almost all, of the limited number of preceding cross-country studies, have only examined the influence of either education or health on economic growth (Makdissi et al., 2006; Pablo-Romero et al., 2016; Senay et al., 2017; Barkhordaril et al., 2018). To the best of our knowledge, no empirical studies have attempted to explore the contribution of both health and education to economic growth for a panel of MENA region economies. A few empirical studies have examined the influences of health or education on economic growth at an individual country level (Awad et al., 2014). Nevertheless, the estimated results from a cross-country exploration are more worthwhile sources of empirical evidence for making critical policy decisions at the regional area (Ogundaria and Awokuseb 2018; Ogundaria and Awokuseb, 2018). The current study investigates the impact of human capital on economic progress in the MENA region and contributes to the prevailing literature in several ways. First, since, until now, there has been no empirical study that has addressed the contribution of health and education individually to economic growth at the regional level, this is the first study to investigate this matter. Second, the present study takes into account the omitted variable bias in earlier empirical studies by simultaneously estimating the influence of both the education and health indicators of human capital on growth. Third, the current study contributes to the existing literature in terms of differentiating between the short- and long-run impact of each human capital measurement on economic growth. The core objectives of this study are threefold. First, we examine the nature of the relationship between human capital and economic progress for a comprehensive panel of economies in the MENA region. Second, we account for some weaknesses in preceding studies by jointly assessing the coefficients of two well-known proxies of human capital. Specifically, we examine which of the two proxies of human capital (i.e. education and health) contributes most to economic progress in the MENA region. Third, we differentiate between the short- and long-run impact of each human capital measurement on economic growth. The preliminary findings from our empirical investigation indicate that while in the long run, education will contribute positively and significantly to economic growth, life expectancy contributes negatively but marginally to such growth. In the short run, education has an insignificant contribution to growth, while health contributes positively and significantly to such growth. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 comprises a brief overview of human capital and economic growth in the MENA region, while Section 3 represents an overview of the theoretical framework and the empirical model. Section 4 illustrates the definition of the variables and the data sources, and Section 5 comprises a discussion of the empirical results. Lastly, Section 6 presents concluding remarks and suggested areas for further study.",5

M. Imamul Haque,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"With the dawn of the twenty-first century, information, computer technologies and communications have experienced swift innovation and popularisation, intensely altering human lives and economic configurations. The Internet revolution caused transformations in electronic dealings and economic regimes and transformed traditional industrial manufacturing processes and management styles. The “digital revolution” has instigated a “paradigm shift” in the production and supply of goods and services, research and development, marketing, manufacturing, design and transactions (Hsu 2001). In this era, land, labour and physical capital have been replaced by the knowledge, which is being considered as the vital reason for production (Drucker 1988). Today, the business firms focus more on the intangible resources than the tangible one, which in the addendum of IT and globalisation makes the intangible assets a significant player in enhancing the financial performance of the business organisation (Martins et al. 2016). Distinct researchers and academicians have consensually agreed that knowledge is the decisive factor in this cut-throat competition era. Knowledge is also the most crucial factor in value creation and sustainable competitive advantage (Drucker 1993; Stewart 1997). A number of the utmost successful corporations of the world like Microsoft, Apple, TATA and Infosys have efficaciously managed and administered their knowledge and intellectual capital assets. In today’s world, it has become more important to devise new approaches that understand and measure the organisational performance from the perspective of creating value by the knowledge-based resources of the business. When knowledge is measured and conveyed from a value creation perspective, it is widely known as intellectual capital (IC) (Khan 2018; Khan et al. 2019a, b; Kianto et al. 2013; Raushan and Khan 2017). IC comprises of the valuable knowledge-based resources/assets and the management activities connected with managing these resources and assets. These resources are mainly intangible in nature and comprise of various components such as human resource, structural capital and organisational-stakeholder networks along with the management activities associated to strategy making, policy formation and implementation plan to optimum utilize these resources (Bontis 2001; Edvinsson and Malone 1997a; Guthrie 2001; Itami 1991). The problem with which the businesses have to deal is to comprehend and convey the difference between the company’s value or the market capitalisation and the company’s accounting book value (Edvinsson and Malone 1997a). It can also be assumed that some undeclared intangible assets cause the difference and about 80% of the company’s market value remains unexplained in the traditional financial statements (Lev 2001). The rise of the new economy, which is based on the information and knowledge, promoted the prominence of intellectual capital. It became a significant construct in explaining the difference between market capitalisation and book value (S Firer and Stainbank 2003). The different researchers and academicians had checked this relationship across the world in a different sector. Since there is a dearth of empirical evidence within the finance sector of India, therefore, this study intends to fill this void. The finance sector in India is one of the most promising sectors in terms of growth, contribution in GDP and employment (Economic Survey 2015; IBEF 2018). India has a diverse financial segment which is escalating rapidly in terms of growth and development and entry of new players in the market. The share of the financial service sector was 5.8% in the total gross value added (GVA) at a basic price for the year 2015–2016, which is growing at the rate of 7.3% in 2017–2018 (Finance 2018). The segment encompasses non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), commercial banks, insurance companies, co-operatives, mutual funds, pension funds and other smaller financial units. The banking services mostly dominate the financial service sector with an aggregrate of 64% of total assets held by the whole financial service sector (IBEF 2018). The sector employs lakhs and lakhs of people in the country; only the banking sector employs more than 13.35 lakh people according to a report of the Reserve Bank of India (India 2018). Hence, the identifying, measuring, reporting and managing of intellectual capital become an essential task for the management of these organisations (Chen Goh 2005; Mavridis 2004; Mondal and Ghosh 2012). Thus, the primary goal of this paper is to expose the presence and nature of the connection between intellectual capital and corporate financial performance of the companies encompassing the finance sector of India. The contemporary analysis employs a sample of 101 finance companies listed on the S&P Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) finance index.

For the first time in the country’s history, the Portuguese National Statistics Institute (INE) publicly released information on the innovation level of Portuguese Level II Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes (NUTS II). A Synthetic Regional Development Index (ISDR) was created to measure the level of innovation in order to ensure a better policy support. The ISDR is based on a conceptual model characterised by a multidimensional vision of regional development being, thus, structured in three key components: competitiveness, cohesion and environmental quality. Each dimension compiles multiple indicators, which means that ISDR is a composite aggregator index. By the end of 2013, the original version was converted into a second version aimed at providing information on the innovation level of Portuguese NUTS III regions, which has guaranteed the persistence of perfect information on innovation level for a hierarchy of territorial organisation closer to local communities.Footnote 1 The main objective of this study is to evaluate the impact that the disclosure of information regarding innovation level has on the innovation efficiency of Portuguese NUTS III regions. A regional innovation strategic policy framework defines priorities aimed at building competitive advantages relative to peers. A well-managed process ensures a good matching between research and innovation (R&I) own strengths and business needs to address emerging opportunities and market developments, while avoiding fragmentation and duplication of efforts. According to Foray (2014), smart specialisation strategies shall be developed in a context of synergistic involvement between managing authorities and multiple stakeholders (e.g. universities, industrial and social partners) to ensure that regional targets are successfully achieved. Since this step is subject to several difficulties in real-world practice, enforcement of ex ante regulation provides useful and concrete information on ‘how to act’ and ‘what to put’, thus diminishing the cost of learning and smoothing the inertia associated with decision making. In the absence of ex ante regulation applied to innovation level, firms risk not to deliver a sustainable impact assessment on the local economy, particularly without a well-conceived public policy strategy that provides information on regional assets and potential for businesses. Similarly, households can delay or even block consumption decisions that otherwise would foster regional economic growth. Consequently, linking information disclosure on innovation level with ex ante regulation constitutes a research gap that should be addressed motivated by the fact that regional innovation level is subject to multiple threats and conditionality, so that this regulatory principle constitutes the quickest and most transparent way to clarify doubts to interested parties in addition to promote a better and effective coordination between ex ante regional constraints, ongoing policy actions and ex post investment decisions. According to Main (1992, p. 102), benchmarking is defined as the ‘art of finding out, in a perfectly legal and above-board way, how others do something better than you do – so you can imitate – and perhaps improve upon – their techniques’.Footnote 2 Hurmenlinna et al. (2002) and Dou (2004) consider that benchmarking through data envelopment analysis (DEA) represents a relevant systematic technique to evaluate regional efficiency by comparing the performance of a given spatial unit with the performance of the ‘best region in class’, thereby allowing to construct a technical efficiency frontier in the innovation production possibilities set (IPPS) of a Regional Innovation System (RIS). Moreover, it corresponds to a non-parametric method because the efficiency frontier is constructed based on real data rather than being estimated. DEA as a measure of efficiency is initially proposed by Farrell (1957). Thenceforth, Charnes et al. (1978) use DEA to assess the efficiency of schools in the United States of America (USA) through a model specification known as CCR. Banker et al. (1984) propose the BCC model that, differently from the CCR model, is characterised by the incorporation of variable returns to scale (VRS) to accommodate observed heterogeneity in the dimensionality of decision making units (DMUs). A relevant extension to seminal contributions in the context of RIS performance is the multi-stage DEA. This approach consists of a technique whereby the innovation process is perceived as a complex phenomenon being, thus, divided in various sub-processes to provide clairvoyance on input-output relationships of a system. According to Kao (2014) and Carayannis et al. (2015), the innovation process is normally composed by two sub-processes: production and commercialisation. A two-stage DEA model implies that outputs of the production stage correspond to inputs of the commercialisation stage, which justifies the presence of intermediate indicators. In this study, we analyse and compare innovation efficiency scores of Portuguese NUTS III regions considering three different models under the assumption of VRS: one-stage DEA, two-stage DEA and three-stage DEA. The latter option is a novel refinement that consists of incorporating three sub-processes—information, production and commercialisation—whereby perfect information on innovation level of Portuguese NUTS III regions becomes a common knowledge. Hence, this study verifies whether the information release stage has explanatory power on innovation efficiency scores of Portuguese NUTS III regions. From a technical point of view, this study demonstrates that information can act as a propagation mechanism of efficiency changes in multi-stage systems. According to Kao (2014) ‘most studies in the efficiency evaluation literature focus on a 2-stage approach’ (Carayannis et al. 2015, 254).Footnote 3 This statement suggests that the combination of production and commercialisation constitutes a sufficient condition to explain innovation efficiency trends. By deduction, innovation efficiency scores computed by two-stage DEA are expected to be coincident with innovation efficiency scores computed by DEA containing three or more stages. Hence, if the two-stage DEA model is a sufficient condition for the assessment of regional innovation efficiency, then additional stages are expected to lack a significant effect on the dependent variable. Otherwise, recognising that most studies follow a two-stage DEA model to analyse RIS efficiency would constitute a redundant claim. Consequently, one pretends to provide answers to the following research questions: RQ1: Has the principle of ex ante regulation applied to the innovation level of Portuguese NUTS III regions increased the mean innovation efficiency in Portugal? RQ2: Has the principle of ex ante regulation applied to the innovation level reduced asymmetries between Portuguese NUTS III regions in terms of innovation efficiency? RQ3: Does the additional stage representative of the institutionalisation of the principle of ex ante regulation have explanatory power on the innovation efficiency of Portuguese NUTS III regions? Main results are summarised as follows. From an economic point of view, one demonstrates that the transition towards a perfect information scenario on innovation level influences both the mean and range of innovation efficiency. In particular, one shows that the introduction of ex ante regulation has a significant and negative effect on innovation efficiency scores of Portuguese NUTS III regions. Moreover, the innovation efficiency gap between peripheral and non-peripheral areas is reduced. Given the policy-oriented nature of this study, useful recommendations are provided to ensure the persistence of best regulatory practices in a context characterised by strategic substitutability between innovation level and innovation efficiency. From a technical point of view, the mathematical treatment applied to the refinement provided by this study confirms that alternative approaches other than optimisation (e.g. probability theory) can be used in multi-stage systems subject to DEA, particularly when these are characterised by imperfect information. The rest of this study is organised as follows. The “Background Literature” section provides the background literature. The “Mathematical Theory” section exposes the theory underlying multi-stage DEA models. The “Empirical Application” section presents the empirical application.

The absence of an “Entrepreneur Class” is not only characteristic of the UAE, but it is also prominent in every Rentier State. The first use of the term “Rentier State” is found in Mahdavy (1970, p. 429) who simply defined it as applying to “those countries that receive on a regular basis substantial amounts of external rent”. Originally, the concept of Rentier State has emerged to explain how problems in public finances affect political changes. In its famous contribution on the origin of tax systems, Ardant (1972) explains how taxpayers have contributed to build democracies by defending their natural rights. The underlying general principle is no taxation without political representation (Anderson 1987, pp. 9–10). The State becomes a rentier if it does not need to transform itself into a fiscal Leviathan, i.e. if it can finance its military without levy taxes. Rent generally comes from natural resources such as oil, gas or minerals. The definition of rent has also been extended to international aid and income driven by the leases of territories for military bases or infrastructure such as oil pipelines or river canals (the Suez Canal, for instance). Once such rent is controlled by the “State” (i.e. the government), political elites do not need to tax their citizens who are rewarded for political quiescence by generous welfare subsidies. For instance, oil-rich governments maximize patronage benefits by employing as many public sector workers as possible (Robinson et al. 2006; Bjorvatn and Farzanegan 2013). According to Ross (2001), the Rentier State generates three effects. First, a small fraction of the population contributes to wealth creation. Second, the clear majority of the population make their living from the rent distribution. Third, the income level and its distribution are determined by the proximity to the “Elite Class.” Rent, thus, tends to generate a rentier mentality and a tribe logic. As Beblawi (1990) points out: “having characterized the main feature of a Rentier State, it is important to emphasize that the choice of such a concept, is based on the assumption that such an economy creates a specific mentality: a rentier mentality. Such mentality embodies a break in the work-reward causation. Rewards-income or wealth- is not related to work and risk bearing, rather to chance and situation”. (Beblawi 1990, p. 52). It also creates the conditions of a rent economy for neighbouring countries. For instance, in labour-exporting countries like Egypt, Jordan and Yemen, remittance income from millions of migrant workers in the oil-exporting countries boosted household consumption, especially in rural areas. At the peak of the oil boom in the early 1980s, some 3.5 million Arab migrants were employed in the Persian Gulf states. As a result, loans, grants and other forms of assistance from oil-producing states to non-oil producers boosted government revenues and sustained distributive commitments (Youssef 2004, p. 95). The six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)Footnote 1 countries are said to be the “archetypal candidates” of Rentier States (Beblawi 1990, p. 89). In such a context, the post-oil era in the UAE raises a long-term challenge: developing a strong productive economy from which efficient and fair taxes could be levied. Such ambition requires to properly managing the creation, dissemination and utilization of knowledge across their different economic sectors (Grewal et al. 2002). Indeed, Drucker (1998) argues that “knowledge has become the key economic resource and the dominant—and perhaps the only—source of competitive advantage”. In the same vein, Powell and Snellman (2004) emphasize that the key component of a knowledge economy is a greater reliance on intellectual capabilities than on physical inputs or natural resources. In this respect, the UAE has promoted and implemented economic diversification strategies over the last 20 years. For example, during the 1990s, real GDP growth in the UAE has averaged around 7%. Much of this growth has been created through rapid diversification in non-oil sectors: first, in energy-intensive petrochemicals, fertilizers, cement and aluminium as well as more recently in tourism, trade and manufacturing. With an average annual growth of 9% in real terms in the 1990s, the non-oil sectors accounted for 70% of GDP and 43% of exports in 2000 (Youssef 2004). However, in the process of moving away from an oil-based economy, UAE is still lagging in comparison with nations perceived as leaders of the knowledge economy (Parcero and Ryan 2016) and it is making efforts to develop the education system to support the transition (Van Horne et al. 2017). In addition, foreign direct investment, and not local entrepreneurs, has initiated much of the diversification efforts in the UAE. The literature, which is still in its infancy, shows that local entrepreneurship remains marginal. Indeed, local Emirati have a strong preference for public sector jobs, as the latter are well paid and more socially rewarding (Forstenlechner and Rutledge 2010). Indeed, 92% of Emirati work in the public sector (UAE National Bureau of Statistics 2011). It is well known that entrepreneurship plays a key role in economic development. An entrepreneur is, above all, one who perceives profit opportunities, in other words, a mutually advantageous exchange which is not yet exploited by market agents (Kirzner 1973). In this perspective, the main source of a country’s growth and productivity gains is the readiness of the population to take advantage of market opportunities (Holcombe 1998; Boettke and Coyne 2003; Facchini 2008). The post-oil era calls for the finding of solutions to the lack of entrepreneurship among Emirati nationals. Such an issue is generally inherent to every Rentier State. The quality of institutions is often targeted as the main determinant of a country’s entrepreneurial activity. Consequently, Rentier States’ governments could improve the quality of their institutions in order to fuel the emergence of an “Entrepreneur Class”. North (1990) makes the distinction between formal and informal institutions. A large swath of literature has highlighted the prominent role of formal institutions, and in particular, the effect of economic freedom, on economic development and entrepreneurial activity (Kreft and Sobel 2005; Campbell and Rogers 2007; Bjornskov and Foss 2008; Gohman et al. 2008; Hall and Sobel 2008). In the UAE, indicators of economic freedom have increased steadily since the 2000s. The Fraser Institute classifies the UAE as being one of the freest countries from an economic standpoint.Footnote 2 Formal institutions are thus robust in the UAE. Perhaps, the reflection instead needs to focus on informal institutions. The relationship between informal institutions, or culture, and entrepreneurship is a more complex one because formal rules are driven by informal rules followed in society (Boettke and Coyne 2009; Randolph and Rivero 2017). In addition, the post-oil era in the Rentier State context would force the State to levy taxes and ultimately to reduce economic freedom. The latter would be detrimental to entrepreneurial activities. Despite a strong positive relation between well-established formal institutions and entrepreneurial behaviours, it has also been argued that country-specific culture influences individuals’ economic choices and entrepreneurs’ profiles. Indeed, Peters and Besley’s (2006) notion of knowledge cultures points to the cultural preconditions required for knowledge-based economies to operate successfully. The creation, production and dissemination of knowledge require the cultural exchange of ideas, which in turn depends upon certain cultural conditions, such as trust and responsibilities between different knowledge partners, institutional routines, regimes and strategies. Yet, the literature findings remain conflicting (Bowen and De Clercq 2008; Stephan and Uhlaner 2010).Footnote 3 For instance, individualistic societies based on innovation and meritocratic values stimulate entrepreneurial activities (Lee and Peterson 2000). Similarly, societies with a greater proportion of the population exhibiting traits such as high level of trust and uncertainty avoidance experience high levels of entrepreneurship (Uhlaner and Thurik 2007). Conversely, South East Asian holistic societies tend to value development strategies based on imitation rather than innovation (Shane 1993, 1995). Grounded on moral values promoted by Confucius, these societies attach greater importance on social prestige, hard work and rigour. The complex debate about formal versus informal institutions as drivers of entrepreneurial behaviours motivate our hypothesis developed in this article, namely, that the lack of entrepreneurship in the oil rich UAE is driven by a culture which is not conducive of entrepreneurship. Following Beblawi (1990), citizens of Rentier States would exhibit a rentier mentality rather than an entrepreneurial mindset. This would occur despite the existence of well-established formal institutions of economic freedom. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a questionnaire survey among business students at a federal university in the UAE and analyse the impact of culture on entrepreneurial intentions. Our survey showed that students exhibit a culture which is not entrepreneurship-friendly. Starting a business is not the students’ priority. More specifically, one of the main results of this study was that the students who were not willing to start a business seemed to be constrained by a holistic culture which led them to fear stigmatization associated with business failure. This group of students also believed that entrepreneurship was not the main driver of a country’s economic growth. In addition to shedding light on the central role played by culture in shaping entrepreneurial attitudes, our study highlights the strong students’ preference for public sector job as a way to become wealthy and gain social recognition. As a result, our analysis gives credit to Beblawi’s thesis and raises the question of education and of the development of an “Entrepreneur Class” in the post-oil UAE era context. The remainder of the article is organized as follows: After having exposed the motivation of the article in the “Introduction”, “Background” discusses the lack of entrepreneurship in the UAE and highlights some stylized facts suggesting and pointing out the importance of culture. “Research Methodology” describes our methodology and explains the setup of the questionnaire which is grounded on a sociological approach of entrepreneurial behaviours. “Analysis and Results” presents the empirical analysis and its results. “Discussion and Implications” provides a discussion of the results and their policy implications. Finally, “Conclusion” concludes and highlights some limitations of our study.",8

The research in the field of knowledge management has focused mainly on the public and private sectors. It is possible to refer to the contributions of Graham and Pizzo (1996) and Gibbert et al. (2011) for the private sector and Syed-Ikhsan and Rowland (2004) and Riege and Lindsay (2006) for the public sector. For Ragsdell (2013), as motivation for this research drive in the private sector, it may be suggested to equip knowledge management organizations to obtain competitive and public sector gains, looking for ways to reduce costs and improve efficiency. Details regarding research in the field of knowledge management for the third sector, including NPOs, are discussed in the works of Lettieri et al. (2004), Hurley and Green (2005), and Hume and Hume (2008). However, these and other reference works are, according to Ragsdell (2016), the first steps taken in an area that offers immense research opportunities, especially when comparing the abundance of studies in other sectors with the still scarce research directed to this third sector. According to Fotler (1981), the organizations that operate in this sector operate in very dynamic and complex contexts, whose studies can lead to valuable conclusions. The relevance of the deepening of knowledge management research directed to the third sector still increases, about organizational behavior. In carrying out the present study, we found no other study focused on the sharing of tacit knowledge in non-profit organizations that combined voluntary work with salaried work. Thus, the present study focuses on the determination of tacit knowledge sharing within volunteer fire brigades in Portugal, by verifying the prevalence of indicators for this sharing and the main barriers to this sharing. Thus, the objectives focus on the identification of the main factors and the main types of barriers to sharing tacit knowledge in these organizations. This article begins with a summary of the essential information about the objectives, the methodological approach, the main conclusions, the limitations of the research, and the originality or value of the research. Here’s a brief introduction to the topic and keywords. The theoretical framework, with emphasis on indicators, factors, and barriers to tacit knowledge sharing, is presented below. The next point deals with the presentation and discussion of the results. Finally, we present the conclusions and recommendations for future studies.",15

Firm incentives and abilities to innovate hinge on various factors. Some of these determinants reflect firms’ internal characteristics such as ownership and size, which affect vital decisions of the firm such as whether to participate in international markets. These firm characteristics also influence vital manpower decisions such as employing highly skilled workers (Salavou et al. 2004). This decision also affects firm access to and availability of finance in the long- or short-run time period. Externally, firm’s innovations are influenced by the business ecosystem in which they operate. Competitions and interactions play a key role in the business environment to stimulate firms’ innovations (Norbäck and Persson 2012). Innovation is significant to technology acceptance, and assessing the determinants of innovation is vital in understanding how firms reach the technology frontier. It is also the first step in designing policies to improve growth and development. The aptitude to utilize innovations is therefore the most imperative factor for firm growth and increased economic competitiveness. These innovation performances are driven and sustained by efficient knowledge creation, appropriation and dissemination. The recent innovation surveys conducted by Eurostat concluded that innovations across the EU are scaling up (Phillips 2018). Albeit innovations are increasing, the evidence of the factors driving the rise in innovations is not evenly distributed across the EU due to the differences in socioeconomic development and innovation landscape (Beugelsdijk et al. 2018). These variations in the innovation landscape affect how innovation performance can be analysed. Currently, there exist numerous empirical limitations that can be used to properly account and measure firm-level innovations due to the differences in innovation landscape. For instance, there are no generally agreed upon indicators that can be used to directly determine and monitor innovations performances. Factors stimulating innovations in countries need to adapt to local conditions and should not be generalized. Numerous studies (see Pece et al. 2015) have concluded that innovations in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries are increasing and driving growth and development. But these studies did not focus on the factors propelling these soaring innovations. Therefore, our understanding of the determinants influencing high-quality innovations needs to be further refined, and this is the focus of this paper. This study is unique in the sense that it combines Visegrad countries into a single analytical unit due to their unique socioeconomic features and tries to find out the factors boosting their innovation performances. These countries share similar economic, social characteristics, institutions and structures and are all transmuting from communism to market economies. Hence, we believe that our results could be used for generalization purposes. Based on their similarities, we believe that lumping them into a single analytical unit will save us the time from analysing them separately. We focused on the manufacturing sector in these countries due to the significant contributions they provide to these economies in terms of job creation and GDP among others. The rest of the article is planned as follows. The next section describes the empirical and theoretical literature that explores the determinants of firm’s innovations. The third part focuses on the methodology and presents the source of dataset. The empirical results and discussions are included in the fourth section, and “Conclusions and practical implications” concludes with recommendations and suggestions for further research.",17

The idea of moving towards the so-called knowledge-based economy within the EU is longer, because its assumptions have already been the subject of interest of a large part of the EU countries under the Lisbon strategy since 2000. The above strategies implemented both at EU and national levels are an attempt to counteract the EU’s structural problems reflected by weakening pace of economic growth and competitiveness of the EU countries in relation to the largest trade partners, i.e. the USA, China and India, and resulting mainly from the relatively low level of professional activity, education and European society’s propensity to innovate, as well as lower level of investment in research and development and utilisation of new technologies (European Commission 2010). Smart growth priority is assumed to interact also with other Europe 2020 strategy priorities, i.e. sustainable and inclusive growth. Technological progress and innovation have a positive impact on environmental protection, resource saving and the development of sustainable production methods. It creates new jobs, reduces unemployment as well as economic and social exclusion (Begg 2010). Smart growth, requiring high R&D expenses and the use of mechanisms conductive to application of theoretical knowledge in practice is regarded as a growth creating high added value (Dziawgo and Dziawgo 2016; Yi 2013). It is growth connected with the increasing role of education, knowledge and innovation, which is potentially more universal and sustainable (Rusca 2011; Balcerowicz and Rzońca 2015). Focusing on implementation of the smart growth priority in the EU undoubtedly originated from many theoretical concepts indicating a significant impact of innovations and human capital on increase in GDP per capita level and the role of institutional factors supporting this relationship. The precursor of this approach was Solow (1957), who identified technological progress (total factor productivity changes) as the exogenous source of GDP. In the version of the neoclassical growth model presented by Mankiw et al. (1992), the key role of human capital in stimulating GDP was for the first time emphasised. An important role in its creation (as an endogenous resource) was attributed to properly conducted economic policy. It was also in line with the previous concepts of Schumpeter (innovation theory) or F. Machlup (concept of knowledge industries), emphasizing the importance of implementing innovation by entrepreneurs–innovators and the development of the sectors responsible for development and distribution of knowledge (e.g. education, R&D, information services) for economic growth processes (Schumpeter 1934, 1939; Machlup 1962). The theoretical justification for including the smart growth idea into the priorities of European Union policy can be found especially in endogenous growth theories. According to them, an increase in individual qualifications of employees, learning opportunities and innovative abilities of economies are the main GDP drivers. They are particularly connected with investment in R&D and education and should be supported by a state policy (Barro 1997). P. Romer (1990) proves the theoretical and empirical relationship between GDP and the accumulation of human capital obtained by improving the quality of the education system, learning by doing, external effects between companies (spillover effects) and relevant government activities in the field of supporting technological changes (investment in R&D), monitoring the process of creating and distributing knowledge and protecting entities responsible for inventions. R. Lucas (1988) defines the sources of GDP per capita growth as the initial state of human capital resources, the quality of which can be improved as a result of “internal effects” (self-development, skills improvement, increasing productivity) and “external effects” (impact of an individual employee on the performance of others). S. Rebelo (1991), in turn, claims that GDP growth is mainly associated with the effective production of final capital goods and the gradual increase in human capital used in their production. He underlines the importance of involving both private entities and public bodies in creating human capital resources and actions aimed at increasing the professional activation of society. The implementation of the smart growth priority under the Europe 2020 strategy in EU countries, which, as indicated above, is deeply theoretically justified, involves the achievement of several objectives by 2020, i.e. increasing R&D expenditure, improving the quality of human capital by increasing the percentage of people with tertiary education and lowering the rate of early leavers and increasing professional activation of European society. The progress of individual countries in their implementation is monitored by the European Commission through the European Semester, an annual cycle of macro-economic, budgetary and structural policy coordination (Rzeszotarska 2016; European Semester 2019). This issue is also the subject of interest of many economists. They focus very often on the progress of EU member states in achieving the overall Europe 2020 objectives, including those related to smart growth. In their research, they point at a significant variation in the level of implementation of the strategy across EU countries. The disparities are noticeable between the “old” and “new” EU members, between the highly developed western countries and south European countries (Fura et al. 2017), and among the new member countries (Stec and Grzebyk 2018). The convergence between the EU–15 and EU–13 countries in the implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy goals has also been proven (Szymańska and Zalewska 2018). The reasons for these differences are seen in the countries’ socioeconomic status, previous backlog in reaching the strategy goals in some of the community countries (Kukuła 2017), relatively high level of unemployment and unfavourable demographic structure in many EU member states, as well as in a public finance policy aiming to mitigate the effects of the 2008–2009 economic crisis (Klikocka 2019). In addition, there are voices questioning the success of the strategy and postulating the need to extend its time horizon (Kukuła 2017; Klikocka 2019). However, there are a few studies where only the degree and prospects of the smart growth implementation in EU countries are examined. Majority of them focus on the attempts to create a tool measuring the level of implementation of the smart growth priority and assess the position of individual EU countries in this respect. Pasimeni (2012, 2013) makes an attempt to measure the performances of the EU member states in the Europe 2020 strategy, including its smart growth dimension, with the use of the Europe 2020 index (based on a set of relevant, accepted, credible, easy to monitor and robust indicators presented by the European Commission). Walheer (2018) decomposes the above index (by distinguishing between three different components: country-, group- and objective-specific indexes) and extracts the new indices allowing better quantification and monitoring of the progress of the European countries towards the achievement of the smart growth objectives, i.e. the Smart Growth Index and country-specific Smart Growth Index. Żelazny and Pietrucha (2017), assuming that smart growth is based on innovation and institutions, carry out a survey for EU countries in 2004–2014 using the creative economy index whose components are both variables diagnosing innovativeness of the economy as well as variables characterising institutional environment. In the studies on the EU members’ degree of smart growth targets implementation, composite indicators based on Hellwig’s synthetic measure of development (HSMD) are also used. Skordzka (2016) ranks EU countries in terms of the value of the synthetic measure of the level of smart growth in 2013. This synthetic indicator is based on the selected variables from the Knowledge Economy Index (the World Bank) and the European Innovation Scoreboard (European Commission) methodologies. Hellwig’s method of linear ordering is also used by Tusińska (2015) to determine the position of EU countries in the area of the fundamentals of innovativeness in 2012. The synthetic indicator created for this purpose includes a number of variables approximating important smart growth dimensions, i.e. the education system, R&D expenditure, innovative system and patent activity. In more in-depth studies, authors attempt to identify the factors determining the progress of EU members (also CEE countries) in meeting individual targets adopted under the smart growth pillar. The reasons for differences between EU countries are seen in the industry structure, intensity of using knowledge in particular sectors of the economy and research possibilities of individual countries (Mazur-Wierzbicka 2019). Żelazny (2017), in turn, assessing the positive changes in Poland in creating conditions for smart growth, points at the significant importance of human capital and creativity as the basis of innovation as well as institutional factors (freedom and property rights, business regulations, fiscal institutions etc.). In the context of all CEE countries, among the factors determining the effectiveness of implementing the smart growth objectives, authors also mention the level of the brain drain phenomenon, socio-economic conditions for retaining and attracting highly educated and qualified people (Talamaciu and Cismas 2016), innovation and education systems, effective use of ICT technologies, conditions for entrepreneurship facilitating the ability to bring new knowledge into the market in a timely and effective manner (Myszkowska 2015) or the level of tertiary education expenditure (Radulescu et al. 2018) . The economic effects of successful implementation of the smart growth priority are much less frequently examined in the literature. M. Radulescu et al. (2018) found an empirical evidence for the positive impact of some of the Europe 2020 strategy objectives on CEE countries’ economic performance and competitiveness in 2004–2015 and pointed to the particular importance of tertiary education, school dropout ratio and employment rate. Priede and Neuert (2015) showed the evidence that higher R&D investment implemented under Europe 2020 strategy resulted in higher EU economies’ competitiveness expresses as the number of patents and the share of high-tech goods in total export. The literature provides examples of research where implementation effects of only one smart growth target (mainly R&D expenditure and human capital resources) are investigated. Kacprzyk and Doryń (2017) found no evidence of a positive impact of R&D expenditure on economic growth in both the old and new EU member states in the period 1993–2011. In turn, Szarowská (2017), in a survey of 20 EU members for the period 1995–2013, proved the positive impact of public R&D expenditure on economic growth and the insignificant impact of these outlays made by private entities. A statistically significant impact of R&D expenditures on EU members’ economic growth in the period 2000–2013 was also confirmed in a survey carried out by Freimane and Bāliņa (2016). Results of the recently published studies assessing the impact of human capital on EU countries’ economic performance are more explicit. They confirmed a positive impact of qualified human capital on growth through innovation (Barcenilla-Visús and López-Pueyo 2018) and revealed a positive and statistically significant relationship between GDP per capita and innovative capacity of human capital (evidenced by the number of patents) and qualification of employees with secondary education (Pelinescu 2015). They showed additionally that this impact (in the period 1995–2015) was far more significant in more developed EU economies (Kokotovic 2016). The positive impact of the amount of human capital on the EU members’ per capita income was also proved at the regional level (Laskowka and Dańska-Borsiak 2017). It was shown that past regional human capital was a key factor explaining current regional disparities in innovation and economic development of EU countries (Diebolt and Hippe 2018). However, the literature lacks more comprehensive research examining the strength of the relationship between the state of implementation of the smart growth targets in EU countries and their GDP per capita. This study is an attempt to fill this gap. The aim of the study is also to investigate whether the strength and nature of this impact differs in relation to new and old member countries. The study, first of all, examines the progress of individual countries in achieving the smart growth targets in relation to the intended national and general EU objectives. Secondly, the overall position of individual EU countries in terms of implementing the smart growth assumptions in the period 2000–2017 is assessed. A synthetic indicator (i.e. Smart Growth Summary Index) is used for this purpose. Thirdly, the relationship between the state of smart growth priority implementation and GDP per capita is indicated, which is then verified in a panel survey conducted separately for new and old EU member states. Econometric models (fixed effect models) are estimated not only for the entire 2000–2017 period but also for 2010–2017 sub-period, i.e. the period of the official implementation of the Europe 2020 strategy.",3

The reciprocity of technology upgradation has also resonated with the late industrialisation that prevailed in South Korea and China from the 1960s onwards (Amsden 1989) (Amsden and Chu 2003). The growth outputs in manufacturing between the 1960s and 1990s in the late-industrialised countries have fine-tuned the predictions of dependency theorists (Amsden 2001). Historically, the development phenomenon was linked to the core and peripheries or the first and third world aspects of industrialisation through dependency phenomenon (Frank 1975). Due to dynamic technological activity that has gained profound experience between the core and the peripheral countries after industrial globalisation, the existing dependency theories have started to sway towards the knowledge economic development phase (Shie and Meer 2010). The classical proponents of dependency theory like Baran (1957) and Frank (1975) had predicted the periphery to be stagnant without any development due to resource sharing with the core. On the contrary, the contemporaries like Evans (1983) and Cardoso (1973) highlighted the dependent development and associated dependent development respectively to highlight the various partnerships that pronounce the coalition between the “state, aristocrats and multi-national corporations (MNCs).” Santos (1970) differentiates three types of dependence: firstly, colonial relationship—monopoly of input rich territories; secondly, financial-industrial dependence—capital domination of hegemonies over raw material production and thirdly, technological-industrial dependence—MNCs with technological prowess formed especially after World War II. Historical evidence also supplement the dynamic condition of dependency of periphery over the core nations (Castells and Laserna 1989). South Asian countries like India were following the Import Substitution-Led Industrialisation (ISI) model, where structurally, the economic systems of self-reliance through investments on capital goods produced within the country (Bruton 1998). The more local development focus of the ISI model would not sustain the scale economies, and this would also create an environment of favouritism between the state and domestic capital weakening the need for technology upgrading. The other drawback with the ISI model is the weak state-society relationship that is easily visible in the late industrialisation model followed by East Asia (Rasiah and Hing 2009). The historic-structural factors in the peripherally developing countries would help in verifying various factors that deal with global-local relations not only within the country politically, but also identify the various factors that enable sectoral growth in nation-building (Santos 1970). The new institutional framework developed by Douglass C. North explained the relationship between the emergence of the computer industry in a democratic Indian state. This framework has categorically provided a central place for the economic performance of any location governed by a state temporally (Moon 2017). North (1990) “defines institutions with formal (constitution, statute and regulations) and informal (rules, norms and values) modes, and structure organisations having specific common goals to interact.” The state is a political organisation defining formal modes of institutions which would give birth to various firms and markets (North 1989). The main aim of this paper is to understand the development of institutions and organisations in the development of the knowledge-based industry in India. Two cumulative strategies that helped India make progress from a premature position to an advanced stage in generating organisations in the development of the service sector economy. First strategy is the assessment of the state’s dominant role in setting up institutions in gaining recognition for embracing a third industrial revolution through the new institutional framework. Second strategy empirically analyses the contribution to the export growth of the knowledge-based service economy output through a selection of multiple variables and generating a model through regression analysis. The “Initial Footprints in Science and Technology” section will review the establishment of institutions that had helped in the time to time policy changes in the development of the knowledge-based industry. Discussion on the significant aspect of the growth of human capital for the promotion of the knowledge-based service industry is in the “Establishing Institutions for Producing Human Capital” section. The “Addressing Self-reliance Through Devising Diverse Institutional mechanisms” section will ponder upon the most incognizant decision of self-reliance through devising diverse institutional mechanisms. The choice of economic development phase adopted by the state from “regulation to facilitation” is discussed in detail in the “Economic Development Phase from Regulation to Facilitation” section. The “Data and Methodology” section will determine the temporal data and methodology adopted in the multiple regression analysis. The “Conclusion” section would conclude this temporal review of institutional decisions that helped in recognition of India’s role in the knowledge-based economy globally.",5

One of the components in this positive image is the information component covering the flows of data about economic, political, cultural, and social domains. The aggressive globalization going on in the twenty-first century has implications for all the human activity domains. Now, it is difficult to imagine an active human without gadgets simplifying his/her life. People have become used for the immediate and comfortable access to high-quality information or services that they require. By use of gadgets or Internet, we can watch news, communicate, order foods, do shopping, or solve our wellbeing problems etc. But what can be the consequences of this “information comfort”? As argued by Jain (2017), the information generated by the population is expected to increase to 44 petabytes, or to 44 trillion Gigabytes by 2020, with the boosting data of diverse kinds and all-embracing Internet, but by now, it has already created unique conditions for growth in scientific knowledge. It is obvious that the data ecosystem and information webs need to be managed in a skillful and effective manner. This is obvious by definition, because any sphere of human life activity is oversaturated by information now. This article is devoted to analysis of research data as an integral component of the progress, in which applications help develop the economy and social system as a whole. It should be noted that the terms “research data” and “scientific data” have similar meaning in our study. The study could reveal the drawbacks in organization of research data, immanent in organization of big data, and works devoted to this category of data have been published by specialists from diverse fields, including ICT, statistics, and library studies. This poses the problem related with systematization of research data, which, accordingly, requires their multidimensional analysis in order to foster a holistic view of the big data management problem, with identifying their role and significance for the digital society. The results of this study can be used in organizing big data management. This article attempts to sum up information about research data. We believe it desirable to start up with addressing the big data concept, to proceed with a review of research data interpretations, principles, and organization of research data as a subcategory of big data in the official statistics perspective, and end up by investigating the way of research data management and outlining the role of academic libraries as full-fledged participants of the research process.",1

ICTs,Footnote 1 a cluster of technologies that emerged in the 1970s, have been widely considered at the origin of the current technological revolution. However, the recent period of slow growth and the emergence of potentially new radical technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, robotics, and IoT) have sparked a debate about the next technological revolution, its possible advent and impact, its core technologies, and its relationship with some of the most important societal problems, like environmental sustainability and income inequality (Gordon 2012, Perez 2013, Archibugi 2017, Steinmueller 2017, Lundvall 2017, Schwab 2017, Lee et al. 2018, Tylecote 2019, Dosi and Virgillito 2019). Technological revolutions have been defined as clusters of interrelated radical technologies that create new leading industries and have a widespread impact on existing industries, destroying some and rejuvenating others (Perez 2010). Hence, by definition, technological revolutions are the main factor that generates structural change. As highlighted by Schumpeter (1939) and Schumpeterian scholars (Freeman and Perez 1988, Perez 2010), technological revolutions also generate long-run fluctuations in innovative and economic activity, that is, periods of accelerated and decelerated growth of both investments in innovation and production, also called growth waves, long waves, or great surges of development. Periods of high growth have been associated with the improvement and diffusion into economy of radical technologies. Periods of slow growth have been linked to the maturity of leading technologies and the installation period of emerging technologies (Schumpeter 1939, Freeman and Perez 1988). This paper aims at examining whether the long-run fluctuations generated by technological revolutions are endogenous or exogenous. This question is important because if fluctuations in innovative and economic activity are endogenous, then the economic system would tend to recurrently generate on its own the forces that transform it and that determine its long-run development, namely, technological revolutions and structural change. In addition, the economic system would tend to recurrently experience periods of accelerated growth. On the contrary, if fluctuations are exogenous, then technological revolutions, structural change, and growth accelerations would be the result of historical accidents or other exogenous events that will not necessarily repeat in the future, e.g., the Second World War, or exceptionally important innovations that can only be invented once, like in Gordon’s (2012) analysis. This question also has important policy implications, in particular with respect to the debate sketched above, because a better understanding of the process of long-run economic development should improve the capability of public policies to orient future development paths. In the literature there seems to be a certain consensus on the idea that radical innovations, and the associated long-term fluctuations in innovative and economic activity, are exogenous, though some scholars have put forward arguments in favor of endogenous radical innovations. In Kuznets’s (1930) and Schumpeter’s (1939) analysis, as near as we can make out, radical innovations are caused by random or exogenous factors, independent of macroeconomic variables. If so, Schumpeter’s theory would explain growth waves (i.e., why economic growth accelerates and then decelerates), but not their recurrence, that is, why the economy regularly recovers after the deceleration and why a new wave begins. In fact, the existence of an endogenous mechanism explaining the recurrence of waves is a necessary requirement for a theory of long waves (Rosenberg and Frischtak 1983). Schumpeter, instead, conceptualized business cycles as disturbances in the equilibrium and a return to a new equilibrium point, which gives the process a cyclical character (Konstantakis and Michaelides 2017). This position is basically shared also by neoclassical economics, according to which economic fluctuations are due to exogenous technological shocks causing acceleration/deceleration in the rate of technical change and production. Mensch (1979), instead, proposed that firms’ propensity to invest in radical innovation is endogenous, that is, dependent on general macroeconomic conditions. According to Mensch, only the exhaustion of the growth potential of predominant technologies and the consequent despair of depression periods will induce firms to invest in radical innovations, which will eventually give rise to a new growth wave. This position allows explaining the recurrence of waves but has been highly criticized. For example, Clark et al. (1981) argued that the emergence of radical innovations is mainly due to relatively exogenous factors, including scientific and technological breakthroughs, and periods of very strong demand, such as booms and wars. Finally, also economic history scholars have stressed the importance of exogenous “macroinventions” in order to explain the observed acceleration of productivity growth during industrial revolutions (Mokyr 1993, Craft 1995). Although we share the view that historical accidents and other exogenous factors have a major impact upon long-run fluctuations, we think that theories based solely on purely exogenous factors risk ignoring those endogenous forces that could be part of the explanation. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework that integrates both endogenous and exogenous factors: While endogenous factors are at the origin of the tendency of the economic system to grow in a cyclical way, exogenous factors are expected to influence the length and amplitude of cycles, which, therefore, are not regular. More in particular, in this work we use the notion of technological paradigm (Dosi 1982), and, following Perez (2010), we apply it at macro-level. By relying on Schumpeterian studies of innovation dynamics, we first define the development pattern of a technological paradigm (the technological cycle) and its growth phases. Then, by combining such studies with Keynesian theories of demand generation, we analyze the relationship between technological cycle and economic activity (the economic cycle). We suggest that this relationship may be represented as a process of co-evolution between investment in innovation and demand. This is based, on the one hand, on the different productivity gains generated by a technological paradigm over its life cycle and, on the other hand, on continuous multiplier and accelerator feedback effects between innovation and demand that cause a cumulative amplification of any initial change in innovative investment. The co-evolution between innovation and demand has already been considered the main endogenous mechanism driving structural change and long-run economic development (Saviotti and Pyka 2012, 2013). Here, in a complementary way, the process of co-evolution between innovation and demand is also the main endogenous mechanism explaining technological revolutions, growth waves, and their recurrence. In this context, the emergence of radical innovations depends on unfavorable economic conditions, but, unlike Mensch (1979), such conditions affect the propensity of only a minority of new firms to invest in radical innovation. Yet, because of the multiplier and accelerator effects, the behavior of this minority may explain why a new cluster of radical technologies emerges and why the economy recovers. This is coherent with numerous studies showing that incumbent firms possess sunk investments, as well as specific knowledge and managerial practices that make it either difficult or disadvantageous for them to invest in radical innovation (Anderson and Tushman 1990, Christensen 1997, Kemp et al. 1998, Breschi et al. 2000, Markard et al. 2012). On the other side, a number of exogenous factors may have a major impact upon the above-mentioned endogenous process by influencing both the length and amplitude of fluctuations, that is, the timing and economic impact of technological revolutions. Exogenous factors may include random historical events (e.g., wars, financial crisis, international factors, and demographic dynamics), technical factors, socio-institutional actors, and public policies. Hence, due to exogenous factors, some expansive (recessive) phases may be long and may exhibit very high (low) growth rates, while others may be shorter and weaker. Exogenous factors are also expected to play a role in selecting new technological paradigms and trajectories among the set of notionally possible ones (Dosi 1982), and, therefore, they may influence technological change directions. To provide a preliminary empirical evidence supporting the proposed framework, we have used patent data relating to ICTs and productivity data over the period 1970–2016. We have fitted to these data the logistic curves representing the technological and economic cycle, then we have identified the growth phases of both the technological and the economic cycle, and have tested their synchronization. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review the relevant literature, while in Section 3 we illustrate the framework, discussing both endogenous and exogenous factors. Section 4 examines the empirical evidence on the ICTs cycle, and Section 5 concludes.",7

Seyr,Thomas Hoffer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Knowledge management (KM) has become established as a multidisciplinary field of research in social sciences and management studies since the turn of the new millennium. Numerous scientific publications underpin the importance of KM. In this sense, KM is able to improve productivity and sustainability of organizations (Zheng and Wang 2018, 110–111). Furthermore, successful KM leads to competitive advantage (Tang et al., 2010; Gammelgaard and Ritter, 2005) in a fast-changing global business environment (Santoro et al., 2019). In contrast to the optimistic view of the academic literature, KM is often reduced to the level of information and communication technologies (especially databases), which is not appropriate for its multilayered nature regarding the dimensions man – organization – technology (Brandt and Massing 2002, 235–249). The practical application of a holistic understanding of KM (which is basically efficient and effective at the same time) is often neglected (Seyr 2015). In addition to such neglection, Tang et al. (2010) and Gammelgaard and Ritter (2005) only focus on efficiency, while Ferraris et al. (2017) concluded the importance of an efficient and effective use of knowledge. Therefore, KM is unable to unfold its full potential and it achieves only marginal effects. Technology should only be seen as a (necessary) tool to enable the processes of KM, but it should not replace KM itself (Sharma and Deb 2019, 763). In order to implement sustainability within information management and KM, Erek and Zarnekow (2009, 424) introduce a regulator circuit containing the following phases: identification of resources, evaluation of resources, identification of measures, prioritization, implementation, action, and controlling (Fig. 1). The second and last phases (shaded grey in the graph) emphasize the importance of evaluation tools in the field of information management and KM. Regulator circuit for information and knowledge management (own graph, inspired by Erek and Zarnekow 2009) Such evaluation tools are the main focus of this article, which is structured as follows: First, the authors review the most relevant research articles in the field of KM. The focus is on conceptual and practical studies to serve both the academic and the business environments. Second, the portfolio analyses are introduced in the context of KM. Third, the research methodology of the authors is explained. Fourth, different approaches (Boston Matrix, the McKinsey Portfolio, the life cycle analysis, and the SWOT analysis) are described and adapted for use in strategic KM. Fifth, the adaptations are discussed, practical implications are given, conclusions are drawn about the academic contribution and practical use, and finally, an outlook for further research concludes this paper. Even if this work is of a conceptual nature, it is very important in the field of KM not only from a theoretical perspective but also in a practical sense. The tools adapted are very well known and build a theoretical foundation. The practical use of the approaches described and recommended needs to be further tested. One of the most significant gaps in the field is being addressed, and a solution provided, by introducing the different approaches in a strategic KM context: previous literature focuses on efficiency and neglects effectiveness, which does not make any approach strategic at all. Furthermore, the authors’ recommended approach in KM is sustainable from the economic perspective of a firm. This fact does not only make the contribution relevant in theory but also helps firms to increase/optimize profits, and therefore the research is practically important.",3

If traditionally human capital concept is associated to the worker’s education/skills (Krueger and Lindhal 2001; Becker 2007), more recently, it has assumed a broader notion to include health status because omitting health in the growth regression may lead to biased results. Human capital should be considered in a broad notion that includes both education and health dimensions. The purpose of more recent macroeconomic studies on the relationship between health and growth is to demonstrate that health status has a positive effect on the growth rate and therefore that the relationship from health to growth is also taken into consideration (Hashmati 2001; Gyimah-Brempong and Wilson 2004; Bloom and Canning (2005, 2008); Li and Huang 2009). More generally, the contribution of the health sector to economic growth passes through two effects: the effect of improving the general health of the population and the effect of education. The main purpose of this paper is to show how, in addition to education, health capital has been integrated in the theory of economic growth and to present empirical evidence of its impact on developing and developed countries’ economic performance. More specifically, this paper analyses the tripartite relationship between education, health and economic growth by comparing low-, middle- and high-income countries. It uses aggregate annual panel data, obtained from the World Development Indicators for a sample of 108 developed and developing countries, with data spanning 1990 to 2017, to estimate a model of the interrelationships between human capital (health and education) and economic growth. The paper is an extension of the augmented Solow model suggested by Mankiw et al. (1992) by using, in addition to education, life expectancy at birth as a proxy of health status in the growth function. At a macroeconomic level, the idea that human capital incorporates not only education but also health is more recent (Mostafizur 2010; Suri et al. 2011). Some pioneer studies that relate health with GDP per capita are due to Preston (1975), who showed a positive relationship between national income levels and life expectancy, and Grossman (1972) who showed that health can be also seen as a capital good, since the production of health determines how much time is spent in labour. Healthier workers are less likely to be absent at work due to illness and by consequence they are more productive (Bloom et al. 2018). It is also showed that education develops effective capacities that shape many of life circumstances that ultimately affect health, including paid full-time employment and fulfilling work. Ross and Wu (1995) argue that education exerts its positive effects on health through four broad channels: i.e. spend more time in the labour force, invest more in education, save more and more productive at work. Education teaches people to think logically and rationally which may lead to higher income levels (Ross and Mirowsky 1999). Empirical studies regarding the linkages between education and economic growth and between heath and economic growth are available at national and international level, but a very few studies are available in literature that have established simultaneously the linkage among education, health and economic growth. Bloom et al. (2001, 2004) find that life expectancy and education have a positive and significant effect on GDP growth. That is, improved health conditions increases output not only through labour productivity but also through the capital accumulation. Jamison et al. (2004) find that education and better health plays critical role in boosting the economic growth. Acemoglu and Johnson (2007) point out that health to be very influential on economic development, mostly in the long run. Thus, improvement in health contributes significantly to GDP growth (Akram et al. 2008; Aghion et al. 2010; and Arthur 2013). In a similar study, Gyimah-Brempong and Wilson (2004) find that investment in health and the stock of health capital has a positive and significant effect on GDP growth. It emerges, from these few empirical observations, that if the correlation between human capital and economic growth has been established and accepted for a long time, the meaning of causality, the extent of its effect and the sign between their components and economic growth, remains an important issue. And as such, it is essential today to take into account these relations in development policies. The results of this research should help to draw the attention of the public authorities to the health and education policy measures or even the human resources they could take for an economic take-off. Studying this relationship is so important because it will afford a better understanding of the effectiveness of human capital on economic growth. Following this introduction, the remainder of the paper is organized as follows: “Empirical Methodology” section describes the econometric model to be estimated, the data variables and the econometric strategy. The “Analysis and Results” section presents the empirical results. The following section contains a robustness analysis and a discussion of results, and the paper concludes and presents policy implications in the last section.",7

The current long-term development strategy Europe 2020 and the next Horizon Europe focuses heavily on reducing the innovation gap among EU member states. A significant emphasis has been put particularly on increasing R&D expenditure to do that, and it has been a concern already since the early 1990s (Sachwald 2015). Despite a substantial effort to stimulate innovation, the EU has, for a long time, suffered from the so-called “European Paradox”—the inability to transform the results of technological research and skills into innovations and competitive advantages (European Commission 1995). It was failing to transition into “a knowledge economy” as successfully as the USA seemed to have (Soete 2002). The enactment of the Bayh-Dole Act in the USA in 1980 significantly changed the way how publicly funded research is commercialized (Grimaldi et al. 2011) and has contributed to the success. It has, therefore, inspired other countries to view commercialization of publicly funded research as a remedy for insufficient innovation performance. EU has provided significant means of funding for these efforts and facilitated the emergence of the “entrepreneurial university” in a top-down manner as a response (Etzkowitz 2003b). The main interest (particularly among transitioning countries) is to pursue instruments like competitive funding for R&D, grants for collaborative R&D, and support programs for technology transfer (e.g., the establishment of technology transfer offices (TTOs), etc.) (Veugelers and Schweiger 2015). Commercialization of university research has also gained traction among scholars. Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (2000) proposed a more enhanced role for universities in knowledge-based societies and a model that analytically differs from the national systems of innovation (NIS) (see, e.g., Lundvall 1992; Nelson 1993) where companies are playing the leading role in innovation. Another literature strand focuses on the dynamics within universities—characteristics and requisites of an entrepreneurial university (Etzkowitz 2013; Etzkowitz et al. 2000; Clark 1998; Etzkowitz 2003b), channels for commercializing university technology (Lockett et al. 2005; Phan and Siegel 2006; Siegel et al. 2007), the role of university TTOs (Geoghegan et al. 2015; Osenga 2007; Siegel et al. 2007; Siegel et al. 2003), and the role and motivation of individual researchers (Jensen and Thursby 2001; Thursby and Thursby 2007). There is also a vast amount of literature on policy implications and support incentives—the implications of a “one-size-fits-all” approach in innovation policy (Karo and Kattel 2010; Tödtling and Trippl 2004; Veugelers and Schweiger 2015; Izsak et al. 2015; Karo 2010) and incentives that could be used to facilitate commercialization of university research (Goldfarb and Henrekson 2003; McCutcheon 2019; Rasmussen 2008; Rasmussen et al. 2006). The article aims to bring these research strands together and explore: How has the “one-size-fits-all” approach has influenced commercialization of research in a catching-up country? Are the incentives that are provided for universities to commercialize research relevant and address their needs? If not, what should be changed? What preconditions have to be in place for universities to be able to transform into an entrepreneurial university? A particular focus in this article is on the aspect of autonomy. Increasing university autonomy through reforms—aimed at transforming universities to act more like private sector organizations—has been on the European agenda due to the belief that universities must play a more significant socioeconomic role (Maassen et al. 2017). However, implementation of Bayh-Dole like laws and top-down provision of homogenous incentives that do not match the capabilities and needs of universities strengthens formal and not actual autonomy (Christensen 2011). This paper aims to explore if this can be a cause for incentives for commercialization of public research to fail. This exploratory case study focuses on the Republic of Latvia—a country that regained its independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. It became a part of the European Union (EU) in 2004 and has received funding to improve its national innovation system (particularly its major weakness—insufficient science-industry collaboration) and contribute in closing the innovation performance gap in the EU. However, this particular area, despite a number of support incentives, has been improving at a slower pace than desired. The article aims to explore how commercialization of publicly funded research is complicated by limited autonomy of universities, characteristics of the country’s economy, and state of development. It also provides recommendations on what elements should be added to the policy mix to tackle the issues. A case study approach was chosen to provide an in-depth exploration and also explanation of a contemporary phenomenon in a real-life context (Yin 2003). The article mainly relies on secondary data, such as publicly available documents, studies, reports, and statistical data. Semi-structured elite interviews with researchers and other university staff involved in commercialization of research, as well as selected experts, were used as additional data sources to gain a more in-depth understanding of the processes. The rest of the paper is organized in the following way: “Literature Review” discusses existing literature; “Methodology” describes the method used in the study. “Development of an Innovation System in Latvia: a Brief Overview” describes the development of Latvia’s national innovation system since regaining independence. “Facilitating Commercialization” introduces a particular program for commercialization, and “Discussion: Commercialization of Research in Latvia: Why Lacklustre Results and What Can Be Done to Improve Those” discusses the main issues with the approach and potential solutions; “Conclusions” concludes the study.",4

While supply chains (SC) involve all the activities regarding the flow and transformation of materials and information among its nodes (Handfield and Nichols 1999), KM is expected to be helpful by enhancing the flow of information and knowledge through the nodes by increasing collaborative relationships with business partners (Hung et al. 2008). The knowledge-based view of the firm recognizes knowledge as the primary organizational resource with the highest value (Grant and Baden-Fuller 1995). This resource is generated, acquired, and utilized in supply chains through the following four knowledge management activities: (1) knowledge creation; (2) knowledge transfer; (3) building appropriate environment for knowledge creation, transfer, and use; and (4) managing knowledge assets (Gunasekaran and Ngai 2006). Given that SCs are rich sources of knowledge (Rauniar et al. 2008; Lawson et al. 2009; Cao and Zhang 2010a), KM as a professional approach is fundamental in managing these sources through the chain (Marra et al. 2011; Rosario et al. 2017). Implementing KM, as a very critical issue, is a huge project through a very complex interconnected structure (supply chain) and it is much more than feeling the requirement for KM in supply chains. In fact, few organizations were capable of implementing KM in their respective supply chains (Wong and Aspinwall 2004) and aware of the need for KMI (Edwards 2005, 2011.). The significance of the problem motivates this study to understand the enablers of KMI and potential outcomes after successful implementation. This study targets to contribute to the literature by clarifying the awareness level of Turkish manufacturing companies for KMI and the fundamental enablers and outcomes of KMI through their eyes regarding their supply chains. Since it is quite difficult to provide information for different KM strategies and processes in a single study, the fundamental goal is providing a general picture. While the literature includes studies about the enablers and outcomes of KMI separately, they are weak in presenting a holistic view of the concern. KMI studies in the context of Turkish market are even weaker in providing details. They present findings mainly from single companies’ perspective and consider only the requirement for KMI (e.g., Zaim 2006; Abughazi and Sener 2018). There are also a few studies regarding the implementation of KM in SCs (Kanat and Atilgan 2014). This study embraces the two issues by considering the implementation of KM through SCs in achieving identified performance outcomes. We evaluate the outcomes under two main directions (short-term and long-term outcomes). Moreover, it also aims to contribute to the literature, especially in the Turkish environment, by clarifying the abovementioned points. In the “literature review” section, the main influencing factors and outcomes of KM implementation are reported under proper headings. These factors and outcomes are used to build survey questions through which respondents, from various Turkish manufacturing companies which are members of existing supply chains, identified the most prominent enablers and outcomes regarding KM implementation. The following sections are used to report the results in detail and to discuss their implications.",1
12.0,3.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,17 March 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00755-4,Innovating in the Desert: a Network Perspective on Knowledge Creation in Developing Countries,September 2021,Mahmoud Ibrahim Fallatah,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Ever since theories of knowledge creation have emerged (e.g., Grant, 1996; Kogut & Zander, 1996; Nonaka, 1994), research on the topic has been rapidly increasing (Phelps et al., 2012). Specifically, scholars have employed network theory to examine the impact of various social capital and network-related features on the creation of new knowledge (e.g., Ganguly et al., 2020; McFadyen & Cannella, 2004; McFadyen et al., 2009; Perry-Smith, 2006; Schilling & Phelps, 2007; Zhao, 2015). While there is a significant body of research on knowledge creation that built on network theory, few studies have focused on how networks impact the value of newly created knowledge. Importantly, such research is lacking when it comes to examining the value of new knowledge created in developing countries. While some developing countries are considered innovative (e.g., China and South Korea), the majority of developing countries are less innovative and less likely to create new knowledge. Indeed, most studies on knowledge creation have focused on developed countries, where knowledge is more likely to be created (Prahalad, 2005). Thus, it is important to examine ways by which valuable knowledge could be created in developing countries (Parcero & Ryan, 2017). It is ideal to conduct a knowledge creation study on developing countries in order to test the generalizability of previous findings (Chua, 2018; Kotabe et al., 2007). It is also important to study the value of created knowledge, given that not all knowledge has the same scientific and economic value (e.g., Fallatah, 2018; Hall et al., 2005; Trajtenberg, 1990). Thus, some interesting questions need to be further addressed. For example, how can developing countries, given their limited access to advanced knowledge, create new knowledge of high value? Utilizing network theory, the current paper attempts to answer the question by examining how some characteristics of networks of knowledge workers affect the value of knowledge created in developing countries. Using patent data, the paper particularly aims to examine if knowledge workers from developing countries can create valuable knowledge by networking with others from developed countries (Fig. 1). It also examines the moderating role of network size. Following earlier studies, networks are defined as sets of knowledge workers and the interpersonal relationships among them (Bourdieu, 1986; Burt, 1992; McFadyen & Cannella, 2004; Cannella & McFadyen, 2016; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998; Phelps et al., 2012). On the other hand, knowledge creation is defined as the creation of new knowledge that has not been known previously (McFadyen & Cannella, 2004; Nonaka, 1994; Schumpeter, 1934). Applying network theory to study teams and small groups is very common in the literature (Katz et al., 2004; Perry-Smith & Shalley, 2014; Sparrowe et al., 2005). For instance, previous studies have used social network analysis to investigate how demographic diversity among R&D teams affect their productivity (Reagans & Zuckerman, 2001), while Fewell et al. (2012) used network theory to study the offensive strategies of basketball teams. In this paper, rather than looking at networks’ external ties (i.e., ties with others outside the focal network), the focus is on networks’ internal ties (i.e., ties among the actors of the focal network). Overall, studying groups’ internal ties through network analysis seems ideal to study knowledge workers’ bounded relationships and its impact on knowledge value. The current paper is different than previous studies in two ways. First, unlike most research that used patent data of developed countries to examine various features of networks (e.g., Ahuja, 2000; Fleming et al., 2007; Kotabe et al., 2007; Nerkar & Paruchuri, 2005; Roper & Hewitt-Dundas, 2015), the present paper uses patent data of a developing country to assess the value of created knowledge and how it is affected by some network characteristics. Particularly, the paper studies knowledge creation of an Arab country, a relatively rare phenomenon (e.g., Berger et al., 2015). It has been suggested that organizations in developing countries tend to ally with partners from developed countries to acquire stronger resources such as new knowledge (Hitt et al., 2000). Therefore, an examination of patents of developing countries seems warranted, since characteristics of knowledge and knowledge workers in such countries are likely to be different than those in developed countries, and because such examination should be helpful in addressing generalizability issues (Chua, 2018; Kotabe et al., 2007). Second, the paper differs from Taylor and Greve (2006), who examined the relationship between the number of creators and financial performance. In particular, they predicted that high numbers of creators are associated with extreme, both positive and negative, financial outcomes. Instead, the current paper focuses on the scientific value of the created knowledge, regardless of whether the knowledge was converted into a product, or its financial success, if ever produced. In other words, using network size as a moderator, the paper builds on Singh and Fleming (2010) in suggesting that when more knowledge workers are involved, the value of created knowledge tends to increase accordingly. Overall, employing network theory and building on arguments from the knowledge literature, the paper takes steps in developing a model of creating valuable knowledge for networks of knowledge workers from developing countries. It aims to broaden the application of network theory in the knowledge literature to include contexts different than what prior studies have focused on. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In the next section, knowledge creation in developing countries is discussed, and arguments on how networking with knowledge workers from developed countries impact the value of created knowledge is provided. Additionally, the section also illustrates how such a relationship is moderated by the size of the network. Then, the methodology used in this study is presented, explaining the data collection process and all the variables, before presenting the results of the study. Finally, the paper ends with the discussion and the conclusion sections.",8
12.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,15 August 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-020-00683-9,Total Quality Management and Innovation: Linkages and Evidence from the Agro-food Industry,December 2021,Pantelis Sotirelis,Evangelos Grigoroudis,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Total quality management (TQM) is a fundamental and comprehensive rule for leading and operating an organization, aiming at continually improving performances over the long term, while focusing on customers (Charantimath 2011). It is both a management philosophy and a set of guiding principles based on a continuous improvement process to the benefit of all stakeholders involved (Dale 2003). In respect to its holistic aspect, TQM requires the simultaneous implementation of its key principles (Abrunhosa and Moura E Sá 2008) in all functions of the organization in order to produce products and services that will meet customers’ expectations. The importance of TQM in business organizations may be demonstrated by its major advantages that include both internal and external benefits. Internally, organizations adopting a TQM philosophy are able to eliminate defects and waste, improve processes, reduce cost, and generally have a better cost management system. As a result, they can achieve higher productivity and profitability levels and enhance shareholder and stakeholder value. At the same time, they can improve employee satisfaction and morale and increase customer satisfaction, loyalty, and retention. Furthermore, the adoption of the TQM philosophy is able to strengthen company’s competitive position, enhance market image, and improve its adaptability to changing or emerging market conditions. In addition to the above, the linkages between TQM and food safety is extremely important for agro-food companies. As noted by Barendsz (1998), TQM provides an integrated approach involving all parties in the agro-food chain, and this may help in the effective implementation of food safety systems. Food safety certifications may contribute in the aforementioned benefits; however, particular attention should be given in the standardization of risk assessment, the necessity of chain formation in the agro-food sector, and the improvement of global communication (Barendsz 1998; Talib et al. 2013). In the relevant literature, based on both empirical and theoretical analysis, various practices and elements of TQM are presented. Charantimath (2011) identifies the following key principles of TQM: Customer focus Management commitment Continuous improvement Employee empowerment Fact-based decision making Given the need of firms to implement TQM philosophy, various excellence models are leveraged as a guide. Specifically, the most widespread excellence models are the European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) in Europe, the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award (MBNQA) in the US, and the Deming Price in Japan. Moreover, two aspects of TQM are presented in the literature, the “hard” (or technical) side, which refers to management tools, techniques and practices, and the “soft” (or philosophical), which gives emphasis on the leadership and management of human resources (Dale 2003; Wilkinson 1998). Specifically, in regard to the soft factors, the study of Fotopoulos and Psomas (2009) identifies the following elements: leadership, strategic quality planning, customer focus, process management, continuous improvement, information and analysis, knowledge and education, and supplier management. On the other hand, in a broad definition, innovation refers to new ideas for products/services, new marketing methods and new uses, improvements and new markets for existing products (Simmonds 1986). Furthermore, it could be viewed as a process of creating and implementing ideas in order to produce value for the firm, the suppliers, and the consumers (Popadiuk and Choo 2006). As noted by Carayannis et al. (2020), innovation should be considered as a process of dynamic change that has three major dimensions: socio-economic, socio-political, and socio-technical. Several other scholars define idea as an offering or a solution (e.g., product, service, process, experience) that adds value to the business organization and/or the customer. This “dual” nature of innovation requires the satisfaction of customer needs on one hand, and a viable business model on the other. Nevertheless, innovation is related to the companies’ need to adapt and evolve, in order to meet the changing needs of shareholders and stakeholders. Regarding the linkage between TQM and innovation, it should be emphasized that both concepts focus on customers. Widespread excellence models formalize customer satisfaction as a quality component, while the TQM approach aims on long-term success through it (Grigoroudis and Siskos 2010). Furthermore, customer satisfaction is identified as a main TQM objective (Drury 2007; Tsang and Antony 2001), while innovative firms aim to increase customer value (Abdallah et al. 2016; Dobni 2008). In addition, two of the elements of TQM, namely, customer focus and continuous improvement could enhance firms’ innovation processes (Flynn et al. 1994; Baldwin and Johnson 1996), while both innovation and TQM are aiming on competitive advantage. Moreover, innovation can be viewed as a novel quality process for the improvement of customer delight and thus could be managed and measured. Regarding innovation management, Gupta (2009) suggested four types of innovations (i.e., fundamental, platform, derivative and variation) and identified five innovation phases: Targeting opportunity Exploring ideas Developing alternatives (prototype, etc.) Optimization and commercialization of innovation Following the concept of “big Q” (strategically managing quality in all business processes, products and services) and “little q” (activities related to ensuring the quality of products and services provided to customers) (Madu 1998), innovation process could be focused on a specific product/service (“little i”) or could refer to changes in organizational structure and business model (“big I”) (ASQ 2013). Subsequently, the “big I” is based on the following key factors: organizational culture, senior leadership support, capabilities (talent, experience, etc.), processes (tools, techniques, etc.), and strategy (ASQ 2013). In the aforementioned context, the quality of innovation is an indicator for firms’ readiness to innovate, and requires the shift from quality improvement to innovation improvement (Gupta 2009). On the other hand, the study of Baronienė and Neverauskas (2005) suggests that quality management methods should be viewed as management innovation, while TQM and innovation should be connected under the framework of economic knowledge in a way whereby TQM practices enhance firms’ ability to face obstacles in innovation processes. Furthermore, firms innovating in quality management methods could respond effectively to changes, while they could easier implement different types of innovation (Baronienė and Neverauskas 2005). In addition, Anttila and Jussila (2016), considering quality and innovation as two distinct partnership disciplines interacting to enhance firms’ completive advantage, identified three ways of interaction: Quality management could be supportive towards the different phases of “invention-to-innovation” process. Innovation is vital for quality improvement processes and new product development. Effective integration of quality management and innovation management are necessary, in respect to standardization (e.g., adoption of ISO 9001:2015). Moreover, Din and Cheema (2013), having identified continuous and discontinuous change as elements of TQM and innovation, suggest that firms should adopt both disciplines for a strategic change, while the TQM approach could be supportive towards the deployment of innovative processes. The main aim of this paper is to review and discuss the theoretical and practical linkages between TQM and innovation, focusing on the agro-food industry. Although the study of the relevant literature presents heterogeneous findings, the majority of the published works supports a positive relation between these concepts. The paper identifies three distinct conceptual frameworks for the analysis of the TQM and innovation relationship aiming to contribute to the discussion over this complex and multidimensional topic. Reviewing, organizing, and finally grouping the examined studies could provide valuable insights to firms involved with quality and innovation processes. Each framework is separately analyzed, while the methods found in the literature are listed and relevant findings are provided. The paper also provides a holistic view on the links among TQM, innovation, and firms’ performance after considering all three frameworks. Furthermore, for the analysis of the current links, the paper mainly considers quality systems rather than TQM practices per se, providing useful outcomes on the correlation between the adoption of specific quality systems and techniques and the implementation of different types of innovation. Moreover, the presented review focuses on all types of innovation, i.e., product innovation, process innovation, marketing innovation, and organizational innovation. It also focuses on the classification of innovations to incremental and radical, since TQM practices tend to enhance incremental innovations, although they could become an obstacle for radical innovations (Moura E Sá and Abrunhosa 2007). The review focuses in the agro-food industry, since it recognizes the potential contribution of TQM approach on assuring food safety and quality. The adoption of TQM could shift agro-food firms’ attention towards quality, by setting people behavior, firms’ procedures, and production processes as major priorities (Luning et al. 2006). Agro-food firms are being pushed towards innovative changes on production (e.g., eco-friendly practices), storage, and distribution stages, while they are facing issues such as changing customer needs, variations in the quality of raw materials, contamination of products, packaging, and shelf life limitations (Mambanda et al. 2017). Given the above, agro-food firms need to redefine and expand their established quality processes, by integrating quality assurance and control processes into an effective TQM policy. The paper is organized in three more sections. The theoretical background of the TQM-innovation relationship is given in the “Background and research questions” section, including the research questions of this study. The “Linking TQM and innovation” section presents analytically the alternative approaches for studying the relationship between TQM and innovation. Specifically, this section examines TQM as a driver of innovation, innovation as driver of TQM, as well as the quality-innovation-performance nexus. Finally, the “Concluding remarks” section summarizes some concluding remarks.",3

Immigrants in the USA accounts for 13% of total population (Vesely et al. 2015). Recent scholarly finding denotes a robust relationship between immigration and entrepreneurship (Vesely et al. 2015). Foreign-born individuals have more business ownerships than natives in the USA, UK, Australia, and Canada (Clark and Drinkwater 2010; Schuetze and Antecol 2006; Wang 2010). American cities offer favorable environment for immigrant entrepreneurship with diverse ethnicities (Fairlie and Lofstrom 2015). Nevertheless, immigrants are considered to have higher entrepreneurial spirit than native born (Fairlie and Lofstrom 2015; Krichevskiy et al. 2016). Currently, millions of Muslims live in different states in the USA. Among these immigrants, 77,679 were born in Turkey and immigrated to the USA after the WW2 and approximately 118,000 in 2006 (Şenyürekli 2006) and between 136,000 and 182,000 as of 2016 (Kamiloğlu 2016) individuals have Turkish roots and this number is expected to double in the coming years. Kaya (2003) added that the number can be greater if Turkish people immigrated to the USA from Cyprus, Middle East, and former Soviet countries. Turkish immigrants live in different states in the USA such as Minnesota (Şenyürekli and Menjivar 2012), Washington, DC, Boston, New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Madison, Wisconsin (Ayçiçeği-Dinn and Caldwell-Harris 2011), and New York, New Jersey, and California where the largest Turkish diaspora live (Turkish Coalition of America 2017). Turkish immigrants have entrepreneurial activities in Europe especially the Netherlands (e.g., Baycan et al. 2012; El Bouk et al. 2013), Germany (Pütz 2003; Tolciu 2011), Switzerland (Baycan-Levent and Kundak 2009), and Romania (Constantin et al. 2008), although the nexus between immigration and entrepreneurship in the USA has been discussed in many studies (e.g., Hart and Acs 2011; Krichevskiy et al. 2016; Moon et al. 2014; Wang 2010). Immigrants with Turkish roots constitute a significant segment in the US society but are among the least studied immigrant groups (Bulut and Ebaugh 2014). In particular, Turkish immigrants’ entrepreneurial activities in the USA are still under-researched. There is a lack of academic and practical attention on factors shaping immigrant entrepreneurship especially Turks in developed nations (Pécoud 2017; Saleh 2017). Individuals convey specific personal and psychological traits based on need and context to attain entrepreneurial success and power (Işık et al. 2019b; Shneikat and Ryan 2018). These factors are a blur in the context of immigrant entrepreneurs with Turkish roots in the USA. Entrepreneurs with Turkish roots are of particular interest because of their Middle Eastern and European heritage. To spur scholarship and advance this research stream, we put forward a comprehensive taxonomy of entrepreneurial capital, social capital, family capital, financial capital, psychological capital, and intellectual and knowledge capital to provide insights on what, how, and why Turkish immigrants engage in entrepreneurship activities. These insights may serve as reference for policy development, which aid integration and economic policies. To fill this gap, this article provides answers to the following questions: What are the emigration motives of immigrant entrepreneurs with Turkish roots in the USA? What are the roles of financial, entrepreneurial, social, family, and intellectual and knowledge capital toward the success of immigrant entrepreneurs with Turkish roots in the USA? What are the common characteristics (i.e., psychological traits and capital) shared among immigrant entrepreneurs with Turkish roots in the USA? What are the challenges faced by immigrant entrepreneurs with Turkish roots in the USA?",5
12.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,25 August 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-020-00679-5,Metropolis: Emergence in a Serious Game to Enhance the Participation in Smart City Urban Planning,December 2021,Jose Aguilar,Francisco Díaz,Jose Gutierrez,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Recent advances in artificial intelligence have become critical in the design of video games. In particular, the concept of emergent game marks the beginning of a new era in video games (Sweetser 2007; Sweetser and Wiles 2005): emergent games represent the evolution of games that are adapted to the player while maintaining the central thread of the game. In the emergent games, the emergence is based on the dynamic creation of a world, so that the player’s actions influence this world, generating emergent behaviors in the world according to what is happening in the game. On the other hand, the term participation means taking part in joint activities to reach a common goal. This practice is highly complex due to its goal-oriented process, which involves decision-making and control. E-participation in a smart city supports the participation of citizens in governance through the use of information and communications technologies (ICTs) (Vrabie and Tirziu 2016; Komninos 2018; Deakin 2014). Citizen participation is especially important in a smart city; hence, its planning should consider the needs of its citizens (Chourabi et al. 2012; Graniera and Hiroko 2016; Mellouli et al. 2014; Deakin 2014). In general, e-participation encompasses different purposes: administration, policy-making, service delivery, and decision-making. With this in view, this paper analyzes the e-participation in the context of decision-making in a smart city (Komninos 2018; Deakin 2014). The processes of collective decisions have significant importance for a smart city. Therefore, it is necessary to define the tools that allow the interaction of the citizens in the decision-making processes about the life in the city. Additionally, it required platforms for the citizens to learn about participation and, specifically, to gain knowledge about the complexity of e-participation in the decision-making processes in a smart city. In particular, this paper studies how to manage the collaboration in decision-making process for urban planning (Komninos et al. 2019). Urban planning involves complex interdependencies and conflicting interests, among other aspects, between citizens, which call for new forms of interaction. Thus, an emerging serious game is used to study this complexity by analyzing the power relations and real collaboration, for developing creative strategies of collaboration. It also determines the forms of managing collaborative efforts in the context of the complex urban planning issue. Introducing emerging serious games into a smart city allows a transparent integration of technologies into city dynamics. According to (Aguilar 2014), the story, the dynamics, and the arising script depend on the context where the emerging serious game is being given. Thus, the game positions the players in a feedback environment of information and motivation to achieve, guided by an explicit objective other than pure fun, to overcome challenges appropriate to their ability and learn from their own mistakes. Emerging serious games is suitable to be used in different contexts in a smart city. Considering that one of the main characteristics of a smart city is the application of e-participation to facilitate collective decision-making about citizens’ services and needs, this work analyzes how emerging serious games are used in this context. Therefore, this paper explores the technology needed to construct a vision of urban development in a smart city and in a collective and secure fashion in order to manage the city’s assets (schools, hospitals, etc.). Special focus is done in serious games that promote e-participation in the context of urban planning. In the domain of serious games and e-participation, (Ahmed et al. 2015) proposes a technology acceptance model (TAM) and a trustworthiness model (TM) that facilitate the use of serious games in e-government services and empower citizen engagement and participation. The models are based on serious games to assist governments in increasing citizens’ engagement in their online services. Pflanzl et al. (Pflanzl et al. 2016) discuss game design as an approach to motivate, involve, and change citizens’ behavior with respect to public service improvement. They propose a serious game for decreasing the gap between public services process opacity and complexity, as well as citizens’ lack of interest or competencies to understand them. The benefits and challenges of this approach are discussed using a public service delivery scenario in Brazil. Thiel (Thiel 2016) reviewed recent academic projects concerning gamified participation tools. The gamified participation tools are a novel approach to re-encourage citizens to make use of their democratic rights by using digital participation platforms. Thiel et al. (Thiel et al. 2016) provide a review of gamification strategies in e-participation platforms and an overview of the current state of the art of so-called gamified participation initiatives. Their results suggest that only a small number of the reviewed projects employ gamification. Moreover, gamified participation initiatives currently seem to be mostly restricted to reward-based gamification, a strategy that might only evoke short-term effects and decrease the quality of participation. They also outline avenues to extend gamified participation. (Thiel 2017) provides an overview of the current practice of applying gamification in public participation. The contribution of that research is twofold. Firstly, it offers relevant insights for the design of future e-participation platforms. Secondly, it helps to establish a common terminology for e-participation game research. In the domain of games for urban planning, (Poplin 2011) focuses on online games and serious games in urban planning. The paper overviews the urban planning games available online and gives some examples of the game stories. Additionally, the author explores the potential of serious games in public participatory planning, in a game entitled B3 Game, applied in the case of a market place in Billstedt. The game enables the players to design their marketplace and discuss their suggestions with other citizens and urban planners. Lundström et al. (Lundström et al. 2016) address urban and regional planning as a wicked game. They explore the obstacles and opportunities of a participatory method in a wicked game called “Citizens’ Jury.” This game represents deliberative practices designed to garner the opinion of groups to serve as a microcosm of the whole population affected by an issue. Martin et al. (Martin et al. 2014) present research of architects and computer scientists about mobile, context-sensitive serious games for sports and health (so-called exergames). Specifically, they describe an approach that designs exergames by interacting with the topography and social environment and present strategies on how to integrate research on health-oriented urban design and planning to the design of such games. Finally, they analyze how the built environment influences physical activities such as walking, cycling, and stair climbing, and they define how to integrate best practices and guidelines from architecture into the game design process, in order to create attractive and more effective exergames. Recently, Madani et al. (Madani et al. 2017) have proposed a serious environmental management game to improve understanding of environmental sustainability. This game-based learning approach increases soft skills, such as critical thinking, creative problem solving, and teamwork, as well as improving cognitive development, learning retention, and social learning. This kind of game is applied in educational settings to promote awareness about sustainable planning and management among citizens. This paper explores a subtype of gaming in a smart city, named “construction and management,” which are simulations where players build, expand, or manage either fictional communities or projects with limited resources (Ferré 2004; Rollings and Adams 2006). Thereby, the player’s objective, in these games, is not to defeat an enemy, but rather to build something in the context of an ongoing process (Aguilar et al. 2011). Examples of these include city construction games such as SimCity and OpenCity (Adams 1998; Ferré 2004; http://www.opencity.info/ n.d.). Specifically, this paper presents a game, called Metropolis, where the social dynamic emerges from the decisions that people make (Aguilar et al. 2011; Aguilar et al. 2016). This game aims to collectively plan the successful growth of communities. Metropolis has as a premise that cities are self-managed, from the decisions taken collectively, in an environment in which all actors (players) have a role of equal importance, and there is no local authority (mayor, governor, etc.). This game can be used for planning a city, managing its limited resources, and identifying the collective interests of its citizens, among other issues. It also can be used for learning to reach collective decisions. Hence, Metropolis is both a serious game due to its teaching capability (learning to reach collective decisions) and an emergent system due to the obtained results (management of a city). Previous research focused on studying emergent behaviors of a city based on rules that govern the interactions between agents (players) that play social roles in this society. This paper uses a mechanism that reaches consensus opinions in Metropolis and establishes transparent forms of inclusion for e-participation. Additionally, Metropolis encourages the emergence of the collective urban vision of a city based on the interests of its citizens. Metropolis, as an emerging serious game, teaches the players about the complexity of e-participation in a smart city. Specifically, it educates players on how to collaborate. As a result, Metropolis facilitates the emergence of smart city behaviors (urban patterns, city features, among others) based on collective decisions. This kind of game exhibits the potential of ICTs in a smart city and encourages its citizens to exploit them. Thus, this work makes contributions within three domains. First, it establishes the importance of e-participation in a smart city for democratic decision-making processes. Second, it shows the use of an emerging serious game for teaching e-participation, and finally, it confirms the emergence of behaviors in a smart city due to e-participation. This work is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical aspects of this paper: emerging serious game simulators of cities and e-participation in a smart city for urban planning. Section 3 introduces Metropolis. Section 4 provides examples of the utilization of Metropolis for e-participation in the context of a smart city for urban planning. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 5.",8

This location explains the historical predilection for seaside tourism to the extent that even political strategies have highlighted this intrinsic link between Tunisian tourism and coastal areas. While seaside tourism has long been a real driver of the economy, employment and investment, it is going through a moment crisis now more and more salient especially after the revolution of January 14, 2011. This crisis is aggravated by other factors such as competition with other destinations, the economic crisis, the degradation of equipment and infrastructure. As a result, the need to restructure tourism strategies is becoming an urgent necessity for Tunisia. Cultural tourism, therefore, seems to be a promising alternative that may open new horizons and expand the range of tourism products as well as target visitors. Thus, the present study raised questions and provided some solutions in order to highlight this alternative tourism for better social and economic outcomes. In other words, it is a question of revalorising the cultural potential that was long relegated to the seaside tourism. Cultural products (monuments, historical sites, traditions, folklore) have great potential to make destinations more attractive. Similarly, since these products are not limited to coastal areas, this choice could expand the Tunisian tourist map by integrating the southern and western regions. In addition to the importance of this new concept of tourism at the sectoral level, it would be a solution aimed at reducing the impact of the social crisis in these disadvantaged regions victimised by regional inequalities in terms of growth, employment and living standard. However, this new strategy requires great financial efforts and capital mobilisation to implement this kind of tourism. Given that the Tunisian state is going through a stifling financial crisis and that national and local private capitals are reluctant, foreign investment seems to be a fundamental means for promoting tourism. In this context, foreign capital from the Gulf countries seems to be a suitable solution. In this research study, which is part of an economic and anthropological approach to destination tourism, we dealt with the actual as well as potential visitors who might be interested in the Tunisian destination. To this end, we analysed the tourists’ motivations vis-à-vis the Tunisian destination by considering our questions and our investigations at the heart of the attractive cultural factors and focusing on other regions that are not exclusively seaside. The design of the approach and the interpretation of the results are based on an econometric model we considered relevant for the variables’ analysis. It is the probit model that was first introduced by Bliss (1934). Before presenting our hypothesis, we strongly believe that the tourism sector is considered as one of the fundamental drivers of economic and social development in Tunisia. In fact, this sector contributes with 7% to the GDP, generates 380,000 direct and indirect jobs and covers 56% of the country’s trade deficit, according to Agence Foncière Touristique, AFT (2018). Despite this economic weight, this sector has remained, for several decades, mainly seaside exhibiting numerous weaknesses and lingering deficiencies. Indeed, it remained a prisoner of a past development strategy, namely the standardised service inspired by the Fordist production model. This old-fashioned model drew its strength from low-cost mass production, which allowed for gains in scale and a regular and constantly increasing wage policy, which stimulated the consumption of the available products and services. When Fordism, based on the principle “we sell what we produce”, was dethroned in the early 1970s of the last century by Toyotism, implementing the principle of the production of “variety” and the motto “We produce what we sell”, all sectors of the global economy have gradually aligned with this new maxim. The tourism sector has not been an exception and it is now the tastes of the visitors that dictate the nature of the product or service, its variety and its range. As a result, this shift in literature and economic approaches has stimulated many countries to provide product diversification efforts such as specific tourism services in countries that are classical tourist destinations. Tunisia has not, unfortunately, taken into consideration these new economic approaches which are based on marketing strategies and the diversification of the proposed ranges. Indeed, it has continued investing in the low standardised range attracting only “poor” visitors spending little and being content with “natural” products (beach, sun, etc.) with low added value seasonally employed active population reluctant to become involved in providing better quality service. Similarly, despite the shy calls for and trials of a possible opening to an “alternative” or “cultural” or “ecological” tourism, attempts have remained reluctant. This crisis worsened with the harsh competition with Mediterranean destinations that have close if not similar characteristics as the Tunisian model. According to the UNWTO (World Tourism Organization) (2011), Tunisia is, first and foremost, in competition with the countries surrounding the Mediterranean, mainly Morocco and Turkey and, to a lesser extent, Egypt. Turkey is the leading tourism destination with 34.083 million international tourists, followed by Egypt (9.497 million) then Morocco (9.342 million). Tunisia ranks fourth with 4.785 million, thus showing a deficit of more than 2 million compared with that in 2009, preceding Algeria, the fifth destination with 2.395. Despite the opacity of strategic tourism choices, the political and economic authorities were aware of the need to review the implemented strategies and introduce changes that could diversify tourism and its products and improve their profitability. In this respect, the Tunisian Ministry of Tourism launched a study to diagnose the situation and propose the necessary solutions in 2009. Just when it started the implementation of the recommendations of this study, a political earthquake hit the country at the end of December 2010. Thus, socio-political and especially ideological tensions put Tunisia back to the starting point, aggravating the already critical situation in this vital sector for the country. Driven by the Islamist impulse that has dominated the Tunisian political scene, Tunisian tourism seems to want to convert into the “hallal” tourism in 2012–2013, in accordance with the precepts of the “correct” Islam according to the rudimentary point of view of the Islamists. This concept was developed in Tunisia relying on the Asian models such as Malaysia, Singapore and Turkey. Some Tunisian politicians have kept on feeding the idea that Arab-Muslim tourism is possible. As a result, several decisions issued by many officials at the top of the Tunisian state aimed at reconfiguring this sector. Having become a major issue of the overall development policy, religious pretexts tend to reign over the tourism sector and other closely tied fields such as the agri-food industry and wines. This tendency has generated odd paradoxes that risk driving this vital sector in the Tunisian economy to failure. The new leaders defend a tourism financed by an Arab-Muslim capital whereas the entrepreneurs holding this capital, coming mainly from the Gulf countries, have not shown any particular interest in a cultural tourism and remain attracted by a seaside and nocturnal tourism which is based on the distraction and entertainment. As far as the Gulf countries’ consumers are concerned, they do not consider Tunisia a privileged destination nor its “cultural” tourist products as first choice goods and services. It is rather the neighbouring Algerian and Libyan tourists who flock in large numbers in Tunisia during the summer season and even the winter. The second paradox that might be deduced here is that the last category forming nearly 40% of foreign visitors in 2009 has not shown any preference for this so-called cultural tourism, let alone the religious one. The desert, ksours, couscous, etc., can not play the role of a total escape for this category of visitors because such means do exist in abundance at home. Both of the Algerians and Libyans are attracted by seaside tourism as well as that related to health and therapy reasons. In this context of crisis, and aware of the need to revolutionise the tourism strategies of the Tunisian destination, we tried, through our study, to answer the following fundamental hypothesis: Hypothesis: cultural tourism might be the best way to attract Arab-Muslim tourists. As already stated, Tunisia is a tourist destination that is famous for its coastline and beaches. However, these resources, subject of various strategies over time, continue to face an increasing harsh competition with other more attractive seaside resorts like Egypt and Morocco. This situation has become more serious following the world subprime crisis, political uncertainty and security precariousness after the revolution. It was even worsened by the degradation of equipment and infrastructure. As a result, re-examining Tunisia’s products and target markets is now an absolute emergency. It is this problematic context that motivated us to elaborate the present study trying to examine the motivations of the Arab-Muslim tourists so as to allow us to overcome the shortcomings and develop this sector in order to overcome the difficult economic situation of our country. Our study, therefore, focused on the key motivations of Arab-Muslims vis-à-vis Tunisian tourism while highlighting its undeniable impact on the promise of return, and of course, on economic growth. Arab-Muslim tourists may be interested in a cultural tourism which consists in encouraging new modes of creativity that have become essential for economic growth in Tunisia. Undeniably, this country is rich in monuments, historical sites, traditions and folklore. These assets are found, for example, in the south and west of the country. Hence, one may wonder about the impact of the promotion of an alternative tourism on these inland areas disadvantaged by economic growth and marginal development. Given the importance of studies on the motivations of tourists in the planning of strategies targeting the promotion of cultural tourism, we tried to analyse, as a first step, the theoretical constructs of the visitors’ behaviour. Research on tourism, in general, and cultural tourism in particular, can not be achieved in a comprehensive way if the tourist behaviour is not seriously taken into account through the tourist motivations. Our study, then, identified the relevant factors that would stimulate Arab-Muslim tourists and have an effect on the promise of return based on a probit econometric model and from the analysis of one principle variable: “the motives of Arab-Muslim tourists”. The analysis of the results would allow us to draw some conclusions and propose some solutions helping us to modestly contribute to the restructuring of the Tunisian destination. The rest of this paper was organised as follows: In the second section, we suggested a review of the literature on tourism and its components. The third section was devoted to our empirical analysis and interpretations. The main conclusions were drawn in the final section.",

Literature implies that individuals make their business decisions mainly depending on the risk levels of each decision (Min and Cunha 2019), while managers and executive teams often fail when making strategic decisions due to the fact that these decisions are both complex and ill-structured (Carmeli et al. 2012). Actually, the decision makers in the manufacturing sector are usually confronted with the problem of making a decision through a wide range of alternative options (Venkata 2007). Taking into consideration the complexity and the risk of decision-making process, literature reveals several modeling approaches used in order to assess the risks and probabilities associated with decision processes (Lindley 2000: 293; Nutley and Davies 2000; Sarasin 1999). In this paper we study two literature approaches to decision making, namely, the evidence-based and the heuristics, and how these two approaches often bring conflict and resistance among the executives, managers, and employees. Literature refers to these methodologies identifying their positive and negative points and quite often to their comparison (Gigerenzer et al. 1999). What is identified as a literature gap is that in practice these two approaches are inseparable and are applied in parallel. According to Pachur and Forrer (2013), these two approaches can mutually interact towards a better understanding of contingent nature in decision making. Our article deals with this gap by providing a systems thinking approach to build an analytical framework, based on a case study company. Evidence-based decision making (EBDM) is a practice of making decisions which consolidates the most efficient available research evidence with the decision maker’s personal competences and the employee/customer’s preferences (Vishwanath and Farimah 2012). Rousseau (2012) considers evidence-based management as a process that demarcates principles from research data and translates them into practices that may help solving organizational issues and make decisions. Tranfield et al. (2003) consider EBDM as a switch from traditional narrative approaches to systematic evidence-sensitive procedures. This process aims at leading the decision-making practice to the direction of more effective outcomes for the organization (Sackett et al. 2000). The main focus on the EBDM is the form of the actual “evidence.” Regarding this specific matter, Sherman (2002) considers that evidence may be categorized according to a weak-to-strong scale, based on specific scientific rules. EBDM in the form of naturalistic decision making (NDM) describes how practitioners actually make decisions in complex domains such as organizational management or investment programs based on evidence (Shattuck and Miller 2006). According to Julnes and Holzer (2001) the process of EBDM requires at least two crucial approaches: the first one considers that evidence-based decision making should be embedded into the organization in such a way that may capitalize value and embrace evidence application over intuition in implementing organizational strategies. Such an approach allows individuals to make effective and timely decisions (LaValle et al. 2010). The second approach comprises a coordinated procedure of sequential evidence-based actions in which an organization clusters, processes, and uses evidence in the forms of data. If evidence is not collected, subsequently organizations are not capable of analyzing information in order to make proper decisions. Correspondingly, if evidence is not analyzed at a frequent and efficient way, employees and managers may be drifted towards incorrect decisions. Moreover, evidence in specific forms such as statistical formats has a significant impact on improving EBDM in terms of time required and accuracy of decisions (Arribas et al. 2014), but if the results of evidence analysis are not fully incorporated into decision making, it may lead to a severe loss of financial and organizational resources (Julnes and Holzer 2001). Finally, Rousseau (2018) further categorizes EBDM into three major decision processes, the “routine decisions” for clear cause-effect understanding, the “non-routine decisions” for complicated decisions for which their information is existent but not currently available to the decision maker, and the “truly novel decisions” which require critical but currently non-existent information. On the other side, heuristics are considered as general decision-making strategies based on limited information, which, however, are often proven to be correct (Shah and Oppenheimer 2008). Krabuanrat and Phelps (1998) characterize heuristics as procedures for taking decisions made by individuals or the organization in total, in the course of experience. When information gathering costs are high, individuals tend to rely on non-compensatory heuristics (Bröder and Schiffer 2006; Pachur and Forrer 2013). Amongst several key facets to understand knowledge management, heuristics may be considered the comprehension of specific values of space, time, and passion (Friedman and Prusak 2008). Moreover, Tversky and Kahneman (1974) consider three basic types of heuristics—representativeness, availability, and adjustment—as the core means to be applied at most heuristic-based decisions. Furthermore, representativeness heuristic can be considered as a “gambling” procedure that makes predictions, having as known prerequisites the functional form and the parameters of the underlying process (Krawczyk and Rachubik 2019). Walumbwa et al. (2014) view heuristics decision making (HDM), as a decision-making type seeking to maximize justification of the decision while minimizing cognitive effort. The core of HDM is that there is no optimal solution to problems, but heuristics may be used as “mental short cuts,” in order to make good enough decisions. Moreover, according to Eastwood et al. (2012) it is possible that individuals will be choosing heuristic approaches on occasions when a decision must be made directly and related information is difficult to obtain. Heuristics approaches deescalate the cognitive burden regarding decision making (Shah and Oppenheimer 2008), and they may be considered a primary source of competitive advantage (Krabuanrat and Phelps 1998). Gigerenzer (2001) assumes that HDM allows fast and frugal decisions that may be easily comprehended by most individuals and can be applied to new situations, specific types of problems, and particular environments. Moreover, Busenitz and Barney (1997) claim that in case of environmental uncertainty and complexity, heuristics can be an effective and efficient guide to decision-making, as well as that the use of heuristics has been found to be associated with innovativeness. Furthermore, the heuristics decision-making process includes views and capabilities of making decisions based on predictions, without taking plain cognitive data into consideration. Schuldt et al. (2017) mention that people performing analytical tasks must also be able to predict and express the possibility that their plans and estimates are correct and they will succeed. However, regarding heuristics known processes there is not an absolute factor theory that can fully explain the cognitive biases that a heuristics-based decision contains (Svenson et al. 2018). Literature review often refers to the comparison of these two decision-making methods. Evidence-based decision makers consider HDM as a tool useful for daily interactions where quick decisions are required under a limited set of data available (Gigerenzer et al. 1999). In fact, HDM operates as a mean to a prototypical representation of a decision, by creating a decision based on memory-bin representations from previous experiences rather than a decision based on the actual evidence of the current condition (Wyer and Srull 1986). Moreover, empirical literature has shown that heuristics are used only by a fraction of subjects and only in certain situations (Bröder and Schiffer 2006; Pachur et al. 2008). Furthermore, Martin and Moon (1992) proved in their experimental study that a “partial-knowledge” framework in the case of price distribution is a far more effective decision-making approach in comparison to a “no-knowledge” heuristics approach, emphasizing the significance of evidence at a medium level at least. Other authors consider HDM as a decision-making process that is not processing the information objectively (Hofmann 2015), while others emphasize that heuristics can transform and even deform decision (Weber 2019). Taking into consideration these arguments, it is significant to consider a mixed decision-making model that may combine the speed of HDM at specific managerial aspects that previous experience plays a crucial role, with an EBDM that may be applied at circumstances where detailed analysis of data and situations/procedures is required. Yilmaz et al. (2016) in their paper suggest also this combination, by examining evidence for design heuristics in the creation of multiple design concepts. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to demonstrate in practice the process of initiating a balanced decision-making approach, coupled approach between Heuristics and Evidence-Based Decision process, considering the different levels of hierarchy and resistance to change that are typical in a manufacturing firm. In order to switch from each one of the two different decision-making approaches to a balanced one, we study the process of change and how this is applied to a case company. The case company is a manufacturing company based in the Middle East, operating in diversified sectors within the healthcare industry.Footnote 1 The core operations of the firm are as a developer and producer of brand-generics; the Company’s mission is to enable quality healthcare for all people, through diversified and innovative contributions to the global healthcare industry. According to Buono and Kerber (2010), change capacity is the ability of a firm to change more than once, making change a canonical response to changes in the firm’s external environment while regarding firm’s change performance, that index may refer to multiple organizational aspects such as the level of attainment of the change objectives and catching deadlines (Raineri 2011). Relevant studies have indicated that organizations’ successfulness is directly related to organization’s change capability, regarding their change projects’ performance (Teece et al. 1997). According to the conventional change management literature, there are multiple alternative perspectives on resistance to change that may be applied to both evidence-based and heuristics decision making and appear on strategic, tactical, and operational level. Piderit (2000) considers change a multi-dimensional concept, which implies that the bisection of being for or against change is too simplistic to actually reflect the complicated reality of employee’s responses to change challenges at all levels. Taking all the above concepts into consideration, the contribution of our research is two-fold. First, we contribute to a literature discussion concerning the importance of linking the two decision-making methods, HDM and EBDM, in order to create a new approach, a balanced evidence-based and heuristics decision making (coupled approach between Heuristics and Evidence Decision—named HeED), that would cover the disadvantages of each method when applied separately. Second in order to do so, we provide a qualitative analysis of the holistic modeling approach to the balanced decision-making concept, in order to reveal the resistance that the authority will experience during the transition and propose actions to defuse that resistance. The modeling approach is based on the system dynamics (SD) theory and constitutes a tool for the analysis of relations between the stages of change. This framework is constructed by taking an experimental approach, observing and debating the operations and proposed changes in a case firm, namely, here as MiddlePharma, which faces issues in its supply chain, manifesting in the form of sales loss, high inventory, cash flow shortages, and tensions with their clients.",2

Internationalization is one of the methods to respond to globalization and increases competitiveness, but is expected to continue to respect the individuality of the nation (de Wit 2018). The implementation of internationalization of higher education for developing countries is more oriented towards cultural and academic goals, namely, improving quality and solving problems associated with the lack of demand for quality education (Knight 2007). The aim of developing countries in carrying out internationalization is in line with the internationalization policy in Indonesia as contained in the Long-Term Higher Education Strategy. In the 2010–2014 National Education Strategic Plan and the 2015–2019 Strategic Plan of the Ministry of Research, Technology and Higher Education, it was stated that the higher education internationalization was seen as a method to improve national competitiveness as measured by international university ranking as one of the guidelines for evaluating higher education performance. Every university is expected to participate in higher education internationalization. The low number of international scientific publications, the number of patents and other intellectual properties, and the high unemployment rate are some indications of low quality and relevance. The advantages of internationalization are as follows: increased recognition of institutions, entering new competitive markets; increasing networks of research collaboration at the international level; providing experience to students in entering the global market; building bridges in obtaining international accreditation; increasing staff capability in developing their skills, knowledge, and fields of expertise; and equipping graduates to enter and compete in the global and labor market in the broadest sense (Dixon et al. 2013). Several of studies found that in developed countries, for example, the USA, Britain, Australia, and Canada that have high internationalization universities, they tend to have the following characteristics: (a) variations in sources of income, (b) high annual income turnover, (c) making a stronger contribution to local and regional economic development, (d) having a diverse workforce, and (e) attracting many foreign staff and student interests (Dixon et al. 2013). Universities struggle with the integration of home and foreign students in and outside this international classroom due to stereotyping, lack of knowledge about the background of culturally different classmates, language issues, and the desire to stay in one’s cultural group (Harrison and Peacock 2010; Montgomery 2009). Santos-Vijande et al. (2012) showed that knowledge management is managing and getting the right information quickly and stated that knowledge is the best source of sustainable competitive advantage (SCA), but the result of their study showed a weak relationship between knowledge management and SCA. Therefore, this study needs to be done to overcome the weaknesses of this relationship and lack of knowledge about the background of culturally different classmates by adding management behavior as a mediating variable in the relationship of knowledge with the internationalization strategy which is an effort to increase competitive advantage in higher education.",8
12.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,28 September 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-020-00693-7,Sustainability Reporting and Firms’ Economic Performance: Evidence from Asia and Africa,December 2021,Alicia Girón,Amirreza Kazemikhasragh,Eva Panetti,Female,Unknown,Female,Female,"During the years, sustainability reporting has established itself as a key instrument capable of helping companies and organizations to satisfy the growing demand for transparency from customers, investors, other stakeholders, and from the society in general (Martínez et al. 2016). Through sustainability reports, companies disclose voluntary information about the economic, environmental and social impacts produced by their activities. This allows companies to reduce information asymmetries and increase transparency on their—positive or negative—sustainability performance (Nobanee and Ellili 2016). Moreover, this increased transparency provides investors with the possibility to make more appropriate valuations and to better orient their investment towards companies with a more positive impact. This translates into better competitive positions (Fracarolli Nunes and Lee Park, 2017) and greater advantages on the market (Milne and Gray, 2013) for companies that, by demonstrating their social commitment, responsibility and sustainability in behaviour, manage to obtain the legitimacy and the social acceptance they need to be successful (Hahn and Kühnen 2013; Scherer et al. 2013; Martínez et al. 2016). In light of this, companies and organizations are increasingly paying attention to sustainability issues, and in applying more sustainable business models (Morioka et al. 2017) and new strategies for reporting (Clark et al. 2015). Among the major providers of sustainability reporting guidance,Footnote 1 the Global Reporting Initiative’s (GRI’s) Sustainability Reporting Standards are the most adopted frameworks for voluntary reporting worldwide (Brown et al. 2009b). In 2018, the GRI together with the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) gave life to a collaborative initiative aimed at empowering corporate actions towards achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs have been introduced in 2015 by the United Nations Procurement Division (UNDP) as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development the aim of which is to provide as a framework for institutions and organizations to work towards a more sustainable world (United Nations General Assembly 2015). They consist of a set of 17 global goals structured into 169 ambitious targets to be reached by 2030. The initiative mentioned above has enabled companies to incorporate SDGs into their existing business and reporting processes. Business reporting on the SDGs integrates the GRI Standards and the UN Global Compact Communication on Progress (Global Reporting Initiative 2018). Contributing to the achievement of the SDGs is crucial for companies to achieve sustainable development goals in different areas (Kuzey and Uyar 2017; Moldavska and Welo 2019), and succeed in the short and long term (Agarwal et al. 2017). The KPMG (2017) survey based on corporate responsibility (CR) and sustainability reporting from 4900 companies in 49 countries and regions reveals that reporting on SDGs has increased considerably worldwide since their launch. Of the 3543 N100 companies and 233 G250 companiesFootnote 2 that report on CR, a large part of the two groups (39% and 43%, respectively) made a connection between the company’s sustainability reporting and the SDGs. The integration of SDGs in business reports allows companies to show their commitment to addressing global issues related to sustainable development such as poverty, environmental degradation, climatic changes and discrimination (Adams 2017). Given the increasing concern for the global environmental issues and the relating need for preservation of the ecosystem, sustainability reporting has become more and more important, to both developed and developing economies, sparking the interest of the literature (Hahn and Kühnen 2013). Consequently, an increasing number of scholars has started to analyse the factors influencing the adoption of new sustainability methods in business reporting (Bear et al. 2010; Da Silva Monteiro and Aibar-Guzmán 2010; Gallo and Christensen 2011; Gamerschlag et al. 2011; Arayssi et al. 2016; Ben-Amar et al. 2017; Anazonwu et al. 2018; Dissanayake et al. 2019). Prior studies also have analysed the adoption of external assurance of sustainability reporting in order to increase the transparency of the sustainability information disclosed and enhance stakeholders’ confidence (Kolk and Perego 2010; Moroney et al. 2012; Junior et al. 2014; Peters and Romi 2015). Most of these studies provide empirical evidence on the role played by external assurance—made by professional accountants–—in enhancing the credibility of sustainability reports (Park and Brorson 2005; Pflugrath et al. 2011). Some authors have examined the relationship between firms’ characteristics and the adoption of external assurance, finding that some factors, such as the firm size, the ownership structure, the industrial affiliation, board composition, and so on, play a determinant role in the adoption of external assurance of sustainability reporting (Haddock-Fraser and Fraser 2008; Lourenço and Branco 2013; Sierra et al. 2013; Branco et al. 2014; Amran et al. 2014; Shamil et al. 2014; De Beelde and Tuybens 2015). Finally, a limited number of existing studies have analysed the sustainability reporting and its impact on firm performance (Ameer and Othman 2012; Bachoo et al. 2013), and evaluation (Lo and Sheu 2007; Schadewitz and Niskala 2010; Berthelot et al. 2012). However, much of the literature on sustainability reporting mainly focuses on the quality of the different institutional environments and the pressure exerted by stakeholders on companies (Michelon and Parbonetti 2012; Klettner et al. 2014). Consequently, the influence of organizational factors, such as the organizations’ internal structure, decision-making, performance, or governance structure, is often overlooked and needs to be dealt with more comprehensively (Hahn and Kühnen 2013; Sarbah and Xiao 2015). Moreover, prior studies have principally focused on developed countries (especially on Europe and the USA) (Lo and Sheu 2007; Berthelot et al. 2012) leaving the topic partly unexplored in relation to developing countries (Kuzey and Uyar 2017). The contribution of this research is threefold. Firstly, this study extends the literature on sustainability reporting in the emerging market context by examining the influence of company characteristics on the adoption of new sustainability reporting practices (i.e., SDG reporting). Additionally, it addresses the question of how the gender and age diversity of board resources affects the adoption of the external assurance of sustainability reporting, providing suggestions for further research in the field of assurance of sustainability reporting. Secondly, this study contributes to the existing literature on the relationship between sustainability reporting and firms’ economic performance providing evidence from large companies in the low- and middle-income countries in Asia and Africa. Finally, through its empirical findings, this study provides statistical and economical validity to the 2018 joint initiative of the GRI and the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) aimed at empowering corporate actions towards achieving the United Nations SDGs. The study employs two logit models and one regression model based on a sample of 366 large Asian and African companies which have addressed the SDGs in their sustainability reports published in 2017. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the theoretical background on sustainability reporting. Section 3 presents the research setting, data and analysis. Section 4 examines the results of our analyses. Section 5 concludes and discusses the implications of our findings.",32

For instance, the discovery of electrical induction through the movement of an iron piece in a magnetic core became the foundation of the industrial revolution and opened new dimensions for the world to grow. It thus achieved new horizons of industrializations, solved issues of mass production, and negated the issue of readily available cheap labor. Sir Francis Bacon said that knowledge is one of the ultimately prevailing intangible assets for any organization (Land 2009). Essentially knowledge can be classified into two prime forms viz. explicit and implicit knowledge (Agrawal and Mukti 2020). Explicit knowledge is knowledge that can be articulated, structured, and documented. It can be simple to understand and can be recognized effortlessly. Patents are an ideal example of explicit knowledge. Implicit knowledge, also known as tacit knowledge, is the other form of knowledge that resides in the human subconscious mind and it is gained from experience, observations, beliefs, and mental models. Tacit knowledge is neither present in a systematic way nor visible and is difficult to understand. It is transferred only through conversation and/or narration. Tacit knowledge has the potential to improve the productivity of an organization (Woods 2016). Afterthought, the management of both the tacit and explicit knowledge is known as knowledge management. KM can be defined as the management tool that can be used to promote and use an integrated approach to identifying, acquiring, evaluating, retrieving, sharing, and using all of an organizational knowledge asset (Agrawal and Mukti 2019). These assets are experimental experiences, policies, procedures, documents, past un-captured expertise, databases, etc. (Lecerf and Omrani 2019). These intangible assets are important which play a key role in the success of an organization and it is the main concern of the management of any organization. Nowadays, the competitive environment of business has been characterized by becoming more strategic and dynamic (Animesh Agrawal 2019). As a result, organizations must take care of intangible knowledge assets (Daňa et al. 2018). To obtain sustainable economic competitiveness over a long period of time, it is necessary to adopt the effective use of KM processes through which a proper knowledge-based economy can be used (Oksana 2018). In recent times, KM is gaining attention in manufacturing-based organizations as a tool for improving innovation and shop floor production (Muniz et al. 2010). Bennett (2014) has found that the future of the manufacturing sector would be more strategic and dynamic (Bennett 2014). KM is considered a new management tool to facilitate innovation-based activity and shop floor manufacturing (Uma Mageswari et al. 2017). To get manufacturing brilliance and to fight the competitive environment, the manufacturing industry will struggle for efficiency and productivity (Uma Mageswari et al. 2017). As a result, organizations need to take care of intelligent resource, i.e., knowledge assets to get competitive advantages. In this context, the manufacturing advantages of the organization is determined to a great extent by the use of technological approach, i.e., the use of information communication technologies (ICTs), which helps to create value and ICT-based infrastructure provides a broad platform for exchanging data, coordinating activities, and sharing information within the organization (Margijlaj and Bello 2002; Uma Mageswari et al. 2017). Information communication technology (ICT) was first developed by the Natural Resources, Energy and Science Authority of Sri Lanka (NARESA) (Ravindra 2011). After the introduction of ICT, IBM has also developed ICT in-house to redefine the strengths of their business consulting. Accenture as well as McKinsey have also developed ICT to fulfill the requirements of their clients (Barrett et al. 2006). ICT not only accelerates the economic and social development but also improves the delivery of public services, transparent and accountable governmental activities, augmenting public participation, facilitating and sharing of information through proper knowledge-sharing activities among the people, and unifying marginalized groups and deprived regions. According to (Adeola and Evans 2020) “ICT enables multiple distribution channels, especially targeting niche markets that were once almost impossible to identify, reach, or serve.” Implementation of ICT within a firm improves its efficiency and is capable of maintaining the business competitive advantages (Iniesta-Bonillo et al. 2013). Not only this, but ICT is also capable of maintaining the customer firm relationship and improving the satisfaction level of the customers as well, improvising their commitment, preference, and loyalty towards the firm. Different authors have investigated the influence of ICT in different fields and discussed its applications like the education sector (Iniesta-Bonillo et al. 2013), economic growth (Niebel 2018), improvement in the sustainable information society (Ziemba 2019), agricultural field (Aldosari et al. 2019), innovation in SMEs (Idota et al. 2020), etc. To improvise the success rate of KM, it has been integrated with various management practices like human resource management (HRM) (Andreeva and Kianto 2012; Scarbrough 2003), customer relationship management (CRM) (Gebert et al. 2003; Liew 2008), innovation practices (Donate and de Pablo 2015; Modi and Rawani 2020), green management (Abbas and Sağsan 2019), supply chain management (SCM) (Daghfous and Zoubi 2017), and information communication technology (ICT) (Hendriks 2001). Literature supports that ICT might be the best useable tool for knowledge-sharing activity within or even outside of the firms. Different authors have proposed many frameworks to enhance the capability of KM by implementing ICT within the firm, which has been discussed later in the “Literature Review” section. The formation of objectives is based on the following research queries raised after a rigorous literature review. The primary research queries for this study are “what are the success factors of ICT for effective KM processes?” and “how can ICT be used effectively for improvising the success of KM?” Being specific, this research includes two sets of subsidiary questions from the perspectives of: Evaluation of success factors of ICT for effective KM processes and Framework/strategy/ model to increase the success of KM using ICT in the steel industry. From the review of previous literature, it can be deduced that literature is available rarely in the context of steel industries, showing a comprehensive list of success factors of ICT. So, it is enlightening to extend the research and identify the success factors of ICT for effective KM processes in the context of steel industries. Consequently, it can also be deduced that no literature has evaluated the impact of ICT to improve the success of KM. However, a handful number of literatures have shown the relationship between ICT and KM. From the rigorous literature review, it can also be emphasized that no earlier article has presented any model/framework/strategy to maximize the success of KM using ICT in the steel industry. This research study focuses on the following objectives to minimize these gaps: To evaluate the impact of ICT to improve the success of KM. To identify the success factors of ICT to ensure the success of KM implementation. To prepare a framework/strategy to maximize the success of KM using ICT in the steel industry.",9

12.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,30 September 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-020-00690-w,Measuring the Contribution of the “Knowledge Economy” to the Economic Growth Rate: Comparative Analysis,December 2021,Oleg Sukharev,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Modern education operates in a new reality that is often referred to as the “knowledge economy” (Weber 2011; Saviotti et al. 2016), and this reality covers not only education but also other economic activities. Emerging new knowledge affects the emergence of innovation and economic growth. The conceptual basis of this study consists of numerous scientific papers in the field of “knowledge economy,” but at the same time, they do not solve the question of measuring the contribution of the knowledge economy to the overall economic dynamics, including the comparative aspect by country. This statement is important because the knowledge economy develops in different ways and contributes to economic dynamics, thereby determining the difference in competitive advantages between countries. Let us list some recent works, highlighting the most significant areas in the application of research efforts. In the modern world, there is a transition from the standard concept of the knowledge economy, where knowledge is generated within and for production, to the concept of knowledge generated in the service sector and the creative industry (Švarc and Dabić 2017). In this study, we assume that there are activities that create, distribute, and use new knowledge; that is, we will consider the knowledge covered by both of these concepts. It should be noted that the question of measuring the knowledge economy and assessing its contribution to the overall economic dynamics remains open, since the existing approaches are either reduced to knowledge management tasks (Yu and Yang 2018), consider micro-level tasks, or are related to the assessment of the impact of knowledge on the functioning of firms or other agents of the economy. In particular, comparative studies on countries are conducted from this perspective. In particular, research on the production and use of knowledge, as well as numerous studies on the impact of information and the functioning of information systems (Du and Dai 2018; Cram et al. 2016), usually address the microeconomic level (Al-Emran et al. 2018), for example, information security (Flowerday and Tuyikeze 2016) or patent production, which is influenced by the level of scientific training and collaboration (Acosta et al. 2020). Most of the research has a general focus on information or knowledge management (Kianto et al. 2017; Breznik 2018; Costa et al. 2016) or its expert application (Temel and Karimov 2019). However, macroeconomic assessments of the impact of the “knowledge economy” on economic growth, together with questions of knowledge management at firms and corporations, or their impact on innovation and productivity (Shujahat et al. 2019), are of high significance in terms of developing enabling policies and measuring the impact of institutional reforms on the transformation of education and science as the two driving engines of the “knowledge economy.” In addition, there are researches on elucidating the informational circumstances of growth, linking information about the environment with growth by evolutionary equations (Hilbert 2016). The possibility of such modeling is the result of accumulated knowledge, including in the field of methods for modeling various scenario situations. It should be noted that according to the literature, structural and empirical studies with macroeconomic consequences are less extensive, especially those related to the assessment of the impact of the “knowledge economy” on economic dynamics. Here, the method of measuring the “knowledge economy” as an aggregated sector, as well as a more or less accurate assessment of the contribution of this sector to the growth rate, is crucial. Both tasks have a self-sufficient significance and constitute the purpose of the research of this article. Moreover, the search for a solution is directed to the practical assessment of the “knowledge economy” based on the Eurostat methodology, with the identification of its other capabilities and author’s proposals, as well as the assessment of the contribution to the growth rate according to the author’s proposed method. The knowledge economy has its own characteristics in each country and contributes to the pace of economic development. This research is devoted to the solution of this problem—measuring the size and contribution to the growth rate of the knowledge economy, as well as the impact of institutional reforms in education as a factor in changing the knowledge economy. Characteristics of quantitate changes in the education system as a system-forming industry are given by institutional reforms that are in the initial stage and that are not too late to adjust in order to improve the effectiveness of education. The purpose of the study is to determine the scale of the “knowledge economy” in a comparative aspect for the European Union’s countries and to determine the contribution of the aggregated sector to the country’s economic growth rate. In addition, the final section of the study is devoted to the analysis of current institutional changes in education as the central activity of the knowledge economy. Let us compare the size of the knowledge economy for the European Union, its individual countries Germany and Spain (selected at random) and Russia, and conduct a comparative analysis of the contribution of the knowledge economy to the growth rate of countries. For this purpose, we will perform the necessary calculations according to the structural formula for assessing the contribution of the knowledge economy to the growth rate, using the method of paired correlations, and perform a comparative analysis of the contribution to the growth rate of the knowledge economy for these countries. The theoretical basis of the study is a structural analysis of economic growth, which allows to expand the possibilities of assessing the knowledge economy as a sector, which is carried out by Eurostat, due to the author’s methodology for such an assessment. In addition, the methodology allows us to measure the contribution of the “knowledge economy” to the growth rate, thereby creating a basis for comparative research on the development of the knowledge economy in different countries. This statement of the problem is relevant, since it allows us to identify, in addition to the scale of the “knowledge economy” as a sector, the conditions for its development and the impact on the economy as a whole, including dynamics. This is useful in determining the prospects for the “knowledge economy” and evaluating institutional changes in science and education aimed at improving the quality of these activities.",6
12.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,01 October 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-020-00689-3,The Impact of ICT Development on Health Outcomes in Africa: Does Economic Freedom Matter?,December 2021,Jeffrey Kouton,Rafiou R. Bétila,Moïse Lawin,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The importance and role of health in development are recognized at all levels of strategic decision-making, notably successively by the millennium development goals (goals 4, 5, and 6Footnote 1) and then by the sustainable development goals (goal 3: good health and well-being). According to the United Nations, the objective of promoting good health and well-being is to “enable people to lead healthy lives and promote the well-being of all people at all ages” in order to build a prosperous society. A prosperous society would then be the result of the efforts of an effective and efficient health sector leading to high life expectancy, reduced infant, maternal, and neonatal mortality rates, etc. In Africa in particular, the health sector faces multiple constraints and challenges, including human resource constraints, inefficient health spending, investment in expensive health systems, and low technology use (Shekar and Otto 2014). Indeed, according to Shekar and Otto (2014), while African countries spend and invest a lot on health services delivery, about 20 to 40% of healthcare resources are wasted due to inefficiency (WHO 2010). However, the absence of an efficient health system does not allow for the achievement of expected health outcomes. The lack of efficiency faced by the African health system is related to technical efficiency (high health outcomes obtained from a given level of inputs (means or resources)), economic efficiency (minimizing the costs of inputs to achieve a given level of health outcomes), and allocative efficiency (combining health programs to achieve a high level of health of the population) (CABRIFootnote 2, 2016). To this could be added, a lack of equipment and health personnel, the low level of the rate of services as well as the low accessibility of health services to patients due to financial constraints (Shekar and Otto 2014). Despite these constraints, Africa has seen improvements in health outcomes such as life expectancy at birth, maternal mortality, and under-five mortality. For instance, maternal mortality declined from 385 per 100,000 women in 1990 to 216 per 100,000 women in 2015 who died during pregnancy and childbirth. The under-five mortality rate has also shown a downward trend. From 93% in 1990, the rate fell to 41% in 2015, reflecting the fact that an increasing number of children are living beyond their fifth (5th) birthday. Life expectancy at birth in Africa has been on an upward trend, rising from an average of 50 years between 1996 and 2000 to an average of 58 years between 2011 and 2014. While these data show an improvement in health in Africa over the years, maternal and under-five mortality remain high and life expectancy at birth low compared to other continents. Indeed, according to the WHO (2019), the statistics on life expectancy given on average for each region of the world are as follows: Africa (61.2 years), America (76.8 years), Asia (69.5 years), Europe (77.5 years), Eastern Mediterranean (69.1 years), and Western Pacific (76.9 years). Those related to maternal mortality per 100,000 live births are as follows: Africa (542), America (52), Asia (164), Europe (16), Eastern Mediterranean (166), and Western Pacific (41). With regard to under-five mortality, the statistics per 1,000 live births by region are as follows: Africa (74), America (14), Asia (36), Europe (9), Eastern Mediterranean (50), and Western Pacific (13). African countries are continually seeking strategies that can improve the health status of the population. We can mention the free or partially subsidized Cesarean section (Dumont 2015) adopted by several African countries (Senegal, Mali, Niger, Burkina-Faso, etc.) as a strategy to contribute to reducing maternal and neonatal mortality; the promotion of universal health coverage to enable the population to have access to health care by subscribing to health insurance at a low and affordable cost; free vaccinations for newborns and the provision of impregnated mosquito nets to pregnant women to ensure that they remain in good health; training of health care providers, etc. In Burkina-Faso for instance, a strategy to reduce maternal mortality in rural areas has been, for example, the decentralization of the provision of emergency obstetric health care (Kaboré et al. 2017). This strategy addressed the shortage of midwives in the health district of Tougan and consisted in managing obstetric complications in rural health centers. The absence of midwives in the case of obstetric complications is a factor in maternal death. In the Central African Republic for example, a set of complementary strategies aimed at reducing maternal mortality: strengthening human resources (itinerant agents, matrons) through training, setting up incentives for managers to work in the provinces, increasing the number of health facilities by the State, raising awareness in the community to lead it to set up mutual insurance companies, and intensification of the technical and financial partnership with development partners. Overall, all these strategies, to name but a few, have not led to sustained and rapid improvements in health outcomes on the continent. It is therefore natural to seek out the reasons. Kpolovie et al. (2016) identify poverty as one of the main reasons against a successful health improvement strategy, as ensuring good health has a cost. Kpolovie and Obilor (2013) highlight the decline in investment in health care due to funding problems as well as an increase in infectious diseases. Poverty prevents households to sufficiently investing in health care. These reasons are compounded by the lack of access to clean water and sanitation, poor lifestyle, increase in non-communicable diseases, illiteracy, etc. Other strategies such as the application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) are being explored but still fully unexploited. The potential for ICT penetration in Africa is high, while ICTs are already well established in developed economies (Shekar and Otto 2014; Pénard et al. 2012). Shekar and Otto (2014) argue that harnessing ICTs in the health sector in Africa could contribute to efficient health spending, enable health system reform, and enable the most remote areas (rural areas) to have access to health care. Some examples of strategies for using ICTs to improve the health of the population in some African countries can be cited: radio technology in Uganda to reduce mortality rates (Musoke 2002), birth notification through SMS in Bangladesh to reduce out-of-hospital deliveries (Bordé et al. 2009), reduction of missed clinic appointments among pregnant women through mobile phone use in Kenya (Fedha 2014), a remarkable rate of patient participation in HIV testing, and improved health status in rural Swaziland through mobile phone use (Kliner et al. 2013). To this can be added: (i) e-learning that would enable remote areas to acquire expertise in the delivery of inaccessible care; (ii) the use of mobile health applications to collect and monitor data. These applications have the capacity to monitor health indicators in real time, thus enabling policy makers and health workers respectively to decide on possible challenges and better administer care to their patients; and (iii) the use of mobile health applications to reduce stock shortages and enable an efficient and confident health system. The application of ICTs in the health sector in Africa, however, faces several challenges, among which the lack of inclusive access to and frequent use of ICTs in the health sector, insufficient ICT infrastructure, and the limited involvement of private sector in healthcare in generalFootnote 3 and poor access to a quality internet connectionFootnote 4. It is becoming clear that achievement of good health is not reliant on the health sector alone but also pertains to the mediation of environmental, social, infrastructural, and regulatory systems. According to the World Development Report 2016 (World Bank 2016), in order for countries to increase the benefits of digital technology, to reduce the digital divide, and to strengthen economic development, it is necessary to focus on good institutions, adapt people’s skills to the digital economy, and strengthen regulations, including a secure business environment. Indeed, economic freedom can be used as a proxy of institutional quality (Elert and Halvarsson 2012; Yildrim and Gökalp 2016 among others) and has five main principles: the rule of law, the size of government (constitutionally limited government), the effectiveness of regulation including property rights, sound money supply, and the openness of markets, all of which are institutionally related. This points out the importance of economic freedom as essential for ICT penetration, particularly in Africa. In addition, digital technologies promote socioeconomic development through three main channels: inclusion (reducing the cost of access to information, availability of transparent information), efficiency (increasing coordination and automation of tasks), and innovation (platforms and increasing returns to scale). These three channels are described in more detail as follows. Inclusion as a result of digital technologies is possible through trade, access to the technology market, and employment opportunities. Efficiency is possible through better use of capital, labor productivity, and public sector capacity. Innovation is linked to competition, consumer welfare, and the voice of government (World Bank 2016). The relationship between the health sector and ICT development fits within these three mechanisms, while showing the prospect of introducing economic freedom as a driving factor in fostering this relationship. We hypothesize that if the institutional environment is conducive to the diffusionFootnote 5 of ICTs and if, in addition, individuals are able to make good decisions for themselves (it should be recalled that in a free environment where individuals can make decisions themselves, meaning economic freedom), then it would be reasonable to assume that economic freedom could play a role in the relationship between ICT development and health. According to Gwartney et al. (2017), economic freedom is related to the degree of “personal choice, voluntary exchange, freedom to enter markets, and compete and security of the person and privately owned property.” Furthermore, economic freedom is perceived as a condition of achieving fundamental rights such as the right to health and to protection of health. Therefore, in this study, we focus on the interest of African countries in promoting economic freedom and ICT development for improved health outcomes. Data from the Fraser Institute show that Africa is the continent with the lowest index of economic freedom compared to other continents. According to Miller et al. (2020), the Economic Freedom Index statistics across world regions on average are as follows: America (60.0), Asia-Pacific (61.1), Europe (69.8), Middle East/North Africa (61.8), and Sub-Saharan Africa (55.1) (see Figs. 4 and 5 in the Appendix for an overview and trends of the Index of Economic freedom the Heritage Foundation). The questions that emerge from the previous observations are as follows: (i) Could economic freedom play a role in the diffusion of ICTs in Africa? (ii) Does ICT development and economic freedom influence health outcomes in Africa? (iii) Does economic freedom play a role in promoting the link between ICT development and health in Africa? The overall objective of this study is therefore to investigate the extent to which economic freedom affects the effect of ICT development on health outcomes in Africa. More specifically, the paper aims at (i) studying the existence of causality between economic freedom and ICT development in Africa, (ii) analyzing the impacts of economic freedom and ICT development on health outcomes, and (iii) examining the impact of the complementarity between economic freedom and ICT development on health outcomes. The existing literature has scrutinized the link between economic freedom and health as well as the link between ICT development and health. The trend in the results is that ICTs have a positive effect on life expectancy at birth (Mithas et al. 2009; Wu and Raghupathi 2012; Raghupathi and Raghupathi 2013; Majeed and Khan 2019) and a negative effect on maternal and infant mortality (Musoke 2002; Irawan and Koesoema 2015; Ahangama and Poo 2012; Majeed and Khan 2019). In addition, economic freedom would significantly increase life expectancy (Lawson et al. 2016; Novignon et al. 2018; Owen and Wu 2007; and Razmi 2012) and significantly reduce infant mortality (Novignon et al. 2018; Owen and Wu 2007; Haduk 2014; Levine and Rothman 2006; Olper et al. 2014). These empirical results highlight the importance of economic policy measures aimed at achieving economic freedom in countries in order to reap its health benefits. However, according to Hall et al. (2018), the exact relationship between economic freedom and health status cannot be predetermined. Indeed, beyond the positive effects of economic freedom on health identified by several studies, it is possible to identify a negative effect of economic freedom on health. This is confirmed by Ruhm (2000), who finds that high unemployment is associated with low mortality. The explanation is that if more economic freedom leads to positive economic benefits, then it is possible to envisage that economic freedom reduces health outcomes when economic conditions deteriorate. It is therefore important to conduct an empirical study to assess this relationship in African countries. There are limited studies that have analyzed the impact of ICT development and economic freedom on health outcomes for the specific case of Africa. In addition to filling this gap, this study contributes to the literature by being the first study exclusively designed to examine the role of economic freedom in the relationship between ICT development and health in Africa, thus providing a unified empirical framework for the analysis. Such an approach where economic freedom is used as a policy variable in the effect of ICTs on health is not considered in previous existing studies. The study also examines the role of economic freedom in technology diffusion in Africa. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such an analysis is conducted at the macro level using panel data for Africa. This paper proposes a new approach that could be explored by African countries to promote better health outcomes. The study highlights the health gains from the development of ICTs and a policy that values economic freedom. The paper is built on a strong theoretical basis not only for the ICT-health nexus but also for the relationship between ICT, economic freedom, and health at the same time. This study considers a panel of 35 African countries over the period 2000 to 2016 and applies the Dumitrescu and Hurlin’s (2012) panel causality test and the system Generalized Moments Method in a dynamic modeling framework. The study takes a restricted outlook and focuses on under-five mortality as a measure of health outcomes, uses the Index of Economic Freedom of the Heritage Foundation, and constructs an ICT Development Index. This study has three findings. First, we find that positive changes in economic freedom lead to ICT diffusion, but that the mechanism generating this diffusion effect dissipates beyond two consecutive years. Second, evidence is provided that the complementary between economic freedom and ICT development improves health outcomes by reducing under-five mortality. Third, economic freedom matters in the relationship between ICT development and health outcomes by playing a critical role in enhancing ICT diffusion which in turn reduces under-five mortality. The rest of the paper is structured in five (5) main sections. The first is devoted to the conceptual framework related to the theme of the study and the second to the literature review.

Therefore, the innovation level can be defined as a synthetic set of innovation activities carried out by businesses. This enables to distinguish the most innovative companies from the less innovative ones (Xing et al. 2020). However, the implementation of an innovation strategy is a very difficult exercise. Consequently, controlling investment projects in innovation is complex since it generally consists in investing in specific assets that raise assessment problems. The information at the disposal of companies and capital providers (in particular creditors) on innovative investment projects is not the same. In this regard, fund providers are subject to information asymmetry and managerial opportunism problems. Similarly, the funding of innovative projects is in its turn subject to various studies. The low concentration of external funding of innovative companies is explained by factors referring to the specificity of these projects (Jensen 2004). In this regard, during the funding process, investment in innovation is subject to scrutiny by some institutional investors and bankers (Hoskisson et al. 2002; Rossi et al. 2015). In this context, the high degree of specificity of assets makes the assessment of these investments for the bank more difficult, which implies that knowledge and information asymmetries persist between the bank and the project owner (Jensen 2004). This conflict resolution goes through a better redistribution of information provided by the financial market. In fact, information disclosure regarding the company’s innovation activities is a signal for the alignment of the managers’ interests of with the shareholders’ (Garcia-Meca et al. 2005). The choice of voluntary communication on innovation projects that can take the form of intangible investments (expenses of research and development, acquisition of patents and licenses, training) makes the shareholders benefit from a source of information the interpretation of which helps understand the policy conducted by the leaders and contribute to the reduction of conflicts of interest (Charreaux 1991; Francis and Smith 1995; Gunardi et al. 2016). The promotion of innovation through communication speeds up the creation of the company’s share value (Lev and Sougiannis 1999; Rokhmawati et al. 2017). However, the development and the consolidation of the knowledge capital and the innovation activities could be affected by the leaders’ motivations to reduce investment spending and maximize the current profits (Garcia-Meca et al. 2005). Similarly, in the context of the delegated authority he has earned, the leader can use his hierarchical authority to obtain inaccurate information that will enable him to have stronger roots. Such a defensive strategy would probably be more difficult to be undertaken if the assessment of some risks or economic complex and unusual events did not require an assessment and interpretation effort, which leaves an important place for subjectivity. Manipulation can be developed when the accounting for technological activities is hardly measured. As a result, the company can face a controversy during the launch of these activities. Even a voluntary disclosure of information on these projects may be useless due to the managerial latitude enjoyed by the leader. Empirical research studies in this field agree to highlight the difficulty of firms to measure their level of innovation. Moreover, establishing a relationship between the results of innovation and the company’s performance turns out to be difficult to understand. These measurement problems would also add to the specific characteristics of these investments in innovation which are often at high risk, the increased uncertainty and a source of conflict of interest (Jensen 2004). The empirical results found regarding the impact of innovation on the firms’ performance are mixed. Guo et al. (2005) showed that there is a positive relationship between a firm’s innovation and its performance. Conversely, Vermeulen et al. (2005) found a negative relationship between these two identified elements. More specifically, the present paper intends to answer the following question: what are innovation activities have a positive effect on the firm’s financial performance? The objective behind this research is to study the impact of innovation activities on the financial performance of Tunisian companies. Once again, it should be pointed out that distrust leads us to report that the study of these questions could become more complicated with the introduction of a few control variables like sector specific belonging, the companies’ listing, their size, indebtedness ratio, ownership concentration, and the variable of the information disclosure on the launch of innovations. The empirical research field is Tunisia. In fact, it is an example of a developing country that has been involved in an important national program since 1995 of upgrading companies to help them cope with international competition. This national program is also meant to restructure Tunisian companies by encouraging them to invest in intangible investment so as to stimulate innovation which leads to a sustainable competitive advantage. Besides, establishing a scientific research and technological innovation system helped the sector development after the enactment of new legal texts and the creation of structures made up of competent human resources capable of meeting the specific requirements of high-performing search (MRSTDC 2006). Moreover, the Tunisian average public spending on research and development in relation to GDP (0.78%) exceeds the European average public spending in relation to GDP (0.69%). This shows the great importance attached by Tunisia to improve its technological position. For this reason, this article is written as follows. The next panel will develop the conceptual framework in order to identify the central hypothesis. The third section sets out the used research methodology. The presentation and discussions of the results are the subject of the fourth section. Finally, the fifth section presents the conclusions as well as the limits of research.",6

Carayannis,John Draper,Balwant Bhaneja,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There is a saying that nuclear fusion is always two decades away, and scientific journals like the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Nuclear Fusion have chronicled the long evolution of fusion energy. That said, in the year of the 75th anniversary of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, ITER, the world’s largest fusion experiment, began its machine assembly (ITER 2020a), thus placing fusion energy within long-range military planning. The leader of at least one great world power is now publicly stressing that fusion energy should be used for peaceful purposes, a tacit admission of the alternative: the weaponization of fusion (Franceschini et al. 2013). As the DEMO (fusion energy) planning phase of ITER begins in the coming decade, and as the private sector and venture capital prepare to take over the baton from public sector against the background of Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0 (Holroyd 2020), we warn that a “burning plasma” event represents a “critical juncture” of the like the world has not seen since the Trinity Test. In path dependence theory (Collier and Collier 2015), the critical juncture is where what happens becomes history and where that which does not happen is, as Robert Frost puts it, the path “less traveled by.” In the case of the Trinity Test, the path taken led to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, with the failure of the Baruch Plan (Gerber 1982) being another critical juncture, one that led to the Cold War. A fusion “burning plasma” (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2019) is of the same level of import not only because of the potential for militarization but also because of its potential commercial impact and contribution to managing climate change. In response, building on our suggestion for a global External Independent Review of fusion energy that could be co-chaired by the Global South (Carayannis et al. 2020), we call for an international Acheson-Lilienthal-style report (Department of State 1946) on fusion energy as part of an IAEA and International Energy Agency–backed “Global Commission for Urgent Action on Fusion Energy,” a possible prelude to a global “Fusion for Peace” program designed to ward off fusion weaponization and head off a “New Cold War” mentality (Carayannis et al. MS in preparation). We set this call against the background of Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0, which demand visions for a better society.",27

Whereas traditionally, research and development (R&D)-led technological progress was concentrated in developed countries, which generated most of the innovation (Furman and Hayes 2004; Dosi et al. 2006), nowadays we witness the emergence of innovation hubs in developing economies, out of which China is making a considerable progress in innovation performance. A significant change in the geography of innovation poses a challenge for developed countries, like the Western European economies, which are being at risk of losing their knowledge-related sources of competitive advantage. This calls to provide new insights into innovation policy that the European Union (EU) should take in order to maintain its position as one of the most innovative group of countries in the world economy. This research concentrates on the scientific problem of convergence in innovation performance between China and the EU. The key objectives of this paper are to measure the dynamics of innovation gap between China and the EU average and to identify the determinants of its evolution. The research questions are as follows: What is the level of innovation gap between China and the EU, and how it has been evolving in the period under analysis? Is innovation gap between China and the European Union persistent or do they diminish in the long run? What are the determinants of innovation performance of Chinese and European economy, including internal (e.g., investment in Research and Development (R&D) or emergence of innovative regional clusters), and external (e.g., international technology transfer through foreign direct investments (FDI)) factors? The timeframe of the research in this project covers the period since 2008, i.e., the beginning of the world’s financial crises. The observations on the structural changes in the world innovation system and the need to search for the answers to the presented above research questions and problems lead to the formulation of the following hypotheses for this study: the European Union has an innovation lead over China, but the innovation gap between these two economies has been diminishing since 2008. Among different factors determining fast improvement in innovation performance of Chinese economy, there are science, technology, and innovation (STI) policy, emergence of dynamic innovative clusters, huge investments in R&D, human capital development, and international technology transfer through FDI. Theoretical part of the study is based on critical literature review in the area of innovation gap, convergence in innovation performance, measuring the level of innovativeness of the economy, determinants of innovativeness, and innovation systems, including clusters. Empirical part of research includes statistical analysis of the level of innovativeness of analyzed economies, and measuring innovation gaps and convergence/divergence processes, both for innovation capabilities (input indicators, connected with, e.g., R&D expenditures or human capital development) and for innovation position (output indicators).",11

The improvement and growth stem from factors such as increasing disposable income and leisure time in recent decades, achieving sustainable economic and social development in a large number of countries worldwide, improving transport and technology in general (Polyzos et al. 2007; WEF 2017; Polyzos 2019). This significant change in the tourism industry contributes to the emergence of new destinations and new forms of tourism. In this respect, tourism has become a global socioeconomic phenomenon, with a significant impact on employment, on regional development, on education, on the environment, on the new technologies, on transport, on public finances, on the fiscal and budgetary policies of governments, and on culture (Leiper 1990; Polyzos and Arabatzis 2006; Priniotaki and Capsis 2008; Polyzos et al. 2013; Dimelli 2017; WEF 2017). Clearly, tourism is multi-dimensional in nature and causes the interest of many researchers. The importance of tourism has extensively discussed in international literature, and researchers conclude that tourism is a driving force of economic and social development (Pantelescu 2012). The tourism attractiveness of each region depends to a great extent on the resources that the region has or otherwise, the region’s special features that attract visitors’ interest. Every destination consists of a complex system with technical, political, economic and social characteristics and to some extent, every tourist resource may affect the tourism attractiveness of the region (Vangesayi 2008; Calvo Mora et al. 2011). Besides, studies have shown that the identification of a tourist destination as “attractive” by visitors influenced by personal factors such as their experiences, values, and preferences, and therefore, attractiveness depends on their subjective judgment (Sparks et al. 2002; Cracolici and Nijkamp 2008). These factors are exogenous concerning the destination and link to the emotional processing of information by visitors (Tam 2012; Reitsamer and Brunner-Sperdin 2017). Thus, the international literature is confused about the measurement of tourism attractiveness. There are already many papers, which attempt to explore the tourism attractiveness in different countries, employing different methodologies, under certain assumptions (Cracolici and Nijkamp 2008; Iatu and Bulai 2011; Cugno et al. 2012; Tomigorova et al. 2015). Nevertheless, for Greece, even though many papers analyze Greek tourism in-depth, few papers attempt to measure tourism attractiveness at Greek prefectures and make comparisons between them (Polyzos and Arabatzis 2008). This study aims to fill this gap and seeks to identify the main factors affecting the tourism attractiveness of Greek Prefectural administrative level (NUTS III), for foreign and domestic visitors, utilizing the multiple linear regression method. The analysis is at the level of regional units (NUTS III) as there are significant intra-regional disparities at the regional level (NUTS II). Multiple linear regression method is the most frequently used method for quantifying regional differences and aims to examine the relationship between a dependent variable and various independent variables (Polyzos 2019). Otherwise, using this method, some main factors of tourist attractiveness would accrue, for both foreign and domestic visitors. Our study seeks to provide a detailed understanding of the factors that influence tourism attractiveness for Greece’s prefectures analyzed by both groups of visitors. Analysis and evaluation of the impact of each determinant will help policy makers to adopt an appropriate strategy to enhance the accessibility of tourist areas, as well as local actors, to improve the attractiveness of the regions in general. Greece consists of 13 administrative regions, which are further subdivided into 51 prefectures (Fig. 1). The manuscript is organized as follows. In the “Literature Review” section, there is a brief overview of international literature. Factors that affect tourism attractiveness identifying and the approaches to the quantitative expression of tourism attractiveness analyzed. The “Methods” section refers to a description of the database, while the “Results” section outlines the statistical methodology employed in the study and presents and interprets the empirical results. Two models of quantification of tourism attractiveness for Greek prefectures proposed. The first refers to the foreign visitors and the second one to the domestic visitors. Next, in the “Discussion” section, results analyzed and compared with findings from previous studies. The “Conclusions” section makes some closing remarks on improving the tourism attractiveness of Greek tourist areas.

This paper develops a conceptual model in support of sustaining innovative capacity in entrepreneurial collaboration following a systematic literature review of the topic by the authors. A rigorous selection process was undertaken to identify academic resources. Concepts related to the topic of this study were traced rather than any particular bias or viewpoint held by the authors (Klopper et al. 2007; MacLure et al. 2016; Webster and Watson 2002). This methodological approach reveals many favourable, inherent qualities of individual entrepreneurs that encourage their collaboration. In particular, consensus supports the notion that entrepreneurs introduce new and novel ideas to problem-solving, owing to their inventive nature (Chen et al. 2017; Schlaile and Ehrenberger 2016; Schultz et al. 2016; Stevenson and Jarillo 2007; Quince 2001). Entrepreneurs have a penchant for innovation and creativity, as well as being able to foster a nurturing environment for others (Birley 1985). It is naïve for any manager to assume that these archetypical traits will translate into sustainable innovation capacity even when supported by other entrepreneurs (ibid.). There is no guarantee that an entrepreneurial cadre will achieve, let alone maintain the optimal synergy necessary for sustained innovation. Innovation requires the synthesis of diverse perspectives and intelligence through the social exchange of collaborating entrepreneurs (Chen et al. 2017; David et al. 2020). The literature is silent in terms of how this social exchange can be facilitated critically. Instead, managers prefer to avoid interfering with collaborating entrepreneurs because they believe such intervention will stifle the very creativity for which the entrepreneurs were brought together (Stevenson and Jarillo 2007). Organisational support of social exchange is reported by some researchers to maximise the conversion of market challenges to market opportunities in the hands of entrepreneurs (Clar and Sautter 2014; Sulistyo and Ayuni 2020). Such performance is the enduring result of innovation, as argued by Carayannis et al. (2015). However, innovation cannot happen unless collaborating entrepreneurs are achieving something that exceeds the sum of their individual effort and contribution, known as synergy (Corwin et al. 2012). Innovation requires optimal or positive synergy, which does not exist when social cohesion is excessive (Goold and Campbell 1998; Wise 2014). Excessive social cohesion is a likely occurrence in groups that may appear to be getting along well but at the expense of criticality and quality decision-making and wasting organisational resources, particularly time and money (Dundon 2002; Wong 1992). However, the power and value of co-constructed knowledge require a shift towards criticality as a matter of effort and motivation, not tension and dissent (Huffman 2013; Minhas 2019). McNish and Silcoff (2015) showcase how organisations tend to justify the engagement of entrepreneurs as necessary not only in the pursuit of innovation but also as a matter of competitiveness and survival. They do not consider the need to have optimal synergy for entrepreneurial collaboration to produce innovation, as posited by Dundon (2002). That optimal synergy relies upon the interpersonal relationships between the collaborating entrepreneurs, the very links through which innovation is created (Birley 1985; Burgelman and Hitt 2007; David et al. 2020; Larson and Starr 1993; Najmaei 2016). Therefore, the authors argue that organisational resources allocated (i.e. time and money) for social cohesion must target the creation and maintenance of optimal synergy while curtailing excessive social cohesion. Exploring the body of knowledge highlights the existence of a gap insofar as how the aforementioned links (i.e. the social cohesion) of collaborating entrepreneurs can be exploited to foster optimal synergy in the pursuit of innovation. The implication of this research gap is to encourage active managerial involvement and facilitation with the objective of sustaining innovative capacity in a cost-effective manner. This study challenges the tendency of managers to maintain a hands-off approach in their oversight of entrepreneurial collaboration and argues for more firms to engage entrepreneurs with efficient use of organisational resources. In the following sections, the theoretical background supporting the development of the conceptual model and research propositions is deliberated using the relevant literature, and findings are discussed in summary, concluding with implications of the study to policy and practice along with limitations. Collaboration requires interaction between participating entrepreneurs, necessitating the optimisation of social cohesion through their interconnectedness and individual interactions (Muhlenhoff 2016; Najmaei 2016; Quince 2001; Stacey 2011). Universally, managers persist in their avoidance of interference with entrepreneurial cadres. Nevertheless, the rationalisation of resources in the pursuit of innovation requires managerial involvement beyond the mere assembly of a roster and external observation (Corwin et al. 2012; Dundon 2002; Kempster and Cope 2010; Larson and Starr 1993; Stacey 2011; Stevenson and Jarillo 2007; Quince 2001). Constituting an entrepreneurial cadre with diverse participants does not necessarily enable action. Over the past 70 years, the study of entrepreneurial collaboration repeatedly points to the interpersonal relationships that constitute social cohesion as the key challenge and motivation to the pursuit of innovation (Carayannis et al. 2015; Carayannis and Rakhmatullin 2014; David et al. 2020; Quince 2001). However, the tendency of entrepreneurs to mitigate discord in no way assures management that optimal synergy will be maintained, especially where social cohesion may become excessive to the detriment of decision making quality, let alone the generation of novel ideas (Fox 2019; Huczynski and Buchanan 2013; Janis 1973; Leavitt 1974; Wise 2014). Therefore, managers must overcome their fear of triggering conflict, especially given that collaborating entrepreneurs inherently moderate conflict when empowered to co-create innovation. How entrepreneurs behave towards one another in social settings, not only impacts action but also the dynamism and responsiveness of the group because of the inescapable impact on their sense-making (Najmaei 2016). Managers can be understandably satisficed by the performativity of key contributors within an entrepreneurial cadre. They may be overlooking the fact that these stalwarts are anchored in one manner of status quo for decision-making and strategy until they find the next, better status quo (i.e. dynamic conservatism) (Argyris et al. 1985). Managerial involvement in moderating social cohesion can create an invaluable opportunity for disruption of subgroups comprised of stalwart performers who may be masking dynamic conservatism and thwarting true innovation. In confronting novel problems, the exact purpose of the entrepreneurial cadre, let alone its individual members, cannot always be fully known. While an organisational problem or market challenge is still being understood, the a priori primacy of task cohesion cannot be relied upon in driving innovation, especially since innovativeness is not impacted by the mere functional diversity of participants (Chen et al. 2017; Sethi et al. 2001). Managers can play a key role in facilitating reflexive processes amongst the participants, given that success, failure, and sustainability of entrepreneurial collaboration hinge on social cohesion (Quince 2001; Sethi et al. 2001). It is these interpersonal relationships that potentiate mutuality in respect, trust, and goals in entrepreneurial collaboration. Given the volatility and dynamism of the global marketplace, simply assembling a diverse, cross-functional roster cannot rely on the inherent moderation of conflict in entrepreneurial collaboration. The cognitive differences of the participants that are valued for their innovativeness assure that conflict will arise (Chen et al. 2017; Sethi et al. 2001). This finding encourages the authors’ study of how managerial intervention could exploit social cohesion in entrepreneurial collaboration to optimise positive synergy. Within the organisational setting, managers need to have some means of evaluating the level of social cohesion within the entrepreneurial cadre. Although newer, emerging, external technologies such as proximity tags and advanced audio-visual analytics exist, the authors advocate for the sociometric technique as a well-established, well-suited, and descriptive instrument for small groups in entrepreneurial environments, particularly as it assigns the assessment of the phenomenon to an individual for whom it represents a shared experience with the other members of the entrepreneurial cadre (Barile et al. 2018). In the sociometric technique, the subject represents, visually, the structure of social relationships between the members of the group at a particular time to include their perceptions of leadership and rejection (ibid.). In larger organisations, newer technologies can provide further insights, especially as a means of triangulation, but the authors also present the conceptual model in Fig. 1 as a means for smaller firms to consider entrepreneurial collaboration in their strategic planning. The authors emphasise that the choice of sociometric technique is not in opposition to newer technologies. Rather, it is a practicable suggestion to overcome the challenge of resource constraints, especially in SMB firms where the inclusion of entrepreneurial collaboration may be considered an extravagance reserved for large, multinational corporations. Conceptual model The conceptual model must provide a distinct consideration of the social cohesion of entrepreneurial collaboration as a central phenomenon that exists at any level (low, optimal, or high) at a given point in time in the life cycle of the project or organisation for which the cadre was assembled. The level of social cohesion existing within the cadre is considered an independent variable (IV) because, at the outset of the life cycle of the entrepreneurial collaboration, challenges arising from the market and organisational challenges are often still ill-defined. Entrepreneurial collaboration benefits an organisation for problem definition as much as for problem-solving, and the social cohesion of the entrepreneurial collaboration is not immediately affected by any of the other processes or phenomena in the conceptual model. If the cadre persists and is left unchecked, the activities of the collaborating entrepreneurs may not directly affect the level of synergy; rather, they affect the level of social cohesion. The level of social cohesion can become excessive to the detriment of innovative capacity when no efforts are made to enhance managerial sense-making, leading to sub-optimal organisational synergy as a dependent variable (DV). The conceptual model must support the ease of its use by managers who will have to alter their metacognitive skills as they adapt their sense-making. Therefore, social cohesion activity undertaken as a means of intervention is a moderating variable (MV). Accordingly, the first proposition (P1) considers that social cohesion intervention has a moderating effect towards sub-optimal organisational synergy when not informed by sense-making of existing levels of social cohesion in entrepreneurial collaboration. This proposition is rounded in the literature, as discussed in the section reporting on organisational synergy below. Again, social cohesion activity impacting the level of social cohesion of entrepreneurial collaboration is a moderating variable (MV) because it does not directly affect the level of synergy within the entrepreneurial collaboration. Rather, it affects the level of social cohesion, which, in turn, can be moderated to the benefit of innovative capacity when efforts are made to enhance managerial sense-making. Therefore, optimal organisational synergy is a dependent variable (DV). Sense-making is used where managers can gauge the level of social cohesion with collaborating entrepreneurs and co-construct intervention in the effort to prevent social cohesion from dropping below what is necessary to maintain the cadre and exceeding what is necessary for optimal synergy. Accordingly, the second proposition (P2) considers that social cohesion intervention has a moderating effect towards optimal organisational synergy when informed by sense-making of existing levels of social cohesion in entrepreneurial collaboration. This proposition is also grounded in the literature, as discussed in the “Organisational Synergy” section below. Of course, the exact activity selected, such as current popular group activities to promote collaboration and criticality, for example, “Escape Room” (cf. Borrego et al. 2017), could be of value whether social cohesion is too high (or too low). Managers must allow for the input and preferences of the group if they are to establish a credible agency. That activity would then become social cohesion activity as an intervention. Therefore, the conceptual model shown in Fig. 1 supports the timely and cost-effective moderation of social cohesion in entrepreneurial collaboration while respecting the aversion of entrepreneurs to employee status. For the organisational sponsors of entrepreneurial collaboration, this conceptual model liberates managers from having to sit idly and hope for innovation to occur. A key part of that enhancement is helping managers to recognise when social cohesion is adequate to allow collaborative entrepreneurs to continue being inventive without intervention or further expenditures. The authors call attention to the conceptual model presented in Fig. 1 for the consideration of sustaining innovation through entrepreneurial collaboration, not just performativity for a given problem, task, or project beyond which the collaborating entrepreneurs may or may not remain engaged. The proposed conceptual model incorporates a sensitivity of the inclination of managers to avoid interfering with entrepreneurial collaboration (Stevenson and Jarillo 2007) with the aversion of entrepreneurs to leading or being led (Kempster and Cope 2010). Ultimately, by involving the collaborating entrepreneurs in an assessment of the level of social cohesion, the judicious planning of suitable intervention activities, and the implementation thereof, the conceptual model in Fig. 1 seeks to facilitate the collaboration of entrepreneurs to perform beyond the sum of their individual abilities and contributions. This conceptual model merits the attention of scholars and practitioners alike. The resources allocated to bringing entrepreneurs together for the purposes of innovation must also encompass the effort to define and refine the understanding of organisational problems. That undertaking demands criticality alongside an increased managerial willingness to actively monitor and moderate social cohesion. This paper reports below on the relevant literature contributing to the development of the conceptual model and the research propositions. In the effort to systematically integrate thought leadership into this study, a number of issues arose in the literature insofar as terms of reference, which merit clarification at the outset of this section. Collaborative entrepreneurship and entrepreneurial collaboration are used interchangeably, confounding institutional processes that support or leverage entrepreneurship with the individual-centred phenomenon of entrepreneurs working with one another. While this tendency is understandable given the interrelation of the institutions and organisations supporting individual entrepreneurs and entrepreneurial activity, the authors argue for a standardisation of the terminology. Widespread agreement exists within the body of knowledge to prioritise the interactions between individual entrepreneurs above the process of bringing them together within an organisation since the manner in which entrepreneurs relate to one another may not be readily known to the sponsors of the collaboration (Corwin et al. 2012; Dundon 2002; Quince 2001; Stacey 2011). Based on the primacy of interconnectedness of the individual entrepreneurs over the institutional process supporting their aggregation, the authors adopt the following terminology: Entrepreneurial collaboration describes the phenomenon of individual entrepreneurs working jointly in pursuit of innovation. Collaborative entrepreneurship describes the marshalling of entrepreneurial processes, especially in collaborations between (educational) institutions and businesses. The term entrepreneurial collaboration, as argued by the authors, describes the phenomenon of individual entrepreneurs working jointly in pursuit of innovation. This study seeks to contribute to the body of knowledge through the development of a better description of the phenomenon of entrepreneurs collaborating and, in particular, how to enhance the likelihood that such collaboration will not only lead to innovation but also do so in a sustainable fashion. Over the past 70 years, increasing knowledge has been created regarding entrepreneurs insofar as how they function and how they interact with others. Entrepreneurs are accepted as inventive, giving them the ability to come up with new ideas, uses, or combinations to address a challenge. These unique attributes are very tantalising to business firms seeking competitive advantages in the marketplace (Schlaile and Ehrenberger 2016; Schultz et al. 2016; Stevenson and Jarillo 2007; Quince 2001). For modern firms, the ability to innovate has evolved beyond an idea that is advocated by theorists or academics (Senge 1990; Stacey 2011). In fact, the need for organisations around the world to develop their capacity to innovate has become a matter of key strategic advantage. The motivation to develop sustainable, innovative capabilities is a matter of economic significance that ensures the survival of the firm (McNish and Silcoff 2015; Senge 1990; Stacey 2011). Consequently, organisations must endeavour to include entrepreneurs within their fold, but these same organisations may struggle with how such individuals can be engaged effectively, sustainably, and, of course, profitably (Dundon 2002; Najmaei 2016; Schlaile and Ehrenberger 2016; Senge 1990). Bringing entrepreneurs together can permit the participants to begin to cooperate and construct solutions together, creating an opportunity and challenge to overcome controversy in favour of more critical decision-making (Chen et al. 2017). The value and necessity of entrepreneurs to the innovative capacity of firms are clear, but the inclusion of such individuals presents a host of challenges, particularly in the rationalisation of the expense to support the effort. Furthermore, entrepreneurs are not particularly interested in being employed in a conventional sense or under the thumb of a positional leader, much to the chagrin of hierarchical firms that still seek to include such archetypes in their pursuit of competitive advantage in the marketplace (Kempster and Cope 2010). Researchers report that entrepreneurs are also good collaborators, but managers rarely involve entrepreneurs to establish expectations and compliance with the budgetary and operational concerns of the firm (Burgelman and Hitt 2007; Koellinger 2008; Stevenson and Jarillo 2007). The mistake in this approach is the assumption that entrepreneurial collaboration is somehow magically optimised to forever produce innovation. As it turns out, for innovation to be possible, entrepreneurial collaboration has to come together synergistically (Dundon 2002). Not understanding this issue further contributes to managers taking a very passive role when assigned to the oversight of entrepreneurial cadres, leaving their firm vulnerable to not only an inefficient use of organisational resources but also an unproductive engagement, no matter what the cost (Dundon 2002; Wong 1992). Most disappointingly, managers that adopt this passive approach are leaving innovation to chance instead of finding a way to navigate the idiosyncrasies of entrepreneurs engaged by the firm. This ambiguity leaves firms in the position of following an appropriate trend for seeking competitiveness but without any visibility, let alone certainty as to the expense to be incurred for the privilege. All too often, companies are content to tolerate this uncertainty because engaging entrepreneurs is considered necessary for innovation and, in some cases, even survival (McNish and Silcoff 2015). However, businesses must consider what the literature makes clear. The quality of entrepreneurial collaboration rests in the strength as well as the quality of the linkages of interpersonal relationships, known as social cohesion, which dictate the likelihood of successful innovation (David et al. 2020; Hoigaard et al. 2006; Najmaei 2016; Sulistyo and Ayuni 2020; Quince 2001). It is at this point in consideration of the literature that a deficiency in how social cohesion could be exploited to optimise organisational synergy in entrepreneurial collaboration is exposed. This spectrum of performance with respect to social cohesion is clearly defined through the systematic literature review process and discussed in detail in the next section. Social cohesion and group cohesion are used interchangeably, conveying the willingness of individuals to cooperate in order to survive and prosper with a sense of belonging (Dyaram and Kamalanabhan 2005) but are more often adopted according to a given discipline. While management science uses the term group cohesion, political science and economics tend to use social cohesion to describe the same phenomenon in their context. However, the latter disciplines’ use of social cohesion focuses on national or macro-level interactions of innovative groups. But, thought leadership in the field of entrepreneurial collaboration emphasises the inclusion of the interconnectedness of individuals and micro-levels of social relationships in the use of the social cohesion (Mulunga and Nazdanifarid 2014). Using the term social cohesion for the context of entrepreneurial collaboration extends beyond social cohesion as the establishment of social bonds that potentiate the persistence of a group in a unified fashion undertaken by the participants (Carron 1982). The very validity of social cohesion as a concept is hindered by inattention to micro-level behaviour because the term is anchored in the trust and mutuality that comprises the bonds between individuals (Berman and Phillips 2004; Chan et al. 2006; Smith and Polanyi 2008; Vveinhardt and Banikonyte 2017). The reader is justified to question, at this point, why task cohesion is not the issue central to this study. However, as organisational problems are still being defined, let alone the individual entrepreneurs being assembled, task cohesion remains underdeveloped and unreliable in the pursuit of novel solutions and cannot be assumed to merit a priori primacy (Chen et al. 2017; Sethi et al. 2001). Further to its explication in the “Introduction” section of this paper, the term social cohesion is used by the authors in place of group cohesion without interchange in the context of entrepreneurial collaboration because the literature accepts the term as a dynamic process appropriate for referring to the bonds that potentiate the persistence of a with particular attention to the micro-level behaviour relating to trust and mutuality (Berman and Phillips 2004; Carron 1982; Chan et al. 2006; Smith and Polanyi 2008; Vveinhardt and Banikonyte 2017). The body of knowledge is clear that where social cohesion is absent, collaboration cannot take place, which might seem intuitive to the reader (Dion 2000; Oketch 2004; Wong 1992). However, when social cohesion is too high, innovation does not happen either because entrepreneurial collaboration is diminished in its criticality and the quality of decision-making (Stewart et al. 2008; Wise 2014). The issue is not that social cohesion has as direct and positive relationships with innovation as posited by Wong (1992), or that it has an upper limit beyond which it simply fails to produce innovation as argued by both Stewart et al. (2008) and Wise (2014). Rather, social cohesion impacts the level of organisational synergy (Dundon 2002; Witges and Scanlan 2015). However, none of these studies explore the moderation of social cohesion in optimising synergy. Given the deficiency in the literature in providing direction as to how social cohesion intervention can be utilised to optimise organisational synergy in entrepreneurial collaboration, the authors explored thought leadership through the systematic literature review into the implications of social cohesion itself on the phenomenon of entrepreneurial collaboration. The adept manager must endeavour to find when and how social cohesion can be just right for entrepreneurial collaboration, but this cannot happen if a hands-off approach is maintained. A delicate balance is required between maintaining sufficient strengths in the bonds between the collaborating entrepreneurs to sustain the group while constantly monitoring the quality of those same bonds. Beyond necessitating managerial involvement, such a process demands enhancement to the sense-making efforts of the manager. One of the key goals of this study is to encourage SMB firms to engage entrepreneurs in their efforts to gain strategic advantages, even where those firms lack the budget of larger corporations. In that process, the literature revealed a relatively simple, low-cost method that not only serves as a means to gauge the level of social cohesion but also to promote critical thinking and the taking of greater interpersonal risk where the self-assessment of strengths and interactions is key to entrepreneurs being able to innovate and learn collaboratively (Clar and Sautter 2014). Fifty years from its inception, researchers still praise sociometric technique for its relevance in gauging the level of social cohesion amongst the members of a group, even amongst advocates of the latest external technologies (Barile et al. 2018; Forsyth 2010; Hung and Gatica-Perez 2010). The authors wish to emphasise that sociometric technique is a qualitative, descriptive instrument that describes what is happening in a small group with respect to the level of interpersonal dynamics constituting social cohesion but does not reveal why those bonds have formed (Forsyth 2010). Subjects draw their perceptions of social relationships, rejection, and leadership roles for their group at a given point in time preceded by a short set of questions, prior to assigning the task of representing the linkages of the group, for example, “With whom do you work the best within the group?”, “With whom would you like to work within the group?” and “With whom can you share your ideas?” (ibid). The subject simply draws a circle to represent each group member according to their perception of their linkage and uses lines to indicate their connectedness with arrows to represent the directionality of interactions. Providing managers which simple, low-cost tools to gauge social cohesion in entrepreneurial collaboration establishes them as a facilitator of success to the collaborating entrepreneurs rather than a positional leader imposing operational constraints on the innovative process. Despite the revelation of actionable knowledge by the systematic literature review, the authors emphasise that the optimisation of organisational synergy hinges on the quality—not just the strength—of social cohesion in entrepreneurial collaboration, as discussed in the next section. Historically, synergy connotes cooperative output, which typically conveys the whole being greater than the sum of its parts (Ward 1918; Werth 2002). The notion that synergy is always a matter of positive, the cooperative output is challenged in the management context where organisational synergy can be either optimal (positive) or sub-optimal (negative) (Goold and Campbell 1998; Huczynski and Buchanan 2013; Frigotto 2016). This distinction is of vital importance to the understanding of entrepreneurial collaboration, and the further exploration of the research gap of how social cohesion intervention can be utilised to optimise entrepreneurial collaboration because, without the linkages that comprise and constitute social cohesion, organisational synergy could not occur (Lawford 2003; Najmaei 2016; Oketch 2004; Wise 2014). All too often, collaboration is erroneously presumed to ensure (optimal) synergy, especially in firms that have committed to the engagement of entrepreneurs (Goold and Campbell 1998). This presumption is referred to as synergy bias and typically leads to an underestimation of the organisational resources that will be allocated for entrepreneurial collaboration (Goold and Campbell 1998; Lawford 2003). At this juncture in the process of systematic literature review, the authors are able to ground the first proposition (P1) in the literature and articulate it as: P1: Social cohesion intervention has a moderating effect towards suboptimal organisational synergy when not informed by sensemaking of existing levels of social cohesion in entrepreneurial collaboration. Organisational synergy may very well be present to the extent that an external observer, especially a manager assigned to the oversight of entrepreneurial collaboration, may be heartened by the apparent enhancement of the collective ability of the participating entrepreneurs. However, it could be sub-optimal, masking the diminished quality of decision-making and criticality of the group members with no other indication that innovation is unlikely to occur (Dundon 2002; Goold and Campbell 1998; Huczynski and Buchanan 2013; Lerner et al. 2015). Sociability and proximity amongst group members in no way confirm optimal synergy and may represent the squandering of organisational resources more so than any hope of innovation (Camuffo and Gerli 2016; Dundon 2002; Lawford 2003; Liening et al. 2016). Therefore, managers must create personal responsibility amongst the collaborating entrepreneurs to balance the need for facilitation against any known idiosyncrasies of entrepreneurs, such as their dislike of positional leadership or conventional employment status (Stevenson and Jarillo 2007; Kempster and Cope 2010). The sociometric technique has been described above as an apt tool to permit engagement by the manager. This provides the manager with the very cost-effective means to gauge the appropriateness of the level of social cohesion to foster optimal synergy in the entrepreneurial collaboration. At this juncture in the process of systematic literature review, the authors are able to ground the second proposition (P2) in the literature and articulate it as: P2: Social cohesion intervention has a moderating effect towards optimal organisational synergy when informed by sensemaking of existing levels of social cohesion in entrepreneurial collaboration. Because the very purpose of the entrepreneurial collaboration is innovation, the roster of entrepreneurs must be assembled with the understanding that mere cooperation is not collaboration. Without greater reflection and scrutiny of the inclusion of entrepreneurial collaboration, organisations may be doing little more than succumbing to a management fad that moors them, at best, in technocratic unimaginativeness or, at worst, in a desperate grasp for results (Van Maanen 1995).",2

Fernandes,Carla Azevedo Lobo,Female,Female,Female,Female,"This current research seeks to evaluate the effect of informal entrepreneurship on venture capital flows. In recent years, and in opposition to the conventional literature in which entrepreneurs emerge as some kind of business heroes (Cannon 1991) or supermen and often portrayed as objects of desire (Berglund and Johansson 2007), another approach has emerged that considers other practical entrepreneurship experiences. One aspect incorporates the growing literature on the lunar side of entrepreneurship. This spans at least two sets of literature. One set focuses on the fact that individuals who engage in illegitimate activities also display both entrepreneurship (Armstrong 2005; Bruns et al. 2011; Karjanen 2011; de Jong et al. 2012; Smith and McElwee 2013) and the typical attributes of “entrepreneurs” (Gottschalk and Smith 2011; Bucur et al. 2012). The other set, which is the object of our study here, approaches informal entrepreneurship and recognizes how entrepreneurs sometimes operate entirely or partially in the informal economy (Aidis et al. 2006; Williams 2008, 2009a, b; Antonopoulos and Mitra 2009; Gurtoo and Williams 2009; Webb et al. 2009; Williams and Nadin 2011, 2012a, b, 2013). In recent decades, the generalized processes of modernization, globalization and technological progress have made world economies increasingly dynamic and interconnected after having fostered the development of multinational companies. One of the leading measurements of multinational activities stems from levels of foreign direct investment (FDI), defined by the OECD as investments in companies in which investors hold at least 10% of the common shares, to establish a “lasting interest” in the host country and not only a long-term relationship but also influence over the respective company management (OECD 2008, 2012). For Saetre (2003), entrepreneurs do not want only investors who contribute financially in the capital. For some entrepreneurs, it is not enough just to have investors who bring business experience; want investors with skills and experience relevant to their companies. Experienced investors and specific niche networks provide significant added value for companies. This added value qualifies as a form of capital itself (Fisher 1919). Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in informal entrepreneurship and its effect on venture capital flows, both politically and academically (Martinez et al. 2015). For most entrepreneurs, the demand for venture capital funding depends on formal institutions that function properly related to law and regulation (Martinez et al. 2015). Ramamurti (2003) describes this as an “institutional design challenge” requiring the right combination of substantive legal and regulatory rules, related legal and regulatory processes to apply them. Our research aims to assess how informal entrepreneurship effect on venture capital flows. This raises our research question: what is the effect of informal entrepreneurship on venture capital flows? By implication, risk-adverse financing will flow to economies where formal institutions provide investors with greater protection, particularly when these investors are well-educated and technically oriented (Guler and Guillen 2010). Khoury et al. (2012) note that investors in more exposed environments often have to commit more resources to compensate for the likelihood of costly contractual transgressions and may instead choose not to invest. Zacharakis et al. (2007) conclude that venture capital markets in economies with higher levels of informal entrepreneurship encounter entrepreneurs facing greater challenges. Investors may feel that they are unable to rely on appropriate legal and regulatory institutional safeguards to protect the terms of their initial investment contracts from risks such as opportunistic renegotiation by creditors and local government. Our research contributes to the development of theory, practice and public policies of entrepreneurship across two important facets. Firstly, when we study the effect that the existence of informal entrepreneurship has on the venture capital flows, we convey the importance of the level of trust that investors need to perceive in the institutions in which they will invest their money. Informal entrepreneurship can be an inhibiting factor in these financial flows. Secondly, the majority of studies on informal entrepreneurship concentrate primarily on developing countries, even if not exclusively. The ILO (2012) reports that one in six (17%) members of the global non-agriculture labour force engages in some form of informal sector entrepreneurship as their main form of employment. However, the percentage of the non-agricultural workforce involved in informal entrepreneurship varies across global regions: 26% in sub-Saharan Africa, 23% in Latin America and the Caribbean and 19% in East Asia and Pacific, down to 11% in the Middle East and North Africa, 10% in South Asia and 8.5% in Europe and Central Asia. In terms of participation in informal sector entrepreneurship in the 27 member states of the European Union (UE-27), analysis by the Eurobarometer 2007 survey no. 284 on the informal labour sector finds that 1 in 28 (almost 4%) of the 26,659 adults interviewed reported some form of such entrepreneurship over the last 12 months, spending an average of 73 h on such work and earning an average of €11.05 /hour, producing an annual average income from informal entrepreneurship totalling €806. Almost three-quarters (73%) of this autonomous informal labour takes place through close social relations (for example, parents, neighbours, friends, acquaintances and colleagues). A little over one-quarter (27%) is at the behest of others, previously unknown persons and families. As far as we know, this research is the first to articulate the effect of informal entrepreneurship on venture capital, specifically in Europe, where the level of informality is considered relatively low. Therefore, this problematic framework rarely gets approached in Europe and correspondingly justifying the importance of this study. We thus share with other entrepreneurship researchers this interest in understanding whether and when financial flows to different countries become more likely to shift to financing commercial transactions, such as launching new businesses. Our research proposes informality as an alternative causal factor interlinked with the institutional, rather than the natural, environment prevailing in developed countries. Our paper is structured as follows: in the following section, we present the literature review, in which we develop the relationship of informal entrepreneurship, GDP and financial flows (venture capital flows). Next, we present the methodology, the respective results and their discussion. Finally, we draw the conclusions, implications and future lines of research.",8

Carayannis, Interview to Riconfigure EU Project, November 2019 (Carayannis, 2020) http://riconfigure.eu/publication/democracy-and-the-environment-are-endagered-species/ In his famous book, “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,” Thomas S. Kuhn (1962) emphasizes that there is an evolution of thoughts, with mutual influences, new stages of thinking, also a learning and a cross-learning of thoughts, where new thoughts are developing in reflection of existing intellectual structures and patterns. There also can be a co-evolution of different ideas, not only with a reciprocal co-influencing but also with distinct evolutionary lines. The focus of this analysis is on the development and evolution of Quadruple and Quintuple Helix innovation systems. This implies a comparative analysis and discussion on the Triple Helix, Quadruple Helix and Quintuple Helix innovation systems. The “A Short History of Triple Helix, and of the Quadruple and Quintuple Helix Innovation Systems” section provides a short historical overview, while the “The Quintuple Innovation Helix and Industry and Society 5.0” section focuses on Industry 5.0 and Society 5.0 (Carayannis, et al., 2021a, b). In the “Conclusion” section, it is being emphasized that the Quadruple and Quintuple Helix are based on democracy and an ecological sensitivity. Here references are being made to a “democracy of climate,” intended to create a (social, cultural, economic, and political) “climate for democracy.”",33

Chaparro-Mantilla,Clara I. Peña de Carrillo,Ruth Zárate-Rueda,Female,Female,Female,Female,"Smart cities implement information and communication technologies (ICT), to improve the life conditions of communities, leading to a more effective governance, and increased economic and educational opportunities to attain social equality (Batty et al., 2012; Lehr, 2018). The competitiveness of local communities grows thanks to innovation, without forgetting the challenge of providing better public services and a sustainable environment to citizens (Appio et al., 2019). In spite of the concept of smart cities proposed by several academics around the world, it is clear that the good practices applied in some localities do not necessarily match the successful results found in others (Fiori & Ribera-Fumaz, 2016). In this way, a good strategy is finding cross-cutting factors likely to be considered as a model to set up new guidelines. In this sense, attaining sustainability objectives in smart cities requires the integration of ICT and human capital (Appio et al., 2019), through the creation of plans for educational improvement and social cohesion in accordance with the development of communities, besides granting a strong relationship between the governed and the governors (Berrone & Ricart, 2017). Consequently, the smart governance dimension should focus on citizen participation in the governance of cities, as it will make “make it possible to profit from all the benefits of digital technologies to develop a modern administration driven by the citizens and their needs” (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD], 2018). When the community is involved in planning, city management is decentralized thanks to the integration of a diversity of members: consulting firms, smart technology providers, and national government financing bodies (national players), together with municipal representatives, the university, citizens, and community organizations (local players) (Trencher, 2019). The fusion of these elements makes up the social weaving (SW), identified as groups of people who get together to achieve clear goals and improve the quality of life of its members, by including and integrating ICT in their daily lives. In addition, the commitment is acquired to actively and consciously participate in the decision-making process, an aspect that in certain countries falls exclusively upon their government (Marín & Salgado, 2014; Morales et al., 2015). Hence, digital literacy involves training people to access digital infrastructure and strengthen their competencies in a sustainable manner (Bleja et al., 2020); with education linked to Smart learning standing out as the starting point to “achieve a stable and persistent change in what a person or group of people knows and may do in a smarter way” (Liu et al., 2017, p.32). In this regard, Molnar (2020) notes that education in smart cities is an emerging area with certain deficiencies in the existing initiatives, which assume that people are prepared to use and take advantage of technologies. In consequence, educational institutions should contribute to the thinking process in order to promote the responsibility to consolidate a smart city among citizens (Manjrekar & Deshmukh, 2020). One of the requirements to consolidate a smart city consists in incorporating smart people, capable of implementing ICT and getting them involved in the generation of knowledge, considering that a smart citizen learns under the premises of lifelong learning. In this way, investing in education and technological development is essential (Chaparro et al., 2014; Sant’Ana et al., 2021), added to recognizing the diversity of citizens, eliminating the segregation of minorities and trying to remove physical and digital barriers (de Oliveira Neto & Kofuji, 2016). Dustdar et al. (2017) refer to a collective smart city as the basis for the inclusion of the SW into the city management, based on the social values fostered by the use of technologies to inform, educate, and consult everybody, in order to facilitate socially significant changes. This is key to prevent digitalization in urban areas from excluding certain citizens (Bleja et al., 2020). Smart cities are based on knowledge. In this way, they focus on intellectual assets, lifelong learning, creativity, scientific research, and a high level of innovation (Sikora-Fernández, 2017). Hence, it is important to understand the levels of acceptance of SW regarding information systems for the development of ICT in smart cities (Baudier et al., 2020), due to the changes in performance concerning certain daily tasks, and the capacity to undertake them people should have. According to Husar & Ondrejicka (2019), some criticism facing smart cities refers to the poor training of citizens in the use and appropriation of ICT; this results in an absence of a competent SW for the development of smart cities in emerging countries. According to the above mentioned, the lack of citizen participation presupposes citizens do not fully understand the scope of a smart city, an aspect that is condensed with a high degree of inequality in education and inclusion of all the players and therefore, hinders the development of the city (Rana et al., 2019). In this setting, the construction of a smart city requires a competent SW characterized by the social inclusion of several urban residents (Albino et al., 2015) and equitable access to smart learning educational programs (Kumar et al., 2020). Consequently, this study consists in designing a SW model for the verification of the creation and strengthening of a competent and participatory SW, in the demand for services from the electronic government within a smart city context. In this regard, the population selected corresponds to boys and girls with cognitive impairment who, within the framework of a smart city, have nil or reduced approaches to technologies with accessible content and infrastructure (Lobo, 2018; de Oliveira Neto & Kofuji, 2016). Therefore, the aim is to construct a SW with citizen and digital competencies which are proportional to the equality policies promoted by electronic governments regarding the use of ICT. In this way, the digital inclusion of People with Cognitive Impairment (PCI) requires access to ICT, sensomotor and cognitive skills, technical requirements for the comprehension of codes and conventions at the moment of using technologies (Lussier-Desrochers et al., 2017; Mongeau & Lussier-Desrochers, 2018).",

All over the world, the academic staff is involved in research, teaching, and service work (Park 1996; Malcolm and Zukas 2009); additionally, some academics are getting involved in various forms of entrepreneurship—from founding new firms (spin-offs, start-ups), to being lead scientists, to developing important parts of many businesses across the market sectors (Mosey and Wright 2007; Rasmussen et al. 2011; Davey et al. 2015; Seguí-Mas et al. 2018). They are referred to as “academic entrepreneurs.” An entrepreneurial university, in turn, “fosters interaction and networking in the same way that firm are expected to do, and in the same way that inventors such as Watt and Edison did, with scientists, economists, financiers, and other stakeholders and experts in the community” (Formica 2002: 172). In the narrow sense, the academic entrepreneurship is restricted to university spin-offs and academic start-ups (Shane 2004), but this understanding often does not embrace all the forms of involvement of research institutions, academics, auxiliary staff and administration, or students in business activities (Drucker 1985). This is especially a problem in post-communist countries, where uncommon academic entrepreneurship in a narrow sense coexists with other forms of “entrepreneurial spirit” (Etzkowitz 2011). Recently, Pinto et al. (2015: 15) argued that “in peripheral regions knowledge transfer from universities needs to be considered in a broader sense and adapted to the capacities of firms in the territory.” Thus, the main question of this paper is: How can foreign-born migrants employed in academia commercialize their professional skills in Eastern Europe? The paper closes the gap between Western literature on academic entrepreneurship and Eastern European scholarship by discussing various forms of academic entrepreneurship in this region. Based on 140 interviews, this paper provides four case studies of different types of academic entrepreneurship in Eastern Europe, and contributes to the debate on the alternative forms of the academic entrepreneurship, “such as consultancy and contract research, joint research, or training—as compared to patenting or spin-out activities in academia,” which have been proven to be important in other cultural contexts (D’Este and Patel 2007: 1295). To distinguish this broader scope from the narrower understanding of the academic entrepreneurship, the term “academia-based entrepreneurship” is applied throughout the paper (Barcik et al. 2017: 19). This paper is organized as follows. The literature review and methodology sections are followed by a general analysis of entrepreneurial activities in all 140 cases. The next section presents “personas”—typical academics involved in four professional scenarios. The final empirical part discusses institutional barriers indicated by the interviewees.",1

The industrial revolutions brought a change in the organisational structure of companies and the direction of labour. The first revolution placed industry as the base of the economic structure. The second gave a new breath to industries and the economy through the development and mastery of energy. These two revolutions reduced the use of labour in factories that has been replaced with machines. Nowadays, we witness the advent of a new revolution: “the digital revolution”. This revolution is seen in the electronics, telecommunications and computer science domains. It offers industry advantages through the automation of tasks and has become an important component of world growth (Elouaer-Mrizak and Picard 2016). However, in Africa, natural resources are still the driving force of economies. Despite the implementation of development programmes on the continent, the average growth rate remains low, thus compromising its effective take-off. Since 1960, the average growth rate in Africa stood at 4.24% in the first 20 years (1961–1980), 1.68% in the second, and 5.16% between 2001 and 2013 (World Development Indicators (WDI) 2014). Over the same periods, China,Footnote 1 which at the end of the 1990s was still classified as a developing country, recorded respective average growth rates of 5.61%, 9.90% and 9.66% (WDI 2014). These figures show that over time, the growth gap between China and Africa has widened (from 1.37 to 4.50 points). These disparities bring us to question ourselves on the levers of growth while contributing to the debate on the causes of growth differences between economies. Some factors can explain this difference. For example, studies focused on the growth gap between United Kingdom (UK) and United States (US) gave some conclusions. According to OECD (2007), the named gap is determined up to 60% by financial intermediation and retailer’s delivery within, which are better more performed in US than UK. In 2001, Griffith et al. (2003) demonstrated that the gap is explained by labour productivity (up to 40%). Globally, Basu et al. (2003) shown that others factors such as differences in regulation of product and labour market, cyclical mismeasurement of input, intensity of competition and disruption costs associated with investment are the major determinants of the growth gap. The economy is no longer fuelled only through the traditional sectors (agriculture and the production of traditional goods and services which are a major asset in Africa), but also by another that greatly contributed to economic literature in recent decades: “the digital economy”. The latter refers to the sector of economic activity relating to information and communication technologies (ICT), particularly the production and sale of goods, services and digital contents (Falch and Henten 2018). Beyond the traditional narrow conception, it includes telecommunication, audio-visual services, firm’s software networking and computer equipment (Vial 2012). Its participation in the global gross domestic product is significant as its effect on the world population. In fact, between 2010 and 2014, digital technology improvements contributed from 4 to 7% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries (OECD 2015). Further, more than 50% of the world population has access to the Internet (World Bank (WB) 2016). These figures highlight the fact that digital technologies affect the daily lives of people now, more than ever before. From this point of view, Africa is the continent with the lowest rate of penetration that stands at 29% (WB 2016). As regards the case of China, the contribution of the digital technology in its economy stood at 9% in 2010, 18% in 2016 and it is estimated at 50% in 2030 (WB 2016). According to this same source, these rates are significantly different from those of Africa that was on average less than 2% over the previous decade. Could the economic lag, and more specifically, the growth gap between China and Africa be explained, according to the figures presented above, by the importance of the digital economy sector in China? Can the growth gap between the African and Chinese economies find an explanation in the low capacity of African economies to adopt and exploit technologies with the minimum required level of this century high digital intensity? To address this issue, this study is structured in six sections: This introduction being the first. The next two sections identify some stylised facts and the review of the literature, while the last three, present the methodology, expose the main results of the study and formulate some recommendations.",

Furthermore, models using an endogenous growth framework make a strong case for the growth of R&D and innovation (e.g. Conte 2006), even if they highlight that “R&D investments alone will not do the job” (Aghion 2006). Firms and economies achieve significant returns on these investments, which also create new jobs. The importance of R&D and innovation is even greater as our economies become more knowledge-based and intensive in intangible assets (European Commission 2017). In addition, R&D and innovation investments contribute to improving healthcare and to fighting against climate change. They are crucial in addressing key economic and societal challenges (https://www.earto.eu/working-group-public/impact/). In this context, research and technology organisations (RTOs) have become considerably more important, considering the fact that their mission is to harness science and technology to foster innovation in order to improve the quality of life and boost economic competitiveness. Through their knowledge transfer activities, they increase the competitiveness of companies and generate an economic impact; they promote carbon-free technologies, health technologies and so forth to increase the welfare of society. They also nurture and create deep-tech start-ups and generate employment and economic added value in Europe via their day-to-day activities (EARTO 2019). RTO technologies cover all scientific fields and their work ranges from basic research to the development of new products and services. Using their open-innovation business model, they are able to transfer research and technology to industries that market new products and services with a high impact on society. They must, however, be funded by governments to ensure they can carry out such activities. We know that governments have to provide research and innovation subsidies to reduce failures on knowledge markets, i.e. indivisibilities, “inappropriability” and uncertainty (Arrow 1962). Moreover, to mitigate climate change and integrated environmental externalities, governments gain from supporting research in favour of low-carbon technologies (Lafforgue et al. 2013). We can hold a similar demonstration for health, etc. Therefore, RTOs use the public funding they receive in form of grants and competitive funding to leverage private investments from large and small companies via the means of contract research. However, the risky cocktail of high debt and low growth in Europe calls for smart public investment that fosters long-term growth while minimising the potentially negative short-term effect on public finances and economic activity. R&D and innovation are typically identified as targets for smart public spending because of their economic and social impact (Veugelers 2016). While this issue is not new (dating back to the 1950s), the economic returns to research investment have been analysed repeatedly; it has become a veritable challenge for the European Union and governments with smaller budgets. We have to demonstrate the utility of such subsidies by providing in-depth analysis and detailed arguments on a case-by-case basis (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265369750_Productembodied_technological_diffusion_and_intersectoral_linkages_in_Europe.). In this context, the international non-profit association, called the European Association of Research and Technology Organisations (EARTO) representing the interests of RTOs in Europe, conducted a study in 2018 to evaluate the economic and social impact of 9 RTOs: AIT (Austria), the CEA (France), DTI (Denmark), Fraunhofer institutes (Germany), Imec (Belgium), SINTEF (Norway), Tecnalia (Spain), TNO (Holland) and VTT (Finland). The focus of this study was to highlight the economic impact of RTOs and job creations: RTOs activities leave a so-called economic footprint in society that is worth measuring to justify research subsidies. The environmental impact was not directly covered in the scope even if RTOs strongly contribute to the transfer of clean energy technologies,Footnote 1 technologies useful for public health, etc. Nevertheless, particularly interesting are the leverage effects we see arising from the economic footprint results: what is the additional employment in the European economy that can be related to one person employed at an RTO? If grants are received, how many euros flow back to the national government for each euro it invests in the (daily operation of) RTO? Such an analysis of RTOs economic footprint was carried out by the consulting firm, IDEA Consult, on behalf of the association to collect information from the 9 RTOs and to obtain a global estimate of their impact. The EARTO report on this overall estimate was published in March 2018 (Bilsen et al. 2018). The methodology used is based on the classic input-output approach, combined with microdata inputs from the RTOs. We will see on “Economic Footprint of Research Activities or Research Infrastructure (RIs)” that economic footprint analysis is commonly employed to measure the impact of research activities because it is easy to implement. The advantages are that direct economic effects are exact and that the quantification of the indirect effects is based on the RTO-specific data rather than on sector averages. But it is a relatively static approach and the aims of the paper (and of the EARTO project which is the background of the study) are to try to go a little further than the regular footprint models. As a member of EARTO, the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) took part in the analysis. It was the subject of a separate calculation in the framework of the research carried out for the paper: data was provided by the author with the help of the different CEA divisions (purchasing, human resources and industrial promotion) and simulation was performed on the basis of the model provided by IDEA Consult (Bilsen and Van Hoed 2018). The objectives of this article are to provide empirical results about the CEA’s impact and a comparison with the results obtained for the 9 RTOs. Certainly, the comparison of the French RTO and the other European RTOs studied could be considered biased because of the size and the multiple objectives of CEA. While the size difference is not a major methodological issue as the results are given against the RTOs budget, the wide range of CEA activities is a problem that must be taken into account in the analysis. That’s actually the subject of the article: improve the footprint analysis methodology to consider the wide range of CEA activities. We therefore look at CEA’s impact analysis as a case study. Such a case study is very useful for gaining a better understanding of how impact is created and disseminated in the economy. It highlights quantitative and qualitative information that can be used to provide a more accurate assessment of the economic impact of research organisations that are very diverse in their duties like the CEA. With the current model used by IDEA Consult, the analysis focuses on two types of RTO activities that are expected to generate economic impact and employment: the economic leverage of the RTOs’ core activities through spending and employment on the one hand, and the economic leverage of knowledge transfer activities through contract research, spin-offs and the outflow of staff on the other hand (Bilsen et al. 2018). In the new approach, we also propose to be able to challenge the economic spin-offs derived from high-tech purchases. This is essential because such purchases lead to a myriad of innovations. This is a strong argument for governments that are often required to place this type of order (especially in the defence and space sectors). This article describes the basic principles behind the footprint analysis performed for the CEA based on a European environment to assess the economic impact of its purchases and its payroll. It then details the additional method used by IDEA with original data from the CEA used to estimate the impact of CEA technology transfers in Europe, i.e. the impact of innovation resulting from R&D in partnership conditions (CEA spin-offs benefiting the industry). At the end of the article, we summarise the results and compare them with the overall results of the EARTO report on 9 European RTOs which include the CEA. Thanks to two interviews at management level, we are able to better understand the impact-generating mechanisms employed by the CEA Military Applications Division (DAM). So, we finish by suggesting an improvement path for the model used. As a starting point, the first section provides a review of the economic literature dealing with the question of the impact of research.",2
13.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,06 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-020-00717-2,Economic Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa: Evidence from Composite Indicators,March 2022,Ibrahim Ngouhouo,Tii Njivukuh Nchofoung,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Resilience originated within the ecological sciences and has recently gain increasing attention in economics, with focus on how regions or economies react following common shocks (UNCTAD 2018). In economic literature, the term has been used in at least three senses, that is, the ability to quickly recover from a shock, to withstand the effect of the shock and to avoid the shock algorithm (Briguglio et al. 2009). Looking at the first sense, Dropniak (2012) explains the resilience of an economy as the ability of the cities’ economy to maintain a pre-existing shock level of growth, return to this pre-existing shock level of growth or completely change the economy structure and reach the pre-existing level of growth at least, after experiencing an external shock. The ability to withstand the effect of a shock algorithm was put forth in the definition of Hill et al. (2008) who define resilience as the ability of a region to successfully recover its economy from shock that either throw it off its growth path or has the potential to throw its growth path off. However, a region pre-shock’s growth path may not always be a desirable or an optimal one for the economy. A bounce back to that undesirable path is thus not a warranty for a region’s economic resilience. It is in this sense that Simmie and Martin (2010) define resilience as the capacity of a region or local economy to withstand or recover from market, competitive and environmental shocks to its developmental growth path, and if necessary by undergoing adaptive changes to its economic structures, its social and institutional arrangements, so as to maintain or restore its previous developmental growth path or transit to a new sustainable path characterised by a fuller and more productive use of its human, physical and environmental resources. The concept of the sustained growth path put forth by these authors brought out the avoidance of a future shock algorithm. This concept of sustainable development was however more elaborated by Angeon and Bates (2015) who approached resilience as the capacity of an economy to minimise welfare losses and reinforce its development potentials. To minimise welfare losses in an economy requires the mastering of its economic vulnerability and fighting to reduce it. It is in this sense that Caldera-Sanchez et al. (2016) approached resilience as the ability of an individual, a community or a country to reduce vulnerability, to resist to shocks and to recover quickly. Mastering the degree of transmission of shocks is thus very important in evaluating an economy’s growth path. Developing countries especially the SSA sub-region are vulnerable to shocks due to their less diversified exports, high dependency on primary products, and increase rate of poverty (UNCTAD 2018). According to this organisation, in the 1990s, many SSA countries were considered to be fragile. However, many of these countries today are gearing up towards actions that are development driven. The end of the cold war saw a turn in the world’s economy with SSA countries witnessing growth. The international community annulled the debts of highly indebted countries and good dispositions were put in place to better adapt development aids to the need of the countries. Following the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classification of 2014 based on the European Policy Institute Network (EPIN) scores,Footnote 1 many SSA countries have become fragile or remained fragile (Ivory coast, Burundi, Comoros, Eritrea, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, CAR, Sao Tome, Sierra Leone, Tchad, Togo and Zimbabwe), while others though fragile are in progress (Angola, DRC, Congo Rep and Liberia). Some SSA countries have remained stable throughout (Burkina Faso, Benin, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Cape Vert, Senegal, Tanzania, Zambia), whereas very few have become resilient (Cameroon, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Ouganda and Rwanda). It is in this vein that the IMF advocated for policies to reinforce the resilience of fragile economies in this sub-region. Implementing accurate resilient policy requires accurate mastery of the vulnerability of these economies. Vulnerability here is seen in the exposure of the economy to exogenous shocks while resilience is seen as the ability of the economy to recover or withstand such shocks. One of the well-known methods of analysing the resilience of economies in literature is the construction of composite indexes to capture both resilience and vulnerability. These include the works of Briguglio et al. (2009), Briguglio (2014, 2016), Bates et al. (2014) and Angeon and Bates (2015). These authors integrated the aspect of vulnerability in their analysis but using different methodologies and sets of indicators. In fact, Angeon and Bates (2015) end their study in 2009 and covered very few SSA countries, whereas SSA countries are more prone to adverse shocks compare to other developing countries (UNCTAD 2018). They attributed a peripheral dimension to economic resilience. However, Faulkner et al. (2020) argue that exposure (which is mostly peripheral) is attributed to vulnerability. The problem resulting from this study is thus to know and compare the level of resilience in SSA countries between 2006 and 2015. The contribution of this study is three folds: firstly, our study has adopted the methodology of the graph theory used by Angeon and Bates (2015) in our analysis. Secondly, we integrated vulnerability in our analysis using the vulnerability index proposed by Feindouno and Goujon (2016). Thirdly, we focus our study on SSA covering right up to 2015. The objectives of this paper are thus to construct and analyse a resilience index and a composite resilience-vulnerability index for SSA countries between 2006 and 2015. The rest of this paper is further divided as follows: the “Measuring Economic Resilience and Vulnerability: a Literature Review” and “Methodological Framework: Constructing the Economic Resilience Index and a Resilience-Vulnerability Composite Index” sections make a survey of literature and the methodology respectively, the “Application to SSA” section looks at a practical application on SSA economies and finally the “Conclusion” section concludes.",12

Sweidan,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Academics and policymakers agree that entrepreneurial activities have a significant contribution to economic growth, employment, and innovation in the world economy. It determines how quickly and precisely an economic system recognizes and responds to intrinsic profit opportunities in disequilibrium conditions (Harper 2003). The literature of entrepreneurship contains two dimensions of researches. The first one explores the factors that explain the variation of entrepreneurship rate (see, e.g., Audretsch et al. 2019; Urbano et al. 2019; Castaño et al. 2015; Rogers 2012; Acs et al. 2008; Shane,1996). This strand of research focuses on individual drivers, i.e., demographic factors, and on contextual drivers, i.e., economic and institutional factors,Footnote 1 while the second dimension investigates the influence of entrepreneurship actions on the economy (i.e., Acs et al. 2018; Koellinger and Thurik 2012; Audretsch 2007). The current paper contributes to the first dimension. In the US economy, entrepreneurial activities are the cornerstone to economic transactions because they do not only support economic growth and employment, but they are also consistent with the private sector doctrine. The available data of the US economy summarizes the strategic importance of these businesses. The private businesses contribute by 83% of all the U.S. jobs. The private sector activities with less than 500 workers participate by almost 39% of all the US jobs, whereas the businesses with more than 500 workers account for 43% of all the US employment. The employment of establishments with less than 500 workers formulates around 47% of the entrepreneurial events. Besides, their annual payroll is approximately 41% of the total annual payroll of establishments.Footnote 2 The total annual payroll of all the establishments is around $6.4 billion. The Great RecessionFootnote 3 of 2007 is a significant negative economic shock to the USA and world economies alike. During the period of the Great Recession, the average economic growth rate deteriorated by 1.34% in the US economy, and the unemployment rate reached 10.0% in some months.Footnote 4 Likewise, the number of entrepreneurial activities (staring new businesses) deteriorated remarkably during the Great Recession. The average growth rate of new businesses registered a negative rate of 5.1%. After that, the new business creation witnessed improvement and registered an average growth rate of 2.8%.Footnote 5 Under the federal institutional system, each state has its structure and constitution, and there are significant differences in economic rules and regulations (Campbell and Rogers 2007a). Therefore, our paper explores the ability of state-level economic institutions, i.e., economic freedom and its components, to explain the movements of the entrepreneurial rate after the Great Recession. More specifically, we examine the influence of economic policy structural differences between the U.S. states on the creation of new businesses during the period (2008–2017). Our paper focuses on state-level contextual drivers. It includes institutional factors (economic freedom and its components), economic growth indicators (economic development and unemployment rate), and potential profit opportunities factors (firms’ death rates). Moreover, our paper compares and contrasts the effect of state-level contextual aspects on the new businesses’ creation after the Great Recession. Our paper is silent regarding individual drivers or demographic factors. Our work contributes to the literature from two dimensions. First, contrary to the previous works, our paper shifts the empirical analysis to focus on the period after the Great Recession. Second, our paper evaluates, compares, and contrasts how the entrepreneurial rate responds to different motivations after the Great Recession. We employ panel data from 50 U.S. states to answer the paper’s questions. The current paper uses panel and dynamic panel analyses. More specifically, it employs three estimators: fixed effect model, panel-corrected standard errors method with states dummy variables, and one-step system GMM estimator. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. The “Literature Review” section reviews relevant literature about the link between economic freedom and the entrepreneurship events. The “Data and Methodology” section introduces the data and methodology of our study. The “Preliminary Estimates” section conducts some preliminary estimates before estimating our models. The “Results” section discusses the results and presents policy implications. Conclusions and policy implications are made in the “Conclusions and Policy Implications” section.",4

Margaritis,Constantinos P. Tsamadias,Elias E. Argyropoulos,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Economics stresses that education is the main institutional mechanism for the production, accumulation, and diffusion of human capital (knowledge, skills, attitudes, etc.). The upper secondary schools are production systems that use resources from the already constrained economy and provide a variety of outputs, outcomes, benefits, positive externalities, and spillovers. The real world, economic science, and applied policy show that scarce resources are competitively claimed. Their distribution on the public and private sectors and their optimal use by upper secondary schools to achieve their goals are critical issues not only for education but also for the economy. Estimating the efficiency and productivity of upper secondary schools can lead to the reduction of the wasted resources used and thus improve its achievements. The above is particularly important because of the expansion of education systems in the dynamic environment of the educational society. International theoretical and empirical literature on the above issues has been extensive in recent decades. The methods/techniques commonly used to measure the efficiency of educational units are the data envelopment analysis and the stochastic frontier analysis. Productivity change is measured by the Malmquist analysis. Greece is situated in Southeastern Europe, comprises a total area of 131,957 km2, and has a population of almost 11 million inhabitants. During the period 2015–2018, Greece was included in the support mechanism and implemented a restrictive fiscal policy that affected on inputs of upper secondary schools. The region of Central Greece has an area of 15,549 km2(11.8%) and a population of 547,390(5.07%) inhabitants. It consists of 5 regional units (Evia, Evritania, Fokida, Fthiotida, and Voiotia), which are further subdivided into 25 municipalities. There are 64 public homogeneous upper secondary schools operating in this region during the period under review. The region of Central Greece is a representative region among the 13 regions of the country since the main economic, social, and educational characteristics that most of them have are about average (Karatheodoros et al. (2016, 2019); ELSTAT (2014, 2018, 2019)). In Greece, the educational system has always been a very centralized one. Social demand for education increased during the period 1950 to 2018, and the public educational structures of all levels have at the same time expanded. Greek education, especially at the secondary level, has been oriented to a great extent toward general schooling. The milestone in the history of national education was the year 1975 when 9-year compulsory education was constitutionally established [the establishment of mandatory 9-year education (6-year primary and 3-year low secondary education) and optional 3 years in the upper secondary schools]. Since then, efforts have been made to reform and modernize educational structures of this level but progress has been slow. Educational qualifications in Greece are considered prerequisites for a successful professional career, both in the public and the private sector. The Greek educational system entered the twenty-first century facing a series of problems such as the low quality and low effectiveness of education at all levels, graduate unemployment, massive student exodus abroad, brain drain, misallocation of resources, regressive social transfers, and reduced human capital investment. Secondary education is an important form of investment in human capital. It has historically included economic growth as part of its core mission. It is a well-established fact that the quality of education matters more than quantity. The secondary education has contributed positively to the growth rate of the Greek economy (Tsamadias and Prontzas 2009) and to the economies of its 13 regions (Karatheodoros et al. 2016). The purpose of the paper is fourfold: First, to measure the relative efficiency and productivity change of the upper secondary schools in the Central Greece over the period 2016–2018. Second, to compare the performance of the upper secondary schools of the region in connection with the countries of the world, in particular the ones in the European Union. Third, to investigate if the environmental variables (the number of students in the upper secondary school (Z1), the school unit seat (Z2), the year the school started operating (Z3), number of boys in the classroom (Z4), pupil-teacher ratio (Z5), GDP per capita, per regional unit (Z6), variable returns to scale (Z7)) have effects on upper secondary schools’ performance. Fourth, to identify the upper secondary schools which perform higher than the average efficiency as well as the average overall productivity. These upper secondary schools can be used as benchmarks to improve the performance of other upper secondary schools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to measure the efficiency and productivity change of upper secondary schools in Greece. Two published papers (Maragos and Despotis (2016); Sotiriadis et al. (2015)) have evaluated only the efficiency for upper secondary schools regions. The main contribution of the paper is that for the first time in the international literature, the productivity change in upper secondary schools is calculated. Measuring the efficiency of upper secondary schools identifies inefficient schools and enables the competent authorities to reduce their wastage. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section “Introduction” presents a brief reference to the Greek secondary school system. Section “Review of Empirical Literature” provides a review of the empirical literature. Section “Methodology and Models” provides a short theoretical methodology and models. Section “Empirical Analysis” presents data and discusses our results. Section “Results and Discussion” presents environmental impact of DMUs on their efficiency (Tobit analysis). Finally, Section “Environmental Impact of DMUs on their Efficiency (Tobit Analysis)” presents the concluding remarks and policy implications.",2

Bengt-Åke Lundvall was the first scholar to use this term, noting that the idea was actually proposed by Friedrich List in his book The National System of Political Economy (List 1841). The collaboration between Chris Freeman, Richard Nelson and Bengt-Åke Lundvall in the International Federation of Institutes for Advanced Study (IFIAS) was crucial for the subsequent development of the concept. Three books pioneered the idea of the NIS: Technology Policy and Economic Performance: Lessons from Japan, by Freeman (1987), National Systems of Innovation: Towards a Theory of Innovation and Interactive Learning, edited by Lundvall (1992) and National Innovation System: A Comparative Analysis, edited by Nelson (1993). According to these pioneers, the NIS can be defined as ‘the network of institutions in the public and private sectors whose activities and interactions initiate, import, modify and diffuse new technologies’ (Freeman 1987, p. 1), ‘the organizations and institutions involved in search and exploring such as R&D departments, technological institutes and universities, but also all parts and aspects of the economic structure and the institutional setup affecting learning as well as searching and exploring’ (Lundvall 1992, p. 12) or ‘the set of institutions whose interactions determine the innovative performance of national firms’ (Nelson 1993, p. 4). These definitions imply that the NIS has two main objectives: (1) to show international differences or similarities in the ability of countries to innovate and be at the technological frontier and (2) to offer policy suggestions to support firms’ innovative activities (Vertova 2014). Since the concept was coined, an international body of literature has documented the growing influence of the NIS approach. Several supranational organisations, most notably not only the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) but also the European Union (EU) through the European Commission, as well as the World Bank, have embraced the concept of the NIS as an integral part of their analytical perspective. The innovation systems approach is also widespread in Scandinavia and Western Europe in academic and policymaking contexts (Lundvall et al. 2002). Academic studies of NISs initially aimed at understanding differences in technological development and the profiles of technological specialisation between countries. However, since the beginning of the 2000s, academic studies have increasingly focused on the relationship between the output of the innovation system and the factors that influence this system (e.g. Edquist 2004; Lundvall 2007; Bergek et al. 2008). Innovation, diffusion and use of technology, also known as technological dynamics, are the outputs of innovation systems, resulting from influences from abroad, activities within the business sector and interaction with other actors within society. A wide range of processes influence a country’s technological dynamics. These processes include knowledge, skills, demand, finance and institutions, and they are affected by numerous policies and actors (Fagerberg 2017). Consequently, NISs may differ greatly from one country to another, and a policy mix that works in one context may not suit another (Flanagan et al. 2011; Borras and Edquist 2013). In view of the extent of the literature, the main goal of this study is to structure a conceptual framework for this research field, identifying how the concept has been established in the literature and how it has evolved. This paper describes the foundations and evolution of the NIS literature, giving scholars a stronger and more holistic view of the systemic approach to innovation. We focus on a single research question: Based on the origins of the NIS, how has this research field evolved and what are its prospects? To answer this question, we use a literature review approach. This approach is based on robust empirical bibliometric analysis followed by qualitative analysis of core documents. Using the key bibliometric methods of performance indicators, science mapping of bibliographic coupling, co-citations and keyword co-occurrence, we identify the most productive and influential authors, institutions and countries, as well as the historical development of the literature and the main streams within it. Bibliometric analysis is also used as a basis for qualitative analysis of the core literature, which in turn is used to build the narrative for this study. This paper is structured as follows. The ‘Methods’ section describes the method. The ‘Results’ section presents the results. Finally, the ‘Conclusions’ section summarises the key conclusions.",13

Undoubtedly, a characteristic trait of the current economic climate is intense competition. Therefore, having a competitive advantage can help a company to survive and be more profitable than its competitors. Drucker (2003) emphasizes that in a global market, survival depends on innovation and the capabilities which companies develop. In this way, organizations must make use of dynamic capabilities such as knowledge absorptive capacity in order to be successful in dynamic marketplaces (Greenhill and Oppenheim 2017; Chen et al. 2010). Furthermore, the emergence of the new economy leads to the requirement for new, innovative processes within companies. This is a result of a variable, innovate marketplace which presents constantly new challenges. Recent studies (Wang et al. 2021; Pangarso et al. 2020; Limaj and Bernroider 2017; Adriansyah and Zakaria 2015; Leal-Rodríguez et al. 2014) give empirical evidence for the positive impact of absorptive capacity on innovation and, in turn, the positive impact of innovation on a company’s competitive advantage. Nevertheless, the literature gives evidence that a company’s absorptive capacity and capacity for innovation are closely linked to the goal of achieving a competitive advantage. There still exists a gap in the literature in the form of the mediating relationship of a company’s capacity for innovation, absorptive capacity and competitive advantage (Lane et al. 2006; Zahra and George 2002). Additionally, absorptive capacity has been studied as a simple cause-and-effect relationship between innovation and competitive advantage (Medase and Barrasa 2019; Zou et al. 2018). For this reason, studying a company’s capacity for innovation as an indirect or mediating variable may prove to be relevant in understanding how the relationship between absorptive capacity and competitive advantage tends to be stronger in a challenging variable marketplace. There is empirical evidence to suggest that innovation functions as a mediating variable when preceded by absorptive capacity (Zou et al. 2018). The theoretical framework for this research is Recourse-Based Theory and Dynamic Capabilities, which claim that strategic and valuable resources as well as an organization’s capabilities are sources of a sustainable competitive advantage (Wernerfelt 1984; Grant 1991, Barney 1991; Teece et al. 1997; Teece 2007; Barney et al. 2011). Competitive advantage is found in the capabilities which a company develop through resources which are intangible in nature. These resources are difficult to imitate owing to the intrinsic and intangible processes which depend on tacit knowledge and abilities (Wernerfelt 1984; Grant 1991). From this theoretical viewpoint, absorptive capacity is a collection of organizational routines and strategic processes through which companies acquire, assimilate, transform and exploit knowledge in order to create value, innovation and, ultimately, a competitive advantage. In this way, companies acquire knowledge from different sources and in different ways. The more a company exposes itself to internal and external sources of knowledge, the better opportunities it will have to develop absorptive capacity (Zahra and George 2002). Monferrer et al. (2014) and Pedroza and Ortiz (2008) mention that a company’s competitive advantage depends on a company’s dynamic capability to absorb new knowledge and innovate processes (Monferrer et al. 2014; Pedroza and Ortiz 2008). Knowledge is an essential strategic resource for generating value and competitive advantage (Grant 1996). Knowledge provides companies with the opportunity and ability to overcome challenges, make decisions and innovate (Ahuja and Katila 2004). Therefore, companies need to develop the capabilities to build a vast body of knowledge which is constantly being expanded internally and externally (Martelo-Landroguez et al. 2019). Absorptive capacity is a new strategy which contributes to a company’s ability to acquire and create knowledge (Lane et al. 2006; Liao et al. 2010). This, in turn, allows companies to strengthen the innovation capabilities and competitive advantage (Zahra and George 2002). Indeed, experts in strategic management have emphasized the importance of finding how to gain and maintain a competitive advantage. It needs to be something which is innovative, difficult to imitate and supported by the resource-based theory (Barney 2001). Traditional sources of competitive advantage, such as technology and financial capital, do not guarantee competitive efficiency. These can be replicated with relative ease (Sirmon et al. 2011). Therefore, this type of company needs to study new approaches to dynamic capabilities. In this way, knowledge, information and ideas can be acquired from company-external resources (Cohen and Levinthal 1989). The same is true of the capabilities acquired, assimilated, transformed and the knowledge exploited by companies. These lead to organizational capabilities and the discovery of new knowledge. Organizational capabilities and new knowledge are seen as resource-external innovation and sources of competitive advantage (Zahra and George 2002; Malhotra et al. 2005; Cohen and Levinthal 1994). Knowledge is a strategic resource that has the power to change individuals, companies and even nations. It can create wealth and prosperity and can be an important factor for the survival of a company which works within the framework of an economy based on knowledge (Liao et al. 2008). Supported by this theoretical argument, this research posed the following questions: Does absorptive capacity confer a competitive advantage in manufacturing? Does innovation capability mediate the relationship between absorptive capacity and a competitive advantage in manufacturing? To answer these questions, the aim is to investigate the mediating role of innovative capacity in the relationship between adsorptive capacity and competitive advantage in the manufacturing industry in the State of Mexico. The chosen methodology for this research project was quantitative, non-experimental, cross-sectional or transverse and confirmatory in design. The sample size was determined by way of convenience sampling. One hundred sixteen Mexican manufacturing companies were included in the study. The second-generation, multivariate analysis technique was employed, specifically variance-based structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The decision to choose PLS-SEM and not CB-SEM is justified by the fact that CB-SEM views constructs as common factor models (Hair et al. 2019). PLS-SEM is also the best option whenever variables in the model are composites or a mixture of composites and common factor variables (Rigdon et al. 2017; Sarstedt et al. 2017). Besides, this method is more powerful when testing the theory and when the research level is confirmatory. As such, it avoids bias (Hair et al. 2019; Henserler 2018). This study is original inasmuch as it is the first study to prove a compound “reflective-formative” model which incorporates strategic variables in the manufacturing industry. In this sense, this paper fills a gap in the literature. This article contributes to the literature by providing findings of how to gain and strengthen a competitive advantage based on the resources and dynamic capabilities of a company. The principal finding of this study is a mechanism capable of explaining the relationship between absorptive capacity and competitive advantage in the manufacturing industry. A predicted “cause and effect” relationship cannot be “real” effect owing to the fact that an influence (i.e. mediator) can describe the entire nature of the relationship. The findings have important theoretical implications. Firstly, absorptive capacity has a positive and significant effect on competitive advantage. Secondly, absorptive capacity has a positive and significant effect on innovation capability. Thirdly, innovation capability has a positive and significant effect on competitive advantage. Fourthly, innovation capability is a mediating variable in the relationship between absorptive capacity and competitive advantage. This paper is organized in the following way: firstly, the introduction outlines the importance of strategic variables for fostering competitivity. Secondly, a literature and theory review details the arguments which lead to the formulation of the hypotheses. Thirdly, a description of the methodology of this empirical study is provided. Fourthly, the results of hypothesis testing are given. Finally, findings and their implications are discussed, and suggestions are made for future research.",22

Within the PCAST Report (2011) and Europe 2020 strategy, ICT are viewed as one of the main pillars of economic growth, innovation, and job creation. As general-purpose technologies, ICT can alter product design, production, storage, marketing, finance management, and reorganization of the firm (Fabiani et al. 2005). They also increase productivity, by application of software and hardware (CAD/CAM, FMS…) in production, reduce coordination and transaction cost by Network communications (LAN, EDI, Internet, intranet, extranet, website), and enlarge the firms’ market size and their opportunities of growing (Arvanitis et al. 2016; Lucchetti and Sterlacchini 2004). Here, ICT are not limited to emerging technologies, specific sectors, or companies; it is rather composed of efficient, productive, highly integrated, closely controlled processes across a spectrum of globally competitive manufacturers and suppliers. Amable and Askenazy (2005) point out that we live in a particular stage of capitalism characterized by the generalization to the whole economy of a flexible production model organized around the technological (i.e., ICT), organizational, and human complementarities. ICT are, here, seen as a new techno-economic paradigm (Freeman and Perez 1988; Castellacci 2006; Perez, 2009) opening a vast innovation opportunity space and providing a new set of generic technologies, infrastructure, and organizational principles that can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the whole economy (Perez 2004, 2009). The flexible production model does not distinguish high technology from low technology, particularly in developing countries. The use of advanced technologies in all sorts of products, processes, and services can be more important, in terms of economic growth, job creation, and welfare improvement, than producing high technologies (World Bank 2010). This idea is also in the heart of the smart specialization strategy for innovation driven (Europe 2020) that wants the European Union to become a smart, sustainable, and inclusive economy (European Commission 2014). As a result, for a developing country like Tunisia, the economic growth, job creation, and welfare will depend less on the production of advanced technologies than on the adoption process of foreign advanced technologies. With a population of more than 11.5 million and a total land of 163,610 km2, Tunisia is located in the North Africa. Until 2010, Tunisia was one of the best performing countries in the MENA region and the most competitive economy in Africa. It was considered by the IMF and World Bank as a good “student” and as a role model to other developing countries (Nucifora and Rijkers 2014; Ben Khalifa 2017). However, the Tunisian Revolution that took place in January 2011 as a result of a high unemployment rate and deep regional disparities shows clearly the failure of Tunisian development model. Based on the comparative advantage of low labor costs in low-added value activities, Tunisian economy is stagnating in terms of productivity levels, product and market diversification, and job creation (Nucifora and Rijkers 2014). The 2011 revolution has shown that Tunisia cannot possibly continue using the same development model as before, notably in the knowledge and information era. Furthermore, with increasing wages and the power of the Labour Union (Tunisian General Labour Union) after the revolution, Tunisia stands to lose its comparative advantage of low labor costs. Tunisia needs a real transition to the digital economy—the economy based on the development and the use of digital technologies—to generate a sustainable and inclusive growth. In a world more connected than ever before, digital becomes the standard, essential, and expected component of any firm’s service offering. All firms in all business sectors have no choice: digitize or disappear. Aware of this reality, Tunisia aspires to become a regional hub in the field of information and communication technologies. In 2014, Tunisia launched the “Tunisia Digital 2020” National Strategic Plan. Tunisia Digital 2020 aims to make Tunisia an international digital reference and to make ICT an important lever for socioeconomic development. Through this strategy, Tunisia aims, among others, to improve the competitiveness of enterprises across all sectors by investing in ICT and positioning in the digital economy. It also plans to modernize its digital infrastructure by broadening the connection between businesses, homes, and public administration through high-speed broadband Internet connections. Currently, the Tunisian government is preparing to renew its digital strategy. In March 2019, it launched, with the collaboration of World Bank, the Digital Economy Country Assessment (DECA) Project. The DECA is focused on diagnostics of the current situation to provide the basic assessment of the current maturity level of the digital economy; to identify key gaps, challenges, and opportunities in digital economy development; and to identify areas that require more careful analysis before policy actions or investments (OCDE 2018). This diagnostic project will form the basis for renewed digital economy country strategy, “Tunisia Digital 2025.” We should recall here that the World Bank is now working with African countries under the Digital Economy for Africa (DE4A) initiative and other transitioning economies like Russia on Digital Economy Country Assessment, which will form the basis for digital economy country strategies. Within this context, a better understanding of the ICT diffusion process is central for successful implementation of the “Tunisia Digital 2025,” which one of its strategic axes consists of promoting ICT adoption by all business sectors and increasing firm innovation, productivity, and job creation. At a broader level, it could be also argued that the questions motivating this study are relevant to the firms and other developing countries that strive to enter into the digital age. Furthermore, the bulk of the literature has focused on developed economies, while evidence from developing countries is still scarce and fragmented (Grazzi and Jung 2019; Waters 2017). Thus, due to the poor infrastructure and development basis and the lack of technical, financial, managerial, and human resources, developing countries’ manufacturing is far away from their developed counterpart (Ben Khalifa 2016a; Parhi 2005). This study will fill this knowledge gap by exploring the determinant factors of ICT diffusion in Tunisia. The paper examines the main factors behind the inter-firm diffusion (adoption, i.e., first use of a new technology) and intra-firm diffusion (intensity of use by firms of a given technology) of three groups of ICT (Software, Hardware, and Network communications) among Tunisian manufacturing firms. To our knowledge, very few papers have investigated the determinant factors of ICT in Tunisian economy (Ben Youssef et al. 2010; Ben Khalifa 2016a, 2018). These few papers in the literature do not provide a comprehensive and complete overview on the ICT diffusion process in Tunisian economy. For example, the data used by Ben Youssef et al. 2010 goes back to 2004–2005, a period when the diffusion of ICT in Tunisia, as in most developing countries, is still in its early phase. Furthermore, this paper studied the intra-firm diffusion process, whereas it is rather the inter-firm diffusion, which will be the most appropriate in the early phases of the diffusion process. These limits are not without consequences on the relevance of the results found. Likewise, Ben Khalifa (2016a) used data from 2010 to 2011 and studied only the inter-firm diffusion of Network communications. The Ben Khalifa’s (2018) paper focuses mainly on the evaluation of the impact of subsidies on the intra-firm ICT diffusion using the matching method. By contrast, using a more recent dataset (2016 survey) and the main diffusion models (epidemic, rank, stock, and order models), our paper will give a complete overview on the ICT diffusion process since we investigate the determinant factors of both inter- and intra-firm diffusion of three ICT groups (Software, Hardware, and Network communications). Moreover, and more generally, the comparative analyses of the two diffusion processes are also rare in the ICT diffusion literature (Battisti et al. 2009; Hollenstein and Woerter 2008). Most of the studies are concerned with either inter-firm or intra-firm diffusion. Likewise, the previous studies do not distinguish between the different technological groups, implicitly assume that these groups are homogeneous, and follow the same diffusion scheme. These limits have produced conflicting results (we will come back to these results in the “Conceptual Framework and Model Specification” section). Therefore, by studying both the inter- and intra-firm diffusion process and the three groups of ICT, this work will certainly contribute to enrich the knowledge base on the process of ICT diffusion and remove the ambiguities raised by the previous studies. The analysis is based on industrial upgrading survey conducted in Tunisia in 2016 by the Ministry of Industry and Trade (Bureau of Industry Upgrading) and the Ministry of Development, Investment and International Cooperation (Tunisian Institute of Competitiveness and Quantitative Studies). From a sample of 238 manufacturing firms, we construct three indicators corresponding to three groups of ICT: Software, Hardware, and Network communications (NC). We also collect information on firm structural characteristics, firm absorptive capacity, and environment and organizational factors that may explain the inter- and intra-firm diffusion of ICT. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the conceptual framework and empirical model. Section 3 presents the dataset and the descriptive analysis of the ICT diffusion. Section 4 presents the estimation procedures and the empirical results. Section 5 discusses the contributions and policy implications. Finally, Section 6 concludes.",1

It has a noteworthy positive impact on national economies and affects the Gross National Product (GNP) per capita. Anvari and Norouzi (2016) identified the positive impact of E-commerce on the economy for a research sample of 21 countries. The expansion of opportunities for business-to-business and business-to-consumer E-commerce transactions at the national and international levels has revolutionized the marketplaces creating a fertile environment for new business development across several sectors (Taie and Alsalihy 2013). The development of mobile commerce and smartphone technology is a critical milestone that has expanded the E-commerce volume as consumers can now purchase products or services from their mobile devices (Sulisworo and Muqoyyanah 2018). The advancement of social commerce has boosted E-commerce engagement levels through product reviews, product co-design, and crowdsourcing (Roberts 2017). The global revenue for E-commerce is expected to reach $2,229,283 million in 2020, with an annual growth rate of 7.8% for the years 2020–2024, resulting in a market volume of $3,012,528 million in 2024 (Statista 2020). Previous studies have deeply explored the positive impacts of the E-commerce on the national economies and the negative impacts of the disruptive power on E-commerce leading to the business transformation in retailing, advertising, and traveling (Harrisson-Boudreau and Dahl 2017; Xiao et al. 2018). Other studies have investigated the influence of E-commerce in organizational structures; such as supply chain (Almaktoom 2016; Abhirup et al. 2016) or customer relationship management (Savita et al. 2011). A few studies have investigated the reverse impact of factors that can influence E-commerce development in a country or region. Rodríguez-Ardura et al. (2008) identified that the internet’s potential consumer market is an essential factor for E-commerce development in Spain. When online consumer market reaches a critical mass of potential customers, it creates investment opportunities in E-commerce. They also identify that such technological infrastructure, legal environment, and internet security positively influence the country’s E-commerce development. These results comply with an earlier study by Lee et al. (2001) in identifying security in the buying process and the regulatory environment for consumer’s legal protection as enforcing factors for E-commerce. Karimov (2013) also investigated the factors affecting E-commerce in the transition economies of Eurasia. He evaluated divergent E-commerce acceptance patterns based on the social and technical systemic weaknesses of each country. Most of the research work focuses on identifying factors at the national or regional level for E-commerce growth. The fact that digital economy has a global reach beyond national economies provides a significant lead to study the enabling factors for E-commerce from a wider angle. Markus and Soh (2002) have attempted to analyze the structural conditions (such as supply chains, regulatory frameworks) that makes each country competitive in the global arena of E-commerce. Furthermore, research has been conducted to reveal the positive relationship between innovation systems and E-commerce capacity (Hardilawati et al. 2019) at a microfirm level. This positive relationship is identifiable in a microfirm environment where functional dependencies can be determined and measured. However, at a macrolevel or national level, the socio-technical dependencies between innovation and E-commerce systems are becoming complex and the overlapping effects relationships (Wu and Hsia 2008) could be easily associated. The innovation systems cultivate as a socio-technical construct with an emphasis on the commercialization of knowledge. E-commerce intensifies the marketability of products and services. Since both systems share common characteristics, enablers that cause E-commerce entrepreneurship to grow when infused with an innovation building culture. While innovation systems are composed of complex processes from research to commercialization, E-commerce occupies a more constricted line of activities related to product or service acquisition. Innovations systems assemble a socio-technical structure of institutions, policies, empowered human capital, technological advancements, and intellectual intelligence that in return benefits the development of the knowledge economy. Our study aims to expand previous research, identify the structural characteristics of national innovation systems and E-commerce capacity, and find answers to these questions: Are there any specific structural characteristics in innovation driven knowledge economies that can advance the E-commerce capacity? What structural components of innovation systems can create a fertile environment for E-commerce uptake? (Hardilawati et al. 2019; Wu and Hsia 2008). Our study aims to expand previous research and identify the structural characteristics of national innovations systems that empower the E-commerce capacity utilizing the open data offered by the National Innovation Index (NII) and the World Bank regarding the National E-commerce index for 126 countries.",2
13.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,16 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00720-1,From Knowledge Ecosystems to Capabilities Ecosystems: When Open Innovation Digital Platforms Lead to Value Co-creation,March 2022,Tindara Abbate,Anna Codini,Demetris Vrontis,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The open innovation digital platforms (OIDPs) stimulate and support the firms’ openness (Chesbrough 2003) thanks to different functions, activities and services by allowing knowledge creation and sharing and innovation co-creation processes in their sophisticated virtual environments (Nambisan and Baron 2009; Abbate et al. 2019) and with their advanced information and communication technologies (ICTs) (Andreeva and Kianto 2012; Soto-Acosta and Cegarra-Navarro 2016; Del Giudice and Della Peruta 2016). They can be observed as “an important carrier for searching external knowledge” (Hossain and Lassen 2017, p. 55) and for activating valuable combinations of internal and external knowledge sources with the aim to foster the flow of collaboration and knowledge sharing and to co-create novel solutions to innovation problems (Aquilani et al. 2016). Concretely, these platforms can permit firms to explore external opportunities for acquiring, integrating, and transforming globally dispersed knowledge (i.e., Jeppesen and Lakhani 2010; Boudreau 2010), by expanding the possibilities to co-create innovative offerings with the contribution of diverse external parties. Even though existing literature focused on the investigation of the dynamics of two-sided platforms (Rochet and Tirole 2003; Economides and Katsamakas 2006; Eisenmann et al. 2006; Hagiu 2009), OIDPs—a specific kind of two-sided platforms (Esposito De Falco et al. 2017)—are scarcely examined. These platforms are mainly described as virtual environments in which heterogeneous entities are involved in knowledge transfer and integration processes to face open innovation challenges (Jeppesen and Lakhani 2010), where knowledge is considered the most strategic medium of interaction among ecosystem participants (Van der Borgh et al. 2012; Clarysse et al. 2014). Therefore, these knowledge ecosystems encourage complementarities in the value creation processes (Clarysse et al. 2014), resulting in search and combination of new knowledge more effective than those developed by individual participants acting alone (Järvi et al. 2018). In this respect, these platforms can be observed as open innovation intermediaries (OIIs), capable to perform different activities and tasks, ranging from linking a large variety of parties for collaboration to set up and mediate relationships and filling a wide array of knowledge, resource and competency gaps (Howells 2006; Randhawa et al. 2017, 2018; De Silva et al. 2018). Even though existing literature has investigated the role of these intermediaries in different open innovation processes (Chesbrough et al. 2006), not many studies until today have focused on the specific role of “co-creators” that OIDPs actively assume in the interactive coupled open innovation processes, by facilitating the “creation of open and collaborative ecosystems” (Santoro et al. 2018, p. 347). Similarly, scarce contributions have investigated the capabilities they need to develop for facilitating and sustaining firms willing to use digital platforms for their innovation activities when collaborating with external sources of knowledge and innovation (Randhawa et al. 2017). Specifically, the creation and management of OIDPs and the involvement, participation, and relationships among a large variety of interacting actors (Van der Borgh et al. 2012; Valkokari 2015; Järvi et al. 2018) force the development of specific capabilities deemed to enable and sustain co-innovation processes (Gawer and Cusumano 2002; Iansiti and Levien 2004; Teece 2018). Indeed, in the platform-based context, dynamic capabilities (Teece et al. 1997) enable organizations to generate new ideas, knowledge, and solutions with the contribution of external entities and to create and capture value from the innovation (Van der Borgh et al. 2012), by building and fueling their capabilities ecosystem. In order to fill these gaps in the existing literature, the paper intends to examine which types of capabilities open innovation digital platforms (OIDPs) have to develop to support co-creation in open innovation (OI) processes, by enabling the shift from knowledge ecosystems to capabilities ecosystems. In this perspective, we develop a conceptual paper that grounds on the major contributions available in the general literature focused on knowledge and capabilities ecosystems in the attempt to interpret and fine-tuning the emerging findings to the specific context of open innovation digital platforms and open innovation processes and provide important implications for this type of initiatives by formulating several research propositions. These propositions are focused on the specific dynamic capabilities—sensing, seizing, scanning, integrating, and transformative—needed to facilitate and support the interactive coupled open innovation processes essential for the firm involved in co-creation activities. This study contributes to both the OIDP capabilities and interactive coupled open innovation processes literature (Piller and West 2014) and advances some directions to bridge two hitherto separate field of research. Firstly, it offers an extended framework for OIDPs combining the dynamic capabilities and the interactive coupled open innovation processes literature. In detail, this framework is particularly suitable to the purpose of the study because the identified dynamic capabilities are central to support the open innovation processes with different external knowledge entities. Second, the study suggests a managerial outline to support practitioners in better understanding which type of capabilities are effectively relevant for the development of successful co-creation processes. Additionally, managerial implications are provided both for OIDPs developing the capabilities necessary to support OI processes and lead them to co-creation, both for firms selecting the OIDP suitable to support them in OI processes and leading to co-creation. The paper proceeds as follows. Next, it discusses the shift from knowledge ecosystems to capabilities ecosystems, by providing a useful scheme to observe the main differences between the mentioned ecosystems. Then, it examines the extant OIDPs literature, by identifying the required capabilities able to support the co-creation processes and developing several related research propositions. Finally, implications for future research and practice are discussed.",19

The COVID-19 pandemic represents an unprecedented global crisis. Analysts make comparisons with the Great Depression of the 1930s. The COVID-19 pandemic recession is materially different to both the 2008–2009 global financial crisis (GFC) recessions and the 1930 Great Depression for several reasons. The most important distinction between the COVID-19 pandemic recession and the other two is the role of money and credit; throughout the GFC and the Great Depression, there was a significant contraction in money and credit, whereas now there is a historic expansion in money and credit. Much more typically, recessions result from some imbalances in the economy, either in the financial sector or the real economy, which have to be rebalanced. There were no such imbalances in this recession. There was instead a government-imposed lockdown in order to suppress the transmission of the coronavirus, resulting in a large shock to demand (Greenwood and Burton 2020). The COVID-19 outbreak (previously 2019-nCoV) was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This outbreak was triggered in December 2019 in Wuhan City in Hubei Province of China. COVID-19 continues to spread across the world. Initially, the epicenter of the outbreak was China with reported cases either in China or being travelers from China. While some countries have been able to effectively treat reported cases, it is uncertain where and when new cases will emerge. Amidst the significant public health risk COVID-19 poses to the world, the World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a public health emergency of international concern to coordinate international responses to the disease. It is, however, currently debated whether COVID-19 could potentially escalate to a global pandemic (McKibbin and Fernando 2020). In a strongly connected and integrated world, the impacts of the disease beyond mortality (those who die) and morbidity (those who are incapacitated or caring for the incapacitated and unable to work for a period) have become apparent since the outbreak. Amidst the slowing down of the Chinese economy with interruptions to production, the functioning of global supply chains has been disrupted. Companies across the world, irrespective of size, dependent upon inputs from China have started experiencing contractions in production. Transport being limited and even restricted among countries has further slowed down global economic activities. Most importantly, some panic among consumers and firms has distorted usual consumption patterns and created market anomalies. Global financial markets have also been responsive to the changes and global stock indices have plunged. Amidst the global turbulence, in an initial assessment, the International Monetary Fund expects China to slow down by 0.4 percentage points compared to its initial growth target to 5.6%, also slowing down global growth by 0.1 percentage points (OECD 2020). Many studies have found that population health, as measured by life expectancy, infant and child mortality, and maternal mortality, is positively related to economic welfare and growth (Bhargava et al. 2001; Bloom and Sachs 1998; Bloom et al. 2005). There are many channels through which an infectious disease outbreak influences the economy. Direct and indirect economic costs of illness are often the subject of the health economic studies on the burden of disease. The conventional approach uses information on deaths (mortality) and illness that prevent work (morbidity) to estimate the loss of future income due to death and disability. Losses of time and income by carers and direct expenditure on medical care and supporting services are added to obtain the estimate of the economic costs associated with the disease. This conventional approach underestimates the true economic costs of infectious diseases of epidemic proportions which are highly transmissible and for which there is no vaccine (e.g., HIV/AIDS, SARS, and pandemic influenza). The experience from these previous disease outbreaks provides valuable information on how to think about the implications of COVID-19. Given the recent study conducted by Alemayehu Geda about the social and economic impact of COVID-19 in Ethiopia and using local and global media-based information and information obtained from interaction with some of the industry actors as well as his own research about the Ethiopian economy, one can understand and come up with the possible economic impact of the virus on the country. That study noted that GDP may contract by 11.2% in 2020/2021 fiscal year (that runs from July 2020 to June 2021) if the economic effect of the virus lasts until the end of 2020. In the best-case scenario of the effect of the virus being limited to the first quarter of the next Ethiopian fiscal year 2020/2021, the GDP may contract by 5.6% instead. In the worst-case scenario of the effect hanging around for the coming three quarters, the decline in growth could be as high as 16.7%. Alemayehu Geda (Geda 2020) notices that the government’s related latest forecast of economic growth for the coming 2020/2021 fiscal year is 8.5%. It is not clear whether the possible impact of COVID is taken into account in this forecast. If it is not, the government needs a growth rate of 19.7% (i.e., 11.2 + 8.5) to attain this 8.5% level of economic growth with the COVID effect included, and this is completely unrealistic. On the other hand, if the possible effect of COVID is not taken in this forecast, the growth, including the COVID effect, will be − 2.7% (that is, almost a 3% decline) under the average scenario that we have envisaged in this study (in the best-case scenario of a 5.6% economic decline due to COVID, this could be a 3% growth of the economy in 2020/2021). Apart from such gloomy picture of growth in 2019/2020, the Ethiopian economy is also characterized by significant macroeconomic instability and precarious balance of payment (and hence foreign exchange problem) condition even before the onset of the economic effect of COVID-19. Understanding the above horrors of COVID-19 and looking back to macroeconomic variables are a crucial moment. However, the current review may not deliver you with full information on the pandemic and its impact on all macroeconomic variables. For specification, we aimed at reviewing Ethiopian gross domestic product, unemployment, inflation, and fiscal and monetary economics or macroeconomic policy variables which can cause economic instability or crises in conjunction with the coronavirus outbreak in Ethiopia. Therefore, this review article is in a position to give brief information on the current pandemic relative to some important macroeconomic variables in a country.",10

Al-Gharaibeh,Mostafa Z. Ali,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Research proposes several definitions for knowledge. One practical definition that relates to organizational performance identifies knowledge as the capability of choosing and implementing a rational action for a certain purpose (Guo and Sheffield 2006). The term experts refer to organizational members with high level of job-related knowledge. The Dreyfus’ five-stage model of adult skill acquisition (Dreyfus and Dreyfus 1986) proposes five stages through which an expert develops his expertise: (1) novice, (2) advanced beginner, (3) competence, (4) proficiency, and (5) expertise. The authors attribute the escalation through the stages to a change in the individual’s mode of skill acquisition. A mode of analytical learning gradually replaces a mode of procedural or instructional learning. Thus, it is not only the amount of knowledge that makes a person an expert; moreover, it is the way he views and formulates problems (Suzuki and Harnisch 1995). A business situation could embrace many interdependent factors for which causes and effects are not obviously related. When dealing with such situations, individuals need to assess critically. Knowledge management (KM) emerged as a discipline for formalizing organizational practices that would guide an individual through the skill acquisition journey as effectively and efficiently as possible. The KM research identifies several KM processes including knowledge creation, knowledge acquisition, knowledge sharing, knowledge storage, and knowledge application (Gumus 2007). Some researchers argued that acquisition, sharing, and application are the fundamental knowledge processes (Karkoulian et al. 2013). Others like Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) developed a model that explains knowledge creation based on four processes: socialization, internalization, combination, and internalization. Socialization could be related to Dreyfus’ model of skill escalation through analytical learning since it involves the transfer of tacit knowledge through a social-based process. Thus, socialization is a process demanding knowledge networks to ensure employees get opportunities to share knowledge (McGurk and Baron 2012). Although KM manages individuals’ learning, the organization as an entity needs also to be able to learn (Watkins and Golembiewski 1995). The KM processes that advance individuals’ collective knowledge are not appropriate to support organizational learning. According to Senge (1994), organizational learning processes should support five concepts: (1) shared vision, (2) mental models, (3) team learning, (4) personal mastery, and (5) systems thinking. Kim (1993) developed a model linking personal learning with organizational learning. According to the author, the implementation of a learning organization is confronted with a nontechnical obstacle. Organizational politics turns KS into a game. Those who work in teams and decide to share their knowledge perceive their personal knowledge as power, which makes KS a surrender of personal competitive advantage (Cameron 2000; Anand et al. 2020). On the other hand, those who continuously hoard are selfishly accumulating more competitive advantage. Research have showed that the initial KS intention is affected by cultural values. Multinational organizations with diverse cultural backgrounds would have a mixture of sharers and hoarders. As individuals start their engagement in KS activities, they would be applying their initial KS intention. This initial intention would be modified by personal enjoyment as an intrinsic factor and by sense of reciprocity and rewards as extrinsic factors. These effects on the knowledge transmitter do not have constant values across the several rounds of KS activities. Meaning, the values are dependent on the evolving behavior of the opponent individual. Thus, while a knowledge sharer would be described as cooperative with a certain opponent, he would in parallel demonstrate defective behavior with another opponent. This reveals that a KS intention is actually a dynamic state within a KS strategy (Rapoport and Chammah 1965). Rapoport and Chammah (1965) described five strategies for cooperation. Three of them have cooperation as the initial intention, while one strategy starts with a defection intention. The fifth strategy selects its first intention randomly. These strategies describe the cooperation dynamics over a series of cooperation opportunities involving different interacting strategies. The strategies take a game-theoretic perspective towards an individual’s intention. The individual is a player in a game where he starts with an initial intention, but as he develops experience, his intention becomes reactive to his opponent’s intention. These strategies coincide with the KS research revealing the effect of interpersonal trust among team members. The trustworthiness of the hoarders, by their team members, would decay over time reaching a threshold level below which they would be denied of receiving new knowledge. Accordingly, as a person’s trustworthiness among his team members erode, we should expect him to start receiving less knowledge. If every player eventually turns into a defector, the process of KS would stall. This state is against the implementation of organizational learning. Game theory, being multiplayer decision theory, has an unmined potential as a tool for studying and analyzing organizational cooperation and conflicts of KS. The choice of a player would affect his own utility as well as the utility for opponent players; hence, this would affect decision behavior (Gintis 2009). In the case of a two-player game, we represent the decisions and the utility in a 2 × 2 matrix. The matrix produces four quadrants in which the utility for both players is inserted. The most famous example for a one-round game is the Prisoner’s Dilemma (PD). The one-round game assumes that a player has no knowledge of his opponent’s intention and thus would make his decision solely on the perceived personal utility. The analysis of PD leads to concluding that it has one Nash equilibrium situation that is in the case when both players defect. However, when the two players repeatedly play the game, the PD representation becomes inadequate. This is because each player has now an experience with his opponent’s intentions. This latter game has been described as the Assurance Game (AG) (Fehr and Gachter 2000). Interestingly, AG has two equilibria situations, when both players defect or when both players cooperate. This paper is an attempt to improve the understanding of the dynamics of KS. We start by improving the simple perception of individuals as either knowledge sharers or hoarders. For this purpose, we embrace Rapoport and Chammah’s (1965) five cooperation strategies in which continuous sharing and continuous hoarding are two of these strategies along with tit-for-tat, unforgiving, and random strategies. The concept of KS strategy is able to accommodate the current literature as well as paving the way to enrich the understanding of the dynamics of KS. Intrinsic motivations affect an individual’s selection of his KS strategy. Included in these factors are the cultural factor and the individual’s perceived utility of the KS process, such as enjoyment. On the other hand, the literature has identified extrinsic factors such as reciprocity and organizational rewards. We are proposing a KS framework that revolves around the concept of KS strategy. Both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations either affect the selection of the strategy or provide feedback for strategy implementation. A good start in the application of this approach would be to establish a baseline KS behavior, that is, a behavior with no organizational intervention. We are establishing this baseline behavior by developing a KS framework with an individual’s utility perception that is free from organizational rewards. Regardless of the KS strategy, an individual uses his own perceived utility function to decide for each KS opportunity whether to share or hoard. Rational action theory (RAT) explains the KS decision by theorizing that an individual would make a sharing decision when benefits of sharing exceed its costs. In our proposed KS framework, we recognize the following elements to be the traded benefits and costs: (1) knowledge, (2) competitive advantage, and (3) trustworthiness. Again, organizational rewards are not considered in order to achieve the purpose of examining the dynamics of intervention-free KS. We develop two utility functions: (1) knowledge utility function and (2) trustworthiness utility function. The former represents the exchange of knowledge and competitive advantage, while the latter represents the exchange of trustworthiness. The last step is to insert this setup within a game framework. This is important to capture how the utility function is used with different opponent strategies. In every round of the game, the player facing a KS decision will assess his utility in this situation with a specific opponent. According to Wolfe and Loraas (2008), regardless of incentive type, the incentive utility must be perceived sufficient in order to promote a sharing decision. Although PD is the most famous game, it cannot provide a suitable framework because it does not support the concept of reciprocity. PD assumes that the players play only one round, and thus the rational action would lead both players to defect and reach the one equilibrium situation. However, the AG is memory based, as it assumes that the same players will meet over several rounds, and thus the concept of reciprocity is implemented. A player will start with a positive KS intention and will maintain it for as long as he trusts that the opponent has a sufficient level of trustworthiness. Our KS framework implements reciprocity through three mechanisms: (1) individuals with tit-for-tat KS strategy, (2) individuals with unforgiving KS strategy, and (3) individuals with cooperative KS strategy and sufficient trustworthiness level. Finally, we setup parameters for the utility functions and prepare our framework for simulation. The result that we are monitoring is the progress of a strategy’s percentage contribution to collective knowledge, which is the raw material for organizational learning. For a baseline scenario, it is fair to assign equal number of individuals for each strategy, 20 players. This scenario implies that about 70 individuals will start the game with a sharing intention and 30 players with a hording intention. In this scenario, the defective strategy performed the poorest. In the second scenario, we increased the number of defectors to 50 while maintaining 20 individuals in the other strategies. This equalizes the number of initial sharers and hoarders. This formation enhanced the performance of the defectors against the random strategists, but not against other types of strategists. Moreover, the knowledge progression graphs revealed that competition laid between the two strategies of cooperative and tit-for-tat, with long-run supremacy for cooperative. Hence, we attempted a third scenario with number of tit-for-tat players increasing to 50 and for other strategies maintained at 20 players. This gave more supremacy for tit-fir-tats on the short run, yet cooperative players eventually took over the lead. All other scenarios would lead to the same long-run conclusion but with different short-run relative performances. The simulations with our proposed KS framework reveals that when a group of individuals with different KS strategies are engaged in a series of KS activities, they will eventually settle in two equilibria states, as the assurance game suggests. All players with cooperative strategy continue learning at an increasing rate and would thus be contributing the highest percentage of collective knowledge. All other strategies, regardless of their initial KS intention, will converge towards a poor state of learning with poor contribution to collective knowledge. This conclusion challenges the common hoarding wisdom that “knowledge is power.” On the contrary, it shows that “knowledge sharing is power.” It seems that the wisdom depends on which window in time you examine the KS behavior. Our simulation shows that many rounds of KS activities are required for the advantages of KS to payoff. It is this big time lag that is discouraging the adoption of the cooperative strategy. Future expansion on this research would add organizational rewards to the perceived utilities and test the added motivation on the baseline behavior that we have established. As a preliminary preparation for a longitudinal verification study, we attempted a survey-based empirical study. The results verified the divergence of KS intentions among residential physicians in a teaching hospital along two trends towards two equilibrium situations as the AG suggests. Also, individuals with initial sharing intentions expressed a decrease in their trust towards their colleagues, with an increase in their sensitivity against repeated defections. Decrease in trustworthiness was .053 in correlation with decreases in KS intentions among junior residents, yet they were .45 in correlation among senior residents.",9

Firm-Level Evidence from Tunisia,March 2022,Hanen Sdiri,Mohamed Ayadi,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Innovation is generally known as the key factor in firms’ competitiveness. It is also the major driver of countries’ economic development. There are a considerable number of theoretical and empirical academic studies dealing with innovation. Many of them have focused on analyzing the relationship between innovation and firms’ economic performance.Footnote 1 Other works have been interested in identifying the factors boosting companies to innovate.Footnote 2 On the other hand, very few are the studies that have investigated the magnitude of the barriers to innovation. These barriers contribute to preventing innovation and slowing down its process (e.g., lack of funding, difficulties in finding skilled employers, legislative barriers, and inability of cooperating with good partners). Mohnen and Rosa (2001) used survey data on Canadian firms to identify factors that explain the perception of barriers in the communications, finance, and technical service industries. In addition, Mohnen et al. (2008) studied the importance and the effect of financial constraints on innovation in the case of Dutch firms. Recently, Sandra (2013) has identified barriers to organizational innovation.Footnote 3 She based her analysis on the study of 35 semi-directive interviews conducted in six French industrial firms. Although the aforementioned studies point to the existence of factors that inhibit innovation, they nevertheless give little importance to the obstacles related to a country’s institutional quality, namely corruption. Corruption has always been among the most important concepts that economists and practitioners have debated for decades. The majority of them have been interested in analyzing its causes and consequences. They have also provided some policy considerations and solutions to this practice. The major questions they have mainly addressed are the following: is corruption always harmful? If so, how to reduce and/or avoid it? What are the tools to battle it? Corruption is ascribed numerous definitions. For instance, Transparency International defines it as “the abuse of entrusted power for private gain. It can be classified as grand, petty and political, depending on the amounts of money lost and the sector where it occurs”.Footnote 4 The World Bank regards it as “the single greatest obstacle to economic and social development. It undermines development by distorting the role of law and weakening the institutional foundation on which economic growth depends”.Footnote 5 Corruption has several forms, such as bribery, extortion, fraud, falsification, and informal practices. As shown in the literature, corruption has no precise economic impacts (for further details, see the literature review below). Some works regard it as a good contributor to the economic growth and performance. In this vein, it was argued that its effect can be positive in some situations. For instance, bribes can be used to improve the quality of public services. The main argument stipulating that corruption can have beneficial effects is known as the “grease the wheels” hypothesis. Other works link corruption to the worst way through which political and public decision-makers govern the country’s affairs; corruption has then a tendency to harm the nations’ well-being. Under a corrupt system,Footnote 6 the wealth of the nation is, typically, in the hand of a limited number of corruptors who somewhat handle and manage institutions to the latter’s best interests. The negative consequences of corruption can be perceived at the micro and macro levels. At the micro-level, corruption reduces firms’ competitiveness and limits their market power. In this setting, Antonio and Bob (2014) argue that “Firms have no incentive to improve product quality, and the productivity gains and innovation that would come from new firms is halted. In other words, [corruption] undermines the competitiveness of the economy, hampering investment and the creation of jobs”.Footnote 7 At the macro-level, corruption is a factor of economic recession. It decreases the GDP per-capita, lowers the economic development, intensifies social instability, implies higher unemployment and inflation rates, etc. (Mauro 1995; Fisman and Svensson 2007; Beltrán 2016). It may also inhibit the foreign direct investors (Wei 2000; Egger and Winner 2005). It strengthens the informal economy which, in turn, undermines the public-private relationships. Although entrepreneurs have always a tendency to overcome the corruption magnitude through undertaking innovation efforts, corruption per se remains an obstacle and/or a big problem that impede these efforts. Actually, the relationship between corruption and innovation is considered a new topic. It is a groundbreaking issue to which intellectuals in the field are going to pay a particular attention. As proven in the literature, corruption in the developed countries has been, in some way, effectively contained (Dirienzo and Das 2014). However, scholars have shown that corruption is becoming a dominating phenomenon in the third world. Thus, it is well-observed that the intensity of corruption is larger in the developing and/or emerging countries. This is linked to the weak social, economic, and political infrastructures in these countries. For instance, according to the enterprise survey realized by the World Bank in 2013, 54.78% of Egyptian companies identify corruption as a major or serious problem and 45.18% of Moroccan firms consider corruption as a severe constraint. Tunisia, our case of study, also suffers from corruption. In 2019 and according to the CPI of Transparency International, Tunisia is ranked the 74th among 180 countries and territories in terms of corruption.Footnote 8 According to the Global Financial Integrity (hereafter GFT), the Tunisian GDP decreases yearly by 2% because of corruption. GFT assessed that Tunisia has lost 1.2 billion dollars every year between 2000 and 2008. This is caused by bribes, subordination, and falsification of the criminal activities.Footnote 9 This bad practice is mainly related to the corrupt political systems that had governed Tunisia before the 2011 Revolution and even during the democratic transition. The country’s resources and the education systems have also deteriorated. Furthermore, the wealth distribution is distinctly oriented to the coastal regions where resident and foreign capitalists are willing to invest.Footnote 10 As argued by Yahyaoui (2009): “Those in power enjoy an aura of prestige and privilege, which sets them above the law and ordinary people. They allow bribery and irregularity, and manipulate public money, which eventually lead to corruption, smuggling boom, and the rise of parallel trade, counterfeit goods, which is often based on the ascendant crime networks”.Footnote 11 Tunisian companies have always had a tendency to increase their R&D efforts to lower their marginal production costs (i.e., process innovation; aiming to achieve economies of scale) and therefore to obtain competitive advantage in the final market (market power).Footnote 12 These companies seek to improve the quality of their products and thus increase the range of the varieties on the market (i.e., product innovation; to extract the consumers’ surplus). Thus, the extent to which corruption is an obstacle to the innovation activities is likely to be their main concern. The post-Revolution governments have devoted larger efforts to help Tunisian firms to enlarge their innovation portfolios. For instance, the use of the new ICT becomes remarkable and the R&D-related reform programs are increasing. Yet, the corrupt system continues to be solid. It reaches the majority of the business activities, in particular those related to the R&D and innovation activities. The corrupt officials cooperate with lobbies and politicians in order to prevent the rising of new products and technological processes that do not belong to the lobbies’ coalition. In Tunisia, to reinforce the links within the innovation system, policies do exist but the innovation ecosystem is still emerging. According to the Strategic Economic and Social Development Plan,Footnote 13 the reforms will be oriented towards the constitution of a national innovation system, with the creation of techno-parks and the establishment of partnerships between universities, firms, and research institutes. The aim is to attract investment in activities with high added-value technologies. Thus, the investigation of the Tunisian innovation ecosystem shows strong incentives for the development of ICT sectors. This holds even if many obstacles exist, in particular the ineffectiveness of the implementation of political plans and the lack of cooperation between the public and private sectors. Despite the abundance of the literature on innovation, the analysis of the relationship between innovation and corruption remains a noteworthy issue. Empirical studies on this relationship are rather limited for developing countries, Tunisia in particular. Therefore, it is necessary to empirically investigate the hypothesis claiming that corruption can alter Tunisian firms’ innovation. 
The scope of this paper is then to analyze the extent to which (process or product) innovation accentuates or mitigates the corruption obstacle for Tunisian firms.
 To address this issue, we organize our paper as follows. “Innovation and Corruption: Literature Review” presents a literature review on the relationship between innovation and corruption. “The Empirical Model” contains a description of the data set, the variables used in the empirical analysis and the econometric model. “Estimation Results” analyzes the main results. “Conclusions, Implications, and Future Research” is devoted to conclusions, implications and future research.",2

The markets are no more utility driven, rather more experience driven (Camilleri & Neuhofer, 2017), which has led to occurrence co-creation of value (Chathoth et al., 2016). Creating customer centric experiences is the final target of service offerings and organizations (Verhoef et al., 2009). Building better customer experience is the step to more satisfied customers, leading to firm loyalty (Grewal et al., 2009; Klaus & Maklan, 2012). The advanced peer–peer business models, supported by new digital platforms, engage customers to collaboratively make use of resources (Eckhardt & Bardhi, 2015). Some of the running examples are ridesharing (e.g. RelayRides, Uber, Ola cabs) and the sharing of accommodation (e.g. Oyo rooms, Goibibo, Trivago, Airbnb), dining (e.g. Kitchit, EatWith), local delivery (e.g. Bluedart, Instacart, Postmates, Bigbasket), tours (e.g. Vayable, Blablacar, Tripforeal, Triplt) and even pets (e.g. Rover, BorrowMy-Doggy). Although sharing is no newer to the customers, corporates have recently started working business models of sharing economy. Especially the young entrepreneurs are trying their hands of it (Botsman & Rogers, 2010). Sharing economy is characterized by no ownership, temporary access and reallocation of material goods or less tangible assets such as time, money, or area (Kathan et al., 2016). Sharing gives customers a platform to use products and services which they might not have afforded or choose not to take ownership (Bardhi & Eckhardt, 2012). According to Puschmann and Alt (2016), sharing of resources is loved by the customers due to the attached added benefits like low price for the services, convenience of use, environmental sustainability and above all a contract of traditional ownership model. The eminence of sharing economy as a concept and business model is supported well by the concurrent developments in the technology especially with respect to IT. The business models driven by shared economy are a result of consumption patterns driven by sustainability and re-urbanization (Bardhi & Eckhardt, 2012; Mohlmann, 2015). Competitive advantage of a sharing economy can be well explained using the service–dominant logic, where service generates value leading to satisfied customers (Kuo, Wu & Deng, 2009). Such customers eventually make repeat purchases and become loyal customers. Customer value is one of the most important factor in this relationship and focusses on what customers had perceived and what benefits finally they have received. According to Zhang et al. (2018) through the customer value, firm can understand the success and innovativeness of the entrepreneurial endeavors. Some recent researches suggest a collaborative contribution of all stakeholders to contribute in value co-creation for the business. Value co-creation is defined as creation of different types of the values (both for the customer and for the company) using various processes like B2B, B2C, C2C or C2B with various actors (customer/company) (Alves et al., 2016). Value co-creation (VCC) is a budding concept that has gained attention recently, especially with service markets. The concept focusses on collaboration and benefits for multiple stake holders in the businesses (Prahalad & Ramaswamy, 2000). Recent studies have also tried to explore sharing economy models from a value co-creation perspective; however, the work is limited (Hamari et al., 2016). Prior research of VCC in context to customer relationships has not provided a consistent theoretical perspective, thus leaving a gap to explore the construct even more (Cova et al., 2011; Ford, 2011; Grönroos, 2012; Leroy et al., 2013). Understanding that the new business world is going to see a surge in such business models, it is important to delve deeper and examine the relationships. With so many benefits discussed above, sharing economy as a business model has a tremendous potential to succeed in the future. Industries in retail, hospitality, media etc. will surely be affected by this new model of consumption (Ismail et al., 2014). Academia as well as corporates are trying to understand customer-centric experiences that drive value creation. But majorly, the research centers on customer–supplier relationships (Chathoth et al., 2016; Ramaswamy, 2011), while very few studies explore customer–customer (C2C) value creation (Rihova et al., 2015; Smaliukiene et al., 2015). Understanding the gap, the research gap, the current research explores the construct of shared economy and extends the C2C value co-creation in the sharing economy context. Although shared economy is spread over across many services, the current research restricts it to ride sharing (Uber and Ola), which is the prime sharing service in India. The current research is driven by the following research objectives. Exploring the literature on ride sharing in Indian context. To explore the drivers of value co-creation of sharing economy. To suggest implications for the budding entrepreneurs to co-create value in the C2C context of ride sharing.",6
13.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,02 February 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00733-w,Mapping the Relationship Between Critical Thinking and Design Thinking,March 2022,Jonathan D. Ericson,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Critical thinking skills are highly valued in higher education (Dym et al., 2005) and in today’s competitive job market (Hogland-Smith, 2017; Levin, 2018; Montini, 2014; Reed, 2018). At the same time, graduates of design, engineering, entrepreneurship, and general business degree programs increasingly use design thinking methods to develop novel products, environments, services, and systems (Benson & Dresdow, 2014; Lancione & Clegg, 2015; Zidulka et al., 2018). Although these two modes of thinking are currently central areas of focus across many institutions in both higher education and in industry, they have evolved along largely independent lines and, as a result, they have not been explicitly integrated with one another. Based on a mapping an analytical comparison of the two modes, this paper argues that design thinking can offer educators creative new approaches to engaging students in critical thinking, and that critical thinking needs to be more explicitly integrated into product design and development methods. Although scholars have argued that the cognitive processes associated with design can help students develop critical thinking skills (e.g., Razzouk & Schulte, 2012), critical thinking is generally not an explicitly discussed feature of the design thinking process. This is problematic because product design and development efforts can have significant adverse social, economic, and environmental impacts (Joyce & Paquin, 2016). High-profile product mishaps vividly illustrate the need for critical thinking in product development. Consider Microsoft’s artificial intelligence (AI) Twitter bot, Tay, who posted “a deluge of incredibly racist messages… use[d] racial slurs, defende[ed] white-supremacist propaganda, and call[ed] for genocide” (see Price, 2016). Tay’s unfortunate biases and reprehensible statements can be traced to at least two essential factors. First, despite defensive arguments to the contrary and despite their perceived autonomy, AI systems are designed systems: AIs like Tay may operate relatively independently once their initial algorithmic structure has been specified, but that algorithmic structure is initially defined by human beings. That is, an AI’s intelligence is “parasitic” on the intelligence of its human creators (cf. Searle’s 1980, 1983, and 1992 arguments concerning intentionality). Second, AIs like Tay are generally “trained” to define and calibrate their behavior by absorbing real-world collections (or “corpuses”) of data—for example, actual human writing, speech, or images. Thus, the actions of AIs are not the actions of truly autonomous computational agents. On the contrary, their actions are fundamentally rooted in decisions made by human beings, and in the misguided values and biases that pervade human thought and discourse. The case of Tay illustrates that both businesses and society in general stand to benefit from a more explicit infusion of critical thinking into both the educational process, and into the product development methods that are used to drive innovation. A formal mapping between related aspects of critical thinking and design thinking could be used to guide empirical academic research programs that could, in turn, improve business practices in ways that support smart, sustainable, and inclusive growth (Carayannis & Rakhmatullin, 2014). In particular, such a mapping could support more resilient growth by supporting knowledge exchanges across the major pillars of university, industry, and civil society, consistent with innovation helix architectures (Carayannis & Rakhmatullin, 2014). The present article aims to address this gap in the literature by providing a detailed preliminary mapping between (a) generally accepted components of critical thinking, and (b) widely used design thinking methods (Table 1). Definitions of both critical and design thinking remain the subject of lively debate (Halonen, 1995; Reine, 2017). The analysis presented in the present article is most closely aligned with action-oriented definition of critical thinking (e.g., Halonen, 1995: “the propensity and skills to engage in activity with reflective skepticism focused on deciding what to believe or do”), and with Brown’s (2021) definition of design thinking (“a human-centered approach to innovation—anchored in understanding customer’s needs, rapid prototyping, and generating creative ideas”). The article is structured as follows. First, eleven essential components of critical thinking (Hitchcock, 2018) are discussed in relation to specific design thinking methods, and for each component of critical thinking, examples of associated design thinking methods are discussed to elucidate the relationship between design thinking and critical thinking. In addition to providing an introduction to design thinking methods, the mapping and analysis reveal the shared conceptual structure of these two modes of thinking. Ultimately, it is argued that design thinking can be leveraged to develop creative new ways of engaging critical thinking in the classroom, and that critical thinking needs to be even more explicitly infused into the design thinking process. The mapping should serve as a practical reference for educators and practitioners who wish to explore ways of more explicitly integrating critical thinking and design thinking with one another. The article concludes with a discussion of some unique features of design thinking, an exploration of implications for the knowledge economy, and a research agenda to guide future design pedagogy and practice.",9

Firstly, productivity growth and economic success depend very much on harnessing cutting-edge innovation and spreading it to the rest of the industry. Economic stagnation occurs not from the high-tech innovation at the frontier of the industry, but for the lack of spread of innovation from the frontier to the rest of the industry. Secondly, productivity growth is superior in industries and organizations that are oriented to the global market. Thirdly, innovation, growth and prosperity occur in local or regional hubs, in a context of solid collaborations and partnerships (McKindsey & Company, 2019, 2018, 2017; Shanmugaratnam, 2017a, 2017b). This set of evidence poses a challenge to societies across the world. They need to increase innovation and implement strategies to disseminate the learning that has happened at the frontier, in order to spread innovation to the rest of the industry. In this context, the idea that this endeavour consists essentially of building communities of learning (collaborations), social relationships (partnerships) and, in the end, an ‘ecological approach’ is gaining momentum day after day in Higher Education (HE) (Pei-Ling et al., 2017; Crosling et al., 2015; Eckel & Hartley, 2016; Hall et al., 2013). At present, the ‘ecological approach’ to change in HE has become commonplace. In prevailing accounts of ‘ecological approach’, it is explicitly understood as a ‘philosophy’ for educational change (Barnett, 2018; Pei-Ling et al., 2017; Crosling et al., 2015). Nevertheless, as per a philosophy, it should address questions related to the reality (of, for instance, educational change), the structure of knowledge, and methodological issues when searching for it. However, the ecological viewpoint—as per the referred accounts—relates exclusively to organizational aspects of educational change. Therefore, as much as they use the term ‘philosophy’, they are not a philosophy but rather a strategy (i.e. they exclusively relates to organizational aspects). Under this ecological approach, educational leaders are paying increasing attention to building a ‘culture’ of collaboration (Jones & Harvey, 2017). But, in a complex world, a multi-dimensional organization, which additionally combines a number of pluralistic institutions, the unavoidable fact is that culture becomes ambiguous, uncertain, volatile and complex. Complexity (and then ambiguity, uncertainty and volatility) rely on the nature of ‘culture’; that is precisely why our world is complex, uncertain, volatile and ambiguous (cf. Zubiri, 1995); such a blatant fact which—oddly enough—is normally avoided when addressing the question of ‘culture of collaboration’. We need therefore to take a step beyond the organizational aspect of change, as to get to the nature of educational change. The following sections develop the idea that educational change is not only about techniques and strategies, as important as they are. It encompasses cultural principles, intellectual values, scientific perspective, methodological frameworks and so on. In this complex and volatile world, we first need to problematize current trends in order to be able to build consistent change. This is what leadership is about, particularly if we are aiming for innovation. Thus, innovation and leadership are not only about ‘management’ but also—as will be seen—about ‘systematic, structural knowledge’. An institution is innovative not only because of a number of collaborations that have been made, or the extent of the organizations involved (as important as it is), or the amount of funding allocated for research. Aspiring for innovation in HE basically consists of building a particular kind of knowledge, of an innovative nature, with the capability to go beyond a given situation. Therefore, it requires, first and foremost, a ‘systematic basis’ for the relationship between research, policy and practice. That is where the perspective this paper puts forwards makes a different and adds value. This view provides—as will be seen—a consistent and adequate philosophical, scientific and methodological basis for the relationship between research, policy and practice.",8

In fact, labor market frictions are considered amongst the leading causes of the short-run inflation/unemployment trade-offs (Faia, 2009; Zhang, 2017; Iwasaki et al., 2018). Furthermore, as highlighted by Moyen and Sahuc (2005), the performance of the labor market does influence the dynamics of economic cycles and is crucial for monetary policy decisions. This paper develops and estimates a quantitative macroeconomic framework that incorporates labor market frictions in the case of a small open economy. Particularly, we develop a New Keynesian Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model to examine the transmission of the monetary policy in Tunisia in a context of nominal wage rigidities and unemployment. Our motivation is twofold. First, there are some compelling theoretical considerations. Labor market frictions have seldom been considered in New Keynesian models studying the conduct of monetary policies, although there is a substantial literature which shows evidence that taking into consideration wage rigidity to account for labor market volatility is important for understanding the channels through which monetary policy affects the real economy (e.g., Shimer, 2005; Hall, 2005; Mortensen & Nagypal, 2007; Hagedorn & Manovskii, 2008). For instance, within a non-Walrasian labor market framework, Moyen and Sahuc (2005) examined the impacts of labor market frictions on the dynamics of monetary policy in the Euro area. The simulations showed that there is a strong association between labor market frictions (real rigidities) and nominal rigidities as in Blanchard and Gali (2010). Our second motivation is related to the specificity of the Tunisian economy. Recent macroeconomic trends show a continuous persistence in inflation during the last decade (Alimi et al., 2019). Our belief is that this inflation persistence can be explained by the frictions characterizing labor market in Tunisia, particularly nominal wage rigidities and structural unemployment. The relationship between labor market frictions and the conduct of monetary policy has been investigated by a number of studies. Based on a New Keynesian model, Gali (2010) showed that labor market frictions, especially unemployment and wage rigidity, influence the way the economy reacts to shocks. In addition, Faccini et al. (2011) estimated a model with corresponding frictions and nominal wage rigidity for the British economy. They found that the nominal wage rigidity improves the fit of the model. Using New Zealand data, Albertini et al. (2012) reformulated the Gali and Monacelli (2005) model to incorporate search and matching frictions and found that most variations in the New Zealand labor market are due solely to labor market disruptions. Gertler et al. (2008) estimated a model with an indivisible and costly labor force to conclude that a model with nominal wage rigidity provides a better description of American data than does a model with flexible wages.
 Empirical literature also provides evidence concerning the effects of real wage rigidities on employment and productivity. Riggi (2010) and Riggi and Tancioni (2010) found an increase in employment following a positive technology shock, as opposed to the findings of previous studies (Gali, 1999; Francis & Ramey, 2005). The paper contributes to the existing literature on labor market frictions in three ways. First, as far as we are aware, our contribution is the first to investigate Tunisian labor market frictions within a DSGE framework. Second, in the small open DSGE model, we propose for Tunisia wage rigidity that is embedded into the framework simultaneously with involuntary unemployment and market power of labor unions. Third, contrary to recent contributions that investigate the labor market frictions (e.g., Sheen & Wang, 2016) only through real wage rigidity or hiring costs hypotheses (e.g., Bechný, 2019), the present study rather focuses on nominal wage rigidities. Our analysis is undergone by using a modified version of a small open economy DSGE model with a wage rigidity, which was originally proposed by Adolfson et al. (2007), Blanchard and Gali (2010), and Sheen and Wang (2016). However, our study is distinguished from the previous ones in that, in our model, labor market rigidity is driven by nominal wage rigidity and low employment dynamics. In fact, in Tunisia, the presence of wage rigidity can be mainly explained by the hegemonic bargaining power of labor unions (specifically, the Tunisian General Labor Union (UGTT)). The government wage policies and the bargaining power of trade unions are often perceived as factors of wage rigidity leading therefore to market distortions.
 A recent study carried out in 2017 at the Tunisian Institute of Competitiveness, and quantitative studies (ITCEQ, 2017) showed that the average wage has increased at an annual rate of 8.1% over the last 6 years. Thus, the prevailing view since 2011 is an unbridled increase in wage mass and a continuously declining productivity. Since 2010, compensation for employees has increased by 7.7% annually, compared with 6.6% of nominal GDP, in respect of a wage bill that rose from 39.8% of GDP in 2010 to 42.4% in 2017, higher than the world average.Footnote 1 Moreover, the labor market in Tunisia continues “to suffer from a structural quantitative and qualitative imbalance between supply and demand, resulting in high and persistent unemployment” (TCB, 2013). The unemployment rate in Tunisia is amongst the highest in the world according to the International Labor Organization (ILO, 2016) World Report published in 2016. The ILO reports a rate of 35% of Tunisian youth unemployed. According to a report by the World Bank published in 2014, Tunisia suffers from high and quasi-continuously evolving unemployment rates, which continues to weigh heavily on the country’s prospects. In 2016, the unemployment rate stood at 15.6%, compared with 13% in 2010.
 The paper is structured as follows. In “The Model,” the DSGE model for Tunisia is set out. In “Steady-State Conditions,” we analyze the steady-state conditions of the small open economy DSGE model. “Estimation” describes the estimation procedures. “Quantitative Results” explains the estimation results and the impulse-response functions, and analyses decomposition of error variance of unemployment. Finally, “Concluding Remarks” concludes.",1

One of the key reasons for this has been the enduring productivity gap between the EU and the U.S (Ortega-Argilés, 2012; McCann & Ortega-Argilés, 2015). The existence of this gap has been explained by insufficient investments into R&D in Europe (Uppenberg, 2009) as well as by the more integrated and larger U.S R&D and innovation system, which enables a greater variety of specialisations (Foray, 2009). On the policy level, it has been argued that the EU regions are losing competitiveness because they attempt to copy current policies and strategies of already successful regions and this creates inefficiencies in R&D spending as policies do not tackle the key challenges and take advantage of local possibilities (Foray & Van Ark, 2007; Foray et al., 2009). The EU has tried to address these issues through the concept of smart specialisation which emphasises the importance of focusing on leveraging the potential of already existing regional strengths and economic diversification into related technologies and sectors (McCann & Ortega-Argilés, 2013; 2015; Foray, 2018). For the 2014–2020 EU Multi Financial Frameworks (MFF), the adoption of a smart specialisation strategy (RIS3) has been the ex-ante conditionality for the member states to get access to the research, development and innovation (RDI)-related European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF). The concept has been also labelled as the “new industrial policy” of the EU, driven by a strong regional focus and a goal of achieving economies of scale in high-technology and knowledge-intensive sectors through policy prioritisation (McCann & Ortega-Argilés, 2015; Kroll, 2017; Radosevic, 2017). Through industrial policy, a government can support the search and discovery process by internalising market failures which are related to insufficient information spillovers caused by underprovision of innovation and coordination failures (Hausmann & Rodrik, 2003; Rodrik & Hausmann, 2006). As Rodrik (2007) argues, the most important part of industrial policy is the cooperation between the government and the private sector to discover underlying costs, possible opportunities and engage in strategic coordination to keep the mastery in several areas of specialisation which also have a potential to spawn new specialisations. Such cooperation also enables the establishment of common understanding among different stakeholders about the direction of development. In the smart specialisation framework, this is known as the entrepreneurial discovery process (EDP) (Foray et al., 2011). Several other authors have emphasised the importance of cooperation between different stakeholders in the context of RIS3 and EDP (Carayannis & Rakhmatullin, 2014; De Noni et al., 2017; Kyriakou, 2017). However, the more complex the issues one wants to solve through RDI policy, the more important but also more complex the cooperation will be. One cannot just assume that such cooperation between the government, academia, companies and society will just happen out of thin air. Rather, it should be consciously managed and organised. However, little detailed attention has been paid to how it should be and is done in the context of RIS3 and EDP. Several papers have already pointed towards the general challenge of organising EDP. For example, Kroll (2015) and Karo and Kattel (2015) argue that in the Central and Eastern Europe, the bottom-up approach has been at odds with the centralist planning system and these states and regions are missing the routines necessary for supporting entrepreneurial discovery and bottom-up public–private coordination. In the context of stakeholder participation in the policy processes, some scholars emphasise the importance of organisational thickness vs thinness as preconditions for sustainable participation and policy-co-creation. Tödtling and Trippl (2005) have argued that some regions can experience organisational thinness in the sense of a low number of innovative companies as well as knowledge suppliers and less specialised educational institutions which inhibits policy co-creation and EDP. Conversely, some regions may benefit from organisational thickness, i.e. the existence existance of intermediary and support organisations that provide a strong basis for stakeholder inclusion and transformation of selected priorities into concrete projects (Trippl et al., 2019). Also, Kitson (2019) has recently argued that connectivity and collaboration between the actors in the local innovation system may require new local structures to align their interests. Yet, this research is often limited to general emphasis on the importance of organisational thickness and system-level analysis and leaves out a more detailed analysis of how this is achieved and organised through different organisations and approaches. The current paper aims to contribute to the RIS3 research and literature by investigating what role the intermediary organisations play in entrepreneurial discovery processes. While the role of intermediary organisations is central in several adjacent literatures and research streams (knowledge transfer, regional and local government studies, industrial policy), it has been so far largely neglected in RIS3 literature. The narrow definition for intermediaries is that they are organisations located between the users and producers of knowledge that mediate knowledge transfer (Smedlund, 2006) and connect a wider network of stakeholders (Janssen & Frenken, 2019). However, the literature (Howells, 2006; Bakici et al., 2013; Bradford & Wolfe, 2013; Breznitz & Ornston, 2018) identifies additional roles and therefore it is not enough to just look at the number of intermediaries as a proxy for organisational thickness, but it is also relevant to analyse their tasks/missions and how they fulfil them. Analysing the role of intermediaries on this level of detail can provide valuable information on how to design and structure bottom-up collaboration in the context of EDP. The analysis is based on a comparative case study approach and looks at how smart specialisation, and EDP more specifically, are organised in two regions subject to the EU’s regional and cohesion policies through the EU’s Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2) level categorisation: Helsinki-Uusimaa in Finland and Estonia (as a NUTS-2 region). The two countries share many cultural geographical proximities, and in strategic policy documents, both countries also put a strong emphasis on cooperation as the basis for economic, research and development and innovation policies. However, due to historic reasons Estonia and Finland have developed different capitalistic models (liberal vs more coordinated) and are at different levels of wealth and well-being. In the context of these similarities and differences, we analyse how the smart specialisation and entrepreneurial discovery process have been organised with a specific focus on the roles and missions of intermediary organisations. We show that compared to the relatively formalistic and technocratic approach in Estonia, Helsinki-Uusimaa is characterised by a greater organisational thickness for cross-sectoral collaboration underpinning EDP. While the Estonian intermediaries are mostly intermediaries that distribute EU funds, many intermediaries in Helsinki-Uusimaa have a clear mission of supporting collaboration between stakeholders which is done through building networks and initiating and managing concrete projects to fulfil strategic goals. Such collaboration also helps to develop and maintain a common understanding of strategic directionality in policy and reduces coordination failures. The paper is structured as follows. The “Literature Review” section provides a literature review on the main challenges of RIS3 and EDP in the EU and how the intermediary organisations could be used to tackle these challenges. The “Methodology” section describes the methodology of the paper. The “The Cases of Helsinki-Uusimaa in Finland and Estonia” section discusses the cases of Helsinki-Uusimaa and Estonia. The “Concluding Discussion” section summarises the main differences between Helsinki-Uusimaa and Estonia and provides theoretical, empirical and policy-level conclusions and proposes future research topics.",2

In particular, we will be outlining the factors and trends that can serve to help understand and possibly anticipate transformative and potentially disruptive developments across locations, sectors, and institutions. Moreover, we discuss the concepts of the Quadruple and Quintuple Innovation Helix Frameworks (Carayannis and Campbell 2011; Carayannis et al. 2012; Park 2014). This is where the institutional pillars of Government, University, Industry, and Civil Society mesh with each and with the fifth dimension, the Environment, to define and shape the operational landscape for the design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation of global/local (glocal) innovation and entrepreneurship ecosystems as the building blocks of the emerging society, technology, and economy paradigms. Innovation and Entrepreneurship have been drivers of change and outside the box thinking across time and space. The convergence of AI-enabled emerging technologies across all sectors has been creating and diffusing conditions that serve as triggers, catalysts, and accelerators of socio-economic, socio-technical, and socio-political transformation across regions and continents. The following research questions motivated this work: How Risk Management 5.0 can transform Industry 4.0 that can lead to Industry 5.0? What interconnections may exist between Risk Management 5.0, Society 5.0, and Industry 5.0? What are the current open issues and challenges of the three main pillars of Industry 5.0? In order to provide thorough answers to the aforementioned research questions in this work, we firstly outline the concepts of Risk Management 5.0, Industry 4.0, Industry 5.0, Society 5.0, and Digital Transformation and then present in details the concepts of Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, and Blockchain which constitute the main pillars of Industry 5.0 that could enable “smarter as well as more humane solutions to our challenges informing theory, policy and practice.” The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. “Risk Management 5.0” introduces the concept of Risk Management 5.0. “Industry 4.0,” firstly, outlines Industry 4.0 and then extends into the concepts of Society 5.0 and Industry 5.0. “Artificial Intelligence: Innovation Meets Risk Management” summarizes how Artificial Intelligence can aid Innovation. “Blockchain: Towards a Decentralized Web” describes the concepts of Blockchain that could lead to the decentralized web while “Internet of Things” provides an overview of Internet of Things. “Making Sense of It All—Towards “Smarter” Entrepreneurship and Innovation Ecosystems” concludes the paper by describing the main outcomes of this study as well as the interconnections between the concepts that were examined in this study.",38

Main Challenges When Updating Strategies,March 2022,Ricard Esparza-Masana,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Originally, the expression ‘smart specialisation strategies (S3)’ came fundamentally from a theoretical approach that was developed by the logic presented by Landabaso (1997) and by an expert group set up in the first decade of this century by the European Commission called ‘Knowledge for Growth (K4G)’, following a practical approach based on the long-studied domain of innovation policy in Europe in the previous decade, following previous periods, as studies by Cooke and Morgan (1998). This group of experts had as its main goal designing and establishing research and innovation (R&I) strategies for these to be the base of a long run, sustainable and sustained economic growth. This group devised S3 as a sound approach, understanding this concept as the identification of competitive advantages in a territory (based on the relative position in front of other regions/countries), fostering them, identifying at the same time ways of collaboration and knowledge and technology exchange within that territory, as well as with other ones, in a synergic way, enlarging the interaction among innovation stakeholders (Foray et al., 2009; European Commission, 2012; McCann & Ortega-Argilés, 2013; Foray, 2015). This concept soon caught the attention of numerous agents in the sphere of innovation policy in the EU, which started seeing it as an interesting new paradigm for the European regional innovation systems (RIS). The concept of RIS, with a vast literature behind (to cite some good examples, see for instance Asheim & Coenen, 2005; Autio, 1998; Braczyk et al., 1998; Cooke et al., 2000; Cooke, 2003; Cooke et al., 2004; Isaksen et al., 2018), has been elaborating on the framework around the numerous stakeholders that we find in innovation ecosystems, and the way they interact, within and without the scope of the policies tackling their activities, as well as the way these stakeholders are evolving over time, following these interactions and cooperation schemes (Edquist, 2005). RIS are to foster the spillovers coming from the synergies created through the collaboration of stakeholders and the agglomeration effects under some specialisation industrial domains (Rip, 2002; Laranja et al., 2008). The concept of entrepreneurial discovery process (EDP)—a key aspect of S3—is based on this. Following Foray (2014) and Asheim (2019), EDP can be defined as the set of processes leading to discoveries undertaken by the stakeholders of a given innovation system, understanding it from a broad angle (Asheim & Grillitsch, 2015) and coming from either formal and informal institutions or networks (Rodríguez-Pose & Wilkie, 2015). In other words, the EDP must lead to the identification of the competitive advantages of a territory, as well as its challenges and priorities, all to be tackled throughout the implementation of the S3. Following these EDP, another S3 principle arises: S3 is to avoid implementing a ‘one-size-fits-all’ in order to maximise the effectiveness of the strategy (Martin & Sunley, 2003), for a homogenous innovation policy would not efficiently work (Tödtling & Trippl, 2005). The introduction of multiannual S3-based agendas, built on the concept of EDP, was established by the Regulation (EU) 1301/2021 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2013 as an ex-ante conditionality for approving European funding under the Thematic Objective for Research and Innovation of the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) for the programming period 2014–2020. Thus, the majority of regions of the Union (and/or, in some cases, at a state level) designed their S3 agendas, in which they defined a series of territorial specialisation domains and related priorities for which they designed a policy mix with a series of instruments that generate projects aimed at tackling these priorities. In the academic literature, much has been analysed regarding the conceptual logic of S3 and the opportunities and challenges faced by it. As stated in a detailed bibliometric analysis, Fellnhofer (2018) identified the main research questions around this topic in previous works, and they mostly relate on the theoretical concept, its drivers and benchmarking, with very limited works on actual implementation. On the policy making side, in 2020, when facing the final months of the first period of the S3 agendas (2014–2020), management authorities have a double challenge in front of them: establishing clear conclusions about the outcomes of the strategy to date, analysing its successes and failures through a good monitoring and evaluation model, and using all that information to design an updated version of it, an S3 2.0 (as defined by the European Commission), where they are to maintain successful points, modify what can be improved and introduce all those elements that were not there and which could improve and expand the results. Additionally, the European Commission is expected to introduce two additional axes for the design of the S3 linked to the ERDF for the next programming period: more features of international collaboration on the one hand, and some other linked to industrial transition on the other (Vocaskova, 2020). In this context, managing authorities face opportunities but also challenges when undertaking the S3 updating towards the programming period 2021–2027. We have divided these 3 main categories, which can be summarised in 3 questions and 3 main hypotheses linked to them, as it is presented in Table 1. These challenges build on the constrain that updating the strategies means envisaging the future without a clear picture of the past, as it will be further discussed in “Learnings from S3 1.0 into S3 2.0”. This leads to a principal question: can S3 2.0 be constructed on major changes for the strategy and its potential impact, or it is more a minor update of the management and the policy mix which may look as new bottles for old wine? To extract some conclusions, our work discusses the main challenges linked to them. This discussion comes from a revision of the literature and the clustering of different points into the main aspects that we analyse in “Learnings from S3 1.0 into S3 2.0”, “Updating the Strategic Framework”, and “Including (or Further Developing) Key Dimensions”. For each of these items, we review some of the most relevant works in recent literature, discussing which the logic of the particular objective–challenge, which shall serve to assess the actual possibilities for a major/minor update of the strategy, as discussed in “Final Remarks”.",11

Therefore, the question of the economic cycle is central in economics because of the complexity of the phenomenon and its behavior. Economists are aware that a better knowledge of the economic cycle and its intrinsic phenomena would make it possible to control the economic environment. The identification of cycles and cyclical turning points, on the one hand, and the cyclical synchronization study within a partnership area, on the other hand, allow the public decision-maker to set adequate economic policies which would help in decision-making to amortize falls or avoid recession or crisis periods. The evolving integration of the Tunisian industry into a global framework as well as the Tunisian commitment to a free trade agreement with the European Union resulted in stronger bonds tying the Tunisian foreign trade to its European partners. This is only partially true according to some recent research results. In fact, although the correlation between the Tunisian and the French economic cycles is relatively strong (Elachehab (2010) and Chebbi and Knani (2013)), this correlation remains very limited with Italy and Germany. However, when it comes to the synchronization degree, Medhioub and Mraïhi (2011) suggest that it is rather significant statistically when the transmission delays are considered. These contradictions might be due to the specificity of the Tunisian business cycle. References (Elachehab (2007b, 2009)) as well as Chebbi and Knani (2013) state that this cycle is shorter in Tunisia than in developed countries whereas Male (2010) insists that it is on par. It is equally important to remind that the total Tunisian trade regressed over the 2014–2016 period because of several economic difficulties; specifically, while the EU exports to Tunisia were on the increase, Tunisia’s exports to these countries remained stable. The service sector was not any better due to the post revolution fragile security in the country, impacting negatively the tourism sector. In fact, the total trade in services between Tunisia and the EU countries dropped from €5.9 billion in 2010 to €4.8 billion in 2015 (European Commission, 2017a). With the economic integration of Tunisia within the European economies, it is recommended to measure the synchronization degree between the national economy and those of its main partners (French, German, Italian, and Spanish) in order to allow a better interpretation of the macroeconomic fluctuations for political issues. The synchronization coefficient calculation allows us to examine the effects of a recession, or an expansion, from one economy to another. Thus, the study of synchronization makes it possible to check the interdependence of the Tunisian economy and the European economies. The present work raised the question of whether a synchronization of the Tunisian economic cycles with those of the European countries, its main European commercial partners (France, Italy, Germany, and Spain), does exist that largely affect its situation. This question, which has not been openly answered in the literature, deserves particular attention especially since the 2000s with the official launch of the Free Trade Agreement signed by Tunisia and the European Union. Given the characteristics in terms of trade, foreign direct investment (FDI), tourism, and migrant income transfers, the cyclical movements of Tunisian GDP appear to be particularly sensitive to the economic fluctuations of the European countries and in particular to its four main trading partners which are themselves very economically linked and members of the Euro area. The spread of demand shocks from these countries to Tunisia has been strengthened since the 2000s with the expansion of their integration and trade. To compare the economic fluctuations of Tunisia with those of the developed countries considered, it is first necessary to identify their economic cycles. Various “trend-cycle” decomposition techniques have been proposed in the literature. The most widely used are the filter smoothing method of Hodrick and Prescott (1997), called HP, and the Pass Band method, called BP, presented by Baxter and King (1999) and developed by Christiano and Fitzgerald (1999). Indeed, to analyze an economic cycle, several linear models have been developed including the integrated autoregressive ones. Nevertheless, other researchers have suggested nonlinear models such as autoregressive threshold models (Tiao & Tsay, 1993), SETAR models (Terasvirta & Anderson, 1992), and Markov switching model (Hamilton, 1989). However, of the economic cycle with regime switching analysis is becoming a major concern for analysts and forecasters. It is in the early 1970s that Goldfeld and Quandt (1973) pioneered to study the questions of the Markov models of regime change. In the beginning of 1989, guided by Hamilton’s (1989) studies, numerous authors such as Sichel (1989) and Tiao and Tsay (1993) proposed a variety of nonlinear processes of economic series. The assumption that many variables in the business cycle are governed by regime changes is Hamilton’s (1989) main motivation arguing that no credible reason can enhance the researchers’ choice of linear models to analyze the business cycle. On the other hand, other authors find that linear models with unobservable components are not suitable for studying and analyzing the economic cycle since the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) stated that expansions experiencing higher growth rates are longer than recession periods and that this economic cycle specificity is reflected in numerous economic series in almost all sectors. In the economic literature, the economic cycle analysis and more specifically the cyclical synchronization are a fairly well-documented concept today and continue to be widely debated. In this framework, our proposed research work focused on the following research question: relying on the parametric and non-parametric approaches, are there common empirical regularities of the economic cycle between Tunisia and there principal European partners? The purpose of this article was to establish a conjunctural diagnosis of the economic cycle of a developing country—Tunisia—and compare it with those established in developed countries. Two innovations were achieved. Through a historical dating of the classic cycle (business cycle) and the growth cycle (cycle deviation) of the industrial production index (IPI), this article aimed to detect episodes of economic recession and analyze the behaviors of the components of Tunisian production and those of its partners during these phases. In addition, we adopt the a-theoretical approach to study the economic cycles of Tunisia and of its main partners. We relied on the Bry and Boschan (1971) non-parametric procedure to decompose the classical and growth cycles into cyclic phases and study in a univariate way the IPI component behavior during these phases. Subsequently, we adopted the Markov Switching-Vector AutoRegression model (MS-VAR) parametric modeling. To address this issue, we have chosen to determine and detect the turning points dating in the Tunisian economic context compared with that of the European partner countries. The remaining of this paper was therefore organized as follows: the second section described the main characteristics of the Tunisian economy and the main transmission channels. The third section introduced the MS-VAR nonlinear model. The fourth section introduced our adopted empirical methodology. The different empirical results were revealed in the fifth section. The last section provided the main conclusions and recommendations.",3

Cotsomitis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The past decades have seen a marked acceleration in the importance of learning and knowledge creation in the modern economy. This acceleration is associated with intensified global competition, the spread of information, and communication technologies into all sectors of the economy and the deregulation and liberalization of markets (Gregersen & Johnson, 2001). At the same time, the extent to which different sectors of the economy have been impacted by these changes has increased dramatically. These trends have led the Swedish economist Bengt-Äke Lundvall to refer to the contemporary economy as a learning economy. As articulated by Lundvall (1996), the term learning economy has two distinct dimensions. First, it is a conceptual and heuristic device that emphasizes the roles of different kinds of learning in the contemporary economy and how they interact to shape the capabilities and performance of economic actors. Learning in this sense is an interactive process which depends on the ability of individuals, firms, and national populations to combine and recombine different pieces of knowledge into something novel. Second, the term learning economy also denotes a distinct and newly emerging economic regime where knowledge is a critical resource and learning and knowledge creation are key processes. Learning is pervasive in this new economic order and is embedded in the customs, routines, and value structures of society, facilitating not only learning practices but also the capacity to learn. This suggests a circular cumulative process where the pace of change imposes the need for rapid learning which in turn gives rise to further changes in the economy. Although it can be said that every economy is a knowledge-based economy, not every economy is a learning economy. What is crucial to success in the learning economy “[…] is the capacity to learn to do new things and to do old things in better ways.” (Pavitt, 2002, p. 125). The key economic question is no longer how to optimally distribute existing scarce resources but rather how to generate new kinds of resources and advantage through a wide range of learning processes. The existing literature has focused almost exclusively on Lundvall’s conceptualization of the learning economy as a heuristic device that emphasizes the importance of learning and knowledge creation. There has been little discussion to date on the separate notion of the learning economy as a distinct and emerging economic regime. To the author’s knowledge, Lundvall (1996), Gregersen and Johnson (2001), and Johnson (2011) are the only researchers who have explicitly broached this topic but do so in investigations that are directed more towards national systems of innovation and institutional responses to development. No systematic inquiries have been undertaken to delineate the salient features and the key variables driving the transition to the learning economy regime. This has led to a failure to link the transformation of economic structures and institutions in the learning economy to the process of economic development. Additionally, little weight has been given in the existing literature to the role of human motivations and activities in shaping the transition to a learning economy regime nor to the normative contribution to human well-being of functioning in this new learning environment. The present paper endeavors to close this gap in the literature on the learning economy by focusing on three primary research questions: What factors render the learning economy a distinct economic regime and ensure its growth and sustainability over time? What are the transition pathways to a learning economy regime? What are the normative implications of transitioning to a learning economy regime? Because of the lack of previous theoretical and empirical work on the learning economy as a distinct economic regime, this paper uses a combined qualitative and quantitative research methodology in order to answer these questions and derive insights for further study. The first question is answered through an analysis of the consumption-production relationship in the learning economy and the regulating institutional architecture underlying it. The second question is addressed through the development of a theoretical model of the transition pathways to a learning economy regime based on the progressive satisfaction of the needs claims of consumers as real incomes rise. The final question is addressed by conducting an exploratory quantitative investigation that compares the social welfare outcomes of learning economies to those of counterpart societies using a descriptive ranking technique. The originality of the paper stems primarily from its theoretical and conceptual contribution to the scarce literature on the learning economy viewed as a newly emerging economic regime. This alternative and analytically useful perspective on the learning economy can provide novel insights on what have been standard topics of economic enquiry (the short term, prices, static equilibrium) and draws attention to more dynamic elements such as interactive learning, trust, and collaboration. It may also provide new insights into the dynamics of the learning economy. In this context, the paper proposes an historically oriented model that traces the transition from antecedent regimes to a learning economy and offers guidance for prediction and further inquiry. The model extends conventional stages of growth theory from the perspective of the learning economy. Lastly, the exploratory empirical analysis presented in the paper is to the author’s knowledge, the first attempt in the literature to provide an independent referent to assess the normative implications of transitioning to a learning economy regime. This preliminary analysis with due caution for its limited scope and methodological limitations lays the groundwork for further empirical work on social welfare policy in the learning economy regime. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The following section reviews the existing literature on the learning economy. The third section provides a conceptual framework for analyzing those characteristics of the learning economy that delineate it as a distinct economic regime which is reproducible over time. The paper then goes on to elaborate a model of the transition pathways to the learning economy. The fifth section empirically examines the normative implications of transitioning to a learning economy, while the ensuing section puts forward a number of policy recommendations. The seventh section discusses limitations and possible areas for future research, and the eighth section concludes the paper.",
13.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,12 February 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00723-y,"Capital Account Liberalization, Political Stability, and Economic Growth",March 2022,Mekki Hamdaoui,Saif Eddine Ayouni,Samir Maktouf,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"In response to the harmful effects of financial restrictions, many countries have become engaged in capital liberalization and globalization strategies. This orientation consists in ensuring the free circulation of international finance, in lifting the restrictions on financial institutions in order to be part of the world market, and in ensuring the independence of central banks (Patnaik 1999). The idea was to make the national financial sector part of the international sector, with the intention of making it functioning according to market forces and therefore more efficiently. However, findings concerning the effects of capital account liberalization on economic growth and on social welfare are divergent. On one hand, protagonists of financial globalization postulate that it improves the capacities of the financial system to allocate resources on a global level: it can lead to efficiency gains thanks to the mobility of capital. Indeed, the opening of borders allows a more profitable orientation of global savings, both from the point of view of borrowers and that of lenders. Thus, the available capital is directed towards the most profitable investments. At the same time, borrowers can find cheaper sources of finance in this global market than in their domestic market. This optimal allocation of financial resources at the global level makes it possible to stimulate the most dynamic sectors and countries. At the international level, the opening of the capital account, for example, was initiated in order to increase North-South capital flows and subsequently to increase the resources available in the peripheral countries, supposed to have better investment opportunities (Solow 1956). These capital movements generate an increase in aggregate productivity and consequently an increase in economic growth allowing the diffusion of technological knowledge and the adoption of more efficient managerial practices (Borensztein et al. 1998). In another way, by favoring the installation of foreign operators, one can increase competition and authorize the transfer of knowledge. The existence of foreign banks limits the sudden reversal of capital flows (Goldstein and Turner 1996). Domestic investors are able to diversify their risks as effectively as possible by providing new opportunities for sharing and hedging against risk with foreigners. Reducing risk by diversifying the portfolio encourages companies to invest more, stimulating economic growth. The removal of restrictions on capital flows can be seen as a positive signal for foreign investors (Bartolini and Drazen 1997). Thus, according to Gourinchas and Jeanne (2002), national governments tended to institute a crippling tax on physical capital, which can have the effect of discouraging investment and hampering economic growth. Financial openness could, on the contrary, produce a disciplinary effect. Governments if they want to attract international capital would have to relax their taxes. The reduction of distortions linked to the taxation of capital can initiate a process of reallocation of savings towards the most productive sectors. Thus, capital account liberalization in addition to its intrinsic advantages can be seen as an instrument of structural reform. This message is clearly conveyed by international institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank, who wish to encourage the reduction of public authorities’ intervention in financing to encourage banks, shareholders, households, and creditors to develop competitive profit-seeking behavior. As a result, many transition economies experienced a significant capital inflow after the restrictions were removed. The resulting increase in market liquidity reduces the risk premium on domestic securities and therefore reduces the cost of capital, which is favorable for investment. According to Levine (1997), external financial liberalization should make it possible to develop both markets and financial institutions. On one hand, international portfolio flows must increase the liquidity of domestic financial markets. On the other hand, the increase of foreign holdings in domestic banks is believed to be the source of a variety of benefits. Overall, foreign participation facilitates access to international financial markets. Financial innovations allow increased risk diversification and improve resilience to shocks. Foreign banks are often behind the introduction of a wide variety of new financial instruments that accelerate technological advances in the financial markets. The entry of foreign banks increases competition and helps improve the quality of domestic financial services as well as their allocative efficiency. The existence of large and liquid markets allows economic agents to diversify their investments and therefore the associated risks; the proliferation of financial innovations, particularly since the end of the 1980s, has enabled economic players to manage and cover the risks of their economic and financial activities (currency risk, credit risk, and risk of changes in the price of raw materials). On the other hand, antagonists of capital account liberalization support that it increases financial crisis probability through a lot of risks linked to trading on the international financial markets such as (i) counterparty risk (or credit risk) which is based on the possible default of the debtor. It is therefore the risk that the party with which a contract has been signed does not keep its commitments. (ii) Market risk is linked to changes in stock prices which can be defined as the financial risk due to uncertainty about the future value of a share or a portfolio of shares. Financial markets are characterized by major imperfections, which lead to instability and the inability to carry out an optimal allocation of resources. Indeed, imperfect information leads operators to follow gregarious and mimetic behavior: economic agents imitate their neighbors, hoping that they are better informed. Instead of adopting a rational behavior, individual investors, like institutional investors (investment companies, pension funds, and insurance companies), rely on the mixed opinions of other agents and are content to follow the trend, thus, strengthening market excesses, both up and down. The main risk of the financial markets then comes from the disconnection between the real value of the assets and their market value because of these sheepish behaviors, which abnormally increase the prices of financial securities, leading to the formation of financial bubbles. This mimetic behavior also explains the bursting of these financial bubbles. Therefore, financial risk is increased via the moral hazard phenomenon, which designates a risk situation born from the prospect that an agent who knows that is guaranteed against the risk behaves differently than if he were totally exposed, and therefore ready to take more risk. Rescue operations carried out by central banks and/or governments in the event of a financial crisis may cause financial market participants to feel protected from their own imprudent actions and to take more risks in the future when granting loans or executing market operations. The financial crisis of 2008 showed that American banks granted subprime loans with little rigor because the risks on these credits were massively transferred to other economic agents by means of synthetic securitization. It is this moral hazard that has increased the number of defaulting securities on the financial markets. More generally, information asymmetry is an essential characteristic of financial markets: borrowers generally have more information than lenders on the value and risk of their projects. This can push them to choose excessively risky investments: if the investment bet is successful, the borrower will win a lot; if the investment does not succeed, the lender will lose a lot. This phenomenon known as “moral hazard” means that we are very far from the paradigm of efficient markets. The fixed exchange rate against the dollar also made investors believe that borrowing in dollars was safe. The moral hazard phenomenon therefore played a full role since the investment risk was socialized or transferred to the State. In the case of emerging countries, Thailand for example, financial globalization has facilitated very short-term dollar risk and debt that turned out to be disastrous at the time of the crisis. Because from 1995, the opening to capital movements facilitated this over-accumulation of capital and led to a speculative bubble in the financial assets of these countries; many private interests close to political power were involved. These private interests, sometimes also linked to the laundering of dirty money (in the case of Thailand), had every interest in this explosive cocktail combining openness to the capital markets, debt abroad, and socialization of risks. This cocktail, before leading to the crisis, has a euphoric effect on the whole economy: investment in the most speculative sectors (in particular real estate) artificially inflates growth. We find this type of pattern in Korea, Indonesia, and Malaysia from 1995. For this reason, it is useful to assess the importance of political risk on triggering a financial crisis in the aftermath of capital account liberalization. The devaluation of the Thai baht against the dollar led to a sharp revaluation of the debts denominated in dollars (by 45% in the case of Thailand) and led to the brutal liquidation of these investments. Investment collapsed between 1996 and 1998 by almost 50% and income over the same period decreased by more than 8%, while in previous years, it increased at a rate close to 10%. Particularly as a result of rising unemployment and the lack of a social safety net, the crisis hit the poorest very hard and has resulted in increased inequality. In this context, we can note that policy makers at the international scale face two contradictory challenges. On the one hand, most developed countries are approaching their stationary point and need new employment opportunities in developing countries. Likewise, developing countries generally need financing and resort to external financing given the insufficiency of domestic savings, which explains adopting a capital account liberalization strategy. Some countries have benefited from capital inflows and have experienced considerable growth rates. Other countries, contrary to the expectations, have failed to achieve a significant rate of economic growth, may be, due to political instability and the inability of governments to allocate resources effectively. On the other hand, the liberalization of the capital account may decrease the probability of financial crisis through more risk diversification or increase the probability of short-term financial instability and crises, especially for non-politically stable countries. Our objective in this paper is to treat these two contradictory points of view in a single model unlike previous works which treat each of these subjects in an isolated way. In other words, our objective is firstly to study the direct effects of capital account liberalization and then of political stability on economic growth. Next, we put the importance of each of these factors on the probability of triggering a financial crisis. Then, we show that the effect of each one is dependent on the other. In particular, we maintain that the relationship between opening a capital account and economic growth or the probability of crises depends on political stability. Similarly, the relationship between political stability and economic growth, and the probability of financial crises depends on the level of capital account opening. To do this, we introduce an interaction term of our variables of interest to focus on the conditional or indirect effects. Then, we consider that the short-term effects of these potential determinants of economic growth can be opposed to the long-term effects. For example, considering the liberalization of the capital account, it is expected that there will be a partial negative short-term effect via instability and increase in volatility against a positive long-term effect on economic growth through increasing funds at least costs and therefore investment. The importance of this methodology is that it makes it possible to identify well-founded results and economic implications in order to overcome the weaknesses of previous works, which tackle these problems in isolation. Our contribution consists in determining the overall effect of both capital account liberalization and political stability on economic growth distinguishing between short-term (partial) and long-term effect (total effect) of different signs. In addition, our study has the advantage of dealing with the direct effect of political stability and its indirect effect which determines the nature of the link between capital account liberalization and economic activity. In others, the literature on financial crises emphasizes the partial effect or the economic and social costs linked to financial disorders following liberalization without taking into account the positive effect of this reform during calm periods. Thus, the literature on economic growth does not take into account the negative short-term effects of opening the capital account. In addition, most of the previous studies have dealt with the effect of financial reforms on economic growth and on the probability of triggering financial crises regardless of the political situation of countries that determine the business environment and investment decisions. Only a few studies have looked at similar issues such as Ranciere et al. (2006) who have decomposed the total effect of liberalization without taking into account the political environment to show that the total effect is positive. Similarly, Hamdaoui and Maktouf (2018) confirmed these conclusions and distinguished between different types of financial liberalization to argue that most of the components positively affect long-term economic growth. In addition, Hamdaoui et al. (2016) maintain that the institutional quality which largely depends on political stability and the efficiency of governments guarantees a positive effect of financial liberalization and neglects the probability of financial crises, which stimulate economic growth. In this study, we used a sample of 49 countries both emerging and developed for the period 1984–2016. Given that our objective is to discern the total effects of capital account liberalization and political stability on economic growth, we are based essentially on the treatment effect model which consists of combining both a classic model of economic growth and a financial crisis model in one regression. Such an approach is adopted after conducting regressions and preliminary analyzes to dissociate the indirect effects of our variables of interest on the probability of crisis as an indirect effect on economic growth. Our results support the positive effects of political stability counterbalanced by the negative effects of capital account liberalization. The remainder of this work proceeds as follows: In Section 2, we present an overview of the links between capital account liberalization, financial crisis probability, and economic growth. In Section 3, we detail empirical investigation, data description, and variable selection procedure. Finally, conclusions and recommendations are provided in Section 4.",6

One of the central topics in the economics of education is the estimation of the rate of private return to education. The rate of return has decreased in North Africa and the Middle East in recent decades, and this reduction has caused youth dissatisfaction and political instability (Arampatzi et al., 2018; Pellicer, 2018). We face a high investment in education in the MENA while we see high youth unemployment. It seems that this educational investment has a very small effect on the labor market in this region. Like other countries in the region, Iran is also faced with this paradox in its labor market. There are extensive investments in education after the 1979 revolution while the country is struggling with a high unemployment rate for decades. The estimations of returns to schooling shed light on what is going on in the labor market and education system in Iran. For this purpose, we used Household Expenditure and Income Surveys of Iran to estimate the rates of returns to schooling and investigate the spillover of education in the labor market. Mincer (1974) provides for the first time a piece of empirical evidence for the labor market effects of education. The Mincerian equation explores the causal relationship between schooling and earning and tries to measure the effect of education on people’s well-being. In the original Mincer equation, the logarithm of income is the dependent variable, and the independent variables are the years of schooling and experience. Mincer estimates this equation using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method. In this framework, the coefficient of the years of schooling is the private rate of return to schooling. However, due to the endogeneity problem in the schooling variable, there are concerns about the true value of the return to education (Card, 2001). An individual with a higher level of ability and motivation may invest more in her education and find a better job with higher wages. This is the root of the endogeneity problem in the Mincer equation that leads to an upward bias in the OLS estimates. To solve this problem, different solutions are proposed in the literature such as the instrumental variables (IV) and fixed-effects models. Card (1995) uses geographical proximity as an instrument to correct for the potential ability bias; Angrist and Keueger (1991) suggest the quarter of birth as an instrument. Many other studies use the instrumental variable method to study the causal relationship between schooling and earning (e.g., Butcher & Case, 1994; Duflo, 2001). In most of these studies, the IV coefficients are larger in magnitude than the OLS coefficients, while the IV coefficients are expected to be smaller than the OLS coefficients due to the ability bias. Some of these studies argue that the ability bias might be quite small and the downward bias caused by the measurement errors in schooling may crowd out the effect of ability bias. However, Card (2001) believes that it is hard to accept this argument. He discusses that the IV estimates might be biased upward in comparison to the OLS estimates. This is because some unobserved differences between the control and treatment groups, which are framed in the IV model implicitly, can cause the instruments to be invalid or weak. If there is a genuine panel data set, then there is no need to use the instrumental variables method, and hence, there is no worry about the weakness or invalidity of the instruments. A fixed-effect model can remove all of the unobserved individual fixed effects; hence, the estimates should be unbiased. However, such a good panel data are not available in most countries. To solve this problem, Deaton (1985) proposes a new method for constructing a pseudo-panel dataset using repeated cross-sectional data sets. In this approach, some cohorts are constructed using some common time-invariant characteristics (e.g., birth-year), and these cohorts are considered as observations of the pseudo-panel (PP). This method is being progressively used in different fields of study (see, for example, Guarini et al., 2018). This study estimates the rate of return to schooling in Iran, a country whose economy and educational system are under pressure, using the pseudo-panel approach (Oryoie & Abbasinejad, 2017). Iran has been investing extensively in its education system during the past decades. As a result of these investments, the average years of schooling has increased from just less than 4 years to more than 10 years, and the literacy rate has improved from 42% to more than 85%.Footnote 1 However, this huge improvement in educational attainment has not still translated to labor productivity. In the labor market, Iran faces a chronic high unemployment rate, especially among the youth population. The average unemployment rate is around 11.66% throughout 2000–2019.Footnote 2 The total labor force participation for ages 15–24 is also quite low. It is around 30.4% throughout 2000–2019, and it is falling during recent years.Footnote 3 This fall of labor force participation suggests that people are becoming unemployed and/or hopeless to find a job. Therefore, the level of educational attainment has increased a lot, while the labor force participation rate and the employment rate is very low in Iran. These two phenomena encourage us to find the rate of return to schooling in Iran. The policy implications of this exercise are first to learn better the relationship between education and labor market and second to help the policymakers to design better policies in the education system and labor market. Based on our results, it seems that Iran faces over-investment in education while the labor market and economy itself were not prepared to create high-skills jobs. There are few studies on Iran’s return to schooling. Salehi-Isfahani et al. (2009) estimate the rate of return to schooling using the OLS regression in Iran, Egypt, and Turkey. But as we discussed earlier, there is a notorious endogeneity problem in the OLS method. This paper is the first study that uses a powerful unbiased method for measuring the rate in Iran. We use six Household Expenditures and Income Surveys (HEIS) conducted by the Statistical Center of Iran (SCI) between 2008 and 2013 to construct our pseudo panel data set. Our results suggest that the rate of return is about 9% and 7% based on the PP model and the OLS, respectively. In urban and rural areas, the rate of return is, respectively, 7.8% (resp. 6.4%) and 10% (resp. 7.1%) based on the PP (resp. OLS) approach. Estimation of the Mincer equation using the PP approach has two benefits: first, the time-invariant unobserved characteristics (such as ability) are removed, and hence we can correct for the potential endogeneity. Second, as Glenn (2005) explains, one of the weaknesses of the cross-sectional data is that it does not control for age-group effects. The people of the same age groups face different conditions at different times. For example, the conditions of the labor market may change over time. Therefore, differences by age may not be completely related to age effects if we do not control for age-group effects. Pseudo panel analysis provides an opportunity to overcome this limitation of the cross-sectional data by construing cohorts based on birth year. By the same logic, we can construct cohorts based on different areas if there is considerable heterogeneity in different areas of a country. Iran is a pretty diverse country in terms of culture, religion, ethnicity, weather, geography, and socioeconomic status. Therefore, people in different areas face pretty different conditions. By constructing the cohorts based on area, we can control the area effects as well. Methodology is described in “Methodology,” the data and the empirical results are discussed in “Data” and “Results,” respectively, a comparative analysis is provided in “Comparative Analysis,” suggestions for future studies are presented in “Suggestions for Future Studies,” and the conclusions are stated in “Conclusion.”",3

Indeed, FDI was considered as an important channel for the transmission of technological spillovers, productivity gains spillovers, the implementation of new processes, and the creation of unemployment opportunities (Lee, 2013). Despite the importance of FDI on the socioeconomic side, many debates have arisen on the environmental side. Several research (Copeland & Taylor, 1994; Cole, 2004) has shown that the influx of FDI to natural resource-abundant countries is explained by a tendency to undermine environmental commitments due to the absence or relaxation of regulations governing polluting activities. Given the high regulatory costs in developed countries, many MNCs choose developing countries as a target for FDI in which environmental policies are not prioritized, which gives high-income countries an advantage in highly polluting sectors (Jaffe et al., 1995). This finding is qualified by research as PHH, which was intensely debated especially with accelerated industrialization. In fact, the results of studies on the FDI-CO2 emission nexus are divergent. Some researchers (Lan et al., 2012; Rafindadi et al., 2018) consider that FDI flows allow the reduction of pollution by facilitating the transfer and use of green technologies originating from different developed countries and destined for developing countries. Other studies (Wang et al., 2013; Pazienza, 2019) have indicated that FDI causes a rise in pollution and environmental degradation. It is under this last postulate that the PHH was formulated. In addition to these studies, a third line of research leads to the absence of significant effects of foreign investments on CO2 emissions (Atici, 2012). Other research (Salahuddin et al., 2018; Sapkota & Bastola, 2017) have examined the effects of foreign investments and energy use on environmental degradation independently of each other. While the majority of research (Ang, 2007; Hossain, 2011; Magazzino, 2016; Ansari et al., 2019) agree about the negative fallout of energy use on pollution, the results seem ambiguous when it concerns FDI-CO2 emissions nexus. Moreover, few researches have analyzed the role of governance in reducing pollution. To this end, the question raised by the previous literature is to test if the governance established in host countries is able to attract FDI (Lemi & Asefa, 2003; Ederington et al., 2005; Rodríguez-Pose & Cols, 2017; Abdullah & Tarek, 2020). We address through this research a set of literature gap that can be synthesized as follows: first, there is a divergence of the results on the impact of foreign investments on pollution. This shortcoming can be explained by the choice of the sample as well as the approach adopted in the modeling linking the FDI and variables related to CO2 emissions. In this respect, the majority of studies has not attempted to examine the conditional effects that occur between foreign investments and CO2 emissions. Although there is a set of recent research that has focused on the indirect effects of FDI on environmental degradation (Bokpin, 2017), these effects are still not well examined. Second, few studies have analyzed the moderating impact of governance between both FDI and energy consumption and FDI and CO2 emissions. Previous studies were limited to the moderating effects of governance between FDI and pollution (Anis & Tarek, 2020) and the effects of certain governance mechanisms on CO2 emissions (Ozturk & Al-Mulali, 2015; Sarkodie et al., 2020) without paying attention to the effects of governance on energy demand. In addition, the role of governance was rather analyzed on the side of its ability to motivate the attraction of FDI (Lien et al., 2005; Asiedu, 2006; Morrisey & Udomkerdmongkol, 2012) and not as a factor moderating both the impacts of FDI on energy consumption and environmental degradation. Accordingly, our contributions can be summarized as follows: first, we proposed an in-depth analysis of the validity of PHH by proposing a conceptual and statistical model of the conditional indirect impacts of foreign investments on environmental degradation. While the majority of previous literature has examined the direct effects of foreign investments on CO2 emissions, we have analyzed the FDI-CO2 emission nexus by integrating a moderated mediation model. In other words, our contribution lies in the analysis of the effects of FDI on environmental degradation by integrating both the moderating role of governance and the mediating role of energy consumption. Second, while the majority of research has incorporated governance as a stimulus factor for FDI, in our model, this variable is incorporated as a conditional factor in the FDI-environmental quality nexus. The moderated mediation approach followed in our study in order to examine the effects of FDI on CO2 emissions allows to test whether good governance is able to control energy consumption or reduce pollution. In other words, we will try in this research to answer the following central question: Is governance a factor that can intervene to justify the PHH in GCC countries? Finally, the contribution of this research also resides in the choice of the sample, which is the GCC countries. Indeed, the alignment of GCC with the different vision of economic diversification and the attraction of FDI should not neglect its commitments to international agreements in terms of CO2 emissions. In fact, encouraging the implementation of FDI in GCC countries is a priority in a context of diversification of economic activity, but our knowledge of the impact of foreign investments on the environmental aspect in general and the CO2 emissions in particular remain vague in the case of the GCC countries. To protect against external volatility factors, the GCC countries have revealed in recent years a new direction for economic diversification and a tendency to limit their dependence on oil resources. In this respect, in order to attract FDI, the GCC members successively reduced taxes on the profits and capital gains of foreign-owned enterprises between 2000 and 2010. During this period, inward FDI have increased by 28 times according, to the World Bank. According to the World Bank, the GCC countries have an average FDI per capita of 956 US dollars during the period 2002–2014. However, this orientation has led to a reduction in tax revenues. As a result, in order to restore fiscal balances, the GCC countries have implemented successive increases in real and proposed taxes, such as an increase in corporate taxes from 12 to 15% in Oman and the UAE and a 5% value-added tax in GCC countries until 2018. Moreover, the persistent drop in oil prices in 2014 was at the origin of the urgent need for economic diversification in the GCC countries as a new strategic vision. Although reforms have been implemented through new visions for each of the GCC countries, most of the FDI has been justified by the financial crisis of 2008, and the need to avoid the problem of uncertainties in other markets (The World Bank, 2013). The objective is to facilitate access to foreign markets, greater transmission of know-how and technology transfer to these countries, which can have a positive impact on productivity. Regarding the state of governance, several reforms have been conducted in all GCC countries through administrative easing and administrative burden reduction for foreign firms and the promotion of their image as a planned destination for FDI. To this end, the UAE has established special economic zones governed by flexible regulations and appropriate infrastructure. Bahrain has no lack of liberalization policy compared with UAE. However, strict restrictions on foreign ownership may be a major obstacle, particularly for GCC countries (IMF, 2019). These restrictions concern areas identified by the government (in Bahrain), tourist areas (in Oman), residential areas (in Qatar). Our paper is organized as follows: first, we presented the theoretical background, focusing in particular on the relationships between FDI, CO2 emissions and governance. Secondly, we exposed our research methodology. Finally, we presented our results as well as the discussion, the conclusion, and the policy implications.",5

Carayannis,Luca Dezi,Ernesto Calo,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In scientific literature and business contexts, the “SMART” appellation is used as an acronym in order to evoke the characteristics of well-defined goals. The meaning of the letters that make this acronym is as follows: Specific (targeting a specific area for improvement); Measurable (quantifying or at least suggest an indicator of progress); Achievable (stating what results can realistically be achieved); Relevant (consistent with primary strategies and objectives); and Time-constrained (specifying when the results can be achieved) (Frey & Osterloh, 2002; Dezi et al., 2018). Some scholars and managers have extended the acronym to “SMARTER,” by adding Ethical (goals must sit comfortably within a moral compass) and Recorded (written goals are visible and have a greater chance of success. The recording is necessary for the planning, monitoring, and reviewing of progress) or Evaluated and Reviewed (these are both functions that foresee a constant control and a possible adjustment of the strategies in course of work) (Yemm, 2013). Since innovation is perceived as a vital factor for economic and social development of organizations, regions, and countries, it represents a mean for economic growth, productivity increase, knowledge creation, new occupations, and wealth proliferation. Innovation is also a means by which organizations seek to renew their management skills in particularly complex environments. Today’s economy is characterized by knowledge-intensive activities that contribute to an accelerated pace of technical and scientific advance, as well as rapid obsolescence; thus, the ability to manage complexity and uncertainty is not achieved through their negation. In this sense, innovation and knowledge in smart environments should be the result of a sharing process that involves all the actors of an ecosystem, interpreting complexity as an opportunity and not as a threat. This type of “openness” fits well with the new logics of I5.0, according to which human-centered solutions should be guaranteed for systemic and sustainable development. But if on the one hand we see the formation of industrial and institutional agreements which mostly refer to a “horizontal” openness, where B2B collaboration and knowledge sharing are often crucial for the survival of organizations, on the other hand, how much is the advance actually extended across all the dimensions of an entire ecosystem? How much are decision-making policies the result of common needs for the ecosystem? How do the prioritization processes of firms change if they actually consider the opinion of the beneficiary actors? To investigate these dynamics of smart governance, knowledge, and decision-making in complex organizations, we have chosen to observe the “smart” realities of airport environments. The airport industry is characterized by the usage of a large amount of technology and prototypical solutions, so innovation is a necessary component for upgrading a sector in continuous fervor such as this. Indeed, with the advance of digital transformation, airport environments are at the forefront for the adoption of new technologies regarding Internet of things (IoT), Internet of Services (IoS), overall digitization, data analysis (handling, storing and sharing information through knowledge management practices), and cyber-physical systems (CPSs) for organizing, managing, and improving performance. Over the years, as the aviation industry has matured and grown, a balanced ecosystem has been built through constant growth, change, efforts, and advancements. This ecosystem is particularly suitable for our analysis because all the actors belonging to it are clearly detectable, considering a macro vision (connected countries and their commercial and passengers routes), a meso vision (regional and local dimension), and a micro vision (workers and passengers “living” the airport). Moreover, it emerged that the sector in question is an important business which, in some respects, can drive innovation policies in a systemic perspective. That is why smart environments, such as smart airports (SAs), need to pursue continuous innovation that helps them satisfy the complex ecosystem in which they are inserted. Technology linked to a highly engineered field such as the airport industry has provided a number of evident inputs to implement its products and services. Nevertheless, the current globalized context, highly developed and mature, requires further efforts in this direction. Airports, in fact, are the real physical touch points between different nations and distant geographical areas, thus, if on the one hand the aforementioned digital transformation guarantees a continuous interaction, free from time and space, on the other hand, it is necessary that airports—as physical hubs of a global network—provide the best solutions for an exchange-centered connected world (of both human relations and knowledge). Thus, our aim is to analyze a SA as an environment resulting from a multiple process of innovation, divisible into endogenous technology-push innovations and exogenous demand-pull innovations (Sherer, 1982; Burgelman, 2002; Carayannis. et al., 2011; Silva et al., 2019). We focus in particular on the virtuous dynamics that can be activated by using both a user-driven innovation idea and a systemic perspective, aimed to set the development priorities of the organizations in an I5.0 context. We suppose that this could be a way to enable the decision makers to incorporate external knowledge and resources within their organizations’ boundaries, by investing on a number of improvements actually requested by the ecosystem. In order to do this, we propose a conceptual model and an operational toolkit able to systematize and standardize the prioritization procedures of complex organizations. We also believe that our studies may contribute to the discussion about management of innovation and decision-making policies within knowledge management, both in the specific observed sector and in other complex environments. Therefore, the paper is organized as follows: the second section gives an overview of scientific literature dealing with open innovation and innovation systems in complex and smart environments, focusing attention on the participatory dynamics in which the firm is inserted and from which it must rethink its decision-making policies and knowledge exploration and exploitation practices. The third section illustrates data arising from the “Leonardo da Vinci—Rome Fiumicino Airport” case study, explaining the methodology used and informing about possible innovation paths for data analysis in decision-making processes. The fourth section discusses results, considering policy implications both for scholars and practitioners. Finally, the last section summarizes the main findings, with a look on research limitations and potentials for future research.",48

13.0,2.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,25 February 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00726-9,"Cluster Space Among Labor Productivity, Urbanization, and Agglomeration of Industries in Hungary",June 2022,Devesh Singh,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The spatial study is a widely investigated topic in past decades, especially for the industrial agglomeration pattern. Agglomeration of industries can be driven by the different regional factors such as firms that are located near to the same type of secondary industry that are beneficial and so-called localization of industries. Further, the industry-specific productive employee attracts this type of cluster and brings new skill, knowledge, innovation, and expertise. These skilled laborers enhance productivity in that area and also positively contributed to the process of urbanization. The three factors industrial agglomeration, labor productivity (LP), and urbanization are co-existing together and, possibly create the cluster space. So, the essential question is worth examining whether there is a spatial concentration among LP, urbanization, and agglomeration of industries. To examine this relation, first, we explore the cluster space among the listed variables through density-based clustering methodology. The second step is the verifying stage since we assumed that all three variables are co-existing in space and form a cluster, to verify this co-existence there should be a significant relation among LP, urbanization, and agglomeration. Therefore, we use the cluster-wise simultaneous equation approach that we found through the spatial density pattern and signify the relation among LP, urbanization, and agglomeration of industries. Third, we used the Kohonen self-organizing maps of supervised and unsupervised machine learning to deeply examine the insight of cluster space, and further, we present the cluster for manufacturing industries in Hungary, for binary phase: the first phase of manufacturing cluster where the industries are in declining phase and gross value added (GVA) or LP is lower and another phase of manufacturing cluster where the industries are in growing phase and gross value added is above the national average according to (Lengyel et al., 2017). Lall et al. (2004) states that the agglomeration of economies has two types. First is the localization in which the firm tries to locate near to another firm of the same industry. Hence, high skilled labor attracts to these clusters and causes a specialized labor pool. Second is the case of agglomeration economies due to the external to the firm; these firms have proximity to the other industries so-called urbanization of economies.
 The concept among the LP urbanization and agglomeration easily understand by the theory of economic geography. Henderson et al. (2001) stated that the net benefits of industrial agglomeration in dense urban areas are immensely accumulated by innovative and technology intensive sectors. This is because the benefit of sharing creative ideas and access to producer services (i.e., venture capital) is remarkably higher compared with low-end manufacturing, which engages in the standardized production process. So, as a result, these innovative sectors afford to locate in dense urban areas and ready to pay high wages and rent in dense urban location industry clusters if other factors (e.g., transport) are constant or have negligible effect. Therefore, in this industrial framework, low-end industry producing standardized product tries to locate in small urban centers where rent is lower. The spatial structure of Hungarian industries is the result of interactions of centripetal and centrifugal forces of industrial agglomeration. The literature has confirmed that industrial agglomeration contributes to the growth of LP and further LP leads to urbanization (Abel et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2009). So, LP and industrial agglomeration are mutually related (Ke, 2009). In another scenario, post-socialist economies became an indispensable part of the global economy and export become significant and modern industries emerged in Hungary, although the process became halted in 2008 global crises and the concept of reindustrialization (such as neighboring regions near to the Austrian border) and deindustrialization (such as the Buda-Pest region) emerged. Reorganization of center-periphery regions is already happening in post-socialist countries such as reindustrialization in Hungary (Lengyel et al., 2017), which makes the Hungarian regions a perfect ground to analyze the cluster space among agglomeration, LP, and urbanization.  There is literature that discusses the relationship between agglomeration and industrial productivity, agglomeration and LP, agglomeration and urbanization, and agglomeration and technology spillover. To the best of my knowledge, no study has included all three variables together at the regional/county level study especially in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) countries. This work attempts to fill this gap contributes to the empirical literature and uses the county level data. Further, the present study aims to fill this literature gaps by addressing the two following questions: First, whether the LP, agglomeration, and urbanizations form a cluster space in Hungary for the post-socialist period from 2001 to 2018, and if so, then which variable dominance in the regions to form a cluster node. Second, what role does industrial development play in spatial integration? The main objectives of this article are as follow: (i) present the clusters space through the variables; (ii) examine the relationships among the variables; (iii) analyses the LP, urbanization, and agglomeration concerning industrial cluster space; and (iv) explore the Kohonen supervised and unsupervised machine learning approach. Further, this article is propagated as follows: (i) discuss the related literature on agglomeration, LP, and urbanization; (ii) data and methodology for this study; (iii) discussion of empirical results; and (iv) summarization and conclusion by offering suggestion and policy implications.",6

In the current era, the appearance of the knowledge-based economy predominately driven by knowledge process capabilities, digitalization, and the emergence of globalization has raised the significance of IC as a tool for capacity building in organizations. Therefore, the transition from a production-based to a knowledge-based economy has changed the processes of wealth and value creation particularly in emerging economies (Chu et al., 2011; Yi & Davey, 2010; Petty & Guthrie, 2000). In addition, the growing importance of KBV has also increased the significance of IC as a source of competitive positioning and value creation for firms operating in knowledge-driven economies (Schiuma & Lerro, 2015). Manufacturing and retail economies are fast-paced and technologically oriented emerging economies, principally driven by knowledge resources (Canibano et al., 2000), where intangibles are attributed as the IC of organizations used to achieve competitive positioning and value creation (Barney, 1991; Cordazzo, 2007; Tayles et al., 2007; Petty & Guthrie, 2000; Yi & Davey, 2010). However, organizations are principally evaluated in terms of their corporate financial and accounting information (Alwert et al., 2009) and information about intangibles is hardly ever revealed in annual reports or on the Web sites of organizations (Wang et al., 2016; Yi & Davey, 2010). This imbalance in information can lead to poor evaluations and the misallocation of funds (Alwert et al., 2009) because conventional financial reporting standards (FRS) explicitly fail to include intangibles in the annual reports of firms except for goodwill and patents (Gigante, 2013; Shiu, 2006; Joshi et al., 2013). Garcia-Meca et al. (2005) argued that traditional financial reporting mechanisms highlight the incongruences between book and market values and hide key information about the drivers of value creation particularly related to intangibles (Mavrinac & Boyle, 1996). This study uses the prism of KBV—which is an extension of resource-based view (RBV)—and institutional theory to establish whether the structure of IC disclosure practices in the financial sector of emerging markets (BRICS) is voluntary or based on various institutional factors that exert pressure to adopt accounting practices for the external reporting of intangible assets (Carpenter & Feroz, 2001). Prior research argued that institutional factors complement the resource-dependent theory that enriches understanding of accounting choice and the dissemination of accounting principles and practices across the institutional environment (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983; Palmer et al., 1993; Meyer & Rowan, 1977). Nevertheless, one of the premises of using institutional legitimacy is collating and disclosing the increasing volume of information related to intangibles. These legitimate practices regarding intangibles can be found in organizational structures through coercive and normative pressures (Palmer et al., 1993; Meyer & Rowan, 1977). Coercive isomorphism refers to influences exerted by external forces such as customers, competitors, suppliers, regulatory bodies, political groups, and so on. This organizational legitimacy is often communicated through rules, regulations, procedures, structures, government mandates, and financial reporting standards (DiMaggio & Powell, 1983). Normative isomorphism refers to cultural-cognitive support or professional values (peer networking and socialization, certification and formal education, training developments, etc.) that have more explanatory power for the adoption of accounting practices (Meyer & Scott, 1982). BRICS is an economic integration of five emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). These economies contribute around 31% of world GDP (Mohan & Kapur, 2015). Due to favorable economic changes and infrastructural capabilities, the BRICS nations dramatically shifted themselves from production-based to knowledge-based economies. These countries have introduced significant reforms for financial development in the last 25 years, and the financial performance indicators of banks here have shown dramatic improvement with collective domestic credit expansion of $22 trillion representing around 22% of world domestic credit growth in 2017 (Gupta & Rao, 2018). The emergence of financial development has been another important element in swelling the financial capital funds in the capital and money markets of these countries. Therefore, in the context of BRICS, the disclosure of information about intangibles related to the financial products and derivatives of banks increases capital funding access and economic prosperity, which is another major premise of this study. IC-driven investment initiatives by firms using internal, external and human capital have convinced managers to disclose IC-related information in annual reports and on Web sites as an indicator of value and wealth creation (Tayles et al., 2007; Petty & Guthrie, 2000; Yi & Davey, 2010). The disclosure of IC information reduces information asymmetry and strengthens the relationships between stakeholders. However, due to the lack of significant IC accounting frameworks around the globe, it is difficult to understand, measure, and disclose IC (Yi & Davey, 2010; Petty & Guthrie, 2000). IC in the form of internal capital (intellectual property, management philosophy and culture, IT systems, processes, etc.), external capital (brands, distributions channels, licensing agreements, business collaboration, etc.), and human capital (employee education and training, entrepreneurial abilities, etc.) has replaced tangible capital as a source of competitive positioning for enterprises (Yi & Davey, 2010; Wong & Gardner, 2005). Drawing from the above, it can be concluded that IC has been robustly implicated in social, managerial, economic, and technological developments (Itami, 1991; Smith, 1994). Joshi et al. (2012) asserted that IC is especially important for banks, which mostly depend on the innovation, skills, knowledge, and expertise of employees. IC disclosure reveals important information about the affairs of banks in this competitive environment. However, in the past, it was hidden and unclear (Petty & Guthrie, 2000). Reports on IC disclosure can lead to better transparency and accountability of firms towards disclosure of the hidden value of intangibles (the difference between book and market value) and reduce possible errors in the risk evaluation and strategic development of organizations (Alwert et al., 2009; Edvinsson & Malone, 1997). IC reporting on intangibles is a significant way of bridging the information gap between managers and stakeholders (Eccles & Mavrinac, 1995). This information asymmetry has led the authors of this study to analyze the patterns and structures of IC disclosure practices in the financial sectors of BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) over 5 years (2015–2019). Prior research on IC has provided useful information related to IC identification, recognition, development, disclosure, and application in business and management practices (Sveiby, 1997a, b; Edvinsson & Malone, 1997; Stewart, 1997; Petty & Guthrie, 2000; Tan et al., 2008). These studies argued that recognizing and disclosing IC in annual reports and Web sites improves the current and future performance of firms (Edvinsson & Malone, 1997; Bukh et al., 1999). Existing research on IC in advanced nations such as Japan, Spain, Italy, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand is country-specific and cross-sectional in nature (Mavridis, 2004; Oliveras et al., 2008; Bozzolan et al., 2003; Petty & Guthrie, 2000; Bontis, 2003; Garcıa-Meca et al., 2005; Whiting & Miller, 2008). Among these studies, few were conducted in the context of emerging economies using content analysis on longitudinal data sets (Singh & Kansal, 2011; Majdalany & Henderson, 2013; Rep et al., 2019; Mehrotra et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016; Yi & Davey, 2010; Rehman et al., 2018; Nadeem et al., 2017; Kamath, 2008). Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, there is a dearth of research on comparative studies of IC disclosure particularly in the financial sectors of the largest and fast-growing emerging economies of the world (BRICS). This research attempts to review whether the propensity for (frequency) and quality of (mean score) IC divulgence practices in BRICS banks are in-line with the theoretical premise of KBV (knowledge resources) or institutional theory.",5

Kostis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"An assessment of how well the Eurozone economies have done during the euro adoption period as well as their vulnerability to the effects of the recent global economic crisis is matter of concern for the research community (Dallago, 2013; De Grauwe & Yuemei, 2013; Petrakis et al., 2013). There have been various reasons why Europe has been so seriously affected by the recent global financial crisis. However, one of the most popular arguments is that the peripheral countries of the Eurozone suffered from a lack of “competitiveness” (Jones, 2016; Petrakis et al., 2013). The underlying issue examined in this paper is how well the Eurozone economies managed to confront the recent crisis as well as whether the recent global financial crisis has increased the imbalances in the Eurozone or whether its management has reduced those imbalances. For this purpose, the papers tries to capture the Success Story of the Eurozone economies constructing an appropriate index, for two main sub-periods—before and after the recent global financial crisis- but also for the whole period under analysis. Thus, a comparison of the economic performance of economies is examined, which form a single economic monetary union, and is highlighted in which direction and in what extent the crisis has affected those economies. The contribution of this paper to the relevant literature is mainly concerned on the fact that the economic performance of the economies is based on the factors through which the real effective exchange rate is calculated, factors which, in addition to the competitiveness of the economies, determine to a significant degree the domestic economic environment of the economies composing the dataset. This leads to important policy conclusions useful to policy makers and decision-makers from each economy or at a European level. Furthermore, through calculating an Index of Economic Success for the Eurozone economies the analysis concludes on how each economy responded to the effects of the crisis. Comparative analysis between economies is offered, as well as the ranking of economies in each of the five sub-indices and the overall index, while all calculations are realized for the total of the Eurozone too. Last but not least, the analysis takes a stand on the extent to which crisis management has led to a reduction in the Eurozone imbalances, and thus to the extent to which the crisis has been a slowing or accelerating factor in the process of European integration. The paper’s structure is as follows: the “The Success and the Performance of Economies” section describes the concept of success and economic performance in the literature. The “Competitiveness and Economic Performance” section presents the theoretical background on the factors that shape the competitiveness of the economies. “The Data” section describes the data to be used in the analysis and “The Methodology Employed” section the methodology used to build the success indicator. The “Results and Discussion” section describes the results of the analysis and discusses the results. Finally, the “Conclusions” section sets out the conclusions.",1

Barakat,Hisham M. AlSmadi,Khalifeh M. Abu-Ashour,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Major revolutions have occurred in the global economy in the last two decades. In order to improve the economy, focus on key areas is mandatory (Širá et al., 2020). A transition is being observed from agriculture economy, where manual labor is the critical element, to industrial economy, where the management of resources was the essential element. According to Tripathi (2006), these transitions cause the movement of global economy towards the information era whose core elements are the connectivity and software-driven products. The transition is characterized by global competition, frequent changes, rapid information processing, faster communication, enhanced complexity in business, and pervasive globalization. The rapid transformation has changed the dynamics of economy, and new firms have emerged and captured the market economy. As explained by Pasternack and Viscio (1998), the rapidly evolving and growing economy has initiated the transformation process in every sector, for example, changes in the production and perceptions of consumers. The current dynamics of the economy demands an evolved and efficient economic system. The formation of knowledge economy highlights the onset of a new stage in the development of the global economy (Zhuparova et al., 2018). The modern era came up with the emergence of a unique economic phenomenon, characterized by a significant decrease in the costs of coding, transmitting, and acquiring knowledge. Since the mid-twentieth century, economic literature has on the post-industrial era, where indicators have begun to move towards the adoption of knowledge as a basis to build the economic system of countries. The development of the economic system depends on technological development, rapid exchange, and adoption of knowledge and data, which is known as knowledge society (Hadad, 2017). It includes the indicators of Jordan’s spending on scientific research and creativity. The need of knowledge economy is based on the creation of modern economies, whereas scientific research, knowledge, and innovation lead to economic development and growth (Wirba, 2017). The increased importance of knowledge in all economic sectors has contributed towards the continuous development of knowledge economy (Marti & do Rosário Cabrita, 2012). This requires strengthening long-term investments in education, developing the ability to innovate, modernizing the information infrastructure, and creating an enabling economic environment (Chen & Dahlman, 2005). According to Pupavac et al. (2019), the new economy has become focused on developing workforce knowledge so that knowledge increases the contribution of productive institutions to GDP. Kaur and Mehta (2016) emphasized that knowledge-based productive capabilities have greater potential to generate a competitive advantage, and this requires that productive institutions use knowledge at the higher basic level of production to meet global competitiveness. The focus on transformation to “Knowledge economies” is an effort to diversify the economies and create jobs with high knowledge content among the local populations (Hvidt, 2016). The importance of the knowledge economy lies in the fact that it possesses the ability to innovate, find, and generate entirely new intellectual and knowledgeable outcomes. It helps to create and find unprecedented, more satisfying, and convincing products for the consumers and distributors (Begg, 2003). Therefore, the focus is on developing knowledge economy as a result of increasing importance of knowledge in all sectors of economy (Marti & do Rosário Cabrita, 2012), and this requires strengthening long-term investments in education, developing the ability to innovate, modernizing the information infrastructure, and creating an enabling economic environment (Chen & Dahlman, 2005). Since the twentieth century, which is considered to be an industrial era, the need of a more efficient and effective economic system has been emphasized, an economic system in which primary indicators must be other than labor and capital. It leads to the emergence of a unique economic phenomenon, characterized by a significant decrease in the costs of coding, transmitting, and acquiring knowledge; this was reflected in a rapid increase in knowledge outputs, and the growing place of change in economic activity and activities was devoted to innovation. The knowledge economy can be defined as a possible way of transforming society to achieve sustainable economic growth and combat challenges arising from the growing scarcity of resources (Rezny et al., 2019). As explained by Hadad (2017), the economic system of a country is based on knowledge rather than capital and labor. The economy functions on the technological advancements and frequent exchange and adaptation of knowledge and data. The relatively smaller states with limited natural resources can depend on this economy and be better benefited in comparison with the traditional economy system. According to Talal (2019), the Jordanian economy and features show similarities with that of Finland; therefore, Jordan can also perform as well as Finland with respect to knowledge-based economy. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate the transition process as Jordan moves towards a knowledge economy.",1

Primarily, this is due to the fact that the world entered a new stage of development, the base of which is an economy based on knowledge and indicators related to it. Its distinguishing feature is that knowledge incentives play critical role in enhancing economies, and its creation, use, and dissemination are sources of national or regional economic growth. Hence, the production of material resources is gradually displaced from the main part of the global economy by “production” of knowledge. However, economy of many developing countries still vastly rests on mining the natural resources. As many other resource-rich countries, Kazakhstan’s economy for its almost 30 years of independence substantially depends on natural resources and manufacturing of raw materials sector, especially oil. Since it causes constant economic instabilities, many reports state that the country needs to profoundly broaden its economy from over-reliance on extraction sectors. At this point, many scholars and international think-tanks argue that in order to catch up and stay competitive in the global arena, countries necessitate quality economic diversification towards the knowledge-based one (World Bank Institute, 2007, Asognu & Nwachukwu, 2017; Tchamyou, 2017; Nurunnabi, 2017; Parcero & Ryan, 2017; Hanif & Arshed, 2016; Salheih & Mashal, 2011; Nour, 2015). Despite the government of Kazakhstan introduced many socio-economic implementations to diversify its economy, national institutions seem to fail enforcing sound changes in those initiatives. Nevertheless, there is a shortage of research based on this topic in Kazakhstan and the current paper aims to examine the state of economy in Kazakhstan from the 1996 to 2014, problems in ensuring the knowledge-based economy (KBE), and perspectives of the framework as a valid instrument for quality economic diversification. The paper intends to answer the three basic questions: What indicators had the most effect to economy in 1996–2014? Does the economy of Kazakhstan ensure economic security to its citizens and the country as a whole? and What policy steps and socio-political changes are needed for becoming KBE? The  article contains six parts. Introduction to the research is followed by the “Socio-economic Background of Kazakhstan” in order to understand current affairs. “Literature Review” discloses studies on the subject matter, and as a sub-section of the “Literature Review,” the next section reveals KBE frameworks and description of four pillars in the context of Kazakhstan. Data analyses are given in the “Data and Methodology” section, and paper finishes with the discussions of the results and conclusion with policy recommendations.",4
13.0,2.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,04 March 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00769-y,"Greening Universities with Mode 3 and Quintuple Helix Model of Innovation–Production of Knowledge and Innovation in Knowledge-Based Economy, Botswana",June 2022,Shantha Indrajith Hikkaduwa Liyanage,Fulu Godfrey Netswera,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In the endeavor of achieving higher living standard and wellbeing of people by increasing the economic growth, it is apparent that a newer economic growth model, knowledge-based economies (KBEs), plays a vital role (Svarc & Dabic, 2017) in all advanced industrialized economies and many developing economies around the world. These KBEs around the world are meant to be “economies which are directly based on the production, distribution, and use of knowledge and information” (OECD, 1996). Their ultimate objective is to achieve sustainable development by investing in human capital, technology, knowledge, and innovation to produce skilled, creative, innovative people and organizations with sustainability values and natural environment values. In responding to the need of the hour, the Quintuple Helix model of innovation (Carayannis & Campbell, 2010) by its fifth helix, natural environment, bridged the gap described above. The model is an extension of the Quadruple Helix model of innovation (Carayannis & Campbell, 2009). It introduced the fourth helix, Media-based and Culture-based Public and Civil Society, to embed and extend the Triple Helix model of innovation (Etzkowitz & Leydesdorff, 1995). The Triple Helix model of innovation (THMI) contextualizes the three helices, Government, Industry, and University, shifting the production of knowledge and innovation from conventional Mode 1 to Mode 2 as theorized by Gibbons et al. (1994). The Quadruple Helix model of innovation (QuadHMI), by one of its four helices called Media-based and Culture-based Public and Civil Society further shifted the production of knowledge and innovation from Mode 2 to Mode 3. The Quintuple Helix model of innovation (QuinHMI) by one of its helices called the natural environment paved the way for producing green knowledge and innovation, preferably Mode 3, to a new quality of life in KBEs. After lapsing half of a decade since the introduction of QuinHMI, two universal top-down policies, Paris Climate Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for 17 Sustainable Development Goals with 169 targets and 300 plus indicators, endorsed QuinHMI. They mandated economies explicitly, including universities, to link their economic activities with nature, in other words, sustainable development. The vision and mission of these two universal packages and the QuinHMI were founded on the basis of enlightened anthropocentrism to bridge the gap made by the inability of the naturalness of the planet to be resilient for distortions caused by the business as usual. Hence, the success story of the sustainable world is dependent on the production of green knowledge and innovation, among other endogenous factors of KBEs. However, the nature and scope of the (green) knowledge meant for sustainability is to be understood in the context of glocal (global and local) knowledge economy and society (Carayannis & Campbell, (2011); Carayannis & Alexander, 2006; Carayannis & von Zedtwitz, 2005). Accordingly, the production of green knowledge and innovation is imperative for sustainable development in KBEs. Mode 3, or else Mode 2, is ideal for bridging scientific knowledge and non-scientific knowledge collaboratively to solve social problems. In contrast, the universities conventionally produce knowledge and innovation in pursuit of knowledge, Mode 1. They produce their scientific knowledge within autonomous disciplines in their mainstream. They do not contextualize knowledge to solve social problems. The boundaries between the universities and industry are not blurred (Gibbons et al., 1994). In other words, Mode 1 is not adequate to solve social problems. As a result, Mode 2 and Mode 3 have evolved combining scientific knowledge and social contexts. It is a reflexive knowledge production system with reverse communication. Namely, science speaks to society, and society speaks back to science (Nowotny et al., 2001). Nevertheless, there is a lethargic transition of knowledge production from Mode 1 to Mode 2 and Mode 3 in Botswana (Onyancha & Maluleka, 2011). The precise reason is structural issues. It did not dominate education and innovation even for a single year during the period from 1995 to 2010, according to the World Bank knowledge economy index (KEI) in African countries (Asongu et al., 2018). Further, the knowledge economy index was gradually falling from 5.07 in 1996 to 4.31 in 2012 (Knoema, 2019). The conventional structure of universities by governance, culture, curriculum, research, community outreach, internal operations, and the reporting system creates institutional barriers for producing green knowledge with Mode 2 or Mode 3. Isomorphism, legitimacy, institutional logic, and bureaucratization dominate to defend the conventional structure. These structural issues should be addressed in particular with the education system (universities) because universities are strongly interconnected for creating knowledge and innovation in KBEs (George, 2006). Each of the universities must be a credible institution which is a precondition to provide a stable structure for human interaction with less uncertainty for sustainable development in KBEs. Further, the recent local and global developments warrant universities to actively contribute to economic growth moving away from the ivory towers’ role. Botswana Vision 2036 has already been initiated to be a KBE. It ratified and domesticated the 2030 agenda for 17 SDGs. Botswana is committed by Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris Climate Agreement. Consequently, a transition of knowledge production with QuinHMI from Mode 1 to Mode 2 or Mode 3 with the QuinHMI is imperative. The journey launched is evident by the Botswana Qualification Authority (BQA)’s vision that it is “To make Botswana nucleus of Global Competitive Knowledge and Skills”. Hence, this study is carried out to design a Green University System with contemporary social rules guided by Mode 03 with QuinHMI superior to THMI. The characteristics of Mode 3, pluralism, and diversity of knowledge and innovation systems lift the quality of developed or less developed society and economies from the current level to the next level. Further, Mode 3 allows and emphasizes the coexistence and co-evolution of different knowledge and innovation paradigms (Carayannis & Campbell, 2010: 51–57), namely, six types of knowledge and innovation systems, Mode 1, Mode 2, Mode 3, THMI, QuadHMI, and QuinHMI (Carayannis et al., 2012). Even though all these six types of models can be used to create green knowledge and innovation at different levels of degrees, Mode 3 and QuinHMI enable the production of the highest quality of green knowledge and innovation needed for sustainable development. Consequently, a university reconfigured as a green university enables the production of green knowledge and innovation as “glocal green knowledge and innovation” with six types of knowledge systems. Accordingly, the following research questions were framed in this exploratory research. “Why are universities unable to create green knowledge and innovation for sustainable development in Botswana as a KBE?” “Construct a blueprint in terms of Mode 3 with QuinHMI, which could be used to create green knowledge and innovation collaboratively with co-creation for sustainable development in Botswana as a KBE?” However, the study is subject to three assumptions. One of them is that the prevailing knowledge production system will be evolved from Mode 1 to Mode 3 and QuinHMI to meet Botswana’s 2036 vision. The second assumption is that the prevailing degree of democracy beyond constitutional democracy is adequate and will be further developed with vision 2036 to benefit the fourth helix of QuinHMI. The third assumption is that the proposed system to produce green knowledge and innovation with Mode 3 and QuinHMI includes the other four knowledge systems, Mode 1, Mode 2, THMI, and QuadHMI, because Mode 3 and QuinHMI is the broadest and superior knowledge production system. A proposed design named “green university system,” which integrates all essential elements of a green university, could be incorporated into the conventional structure of the universities so that they enable the production of high-skilled human capital with sustainable values to protect the ecology by being a green university in a KBE. Further, the universities designed for sustainable development enable collaboration, contextualization, and co-creation of green knowledge and innovation effectively and efficiently with all five helices. Furthermore, the proposed green universities enable the production of green knowledge and innovation in their mainstream process. Besides, universities that are not sustainable enable ascertaining their Status Quo and transform their universities into sustainable universities by adopting the proposed design. In support, Di Nauta et al. (2015) point out that universities are accountable for developing the country in which it operates. They have to offer solutions by collaboration and co-create developing instruments, tools, and models for social issues. The QuinHMI as a tool collaborate with five contexts, in particular fourth and fifth helix, the best example of a democracy-based society in Taiwan, one of the most successful countries that controlled the COVID-19 epidemic. It was a collaboration between the industry and the government to supply face mask and manage the inventory’s panic buying with an application program interface. Further, Taiwan used (digital) democracy beyond constitutional democracy by bottom-up sharing of information, participatory collective actions, and hacktivism. When hacktivists work with open data projects to provide citizens with updated real-time inventory levels and the nearest pharmacy location to claim free masks without panic buying, the Taiwan government responded incorporating a bottom-up process instead of a top-down distribution system, reverse procurement (The Conversation, 2020). Further, COVID-19 has a direct relationship with the natural environment, the fifth helix of QuinHM. Mandal and Panwar (2020) argue that an increase of 1 °C of air temperature decreases .86% of infected people. Chin et al. (2020) point out that 4 °C of air temperature for a long period can resist the virus, and they further point out that the virus cannot survive for more than 5 min when the air temperature is 70 °C. World Health Organization (2020) expresses that sunlight and high air temperature could defeat the virus. Therefore, an interdisciplinary collaboration (including the natural environment of the society) is essential for the post-COVID-19 period as per a study of 32,365 nationally funded sustainability projects from the USA, EU, and Japan (Lee et al., 2020). After the introduction, together with the research problem, research questions, and the managerial implications of the study above mentioned, the next section/second section deals with the literature review under which theoretical framework is discussed to facilitate various principles of theories underpinned in this study. The third section is the methodology under which the research philosophy and the research design is discussed. The fourth section deals with the findings and discussion under which the research questions are first explored. After that, the findings and recommendations are uncovered. The fifth section is the conclusion that summarizes the findings and their significance. After that, the limitations of the study and the areas for future researches are stated. The final section is the list of references which strengthened the entire study.",12

It is approximation that CO2 emission will be increased many folds by 2050, if it is not cured.Footnote 1 The relationship between environment and development is on front strands in recent years. According to Hale and Selden (1999), three main research aspects exist in literature exploring the relation between environmental performance and growth. Environmental Kuznets Curve is a first strand which determines nexus of environmental pollutants and growth. Energy consumption and growth relation is second strand while the third strand combines these strands along with incorporating social, political, and social behaviors (Acaravci & Ozturk, 2010; Wang et al., 2020; Zhang & Cheng, 2009). The third strand has broader association for analysis, assessment, and policy design to preserve environment along with economic growth. It is a great challenge for policy-makers and researchers to stop further environmental deterioration and to determine those channels responsible for such deterioration. The importance of institutions cannot be negated for economic growth and prosperity. Institutions also play their role for environmental performance as highlighted by Alesina and Zhuravskaya (2011) arguing that poor environmental policies in an economy are due to weak institutional quality. The weak institutions are unable for effective implementation of policies related to environment. Ibrahim and Law (2014) highlighted that strong institutions are magical option for environmental protection while Zhang et al. (2009) is of view that the economic growth may be enhanced further in association with high-quality institutions, good governance, and protecting the environment. Madni and Anwar (2020), Dhrifi (2018), Sahli and Rejeb (2015), and Ulman and Bujancă (2014) explored the importance of institutional quality for environmental performance. It is considered that awareness of people and freedom for political and informational rights put a pressure for environmental legislation. Institutional quality in a country reduces the environmental pollutants on the one side while high-quality institutions attract more foreign direct investment on the other side. This FDI is a source for advent of environmental friendly technology. The better institutions are a source of economic growth, but their fruit can be ripened through promoting green growth and sustainable development. Egbetokun et al. (2016) investigated the role of institutions for guarding the environment and found that powerful institutions develop the environment through re-location of CO2 emitting businesses and provide direction to control the pollution. On other side, weak institutional quality remains unable to meet the environmental and pollution challenges. The theoretical relationship among various variables is given in Fig. 1. Theoretical relationship among variables. Source: Ochola et al. (2010) Ethnic diversity is a social aspect which may play its role for environmental performance. The immigration schemes launched by developed countries and globalization reveal the importance of ethnic diversity for environment. The literature describing the relationship between environment and ethnic fractionalization is still at its infancy. According to Alesina et al. (2003), ethnic fractionalization slows economic growth having impact on environmental performance measured by carbon dioxide emissions. On the other side, Fafchamps (2000) argued that societies with more diversity have higher level of innovations and technology which may reduce environmental deterioration. Secondly, ethnic diversity increases the cohesion of communities for better control and influencing the carbon emissions (Alesina et al., (2014). There is also another side of picture; Videras and Bordoni (2006) argued that ethnically diverse areas of New York and New Jersey have weak enforcement of environmental laws due to less cohesion to coordinate among different ethnic groups and creating solidarity across communities. So, ethnic fractionalization negatively affects the ability of a country to execute the large-scale initiatives like environmental policies and regulations. Milem (2003) is of view that people of different races and culture have greater tendency for active participation in community-oriented services as compared with those people having very limited interaction with heterogeneous group. Moreover, homogenous community groups do not thrive in environments that require efficient and quick decision-making while heterogeneous groups have the ability to adapt better decisions and environmental protection. The politics of any country is one of the fundamental motives for environmental performance as pointed out by Schnaiberg and Gould (1994) and Schnaiberg (1980). They are of view that industrialist countries develop a “treadmill of production” generating the problem for ecology. The soundness of “treadmill of production” is a source to increase the level of wages and profits to get the high-quality living standard. Corporations are in struggle to increase their returns by decreasing costs through technology, and technology is reason for economic expansion while economic expansion is making two logical dimensions of a country: generation of economic wealth and generation of negative byproducts during production processes. Gould et al. (1996) argued, “Thus the treadmill operates to maintain a positive rate of return on investments and externalizes the environmental costs of its activities. The social and economic benefits of the treadmill are unevenly distributed in favor of business and affluent communities, whereas the environmental risks associated with the treadmill are disproportionately concentrated among specific groups of people with the least ability to resist the location of polluting facilities in their community. Thus polluting facilities are sited among the most vulnerable groups: the poor, unskilled laborers and the skilled blue collar residents”. Figure 2 draws a sketch revealing the relation between CO2 emission and other political, economic, and social factors. Interaction effects between CO2 emission and other variables The financial sector of an economy has great importance for environmental performance. There is momentous importance for development of financial sector due to bridging the working of an economy and technological innovations. The financial sector is a source to improve the industrialization and technology in an economy. The savings of the economy are channelized through the financial sector and encourage the economic agents to invest in environment-friendly technology which plays its role to reduce pollutants globally in production process. Contrary, developed financial sector may be a source to increase the CO2 emissions due to cheaper investments increasing the installation of new projects and industries. Jalil and Feridun (2011) and Shahbaz et al. (2013); highlighted the importance of the financial sector for the environment of any economy. There are different channels through which the financial sector may affect the atmosphere. It provides the capital to industrial sector, and this industry is deteriorating the environment. According to Ayeche et al (2016), Gokmenoglu et al (2015), and Sehrawat et al. (2015), development of financial sector increases growth in association with industrial expansion, resultantly increasing the pollution. The efficient financial system creates convenience for producers and consumers to buy commodities emitting carbon dioxide–like generators, ACs, construction of houses, and vehicles. Moreover, environment-friendly technology helped through financial sector to improve environmental performance via establishing green industry as investigated by Yuxiang and Chen (2010) and Jalil and Feridun (2011). A massive literature explores the relation between carbon dioxide emission and growth, but little attention is given to reveal the significance of institutions, ethnic diversity, and financial sector for environmental performance. The main purpose of paper is to investigate the relation among environmental performance, political freedom, institutional quality, ethnic diversity, and financial sector in developing economies.",7

Using connectivity, digital platforms, and data, smart cities have emerged as a way to address more effectively complex contemporary challenges of growth, sustainability, and governance and provide more intelligent systems for decision-making and innovation (Komninos & Kakderi, 2019). Smart cities are formed at the intersection of digital technologies, disruptive innovation, and urban environments (Deloitte, 2015) and constitute a rising urban paradigm, “a hegemonic phenomenon in the contemporary metropolis” (Rodrigues & Costa, 2020). The concept envisages a data-enhanced city future and efficiency gains made possible by automation of services and utilities (Batty, 2018). Streitz (2017) outlined the landscape of smart city spaces resulting from connectivity: the Internet of Everything (IoE), a term coined by Cisco for people, processes, data, and things connected into an overall network that uses machine-to-machine communication (M2M), machine-to-people (M2P), and people-to-people (P2P) interactions; hubs connecting many urban objects, in the form of public spaces, streets, parking lots, marketplaces, shopping malls; commuting spaces working as ‘transient spaces’; smart cities and ecosystems; self-aware cities that know themselves and communicate this knowledge to citizens; hybrid cities that combine real and virtual worlds through augmented reality solutions which generate overlays and multiple representations of the environment; and cooperative cities supported by computer-enabled cooperative work. The development of these spaces, which drive the formation of smart cities, take place per city ecosystem (or vertical market), and advance by sector-focused projects and e-services, data collection, and analytics (Appio et al., 2019; Faber et al., 2018; Zygiaris, 2013). This segmented development is attributed to the diversity of city ecosystems, market complexity, the features of each ecosystem, and other specificities and has been addressed as a public sector ‘complexity paradox’, the more complex policy issues are, the more compartmentalized policy-making becomes (Mazzucato, 2019). However, this development path brings about two weaknesses. First, there is strong compartmentation of digital solutions and smart systems across vertical markets for energy, transport, waste management, water management, governance, safety in the public space, and others. An estimation of the smart city market in 2020 by Frost and Sullivan (2019) reveals a total market value of 1.5 trillion, segmented into smart governance and education (20.93%), smart energy (16.65%), smart security (14.11%), smart water and waste management (13.75%), smart transportation (9.09%), smart healthcare (15.26%), and smart building (10.21%). These systems are developed in silos with low interoperability and solutions rollout between them. Most solutions available on the market do not share infrastructure between them, nor generated data, even though they could benefit from such exchanges (Weber & Zarko, 2019). Vertical markets prevail. Compartmentation is an obstacle to smart city replication as different solutions have to be designed for every ecosystem of a city, which increases costs, effort, management, and maintenance complexity. It hampers synergies, but also the scaling up of solutions and economies of scale through adoption across city ecosystems. Second, there is low effectiveness of smart city solutions, which leads to small or marginal increases in performance and feeds disappointment and mistrust about the efficiency and added value of smart city systems. For instance, the most ambitious target in Amsterdam Smart City was to reduce CO2 emissions by 40% from the 1990 baseline by 2015 (Amsterdam Smart City, n.a.). The City of Ghent implemented a multimodal traffic management system based on Variable-Message-Sign for travel information, traffic light management, and parking guidance, which increased the speed of public transport by 5%, and the park and ride by 10%. In Aalborg, the implementation of an adaptive traffic signal control system led to an 8.5% decrease in travel time. But in Bologna, the combination of Intelligent Transport Systems with traffic regulations led to a much greater reduction of absolute traffic by 23–32%, and a much higher reduction of particle emissions by 47% (Egeler & Dell, 2013). In the field of sustainable development, widespread concern has been expressed on the inefficiency of the global response to urban sustainability challenges, which is not yet sufficiently transformative. The general vision is that grand challenges should be addressed more quickly, and smart city developments are evidently not contributing enough (United Nations, 2019). Referring to smart city impact, R. Bell wrote recently “Sorry Smart Cities – You Completely Missed the Point: We get a 5% increase in efficiency, a 10% reduction in costs, a 30% drop in time wasted looking for a parking spot. Wow. We do also sometimes save lives thanks to more efficient policing, firefighting and emergency response. So, aside from saving those lives, what difference have smart cities made to their citizens?”(Bell, 2020). These two weaknesses can be disastrous for the smart city as a holistic model of urban development and planning. They are due to bad design of smart environments, lack of cross-sector platforms, low integration between the physical, institutional, and digital dimensions of smart cities. It is a fact that in many cases smart city projects are reduced to digitalization, creation of e-services, and digital infrastructures poorly connected to the institutional and physical environment of cities. In such cases, the ‘city’ dimension is lost, together with the novelties and externalities it brings. These weaknesses indicate also the need for more flexible smart systems and more complex architectures connecting the urban, innovation, and digital components of smart cities. Behind the ‘silos’ and ‘effectiveness’ weaknesses are deeper knowledge gaps about more universal and high-impact smart city systems and spaces. We still know very little: How to create generic solutions and architectures of smart environments that overcome compartmentation and silos and can be used across city ecosystems, e.g., variations of the same smart system to be used in transport, energy and waste, and other utilities. How to integrate different forms of intelligence that are present in smart cities, such as human intelligence based on the skills of the city’s population, collective intelligence and rule-based decision-making in communities and institutions, and machine intelligence embedded in the digital space of cities. How do city activities change when performed in smart environments where innovation prevails on optimization and how the performance of activities in smart city spaces and ecosystems scales up. In this context, the paper aims to investigate a different path for smart city design and development, based on lessons learned from high impact smart city projects and ecosystems. Cities, and large cities, in particular, comprise hundreds of business, business, and living ecosystems, each of which is composed of different actors, activities, functions, and infrastructures. The digital transformation of cities is structured by ecosystems (Abella et al., 2015; Komninos & Tsarchopoulos, 2013; Vermesan & Friess, 2013). It evolves per city ecosystem (known also as vertical market) defined by activities, areas, and infrastructure networks. This granularity is a source of effectiveness, as solutions come nearer to the challenges and features of each ecosystem. Nevertheless, it is also a source of complexity as demands high efforts in designing and coordinating strategies and digital solutions specific for each ecosystem. It is neither functional nor effective to deploy ‘one hundred intelligent spaces’ for ‘one hundred city ecosystems’ that usually compose a city. Developing a common ontology and a prototype smart ecosystem to be used across city domains and verticals would allow overcoming the fragmentation of smart city solutions and create a digital platform to be used across different city ecosystems. This can greatly simplify the design of smart systems suitable for different city ecosystems and vertical city markets, offer advantages of interoperability, efficiency, cost, and complexity reduction, as well as management simplification. Given this aim, the paper presents our research as follows. We first outline the theoretical framework to address the problem stated, including a short reference to pillars of related literature, the research hypothesis we will assess, and the theoretical framework relevant to hypothesis verification. After that, we provide empirical evidence from case studies on high impact smart city projects dealing with safety, transportation, and energy. We highlight their main elements of operation and how high efficiency is achieved across smart city verticals. In the discussion, we reflect on the lessons learned from the case studies, describe what is verified for the hypothesis assessed, and identify commonalities, innovation functions, and associations between functions, allowing to define a common architecture for innovation and performance scale-up across smart city ecosystems. Finally, in the conclusions, we return to our main argument that high efficient smart city ecosystems replace rather than optimize existing city routines by deploying Connected Intelligence Spaces. However, this initial verification of the hypothesis assessed is based on the few cases we have examined. It needs further investigation with a larger sample of smart city projects and ecosystems. We conclude the paper by highlighting three directions for further research.",20

Due to its multidimensional nature and the existence of various approaches in different jurisdictions, there is no universally accepted definition of financial inclusion in the financial literature (Sanderson et al., 2018). However, it can be defined in simple terms as the access and use of formal financial services by households and businesses, such as opening a bank account with a registered financial institution (Sahay et al., 2015). In broader terms, financial inclusion refers to a situation in which most of the financial services reach a sufficiently large proportion of individuals and families, granting them timely and adequate access to credit and other financial products at affordable prices (Olaniyi & Adeoye, 2016). The development of the financial sector, together with financial integration and access to financial services, plays a critical role in improving people’s livelihoods, reducing poverty and boosting economic development (Chibba, 2009; Manij, 2010). A financial system capable of serving all members of a community, especially women and the poor, can provide educational and investment opportunities for every individual; it can help people receive bank loans, have insurance coverage for various types of risks and facilitate and secure payments (Avais, 2014; Mader, 2018). Well-functioning financial systems promote the establishment of new enterprises and the growth of existing companies (Demirgüç-Kunt & Levine, 2008), strengthen the economic empowerment and active participation in the financial system of youth, women and other vulnerable groups previously marginalised (Siddik, 2017; Hendriks, 2019). Various studies, such as Sarma and Pais (2011) and Ghosh (2013), show that economic growth and development can be achieved by increasing access to financial services for all individuals. Today, all the countries work on financial inclusion and setting it as a priority goal. Given the increased awareness of the contribution of financial sector development to poverty reduction and economic growth, financial inclusion has been placed high on the national agendas of many developing countries, including Asia and Africa (Demirgüç-Kunt & Klapper, 2012;  Shafi & Medabesh, 2012; Sharma & Kukreja, 2013; Park & Mercado, 2015). In the African countries, financial inclusion initiatives have received support from governments and international bodies, such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which are revisiting and reviewing their developmental policies to provide the much-needed support to accelerate the economic growth of these countries (World Bank, 2014; International Monetary Fund, 2015a). Nigeria and Zimbabwe, both signatories to the Maya Declaration,Footnote 1 launched their financial inclusion strategies in 2012 and 2016 respectively, setting 2020 as the target year (International Monetary Fund, 2015b; Abel et al., 2018; National Financial Inclusion Strategy, 2018). The African Development Bank (AfDB) launched the Africa Digital Financial Inclusion Facility (ADFI) in 2019, an innovative financing facility designed to accelerate digital financial inclusion across Africa and ensure access to the formal economy to millions of Africans. Asia has made significant progress in financial inclusion. Regional discussions of the issue have intensified, and many countries have incorporated financial inclusion in their strategies to achieve inclusive growth (Loukoianova et al., 2018). Many initiatives have been taken to promote financial inclusion in Asia over the last years. However, it remains a key challenge in the region. The significant differences across Asian countries, not only at the level of GDP per capita and population size but also at the cultural, ethnic, linguistic and religious levels, makes it difficult to bridge the gaps between rich and poor, men and women, rural and urban populations (Le et al., 2019a, b). More than one billion people within developing Asia have no access to formal financial services, such as bank accounts (only 27% of adults have an account in a formal financial institution). Despite the efforts made, large gaps in financial inclusion remain across and within countries. Probably due to the wrong strategies to promote faster inclusion, or due to their poor implementation, most African and Asian countries have very high exclusion rates when compared with other countries (Le et al., 2019a, b; Abubakar et al., 2020). Nigeria, for example, is one of the developing nations which report a dismal position of 68% exclusion rate even after 4 years of the implementation of its strategy for financial inclusion of 2012. Today, given the increasing use of advanced technology in financial systems, one can form a clear view of the changes in the situations among the world’s least developed countries. This paper aims to measure the degree of financial inclusion in the least developed countries in Asia and Africa by looking at factors such as ownership of a bank account in an official financial institution, use of bank credit and savings. The paper also examines whether gender influences financial inclusion and considers factors such as credit and savings in informal financial networks.Footnote 2 The rest of this study is organised as follows. “Literature Review” reviews the related literature on financial inclusion. “Methodology” describes data, model and methodology. “Results” presents and discusses the empirical results. “Conclusions” concludes the study.",12

Undoubtedly, the biggest turning point and fundamental change that has taken place in recent years is the movement towards purely digital banks. These banks have the advantage of the flexibility and the ability to offer innovative services at lower and cheaper rates than traditional banks. Identified key skills such as artificial intelligence (AI), nanotechnology, robotics, the internet of things, augmented reality, digitization, and the main fields of digital learning, mobile technologies, tablets and smartphone applications (Sousa & Rocha, 2019), new phenomena big data, cloud computing, mobile, and social media are changing rapidly (Komulainen et al., 2018). This digital development leads to a data revolution and a permanent change in customer needs that leads to a change in the entire economy and society (Diamandis, 2015; Raskino & Waller, 2016). Technological revolutions cause structural change and associated long-run fluctuations of production (Epicoco, 2020). Digital technologies are being used as a new channel for information, simplification, and development of new relationships with partners and providing a new interface between sellers and buyers (Li, 2018). It will also increase user experience and generate new revenue streams (Svahn et al., 2017). Increasing digital innovations in financial services is a major threat to traditional business models of banks. Since banking and financial services have been digitized more than other industries in the world, they are the first to deal with issues (Komulainen et al., 2018). Nowadays, successful banks need a unique value rule to make digital technologies so difficult for competitors to replicate (Ross et al., 2017; Rabie et al., 2016). The purpose of digital transformation is to focus on technology, business model, and process to create new value for customers, employees, and the other dimensions of the organization. Conquering the value of digital transformation is important in the most industries and is vital in some cases for survival. The greatest digital value may be beyond customer performance (Olanrewaju & Willmott, 2013). As a result, planning has become an undeniable necessity for banks to identify the key success factors of an organization by providing the appropriate solutions to get rid of confusion and to grow its business. Digital innovation and its widespread systematic effects are often referred to a disruption and may shake the core of any industry (Bonnet et al., 2018). Banks have created value through a combination of different businesses, including finance, investments, and transactions for customers who have higher financial needs for their customers along long paths (Dietz et al., 2016). The banking sector is often regarded as one of the information technology (IT) priorities in connecting its services and customers (Chemingui & Ben lallouna, 2013). Digital banking service providers have created new services for many years (Nejad, 2016). The key interest was to implement common solutions, technology, and standards for integrating business processes within a large supply chain (Korpela et al., 2017). The process of increasing the integration not only requires the new digital connections but also it depends on redesigning the enterprise processes (Mocker et al., 2015). Sharing the opportunities presented by digitization is one of the main challenges and priorities of contemporary banks. However, changing business processes and the use of new digital technologies are the complex issues that affect all parts of the organization (Hess et al., 2016) and are weak in both theory and practice (Parviainen et al., 2017; Loonam et al., 2018). In addition to understanding how to manage the digital changes of organizations (Liu et al., 2011), identifying the organizational aspects involved in these changes (Hess et al., 2016) is particularly important. Scientific research on organizational digital transformation has remained in the early stages (Parviainen et al., 2017; Loonam et al., 2018; Holotiuk & Beimborn, 2017). The digital revolution in the field of financial services is ongoing (Skan et al., 2015), but its impact on current banking players is not defined (Komulainen et al., 2018). Strategic approaches and measures for the realization of digital transformation require more scientific research (Parviainen et al., 2017; Holotiuk & Beimborn, 2017; Sia et al., 2016). The purpose of this study is to identify the trends that influence the future of banking and to determine that how digital transformation works in Bank Maskan of Iran to respond to disruption and how to proceed through these steps. This identification enables us to take advantage of opportunities arising from the development and promotion of technology and the changes resulting from their development in line with the strategies and priorities of banks. The digital transformation of banks is especially important given the new technologies and new models of the banking business. To achieve these goals in the first part of the research, it outlines the dimensions, benefits, and requirements of banks for their digital development and avoids significant gaps in smart economic development. In the second part, to clarify the concepts used in the research, we present the theoretical background of the research. The third part is devoted to explaining the research method. In “The Process of Digital Bank Transformation,” we discuss the processes of implementing digital banking transformation. At first, the business models are described in the digital age; then, the bank’s ICT vision, goals, and mission statement are discussed. The bank’s position in the current market is determined, and the bank’s digital strategies are described by drawing a matrix analysis of the banks’ capabilities gap using a four-step model. Finally, the results of the researches and studies are summarized.",16

Evidence from the European Union Framework Programmes,June 2022,Erkan Erdil,İbrahim Semih Akçomak,Umut Yılmaz Çetinkaya,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Knowledge diffusion is a central element of innovation (e.g. Bottazzi & Peri, 2003; Tödtling & Trippl, 2005; Asheim et al., 2011; Fitjar & Rodriguez-Pose, 2013; Balland et al., 2017). The European Research Area (ERA), conceptualized in the Lisbon Summit of March 2000, is the basic backbone of the knowledge generation and diffusion strategy of the European Union (EU). The basic aim of ERA is to combine European scientific and technological resources more effectively. This attempt of amalgamation produces considerable results for productive knowledge flows to increase the competitiveness of ERA. Though started earlier, the framework programme (FP) is the key policy tool to fulfil this aim. This paper aims at analysing international collaborations in research activities in Europe using FP data to see how the landscape of knowledge production and diffusion has changed in the past 20 years and further investigate to what extent collaborations in research induced knowledge convergence. Given the importance of collaboration in the EU 2020 Strategy, investigating the patterns of collaboration and the knowledge flows between the nodes of the wider EU network is integral for building economic, social, and political strategies according to the recent ERA progress report (EC, 2017). The next round of FP, Horizon Europe 2021–2027, will operate with a budget of about €100 billion most of which will be directed to collaborative research and innovation actions organized under missions (Mazzucato, 2018a, b). Thus, it is vital to assess whether massive funding available through the FPs has reached its ultimate aim of reducing disparities in knowledge production and diffusion in Europe. Funding is an input measure, yet the resulting structure and evolution of networks fuelled by this funding can be treated as both throughput (process) and output indicators. Therefore, this study provides evidence in this direction and gives input for further studies. We depart from the literature in two aspects. First, we aim to look at scientific knowledge diffusion in the past 20 years by using network analysis and econometrics. Using data on international collaborations in research projects under FPs, we aim to shed light on whether the core-periphery structure in knowledge production in Europe still holds and whether there are emerging knowledge hubs. We build on the literature on collaboration-induced knowledge diffusion and its impact on outcome variables (e.g. Wuchty et al., 2007; Bergman & Maier, 2009; Hoekman et al., 2013; Wanzenbock et al., 2014; Hazir et al., 2016; De Noni et al., 2018; van der Wouden & Rigby, 2019) but more specifically extend Balland et al. (2019). Using network analysis to investigate cross-country research networks in Europe and data from FP6 to H2020, they show that peripheral countries have become more integrated to the core. Our data coverage is more extensive, and the unit of analysis is regions rather than countries. The network analysis compares 8 consecutive rounds of FPs from 1984 to 2016. The regressions are based on a somewhat shorter period of about 20 years from 1998 to 2016 due to difficulty in obtaining regional data for earlier years. Second, the analysis is framed in the conceptual discussion of “knowledge convergence” which we aim to build in this paper. We define knowledge convergence as the growth and intensification of commonly shared knowledge that is brought by all the collaborating partners. How innovation systems converge to each other through interactive learning and the role of research networks in this process are the central motivations that drive this research. Thus, the concept of knowledge convergence is also related to the wider literature on cohesion policy that aims to reduce economic and social disparities among the EU regions (e.g. Medeiros, 2017; Fratesi & Wishlade, 2017; Percoco, 2017). The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section is devoted to the theoretical discussion on why knowledge and its flows matter for economic growth and development and try to conceptualize knowledge convergence within this framework. “Data and Methodology” describes the data and methodology. “Results” focuses on the analysis of the FP data seeking evidence for knowledge convergence. “Discussion” further discusses the results. The policy implications of the analyses are put forward in the concluding section.",4

Given that large companies are leading, why does it sometimes make sense for two factories in different countries to be held as joint ventures?Footnote 1 What approach at firm level can bring to research relating to host country policies vis-à-vis foreign MNCs?Footnote 2 How does the assembly of such disparate business cultures as the Japanese and that of a southern European country work in practice? In what regard does Fujitsu Ltd.’s behaviour in Spain confirms or modifies the trend followed by the multinational in foreign subsidiaries? Which are the determinants of location of the overseas R&D activity of multinational enterprisesFootnote 3 and the phases in the evolution of R&D affiliate capacityFootnote 4? In what sense does the pattern of allocating R&D to the Spanish subsidiary anticipate the future response to the challenge of formulating technological strategies and managing increasingly diffuse and diverse networks of laboratories and R&D alliances in the context of disparate national institutions?Footnote 5 The literature on FDI, as opposed to “portfolio investments” in securities, and multinational companies or leviathans went up dramatically since the post-World War II period.Footnote 6 Nonetheless, many scholars dissatisfied with the achievements admit the consensus restricted to recognition of the growing importance of FDI and increasing number of multinationals, which cannot be ignored. As they point out, cumulative knowledge about FDI and MNCs is still inadequate, and generalised conclusions that can be defended as long lasting and accurate come up against the heterogeneity of corporations and country.Footnote 7 Quite a number who recognise the importance of FDI and MNCs in the world economy insist on gaps in research on the subject and point to the factors that determine FDI patterns as one of the most significant general questions.Footnote 8 Others wonder about the consequences of the different political institutions on FDI.Footnote 9 Traditional models consider investment growth as a function of changes in capital stock and depreciation, in turn dependent on several variables, as the cost of capital and output. For some scholars, uncertainty about future economic conditions and expected profits play a key role in driving investment, while financing conditions remain an important determinant. On the one hand, the accelerator model depicts investment as a function of output growth. In the neoclassical model, it depends in a positive way on production but in a negative manner on the cost of capital for the user. Financial environment, barriers to investment linked to institutional, labour and business environment are other variables considered.Footnote 10 The most recent literature acknowledges the imperfections of goods and factor markets as the main explanation for FDI while stating that a small but growing stream admits the impact of imperfections in capital markets as plausible.Footnote 11 In such a context, an important feature of the debate focuses on multinational company-host country relations and more particularly on the bilateral strategic position of MNC-host country relations.Footnote 12 Some experts question the long-term effectiveness of the incentives that countries use to attract projects and increase their attractiveness.Footnote 13 If we look at a fraction of FDI, that of Japanese multinationals in Europe, the traditional stream raises three main issues: the choice of place given the asymmetry of the EU economy, the decision on the method of investment and the way Japanese MNCs approach their ventures from a pan-European perspective.Footnote 14 Bearing this in mind, this article aims to provide materials to fill these gaps tying in with a chapter of the history of Japanese firms in Europe, engaged mainly under the form of subsidiaries and considered by some as defensive in front of protectionism and by others as creative.Footnote 15 More in detail, it provides some background information about a fraction of the global FDI towards the end of the twentieth century—the Japanese FDI in Spain—and the reasons for the implantation of the Japanese highly competitive ICT (Information and Communication Technologies)Footnote 16 multinationals in that southern European country with a profile similar to Ireland as a destination of FDI.Footnote 17 Yet on occasion, Spain is excluded from the observations on the FDI, possibly due to its late integration into the European Community, but this precise circumstance adds elements to the interest of being studied.Footnote 18 It is worth noting that the Spanish economy was undergoing a strong internationalisation in which the multinationals present in the country played an important role. This meant a deep change since not only did new multinationals appear but those already established changed the competitive mode searching an increasing integration with their group and reducing the level of localization.Footnote 19 The article addresses through a qualitative approach a specific empirical case on the creation and evolution of the company Fujitsu España in its various denominations as a strategic equity alliance.Footnote 20 The research methodology combines qualitative and quantitative sources of diverse origin—business, institutions—and character. Some of them are extraordinarily relevant because of their rarity, quality and difficulty of access for scholars. Among them stand out those coming from the monopolist operator Telefónica, during the study period called National Telephone Company of Spain (in Spanish, Compañía Telefónica Nacional de España, CTNE), founded in 1924 by the giant USA company IT&T and rescued by the national capital early in the post-WWII period under Franco’s sanguinary dictatorship.Footnote 21 The text is structured in five main sections, which outline the general framework of Japanese foreign investment in Europe and address the circumstances of the creation of Fujitsu España, a deepening of relationships between FDI and multinationals into Spain and the restructuring of this company in its organisational, labour and corporate issues. A short paragraph discussing the findings brings the text to a close.",

Matevosyan,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Various degrees of health inequalities across the world make the external validity one of the unattainable qualities of public health metrics. Quantifying healthcare index as an aggregate measure is a challenge owing to multiplex constraints in sampling anchor points, covalent ties, assiduous pairing of attributes to precisely enumerate or denumerate the enigmatic ratio. Trends to composite measures of population health—including preventable and non-preventable outbreaks, service coverage, health systems operability—produce a palette of itemizations (indices, ratios) such as Life Expectancy at Birth (WHO, 2015), Health Worker Density (WHO, 2015), Jail Health (CDC, 2019), Binge Drinking Rate (CDC, 2019), Opioid Overdose Mortality Rate (CDC, 2019), Teen Driver Safety (CDC, 2019), Hepatitis-B Surface Antigen Prevalence (WHO, 2015), Health Regulations Core Capacity Index (WHO, 2015), Under-5 Mortality Rate (UNDP, 2013), Disability-Adjusted Life Year [DALY] (Grosse, 2009), Disability-Adjusted Life Expectancy [DALE] (WHO, 2009), Health and Activity Limitation Index [HALex] (American Thoracic Society, 2009), Healthy Life Years (EuroStat, 2019), Health-Related Quality-of-Life 14 Items [HRQOL-14] (CDC, 2019), and others.  The argument is that the above listed indices are limited by: Lack of internal validity. The underlying data are not confounder-free, which makes the exposed clusters incomparable. For example, “Prevalence of Anemia in Children” (WHO 2015) does not reflect the anemia types. Microcytic anemia (MCV < 80fL) could manifest from sideroblastic anemia, thalassemia, or lead poisoning. Subtypes of normocytic anemia (MCV, 80-100fL) include hemolytic-intrinsic anemia (G6PD deficiency, hereditary spherocytosis, pyruvate kinase deficiency, sickle-cell anemia), hemolytic-extrinsic anemia (autimmonue hemolitic, microangiopathic, macroangiopathic), and non-hemolytic anemia (acute hemorrhage, iron deficiency, myelodysplasia, pure red cell aplasia, infection, or chemotherapy-induced marrow failure). Macrocytic anemia (MCV > 100fL) can be megaloblastic (copper or folate or cobalamin deficiency, orotic aciduria, or induced by allopurinol) and non-megaloblastic (Diamond-Blackfan anemia, alcoholism, or liver disorder-induced anemia). Lack of predictive value. Population-health metrics mostly relate to prevalence data where independent, dependent, and process variables (cause, effect, mediator) are acting together in the same cross section without temporal orders between the events. For example, in HRQOL-14 inventory, depression can both be cause and outcome of obesity: high prolactin and dyslipidemia are side effects of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (Raeder et al., 2006); alternatively, increased prolactin in obesity (Kopelman, 2000) and shifted prolactin/dopamine skew are paramount to depression (Gomes, 2015). At the cognitive level too, obesity may cause low self-valuation (Luck-Sikorski et al., 2018) which may exacerbate depression. Absence of causality measures. Moderator variables—either qualitative (binominal, categorical, observational, sensual) or quantitative (lab counts, age, duration, income, weight)— impact the direction and strength of relationships between independent (manipulator) and dependent (criterion) variables. While moderators specify when particular events will occur, mediators speak to why and how such effects occur. The cross-section prevalence data do not address inverse causality and therefore, cannot predict. Furthermore, not all case–control or incidence studies use direct causality measures. A study of Finnish Medical Birth Register targeted placental abruption (22.3%) and thromboembolism (24.0%) in association to maternal deaths occurred over 30 years. Direct maternal mortality ratio from the above two conditions was 6.8 times higher than general maternal mortality ratio (Tikkanen et al., 2010). Absence of duration caps. The above listed indices do not explain duration of the underlying problem. Unlike the prevalence data, incidence is a longitudinal measure showing the number of new cases (diseases) in a population over specific period. Prevalence equals to incidence ratio multiplied by duration of the event (P = I x D). For example, incidence of hay fever is high during the pollen season, but prevalence is low because the seasonal allergy fades faster. Muscular dystrophy has low incidence but high prevalence because it is for lifetime. Vague prognostic value. Prognosis is about the likelihood of an adverse outcome—regardless the therapy; prediction is about the outcome after a therapeutic intervention. These indices are not prognostic. Cancer survival rates do not separate medically intervened cases from untreated cases and do not show absolute risk reduction (ARR). Typically, survival rates are given in percentages. For instance, average 5-year survival rates for invasive breast and bladder cancers are 90% and 78%, respectively, and average 10-year survival rates for breast and bladder cancers are 83% and 70%, correspondingly (ASCO 2015, 2019). Further, the 15-year survival rate is 62% for breast cancer and 75% for bladder cancer. Inevitably, the onset-prognosis is harsher in bladder cancer (78/100, compared to 90/100 at the 5th year). However, the skew of progression or prognosis is greater in breast cancer patients because breast cancer is diagnosed earlier (due to the more available funding) but the treatment is less effective than that in bladder cancer. This also explains why the average detection age of early-stage breast cancer is 55 years, contrasted to the average of 73 years at the onset of bladder cancer diagnosis (ASCO 2015, 2019). Prognosis is the opposite to incidence rate. Would we know the point-prevalence (not period-prevalence) at the cross-section of 5 or 10 or 15 years, prognosis could be made based on the inversed “duration of events” equation: P = D × 1/I or P = D/I (where D is the disease duration and I is the incidence of disease in the assessed period).  Cancer survival indices, however, are not inclusive for such relationships. Lack of sensitivity. Sensitivity is the probability that a positive test or diagnosis is confirmed. Gross prevalence equals to (Tp + Fn)/(Tp + Tn + Fp + Fn) were Tp corresponds to the true-positive results, Tn to true-negative, Fp to false-positive, and Fn to false-negative. Sensitivity is measured by Sn = (Tp + Fn) where Tp is the total number of persons with disease (true-positive results) and Fn stands for false-negative results. Thus, sensitivity rules out the disease. The above listed indices are insensitive to false-negative results. Lack of specificity. Specificity is the probability that a test is negative or a diagnosis is denied. It is measured by Sp = (Tn + Fp) where Tn is the total number of persons without disease (true-negative results) and Fp stands for false positive results. Accordingly, specificity rules-in the disease. Indices discussed above are unspecific for false-positive results. Lack of external validity. Generalization index is the extent to which a study's results can be used across situations, populations, seasons, or healthcare limits. Population indices mostly rely on prevalence or incidence rates which vary per country or population. For example, Chagas disease has a higher prevalence in South America than it does in North America. Discrepancies between countries can be explained by the level of implications of the patient-privacy laws, demographics, migration rates, barriers to research, or data integrity.   (g) Being accurant but not au courant. Used by the lawmakers or law-interpreters, public health indices often do not reflect the progress in clinical standards or protocols. For instance, the landmark abortion law Roe v. Wade (410 U.S. 113, 1973) relies on trimester framework. Yet, the definition of a “trimester” remains vague for those who are familiar that in 1995 the WHO updated the fetal viability threshold from 28 gestation weeks (with 1007-g and 35–38-cm tall fetus) to 22 gestation weeks (with 430–500-g and 28–30-cm tall fetus). Another example: Before 2013, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM1-DSM5) had separate itemizations for dissociative identity disorder (DID), a condition for what the general practitioners had no code. Regardless, over the past century, the US courts issued acquittals in 14.3% cases of not-guilty-by-reason-of-insanity (NGRI) or guilty except mentally ill (GEMI) defenses involving persons with the DID (Matevosyan, 2014). Part of our health is our knowledge about it. Introducing algorithms of quadruple and quintuple helices, Carayannis et al. suggest that positive change in environment (the medium of population health) is based on knowledge management or knowledge economy (Carayannis & Campbell, 2010). This concept is partly supported by studies (Häkkinen & Oksman-Caldentey, 2006) evincing that socio-economic variables (income, education, occupation, family size) have smaller direct impact on health than the lifestyle and knowledge management.",

To model means to develop a model as a representative of a system, and it has sense only if the produced model and its dynamics sufficiently correspond to the original system. For simple models that are represented in mathematical formula, languages may be analysed by analytical tools. However, for most systems such a model would be too abstract for wording the relevant aspects in structure and dynamics. There is a variety of different modelling paradigms with advantages and constraints, adopted for different types of systems or modelling objectives. A basic distinction can be made between macro and micro models. A macro model describes the original system in terms of variables whose values are used to express particular states of the modelled system. The complete model describes the original system as one entity. The used representation language often is the language of mathematics: differential equations or difference equations. A micro model on the other hand represents different components, entities or units separately. The overall system status and dynamics is produced by the entities. (Benso et al., 2014). For a long time, the scientific method has been based on the consideration that natural phenomena are linear and understanding them is possible only by decomposing them into simple processes that can be dealt with by deterministic theories. The reductionist approach of linear systems has been challenged by the discovery of complex system theories focused on “interaction among parts of the systems and not so much on the characteristics of the parts themselves”. In this framework, the behaviour of the single parts does not explain the behaviour of the whole. These theories change (Kirby, 2007) also the way to consider and analyse economic systems. In this view, economic agents are the elementary component unit of a system capable of yielding a given response for a given solicitation, which the agents’ local interactions arises in different configurations. Few of these interactions can be forecasted when there are a limited set of interactions that each agent can perform. In most cases, however, when we have larger numbers of agents acting and interacting in different ways, we see complex and new emergent behaviours from these interactions of aggregate agents that produce significantly greater results than we would wait. These aggregate agents group together with other aggregate agents, creating increasingly larger CAS (complex adaptive systems) with more full sets of emergent behaviours and interactions. Economic agents cannot achieve perfect knowledge of the global effects of their actions; they are not able to analyse costs and benefits of knowledge. A complex system is constituted at a lower level by various and numerous elements whose interactions are governed by specific rules of interaction. Thus, the dynamics of a system is simply the sequence of the results of interactions. The states on which the rules act must be formed as relatively stable ones, but they also have inner degrees of freedom allowing them to undergo a transition only when dynamical conditions are met. In fact, the dynamics of a social system consists of the succession of the system’s states in time generated by the different rules of interaction. Therefore, looking for local interactions and their specific rules, we can detect the formation of rules at a higher level in order to learn the dynamics of system global behaviour resulting from the local interactions. Revealing the mechanisms underlying system behaviour is usually a long and difficult endeavour.Footnote 1 Almost all studies about complex systems using an approach based on constructivismFootnote 2 have shown how complex behaviours emerge from simple rules, but very few studies have been carried out considering rule formation from dynamic behaviours. Some authors (Barzel et al., 2016; Wanga Lai & Grebogie, 2016) have considered the application of a bottom-up approach to complex systems. Using the bottom-up method (Buraschi et al., 2013), macro-behaviours are explained as “emergent” by the interactions among lower-level elements; in order to explain observed processes, the specific data and facts are the starting point for formulating a model. Reverse engineering (RE) characterized by a bottom-up approach is a useful methodology with which to analyse this kind of dynamical system behaviour. “Reverse engineering is a process where an engineered artefact (such as a car, a jet engine, or a software program) is deconstructed in a way that reveals its innermost details, such as its design and architecture. This is similar to scientific research that studies natural phenomena, with the difference that no one commonly refers to scientific research as reverse engineering, simply because no one knows for sure whether or not nature was ever engineered” (Eldad, 2005). There are many differences between RE applied to artificial (engineering) and natural and human systems (biology and economics). The RE of products can therefore be very successful by decomposing the system into a system-subsystem-component hierarchy with well-defined interactions between elements on different levels, and with well-defined functions of each of the elements with respect to the whole system. In manmade machines, parts, chosen to have efficient functions, are combined to work as designed so that no serious emergent phenomena rise (Davis & Alken, 2000). The definition of rules for these complex systems from the individual behaviour of agents is called reverse socio-engineering where some artificial models built in biology have been applied, taking into account the difference between biological and human systems (Dautenhahn, 2000). The idea of redesigning using a reverse engineering framework to study a complex economic system has existed for over 10 years. From existing protocols and tools designed on the basis of RE, for example, the utility functions of agents are determined implicitly and can be extracted through reverse engineering. Other papers consider various control tools as distributed algorithms for solving system utility maximization problems. Based on the knowledge gained from reverse engineering, our research idea is to improve the knowledge and analysis of complex economic systems and by proposing an advanced framework of reverse engineering tools and methodologies. Inspired in fact by recent reverse engineering research, this work extends both to the study of the control of chaotic systems based on a reverse engineering framework, which acts as a tool to bridge the gap between applications and existing theoretical results on the optimization of chaos control: both to study the agent-based model (ABM) based on a micro-foundation macroeconomic approach. Our research questions are as follows: could RE process help us to extract information from systems behaviour, to build models to simulate real economic systems, and to constitute valid tools in taking decisions on the basis of built models? Since the system is analysed to identify its components and their interrelationships, so as to create a representation of the system, could the internal mechanisms of a system, program or data structures be modified without changing its functionality? Could we recapture the top-level specification by analysing the product in order to recover all aspects of the original specification purely by studying the product or data? The paper is structured as follows: in “Introduction”, we explain the aim of the paper to consider the reverse engineering approach for economics on the basis of features of economic complex systems. In “The Reverse Engineering Approach to Discover the Dynamics of Economic Complex Systems”, we propose an example of models for complex system dynamics by developing a method of RE to regain a class of complex system; in “Reverse Engineering Framework for Controlling Chaos: the Recurrence Analysis”, we stress the inadequacy of the top-down and bottom-up approach and we suggest a new approach, chaotic itinerancy (Kaneko & Tsuda, 1994), for integrating them. For applying a RE approach to economics, we propose two kinds of tools: one is recurrence analysis for its ability to work with few data and to detect chaos and CI (Itoh & Kimoto, 1997); in “Reverse Engineering of Multi-Agent System: ABM Simulation”, we propose the agent-based model founded on the double auction in the micro-foundation macroeconomic approach. In the final section are some conclusive considerations. In the following, we will discuss and compare agent-based simulations to other modelling and simulation techniques. Such a comparison is important as a means of argumentation for adopting an agent-based approach but also for identifying where nothing is gained by using agent-based simulation.",1

In most countries, these goals are part of the political agenda and educational plan. Although women’s empowerment and gender equality have also been included in the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) (Ogato, 2013), unfortunately, gender inequality is present in almost every country in the world. The relationship between economic growth and gender is frequently examined and discussed in economic and political circles; participants in various scientific and economic events, seminars and meetings acknowledge that women’s empowerment is an essential economic and political issue. For instance, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund reported that gender equality is vital for economic development (IMF, 2018; World Bank, 2014). The World Bank also acknowledges that gender inequality can be an obstacle to development goals. For this reason, the relationship between economic growth and gender inequality has become a popular research topic among academics. For example, Kabeer (2015) conducted a critical survey on the relationship between gender inequality and economic growth along several dimensions using a macroeconomic perspective. Kabeer presents one of the most important empirical literature pieces and shows that gender inequality is an obstacle to economic development. The results concur with other scholars such as Cole et al. (2015) and Verloo (2006). There are advantages to employing a panel vector autoregression (VAR) analysis, which covers multiple observational components for multiple periods, such as the data available for the cross-section and time series, particularly when the time length is almost small. Also, panel VAR analysis should help discern any effects of gender equality on economic growth (Majumder, 2020). The core gain from using a composite variable’s creation is to adopt a comparatively comprehensive explanation of women’s participation index (GEM). In 2010, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) created a gender inequality index and introduced it widely, using the variables mentioned earlier and the updated data. We used the Gender Inequality Index of UNDP to measure gender inequality, which provides a homogeneous index for the studied countries in Asia and Africa. To calculate this index, UNDP included the appropriate weight for each country. Endogenous methods have also been used for each country to prepare an annual time series index (UNDP, 2016). This study investigated the relationship between gender inequality and economic growth using the Gender Inequality Index for a sample of 34 Asian and African countriesFootnote 1 during the period 2010 to 2018. The data and variables used in the Gender Inequality Index indicate a significant positive impact on economic growth and development. However, some old studies show that gender inequality in education may lead to economic growth (Seguino, 2000), while new studies indicate a significant and negative impact of gender inequality on economic growth. The indicators and variables used in the Gender Inequality Index have direct or indirect effects on economic growth and have been discussed in scientific circles and academic research (Falk & Hermle, 2018; Karoui & Feki, 2018; Khalid et al., 2018; Klasen, 2000; Kleven & Landais, 2017; Onaran, et al. 2016). Results of the previous studies examined a combination of education, technology impact and investment rates variables. They showed, via a panel regression analysis, how could increasing mentioned factors could lead to economic development. Economists have examined the determinants of economic growth by including different factors such as investment rates, education, human capital and numerous suggestions that economists are interested in the impact of gender inequality on economic growth. Researchers in scientific circles and international conferences on gender inequality in these countries justify studying developing and least developed countries in Asia and Africa. Thus, this study could be considered by scientific and academic circles according to the selected countries and results.",8

Both neoclassical (Solow, 1956) and endogenous (Romer, 1986, 1990 ; & Lucas, 1988) growth models have demonstrated that even small variations in growth across countries can entail significant differences in incomes over the long run. One of the core implications of the Solow model is that in a cross-section of countries, per-worker output will converge towards long-run equilibrium (steady state), while the endogenous growth models did not have such implication. With this background, empirical tests of convergence occupied a central place in the debate on cross-country growth (Islam, 2003). The convergence debate is closely associated with the quest of whether there is a general tendency of catch-up between poor and rich countries. Economic growth literature highlighted that technological spill overs (Gerschenkron, 1962), capital mobility (Lucas, 1990) and diminishing returns to reproducible capital provide poor countries with an impetus to catch-up with the rich countries in the transitional period towards common steady-state equilibrium. The literature provides several tests of convergenceFootnote 1 such as β-convergence and σ-convergence. Within the neoclassical framework, β-convergenceFootnote 2 examines the cross-section association between growth rates over the sample period and initial levels of output per worker (Barro, 1991; Barro & Sala-i-Martin, 1992; Baumol, 1986; De Long, 1988; Dowrick & Nguyen, 1989; Mankiw et al., 1992). A simple way of investigating β-convergence is to construct a scatter-plot of growth rates for the cross-section of countries against the initial levels of per-worker output. Thereafter, if the slope of the fitted line is negative, it supports the existence of β-convergence (Barro & Sala-i-Martin, 1990). On the other hand, σ-convergence examines the time trend in cross-sectional dispersion of per-capita output distribution. A declining time trend of the difference in cross-sectional output implies the existence of σ-convergence. According to Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2003), β-convergence tends to generate σ-convergence, but this tendency is disturbed by global shocks that are likely to increase dispersion across the countries. Accordingly, β-convergence is necessary but not sufficient condition for σ-convergence. A more formal test of convergence is cross-country growth regressions (as shown in “Model Specification”). This framework is explicitly neoclassical and represents the starting point for most empirical work on economic growth. However, these cross-sectional testing approaches have been criticised. Through a study on interpreting tests of the convergence hypothesis, for example, Bernard and Durlauf (1996), it was asserted that cross-section tests over-reject the null hypothesis of no convergence, even conditioning for different steady states across individual countries. In line with Quah (1993), Barro and Sala-i-Martin (2003) concluded that cross-section tests provide evidence of conditional convergence even when cross-country income distributions remain unchanged. Similarly, Evans and Karras (1996) asserted that cross-section approach produces valid inferences under highly restrictive assumptions of homogeneous first-order autoregressive representation of dynamic structures across individual countries (\({\beta }_{i}=\beta , \forall i\) in Eq. 1, Model Specification); symmetrical cross-country spill overs and the given vector of regressors explain all the permanent differences in cross-section output levels. Quah (1993) therefore advocated exploiting the time-series properties of the cross-country dispersion of per-worker output levels. The literature witnessed two new approaches in the form of panel and time series methods to overcome the limitationsFootnote 3 associated with cross-country regression tests of convergence. Islam (1995) extended the cross-section convergence tests into panel framework that corrects for the omitted variable bias problem by introducing country fixed effects to capture latent technological heterogeneity across countries. Time series researchers, including Carlino and Mills (1993); Bernard and Durlauf (1995); Evans (1996) and Evans and Karras (1996), have concentrated on convergence testing using time series econometric methods. In practice, time series approach tests for the presence of unit root on output deviation series such as \(Dy_{it}=y_{it}-\overline{y_{it}}\), where \({y}_{it}\) is the per-capita output level of country i, and \(\overline{y_{it}}\) is the sample average for the region as a whole.Footnote 4 Evans and Karras (1996) pooled the deviation data for testing the coefficient on the first-order autoregressive structure of \(D{y}_{it}\) using various variants of conventional Dickey-Fuller equations. However, limitations of these regression-based convergence tests are that they fail to account for any cross-country dependencies or interactions (De Long & Summers, 1991). Comin and Hobijn (2010) through a study on the exploration of technology diffusion emphasised that cross-country technology adaptation has intensified through the channels of human capital, openness and trade, quality of institutions and relative levels of economic development. Furthermore, individual countries are assumed as neoclassical economies with homogeneous technologies in these convergence tests. The present research investigates the existence of conditional convergence in per-worker output among MENA countries. It also analyses the dynamic impact of various factors such as physical capital, human capital and total factor productivity (TFP) on per-worker output. Towards this end, the heterogeneous panel ARDL technique is utilised. The econometric approach controls for cointegration, nonstationarity, heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence in variables and residuals. Thus, this paper represents a clear contribution in terms of the methods used for investigating convergence process. Proper use of panel data with careful attention on cross-sectional correlation, dynamic effects and heterogeneity can contribute significantly to our understanding of the convergence process across the MENA region. To the best of the authors knowledge, no study has used dynamic panel techniques that perform all the necessary steps for a thorough econometric analysis, such as testing for cointegration, addressing nonstationarity and cross-sectional dependence. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The next section provides a brief review of the past research on growth performance and convergence hypothesis of the MENA countries. In “Data Description”, we discuss the data series. The fourth section presents the methodology of convergence and panel ARDL approach. “Empirical Results and Analysis” presents empirical testing of the convergence hypothesis and discusses the results. The last section concludes the findings and provides policy recommendations.",2

It is evident that during the 1990s, the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region encountered a historic problem. The governmental, intellectual, and political leadership of the LAC region came to realize at the end of the 1980s that introduction of fundamental changes in these countries’ economies was required (UNDP, 1998). Due to frequent international crises and macroeconomic mismanagement, many countries in LAC were undergoing stern economic decline at the beginning of the new millennium. For instance, in the case of the Tequila crisis, market-oriented reforms were called into question, and people from politicians to researchers suggested a considerable adjustment of economic policy other than the “Washington Consensus” (Loayza et al., 2003). Thus, the main focus of this article is to evaluate the linkage between institutional factors and economic growth of 14 countries from LAC. Historically speaking, traditional economists have considered the influence of physical and human capital formation, technological invention, the process of knowledge formation and transmission, and global economic integration on economic growth (Dellepiane-Avellaneda, 2010; Helpman, 2004). Nonetheless, experts have also come to acknowledge that governance, institutions, and politics are sine-quo-non to economic growth and development as they influence the incentives to accrue, innovate, and trigger change (Dellepiane-Avellaneda, 2010; Eregha, 2014; Kaufmann & Kraay, 2003). The significance of improved level of economic growth for economic, social, and political development is crystal clear. Those nations which are capable of continuous growth and which can sustain economic growth and development are also capable of several beneficial factors like drastically diminishing poverty levels, supporting political and democratic stability, enhancing the quality of their environment and ecosystem, fostering the living standards of their citizens, and reducing the frequency of violence and crimes (Loayza et al., 2003). Moreover, the role of institutions in promoting growth is critical for all economies in general and developing countries in specific where such institutions are often nascent and development problems are relatively discouraging (Fosu, 2013). As stated above, the aim of this article is to examine the correlation between governance indicatorsFootnote 1 (corruption, political stability, and Govt. effectiveness) and economic growth for 14 countries from LAC. This study used a panel data set covering the period 2002Q1 to 2018Q4. Empirical research studies on the subject are scarce with the exception of the work by Kaufmann and Kraay (2003) who used data from 175 countries in 2000 to 2001 and employed ordinary least squares (OLS) method for empirical investigation. In this study, our set of countries includes “low income, lower middle, and upper middle income” countries from LAC regionFootnote 2. It is assumed that all these countries have almost similar characteristics. This study is different from the erstwhile studies in three folds: (i) it focuses on 14 countries from LAC region, largest number of countries so far, (ii) the data covers relatively for a long period time, and finally (iii) it employs relatively holistic panel data and empirical techniques for estimation purpose. Therefore, the outcomes of this study will not only contribute to the literature on LAC region but can also be extended globally with the objective to understand the significance of governance for economic development. The role of good governance in enhancing the level of economic growth and development is widely accepted. First, let us shed some light on the variances in the meaning of government and governance. Conventionally, the term ‘governance’ is viewed as identical to government (Jabeen, 2007). The study of Jabeen (2007) further maintains that government is a group of individuals that runs the entire administration of a country. However, the term governance refers to new practices, methods, or modes of governing a society. In a study, Keefer (2009) opines that there is no consensus regarding the definition of “governance”. Kaufmann and Kraay (2008) expound that the concept of governance is very old and can be traced back to at least 400 BCE. The World Bank (WB) (1992, p.1) believes that “governance is the manner in which power is exercised in the management of a country’s economic and social resources for development” whereas the word governance signifies for the OECD “the use of political authority and exercise of control in a society in relation to the management of its resources for social and economic development”. While the UNDP (1997, pp. 2–3) describes governance as “the exercise of economic, political and administrative authority to manage a country’s affair at all levels. It comprises mechanisms, processes and institutions, through which citizens and groups articulate their interests, exercise their legal rights, meet their obligations and mediate their differences”. In a similar manner, Kaufmann et al. (1999, p. 1) and Kaufmann and Kraay (2008, p.4) explain the term governance as “the traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is exercised. This includes the process by which governments are selected, monitored and replaced; the capacity of the government to effectively formulate and implement sound policies; and the respect of citizens and the state for the institutions that govern economic and social interactions among them”. Jabeen (2007) cites that good governance according to the Human Development Reports means good humane governance, which stimulates human development. In the broad sense, all these definitions reveal that governance refers to the way in which the power is used in the administration and managing of state’s economic and societal resources for the national economic development (Manasan et al., 1999). In terms of enhanced level of economic development, good governance is desirable because in good governance, the individual assumed to be sound in terms of living standard and consequently many of less-developed economies would be much better off. Where public life were administered and managed within fair and impartial institutions, accountable, judicious, and transparent, the World Bank is also of the view that the attractive characteristics of good governance include accountability and transparency, effectiveness in how the public sector works, rule of law, and systematic connections in politics. Now, it is obvious from the definitions and understanding of good governance that bad governance is the opposite of it. Grindle (2010) shows that good governance is an encouraging feature of political systems, while crummy governance is a problem and weakness that countries shall to overcome. The UN Secretary–General asserts that good governance is “ensuring respect for human rights and the rule of law; strengthening democracy; promoting transparency and capacity in public administration.” (Dellepiane-Avellaneda, 2010; Weiss, 2000). Similarly, the other important elements of good governance are political and bureaucratic accountability, efficient public institutions, nonexistence of corruption, economic management, and social advancement (Huther & Shah, 1998; Manasan et al., 1999). Furthermore, alongside, due to the pursuance of these principles into practice, the fair free and regular elections need to be held and an independent judiciary needs to be established to translate those laws factually. The utmost threats to good governance can occur from corruption, violence, poverty, factors which weaken fundamental freedoms, participation security, and transparency. It is believed that democracies have not usually the most effective governments, because even effective governments have been observed in non-democratic states. It is also noted by Levi (2006) that some economically established and enduring democracies find it difficult to maintain and sustain effective governments. Good governance is mandatory for continued upsurges in living standards (Kaufmann et al., 1999; Knack, 2003). Apparently, a general harmony has been found among various investigators and policy-makers that governance does matter and undeniably good governance is vital for encouragement of progress and poverty alleviation (Hussain, 2004; Shepherd, 2000). This study understands governance as the manner in which power is executed in the administration and how the country’s scarce resources are managed for national economic development. Therefore, to our understanding, good governance means how such practices are exercised by the government in order to assure maximal social welfare. It is, however, also argued that corrupt bureaucrats and politicians in badly governed countries cause sluggishness in all kinds of development efforts by pocketing the financial aid and contributions by misallocating them into inefficient activities. Moreover, there are incompetent bureaucracies and weak institutions that are reluctant or incapable of devising and implementing pro-growth and pro-poor policies. The former United Nation Secretary–General Kofi Annan disclosed that “good governance is perhaps the single most important factor in eradicating poverty and promoting development” (see UN, 1998; Resnick & Birner, 2005; Gisselquist, 2012). The crucial influence of the quality of governance on economic growth is open to discussion (Kurtz & Schrank, 2007; Gisselquist, 2012). It is also revealed by Hyman (2012) that democracy can perform a better role in stimulating sustainable development. Conceivably, various principles, such as accountable government, free and fair elections, free media, as well as other fundamental democratic principles, are all crucial components of an environment favorable to economic growth and development. Bhupatiraju and Verspagen (2013) note that the preeminence of institutions as an element of economic expansion and advancement is not a new theory. Corruption is a broad term and a multifaceted phenomenon which exists in every country and it is one of the indicators of weak governance. The nature, magnitude, degree, and the effect of corruption vary prominently across the world. The WB (1997) describes word corruption as “the abuse of public office for private gain”. Corruption happens where public representatives are directly engaged to use state services for their own benefits (Rose-Ackerman, 1997). In a study, Shepherd (1998) indicates that developing and transition economies record more corruption compared with OECD countries. Corruption in Latin American economies has typically been higher in East Asian countries in comparison with other developing and transitional countries. Several Latin American countries are suffering from higher level of corruption. Corruption is detrimental to economic growth and development because it weakens the rule of law, spoils resources, dampens investment, and increases the cost of doing business. Usually, corruption levies substantial costs on countries and ordinary people, but unluckily, the encumbrance of corruption on the poor is relatively high. The study of Shepherd (1998) concludes that mitigating the destructive effect of corruption on LAC’s society is a big challenge, and the one which is difficult to resolve in a short period. Furthermore, the study adds that progress is going on to mitigate corruption, where not only economic and political changes that governments have been commencing in Latin America, but also the civil society and the WB are making efforts to mitigate endemic corruption in these countries. In a similar study, Alesina (1998) has also shown that in Argentina, the extremely sluggish growth during 1960–1990 was mainly due to bad governance. Weak institutional quality, replicated in corruption, poor standards of bureaucratic efficiency, and the rule of law property rights protection were the fundamental variables determining the county’s poor growth. The study of Vargas-Hernandez (2003) reveals a similar situation in Latin America where the low level of governance has its backgrounds in limitations of economic, social, cultural, and educational policies which occurred in spite of the preceding strong presence of the authoritarian state and its governing institutions. In the case of Mexico, studies have highlighted problems like official and private corruption, the corruption and incompetence of judicial organs, the domination of drug cartels, and insufficiencies in interior security in the form of guerilla groups functioning in rural neighborhoods and vehemence in the large cities (Glen & Sumlinski, 1998; Vargas-Hernandez, 2003). Parker et al. (2004) reveal corruption in Latin America as widely prevalent; however, its frequency differs from one country to another country, ranging from “normal” to “widespread” to “systemic”. In the case when it is normal, it may be fairly easy to detect the problem and control it, while on the other hand, if it is widespread and becomes systemic, it is difficult to prevent and control it and it can be vastly detrimental to the stability of democratic institutions, harmful to the rule of law, and destructive to economic growth. The study further enumerates factors in Latin America that have caused corruption including low levels of accountability, transparency and efficiency, inconvenient legislation, and legal confusion. In addition, institutions have remained weak as there is an absence of effective judicial system, weak social controls, lack of political will, and mixed attitudes about corruption. According to Seligson (2006, p. 381), “Widespread corruption is increasingly seen as one of the most significant threats to deepening democratization in Latin America (and indeed much of the democratizing Third World)”. The study of Penailillo (2012) highlights that in Latin America, various factors such as crime, terrorism, drug trade, and government weakness are obstructions to economic and political growth. Along with the general aspects, corruption is one of the more visible factors, which create environments and inducements for the diversion and misuse of power in the many of economies in the region. According to the World Bank (2013) report, Kim  says that corruption is a ‘public enemy number one’ in less-developed countries. Kim further explains the destructive effects of corruption as “Every dollar that a corrupt official or a corrupt business person puts in their pocket is a dollar stolen from a pregnant woman who needs health care; or from a girl or a boy who deserves an education; or from communities that need water, roads, and schools. Every dollar is critical if we are to reach our goals to end extreme poverty by 2030 and to boost shared prosperity”. The geographical area of LAC is equivalent to Oceania and Europe combined and there are almost thirty-two countries, while the total population is estimated almost 600 million. Poverty figures in LAC shown by the UN Economic Commission for LAC (ECLAC) (2012) are 29.4% of the inhabitants were poor and 11.5% were needy or extremely poor in 2011 (United Nations, 2013). The World Bank Institute’s Good Governance Index (WB, 2009) documented that Ecuador, Argentina, Dominican Rep., Bolivia, Honduras, Peru, and Guatemala exhibit an indicator of government effectiveness under 50%, whereas, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Paraguay indicate an index below 20% and Haiti below 2.8%. The data statistics demonstrates that the rule of law index in Peru, Paraguay, Nicaragua, Mexico, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica, El Salvador, Dominican Rep.,, and Argentina that fall under 50%, and Venezuela, Guatemala, Ecuador Honduras, Haiti, and Bolivia reveal indexes below 20%. While just six countries in LAC indicate rule of law indexes of above 50% namely Puerto Rico, Chile, Brazil, Uruguay, Panama, and Costa Rica. It has been observed that insecurity due to crime and violence also severely exists in the region. The LAC is the second highest vehement region globally with high rates of relational violence and crime (Penailillo, 2012). The WB (2011) has also shown that both crime and violence are crucial problems in the development of Central American economies. The crime rate in three countries Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador are among the top five in Latin America though it is considerably lower at other places. It is upsurge and causing heightened concern in three other countries of the region—Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and Panama. In a study, Vargas-Hernandez (2003) has shown that during the last decades of the 20th century, it has been perceived that in Latin American countries, the institutions of governance are influenced by minute macroeconomic successes and sluggish economic expansion, and the development of an exceptionally instable democracy. ECLAC (2018) reports that the year 2019 seems to be a year in which world economic uncertainties, far from waning, will deepen and will rise from different faces. Indeed, it would have unfavorable effect on overall economy performance of LAC, whereas less dynamic growth is anticipated, both for advanced and emerging economies, along with more volatility of international financial markets. The economic growth rate is expected for LAC in 2019 to be 1.7%, marginally below what ECLAC projected last October (1.8%). The study is structured as follows: “Literature Review” deals with the existing
literature. “Data,
Model Specification, and Estimation Techniques” outlines the data description, model specification, and
empirical methodology. “Regression Results and Interpretation” explains the empirical results. “Concluding Remarks” concludes the study with important findings.",16

Knowledge and its rapid change has also become a key driver of competitiveness (Parcero & Ryan, 2017). Expatriate is one of the potential external sources for companies to improve knowledge and to increase technological capability for creating innovation (Chang et al., 2012) through expatriation (Downes & Thomas, 2000). This can be enabled through knowledge transfer (KT). KT is one of the sources of innovation (Alexander & Childe, 2013; Weidenfeld et al., 2010) through collaboration in value co-creation (Ramaswamy, 2009). Literature indicates that KT is a phenomenon contributing to organizational outcomes that involve both internal and external resources in developed and developing countries (Cassiman & Veugelers, 2006) in (Zulkifli et al., 2019) The expected role of expatriation is to ensure that expatriate is able to implement and to attain global business strategies, including the transfer of knowledge, coordination and control of foreign operations/units, and human resources development (Kühlmann & Hutchings, 2010). Nature of expatriation can be described from its purpose, activities during the process, actors, outcomes, and contextual factors. Considering dynamic change in every country, these elements may experience changes that bring several challenges for the expatriation. The challenges come from several limiting conditions faced by firms employing expatriates, mostly driven by dynamic business environment. Developing countries, of which the industrial structures are usually dominated by companies with low technological capabilities, have limited sources of knowledge due to the investment capability (Figueiredo, 2010). Whereas, the dynamic capabilities framework suggests that firms running in the atmosphere of rapid technological change require particular foundations and means for wealth creation. The dynamic capabilities framework analyzes the sources and methods of wealth creation by firms operating in rapid technological change environment. (Teece et al., 1997). (Lim & Lee, 2001) suggest that latecomers companies need to catch up on their technology backwardness, one of which is conducted through KT. However, KT itself is a complex process with several obstacles, which limiting the ideal conditions for KT through expatriates. Due to its unique social characteristics and nature of expatriation, each country may have different conditions. Therefore, there is no generic KT strategy for all countries. Indonesia, as a developing country, has a relatively small number of expatriates, but it tends to increase overtime (Fig. 1). Companies that employ the expatriates are not only MNCs, but also local ones. During this Covid-19 pandemic, the number of applications of expatriates is predicted to decrease. However, the utilization of expatriate is still supported by the Indonesian government. This can be seen from the issuance of related policies, such as -the most recent - the Omnibus Law. In fact, the KT process has not been running easily and smoothly, especially in local companies, due to four limiting conditions: a) Limited number of expatriates in specific competence. Thus, local firms experience difficulty in finding expatriates who match their needs. It has changed the nature of the recruitment and selection (RandS). Even when the firms are able to identify the ideal expatriate, they cannot afford to pay the salary. Therefore, the expatriation process is usually accelerated to minimize the financial resources used and allocate it for the salary payment. The local firms usually strive to find another potential benefit that can be gained from the expatriates. This also influences the assignment stage of expatriation which greatly needs an innovative strategy so the local firms will be able to absorb the important knowledge from the expatriate. b) Limited resources of the company. In regard to their rare expertise, expatriate usually has high salary standard than local employee, which is less affordable by Indonesian companies. As a consequence, firms need to reallocate their budget so they are able to pay the expatriates, i.e. through cost reduction. The limited resources also become the reason to lower the firm’s expectation on the expatriate. This influences the nature of RandS as a part of expatriation process. Generally, expatriate’s RandS implements coffee-machine theory (Harris & Brewster, 1999). At present, especially for Indonesian local companies, this theory seems to be less suitable since it needs more aspects to be considered and complex decision-making process. c) Complex expatriation process. Indonesian local companies generally apply a fairly rigorous selection process for expatriate candidates. This usually differs based on number of the expatriates and purpose of employment. This encourages the firms to modify some expatriation so it can be more effective and efficient. The modification varies towards the way how the expatriate will be assigned in a firm through single and multiple stage of expatriation which have different complexity (Prihadyanti, 2019). d) Government policy. In Indonesia, government regulation for expatriate in private sectors usually has great effect on expatriation process. This occurs in the form of quota restrictions and administrative requirements. The quota restrictions greatly affect the expatriation when the expatriates come in groups. In this case, when one of the expatriates failed to arrive, the overall activities will be affected, which will bring delays or even stop the project. This influences the RandS stages and also the next stages of expatriation. Meanwhile, there is also bureaucracy problem due to inflexible administrative requirements. This gives effect when an expatriate cancel out his/her arrival due to several reasons. In this case, a firm cannot easily replace the expatriate with other ones with similar competences, but the firm must repeat the process from the beginning. This usually impact on late arrival of expatriate. Even more, the process takes several months to be completed, even when an expatriate will only come for several days. This usually brings loss for the firms. These obstacles stimulate firms to give response and proactive action during the process. These show that government policy affects expatriation process and takes part in changing the nature of the process. Based on the explanation, in Indonesia, the limiting conditions affect the expatriation and change its nature in terms of purpose, process, actors, and contextual factors. In regard with the KT purpose, this also brings consequences to the strategy. Different conditions lead to different KT strategy that should be applied by firms that employ expatriates. This strategy must have concerns on several aspects from the source and recipient of knowledge that should be controlled by the company as much as possible. The strategy should be intended to obtain successful KT, especially in conditions that do not allow optimal result. This paper proposes a new concept namely Knowledge Transfer Readiness (KTR) which embraces dimensions and elements needed to be prepared to be able to conduct successful KT-which is further named as KTR-in several limiting conditions. In addition, this paper describes and analyzes why these dimensions and elements are important to achieve successful KT and builds understanding under what conditions the company-in this case is the local companies in Indonesia-needs to optimize the readiness of knowledge source and/or receiver when the company faces various limitations, that at the same time forms the changing nature of expatriation to generate innovation through KT from expatriate to local employee. Literature discussing this topic is still rarely found. Therefore, this paper contributes to theory in area of expatriation in regard with KT which then can fill knowledge gap related to KT and expatriation in developing countries, or any other countries in which companies experience the same conditions and/or problems. Different from other concepts of readiness in regard with knowledge, for example knowledge management readiness (KMR) (Sultan & Bach, 2015), change readiness in knowledge sharing (Valmohammadi & Amidi, 2020), or knowledge transfer plan (Zulkifli et al., 2019), this concept focuses more on how to prepare for successful KT in a holistic manner considering the involvement of expatriate and local employee. Applying the KTR to analyze the condition of six case studies in Indonesian local firms, this concept can help to understand the importance of each elements of readiness as part of KT mechanism that can lead to either successful or failed KT. The results of this study also have practical contribution in drawing up the KT plan as part of KT's strategy including RandS of expatriate, especially when there are limitations that complicate the formation of prerequisite conditions for conducting KT.

13.0,2.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,26 March 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00776-z,"Transforming Cameroon into Knowledge-Based Economy (KBE): The Role of Education, Especially Higher Education",June 2022,Asan Vernyuy Wirba,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Transforming Cameroon into the knowledge-based economy (KBE) is vital for economic development and growth as well as achieving its vision 2035 as an emerging economy. To transform Cameroon into KBE, current economic development paradigm must change and the role of the government must also change to a mobilizer and manager of national resources and at the same time have a creative spirit and leadership that will allow it to make drastic changes in the fields of law, regulation, and policy making. The required change to affect a move toward KBE in Cameroon today is due to the fact that the problems in Cameroon today are truly deep rooted and needed a new. The unity of Cameroon today is questioned, the economy is in crisis, and the government seems not to have every answer to the Cameroonian problems, such as violation of human right of its citizens, and many are calling for a sincere dialogue to end the endless crisis engulfing Cameroon. The same questions and problems we are facing in Cameroon today have similarities with many countries around the world. The Korean in the nineties had similar problems but decided to look at their problems anew and from a critical perspective. Their decision was to move their country toward KBE and government reforms with sound Master Plan strategy for KBE. Most of Cameroonian problems today are economical and bad governance the same was for Korea in the nineties. Therefore, Cameroon as a nation can learn from Korea development paradigm shift toward KBE and other nations that had transformed into KBE. Today, the economic development and growth in Cameroon come from natural resources, such as oil, gold, and physical assets such as land, steel, and iron etc. Let us learn from Korean example which is tried and tested master plan toward KBE which is knowledge revolution, see Woo (2000) on the road to KBE the case of Korea. The government and the people of Cameroon need knowledge revolution not cosmetic changes here and there as the situation today. Radical changes are needed in Cameroon and should be spearheaded by the president of the republic lead by the finance minister supported by all Cameroonian all think tank in the country to come up with a new strategic economic development Master Plan aiming toward KBE which will allow Cameroon to attain its vision 2035. The reason for such a move is due the current situation of the economic development which is not driven by KBE is a concern. KBE has become a yardstick to assess any national economic development and growth including Cameroon. Therefore, Cameroon as a nation cannot continue to live in the past in the twenty-first century, while other nations are developing their economy using the right tools for economic development. A study conducted by Woo (2000) on the road to KBE the case of Korea highlighted the Korean National Economic Advisory Council (NEAC) long-term vision and a 3-year master plan for KBE development using five goals: (i) making Korea one of the top ten information and intelligence superpowers in the world; (ii) building the Internet and information superhighway of the next generation by 2005; (iii) encouraging the use of computers by students, teachers, and the military; (iv) undertaking drastic education reforms to arm the country for its push to become a KBE, and envisioning the creation of an Internet culture in which individuals can engage phase of governance by ICT, in a human rights-based democracy; and (v) closing efficient welfare and sustainable regional growth divide development. The same could be said for Cameroon if it really wants to transform into KBE as did the Koreans. Cameroon cannot and should not depend on natural resources alone to achieve its vision 2035; education reforms are also key. In many developed economies, knowledge is seen as a strategic plan for economic development; therefore, it should be the case for a country like Cameroon which needs to join a club of nations transforming into KBE. KBE is replacing the old traditional economy which concentrated on natural resources. Apart from Cameroon moving toward KBE, it is vital for Cameroon to maintain and consolidate democracy, good governance, and enhance national unity which is lacking this days. The civil war in Southern Cameroon or in the two Anglophones regions is threatening Cameroon national unity spearheaded by the separatist movement in the two Anglophone regions—North West and South West (NOSO). Cameroon has always been an ethnic and linguistic mosaic with other divergent factors such as religion, politics, and culture and has been called “Africa in miniature” due to its diversity which should be preserved and maintained. Education in Cameroon can play a critical role in the areas of national integration, peace, justice, social cohesion, and democratization. However, the two systems should be minted as they are now based on colonial heritage or be harmonized which had failed due the divided on colonial heritage or else each heritage go their separate identity as a choice for citizens or parent to choose which side to educate it children. The World Bank has urged countries to use education as a means of fostering development. In other words, countries like Cameroon should embrace knowledge and innovation-based development and most importantly KBE. Some developing countries in Africa are less receptive to the idea of using education to enhance national unity due to party-politics. Party politics in some African countries hinder education reforms or any reform initiatives in general either in health, social, or economic. A study conducted by Appiah and Abdulai (2017) in Ghana shows that political settlement in Ghana or “competitive clientelism” restricts success in improving the effectiveness of public institutions, due to the danger of losing power by excluding competitor, in which reform initiatives is driven by the logic of the maintenance of ruling governments in power rather than enhancing the effectiveness of state institutions. Such results undermine reform efforts, ranging from needless and costly institutional duplications to the politicization of the bureaucracy through patronage-based appointments. Any public/civil servant not aligned with the government is perceived to be associated with previous regimes. In the case of Cameroon, opposition political party leaders are put under house arrest jailed for demonstration as they view the ruling party reforms as being cosmetic or ineffective only to maintain themselves in power. The Ghana’s finding is evidence across many Africa countries as Cameroon is not an exception. Reform initiatives in Cameroon are viewed to be benefitting the ruling party and its elite, which is threatening the unity of Cameroon today. Bad governance and over centralization of power in Yaoundé Cameroon have lead to the civil war within the two Anglophone regions as noted earlier and have direct effect on the economic, culture, political, social, and educational. In reviewing the literature for this paper, a study conducted by Asongu (2017a) on KBE shows that parallel to other communities of the world, Africa is not progressing in its ambition toward KBE which is a concern that sparked my interest in examining Cameroon position toward transforming into KBE. The real problems of Cameroon today are political and economic; hence, my interest in examining Cameroon position toward KBE as a solution to its present situation if there is will from the government and its people. No study has been done in Cameroon particularly to examine whether Cameroon as a nation is transforming or transitioning toward KBE, and the role of higher education. Thus, the aim of this paper is to examine whether Cameroon as a nation is transforming or transitioning toward KBE and the role played by higher education (HE). HEs in Cameroon can be great centers for lifelong learning backed by various government regulations, such as giving them autonomy to make universities based on education management and reduction of many social course that do not train Cameroonian to solve its problems. For country whether develop or developing country, knowledge is the main catalyst for economic development. Knowledge and innovation are key to development, but Cameroon and some developing countries are lagging behind in transforming or transitioning into KBE as a means of wealth development. Hence, KBE has been identified by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in 1996 and the World Bank as being the most essential element for the economic development of nations. The case of Korea and many countries in Europe, Latin America, and Asia countries that is transforming toward KBE is real and vital. Tchamyou (2017) conducted a study on KBE and argues that North America, Europe, and Japan have been able to master KBE and are now the leading countries in determining the economic development of many nations internationally and that countries in Asia and Latin American have been catching up except African countries of Cameroon are one. On the other hand, Asongu (2017b) attests to the fact that knowledge economy is an economy in which economic prosperity largely depends on the accessibility, quality, and quantity of information available, instead of the means of production. Thus, the significance of this paper is to shed light on whether Cameroon as a nation is moving toward KBE and the role played by higher education through the lens of KEI (1995–2020). In other words, this paper uses the four pillars KEI, KI (1995–2020) to analyze the situation of Cameroon to ascertain whether Cameroon is transforming or transitioning into KBE. These four pillars are shown in Fig. 1, education, innovation, information, and communication technology (ICT), and also the prerequisite economic and institutional regime of KBE (see Table 1). Cameroon KEI rank in Africa Knowledge is the most vital and significant instrument in transforming any given nation into greatness. No nation on Earth has ever developed without quality education and innovation. In this respect, knowledge plays a key role, especially in higher education (HE). Education is vital for human, social, and economic development in the world. Knowledge from education and the skills acquired through education contribute to the economic growth and development of many countries. A country like Cameroon is not immune from such an experience. Knowledge base economy is now the source of economic development and growth. Gone are those days that natural resources were the essence of economic development and growth. Some scholars of KBE attest to the fact that education and training are the best strategies used by governments toward KBE in the twenty-first century (Finegold, 2006, 1999). He emphasized that education has become a silver bullet that policymakers use to become competitive and innovative. What is KBE? And how does it differ from the traditional economy? Cooke and Leydesdorf (2006), in examining the KBE, acknowledge that KBE focuses on the creation and managing knowledge as a vital source of growth, not as natural resources. For them, brainpower is the key to economic development. Cameroon is a country gifted with abundant natural resources such as oil, gold, bauxite, timber, and other renewable energy sources. Such abundant natural resources require good leaders, a transparent government, and the rule of law to manage. However, Cameroon and many developing countries in Africa have a lesser emphasis on a knowledge-based economy, good governance, accountability, and knowledge to manage their God-given resources. To this effect, the World Bank Institute’s Knowledge for Development Program (K4D) (2008) also argues that many developing countries are failing to tap into and apply the vast stock of global expertise to their needs. Developing countries need a new critical growth instrument, building information revolution to their strengths and carefully planning adequate investments in human resources and successful institutions, related communication technology, and creative and competitive businesses. Developing countries like Cameroon can learn from such countries as Finland, Korea, Ireland, Malaysia, Singapore, Chile, and India that have used the four pillars of the KEI framework to transit into a KBE as shown in Fig. 1. Natural resources are not enough or sufficient for economic development. Hence, for a country like Cameroon to be transformed into KBE, there is a need to enhance its education especially higher education, at the same time improve good governance and national unity. Resources without good governance and education are a waste of resources. To this effect, Lester Throw as cited in Wirba (2017) argued very strongly that “Natural resources have dropped out of the contentious equation. The lack of natural resources may even be an advantage because the industries we are competing for, the industries of the future, are all based on brainpower.” Brainpower is key to economic growth and development. Natural resources are still important but not the only ingredients in the economic development and growth of any given country. The reason why brainpower is key to economic development is that KE is in abundance and not in scarcity as in the traditional economy. Resources are no longer diminishing because knowledge and information do not decrease; instead, they are shared; while it is in their application, they can be learned and used as needed. Knowledge can be shared, and it reduces location and time problems envisaged in the traditional economy as many things are becoming virtual and therefore need global regulation and cooperation. In a traditional economy, capital is described mainly in monetary terms while KE views it in terms of intangibles capital, which requires competent staff and their knowledge to develop and use it. The intangible assets of KE are knowledge and information management which are the core of competencies. The brainpower or the cognitive domain is ideal and is worth billions. Therefore, KBE is key to economic development and growth, replacing labor and capital as traditional production factors. Intellectual property is the basis for knowledge. It is vital that Cameroon as a nation embrace KBE and the country should move toward a new spirit of entrepreneurship, good governance, and good citizenship capable of modernizing its economy and transforming its KBE for all to benefit not just a few elites at the top as is the situation today. Some scholars like Suciu (2004) and Gertler and Wolfe (2004) acknowledge that the essence of KE lies in managing time and detachments: information and knowledge. For Brinkely and Niel (2006), KE “is what you get” when businesses bring powerful computers and well-trained minds together to build wealth, as ICT and educated employees may acquire such wealth. KBE is defined by the Organization for International Cooperation and Development (OECD, 1999) as the “creation, dissemination, and use of technology and knowledge as the keys to economic activity and sustainable growth.” Cameroon can learn from countries within OECD and other developed countries that have been able to transform into a KBE. In other words, they can learn from other nations that have implemented KBE as a means for economic development and growth. The results of this paper are therefore expected to allow policymakers at all levels in Cameroon to look at the findings and lessons to be learned, for both public and private sectors and the civil society. Cameroon historically was colonized by the German (1884–1916) and later become French and British mandated territory (1916–1960/1961). Cornet, the bordering country with cardinal points, e.g., Cameroon, is a country in Africa surrounded by Nigeria, Chad, the Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea. There are ten provinces in Cameroon (North-West, Adamawa, Central, East, Far North, South West, West, North, and Littoral province) with the capital Yaoundé Wirba (2017). Cameroon is a nation created by the British and French colonial roots. It becomes a bilingual nation and reunited in 1961 to form the Federal Republic of Cameroon, at the same time promising to retain their separate educational systems based on colonial heritage. In Cameroon today, these two mechanisms co-exist but failed to be harmonize. Each side wants to preserve its heritage of colonial education. The lack of harmonization of the two systems affects education system in Cameroon, whereby the former British colonial heritage feels marginalized by the majority French colonial heritage. The feeling of being marginalized by the two Anglophones regions in Cameroon has led to a civil war and is a concern. The ongoing clashes between the army and the Ambazonian forces who are demanding cessation from La Republic du Cameroon are a grave concern. The clashes between these two forces have destroyed or hindered education in the two Anglophones regions. Education or schooling in the two Anglophones regions is in disarray and requires political dialogue to put an end to the civil war. Even though there has been a national dialogue of some sort and the extraordinary Parliament to grant special status to the two regions peace is still far away. The best resolution is for the two factions to sit-down and dialogue to give peace a chance. Amnesty and freeing of all imprison as a result of the civil war will put an end to this dirty conflict. The Anglophones elites are clamoring for a Special Status offered in the parliament, but there is doubt whether a special status is a lasting solution. Federalism and confederation are solution but the government is far from finding a lasting solution. Again, the main problem here is bad governance and economic and requires a new economic development paradigm known as KBE which is a knowledge revolution giving every Cameroonian a stake in the national cake. See Woo in the case of Korea and come up with a new way of thinking and governing people. The present regime should avoid a situation of having solution for every Cameroonian and listen to the people. The most important thing for many Cameroonians today is a peaceful resolution to the meaningless civil war. Students and children of these two regions are not going to school due to insecurity. According to the Education Fact Sheet on Cameroon, education in the North West and South West region (English Speaking) has worsened since November 2016 due to political crises, civil unrest, or civil war. Many Anglophones students from the two regions have sighted academic refuge in Cameroon cities that are stable, cities like Yaoundé, Douala, Bafousam, Ngaoundere, to mention a few. Any country that allows itself to have conflict deprived its citizens of the right to education and is the situation in the two Anglophones regions of Cameroon. In a war situation, schools are burnt down or destroyed and, the economics of war take over. Students who are not allowed to go to school are made vulnerable to both sides of the warring factions. Some are displaced internally in towns and cities, whereby there are no guarantees of these children going back to school. As an educator, seeing and watching how people on both sides of the conflict play politics with the future generations of Cameroonians is disturbing. The Government in Yaoundé should listen to the international community, the initiative by the Pop to a lasting peace and its citizens who are yearning for peace to return to North West and South West (NOSO). The Cameroon government should make peace and ensure that children in both Anglophones zones have access to education since some have stayed put during this dirty civil war which could have been avoided by measures address in this paper, bad governance, over centralization of power in Yaoundé, and the feeling of Anglophones to be marginalized; all theses causes are political, economic, and cultural due to colonial heritage (direct rule by the British and the Jacobin system copied from the French centralization of authority). In many cases, marginalization is due to the share of the national cake which is economical, as such the government should provide practical job training for the unemployed Cameroonian in both NOSO and Cameroon at large. Furthermore, the government role should be that of creating enabling environment that promote the creation and diffusion of knowledge among Cameroonian of all divide. The Cameroon government should start peace-building mechanisms to ensure no lost generation in both the South West and North West province (Southern) Cameroon. Bringing back education into the two regions will benefit all, because education promotes peace, stability, and unity. Children going back to school will signal normality, and the willing by the government to settle these problems. This war has lasted 5 years, but only cosmetic solutions provided by the government as argue by many Cameroonians of good will in the two divide. No one wins in civil wars but only the mortuaries. The government of Cameroon should know by now whether they want to be by the side of the people. The education of the two Anglophones regions matters, for education or knowledge, is a strategic resource for any given nation, and by moving Cameroon toward KBE, most of these problems would be solve; therefore, the Cameroon government should learn from the Korean road toward KBE. Failure to learn and adapt from a tested master plan and failure to solve the civil crisis in NOSO will create a big vacuum for the generation of children from these two regions and Cameroon at large. The education system in Cameroon is composed of Anglophone and Francophone education. Each education system starts from pre-school, primary, post-primary, secondary, teacher training schools, and universities. Both systems share the same tertiary education. There are public and private schools within each subsystem. Private education encompasses lay and religious (Islamic, Catholic, and Protestant) education. See Table 2 below which shows the education system of Cameroon and certifications at each level of the two education systems. It starts from nursery education up to universities but does not include pre-school or Kindergarten (Nursery) is not obligatory. Kindergarten education starts with children between the age of 0 and 5 years. Officially, Kindergarten education is 2 years in public school and may last 3 years in a private school. The age of admission is 4 years old in public school and 3 years old in private school. Table 2 shows the education system of Cameroon in brief and what certification is obtained at each stage. It starts from Kindergarten education up to universities of or other institutions in Cameroon. The British or Anglophone education system is as follows: 7 years for primary school, 14 years for secondary education, 5 years for secondary (O/L), and 2 years (A/L) for higher school. The French education system or Francophone education system is as follows: 6 years for primary school and 13 years for secondary school. In can be noted in French 6 years for primary (Ecole Premiere), 4 years for general secondary education (Brevet d’etudes du premier), and 3 years for upper secondary (Brevet/College) program (Baccalaureate de l’Enseigement Secondaire). It is important to highlight the colonial history of Cameroon in years of higher education (HE) and the need for post-independence higher education in Cameroon, which was to train Cameroonian nationals to work as civil servants, and many of them were trained abroad at universities, especially in colonial capitals in Paris, London, and other developed and developing countries. That is why the education system that was created for Cameroon till today is based on colonial heritage of the divide. In other words, the two systems are a reflection of its colonial heritage (Britain and France). The imperial power had left but the legacy loom on. Thus, higher education in Cameroon is influenced by its colonial past and it is evident from the literature review of this paper and all attempt to harmonize the two system had failed. Some writers have argued that the British colonial education system for Cameroon was less centralized and more demand-driven and is a reflection on the way things are done in the two Anglophones regions, “whereby there is less centralization of authority.” The British delegated religious missions (financed through a system of grants-in-aid) with education (Garnier & Schafer, 2006). The French established a public, free, non-religious network of schools; however, the French colonial administrators were inflexible and carry instruction only in French, rather than the local languages. French colonial schools hired more European educators than British schools in Cameroon. The British missionaries’ goal in Cameroon and Africa was conversion, and they tried to reach as many children as possible; meanwhile, the French aim of colonial education was to train a small administrative elite (Garnier & Schafer, 2006). Modern Cameroon higher education (HE) started with Federal University in 1962 and professional and technological institutions were created later, followed by the creation of the University of Yaoundé in 1974. These institutions led to the present educational system in Cameroon. Professional and technical schools being selective are elites in nature, and the mass go to universities studying general studies and the majority of these students do not get employment after graduation. Most of the few professional schools are elitist in nature, which make entrance to these schools a mercy of the political elites or buying entrance to its professional institutions. The government is failing to bring necessary reforms to make higher education competitive and efficient is a concern. The two systems of education or problems do not allow for genuine reforms. The government of Cameroon should avail itself as knowledge-oriented government by implementing continues reforms in education, its management system, and organization to avoid being an impediment to progress and development of Cameroonian at large; at the same time, the government should create and implement curriculum system that value creativity either from private or public schools at all various province and made college entrance for these professional schools more flexible or create satellite campuses in each province to avoid corrupt practices at the national level. Universities in Cameroon are far behind in ranking of the top 100 universities in Africa; the only one university is in the top 100 universities in Africa ranked 78, the University Yaoundé 1; none of the universities in Cameroon are in the ranking world university ranking today and is a concern. Now that civil war is ongoing in the North West and South West provinces (NOSO), higher education institutions in Cameroon could be affected further. Hence, higher education is not cheap and will only continue to benefit a particular segment of the wealthy and privileged in the society. Higher education in Cameroon and other African countries should be improved and taken very seriously because it is a basis for national integration and genuine economic development and growth. Education should not be a privilege for the few. Higher education contributes to tax revenue, increase saving, entrepreneurship, and civil society. Education also contributes to population growth, government health, strengthen governance, and improve technology Bloom et al. (2006). India is an example of a country that has benefited from its higher education to leapfrog into the world economic stage. Other examples are Korea and Singapore. The UK and the USA and the West have been wise, and they have developed their economy based on knowledge or KBE. Knowledge is a driving force for economic development and growth. Developed West is able to use their research universities and institutions of higher learning to innovate and develop new technologies and Cameroon can learn from such paradigm shift and come up with radical reforms that are going to make their public institutions research centers and knowledge-driven academies as the case of Korea. Cloete et al. (2015) in their study argue that world-class universities and higher institutions are located in western North America Europe, and to some extent East Asia, while the rest of the world including Africa is left behind to play catch-up. The move toward KBE is the way forward, and any nation that does not follow will be left behind in this global village.",6

Leung,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The field of the knowledge economy is receiving tremendous interest. Isenberg (2010) reported that there were 40,000 articles on the knowledge and knowledge-based economies as at 2010 and there is a multiplicity of terms being used to describe similar concepts related to knowledge management (Davenport, 2005; Nonaka & Takeuchi, 1995), knowledge economy (Drucker, 1969; 1973, 1999), knowledge industry (Machlup, 1962; Machlup & Mansfield, 1970), information economy (Porat, 1977; Porat & Rubin, 1977) and network society (Castells, 1997; Van Dijk, 1999, 2006). In view of the hefty of terms used, they can collectively be labelled as the knowledge economy (KE), and their authors are avowed as the precursors of the KE. However, nearly 58 years since Machlup’s seminal work on the KE, we are now getting nearer in understanding this new kind of economy. Initially, significant doubts arise as to whether the ‘modern economies’ are, indeed, ‘knowledge economies’. More critically, the current economic meltdown and the Covid-19 pandemic of these so-called knowledge economies are testimonies of false assertion by the precursors of the field, and most recently, the current medical pandemic has cast further doubt on the sustainability that the developed economies are knowledge economy. Such inadequacy occurs in view of the fact that the field has no shortage of writers and critics that advance or reject various avenues of the knowledge economy. So, what actually is ‘knowledge economy’? The objective of this paper is to understand by questioning and reasoning by what the precursors meant by ‘knowledge economy’ and not on what they have explained in a casual manner. We also want to know whether similar terms like ‘knowledge-based economy’, ‘information economy’ or ‘knowledge society’ meant the same or different things, and even if they were used merely for semantic reasons, is there a common ground for us to specify a research agenda that enables us in the furtherance of the study of the field in a systematic manner? The objective is also to find the implications for economic management, computerization of the economy and knowledge management in the new economy. Therefore, this paper will make a contribution to the literature in the areas of the theory and management of the knowledge economy as it provides a new perspective of the issues in the emergence and operation of the knowledge economy, providing a better understanding of the computerized new economy. In doing the above, we use a methodology comprising a systematic review, content analysis and critical theory (analysis) in helping us to examine the terms and contents used to describe a knowledge economy. The next section examines what the precursors of the knowledge economy have told us. In ‘Commentary of the Precursors of the Knowledge Economy’, we critically review what the critics of the precursors have told us, and explain what is wrong with the current reality of the knowledge economy. ‘Theoretical consideration in advancing the research on the knowledge economy’ is concerned with avenues in advancing the research of the knowledge economy. ‘Conclusions and Discussion’ reports the findings of the paper and their implications and concludes our discussion of this research.",10

Research alongside the organizational psychology strand developed the bipolar schema of pull and push factors to explain entrepreneurial motivation (Gilad & Levine, 1986; Herron & Sapienza, 1992; Kuratko et al., 1997). Push theory focuses on the negative external factors (e.g. job dissatisfaction, difficulty finding employment, insufficient salary, inflexible work schedule), while the pull theory suggests that individuals are attracted into entrepreneurial activities due to mainly pecuniary and other subjective achievements/goals (i.e. wealth, independence, self-fulfilment) (Hatak et al., 2015; Keeble et al., 1992; Orhan & Scott, 2001). Entrepreneurship research has focused on the analysis of the context of entrepreneurship suggesting that factors such as job displacement, previous work experience, own resources, and governmental influences might predict entrepreneurial activity (Krueger et al., 2000). Johnson (1990) reviews the relevant literature and reports a fairly consistent relationship between achievement motivation and entrepreneurship but stresses the multi-dimensional character of entrepreneurship and the need to build theoretical models that account for the role and interplay amongst the various dimensions that are conducive to this phenomenon. Indeed, the study of entrepreneurship becomes even more complex when other interrelated parameters are brought into the analysis such as the stage of the entrepreneurial process (Estay et al., 2013; Segal et al., 2005), and the role of place (Besser & Miller, 2013; Figueroa-Armijos et al., 2012; Korsgaard et al., 2015). In their study of entrepreneurial motivation, Estay et al. (2013) identify different pathways as associated with different logics of action (e.g. innovative projects are linked to reproduction or imitation), and the different stages of business creation (e.g. development objectives and a person’s need for independence are linked with the early stages of entrepreneurial process), whereas business growth and success are based on risk and creativity, competence, and the exploitation of advantages occurring in the wider environment of operation. Segal et al. (2005) study entrepreneurial motivation using a sample of 114 undergraduate business students at Florida Gulf Coast University. They find that self-employment intentions are predicted by a person’s tolerance to risk, the perceived feasibility, and net desirability (Segal et al., 2005). Studying the effect of the economic recession in rural America, Figueroa-Armijos et al. (2012) find a shift in the motivation of individuals to become self-employed. Before the recession, opportunity-driven entrepreneurial activities were more likely to occur in rural counties, compared to urban counties, but during the economic recession, they observe a clear decline in opportunity entrepreneurship and an increase in necessity entrepreneurship. Lower incomes and part-time employment are linked with necessity entrepreneurship in all rural and mixed-rural counties, while education is linked with opportunity driven entrepreneurship (Figueroa-Armijos et al., 2012). Besser and Miller (2013) study entrepreneurial initiatives in remote rural towns and conclude that these are more likely to succeed in providing a flexible source of income, thus sustaining the survival of the family business in contrast to initiatives motivated by a desire for great wealth and the need to experience a challenge. As they argue, community bridging social capital assists in the achievement of such goals by helping rural businesses in many ways (e.g. retain and attract skilled labour, reduce costs, access to capital, resident customer loyalty) (Besser & Miller, 2013). More recently, Pato and Teixeira (2016) also suggest that more research is needed regarding both the theoretical underpinnings and the empirical manifestations of rural entrepreneurship owing to the dynamic evolvement of the social context within which entrepreneurship occurs. As Chell et al. (2008) argue, the entrepreneurial personality is the outcome of a given social construction. Similarly, Elfving et al. (2009) propose that the entrepreneurial intentions are context-driven in the sense that social norms affect people’s intentions and interact with self-efficacy and individuals’ motivations. Furthermore, Blackburn and Kovalainen (2009) suggest that we should place emphasis on the role that small businesses play in a society in order to escape normative views that tend to a priori advocate the existence, support, and development of the small business sector. This way we might actually discern a society’s ‘entrepreneurial opportunity’ as formed by the mechanisms and processes that are used for the production of new economic goods and entities (Sarasvathy et al., 2010). To the extent that opportunity entrepreneurship depends on cultural values and social institutions, we might focus on how specific institutional contexts mitigate or enhance the effects of cultural drivers of opportunity entrepreneurship (Cullen et al., 2014). The above discussion illustrates that the heterogeneity characterizing the socio-economic, physical, and political environments in which entrepreneurship occurs might be more fully understood under a comprehensive theoretical framework (Carayiannis, 2008, 2009). Here we focus on assessing the entrepreneurial potential that might be available in ruralFootnote 1 Greece by adopting an inclusive approach to identifying the determinants that are conducive to actors holding positive views towards rural entrepreneurship. This approach is based on the n-tuple helixes understanding of the knowledge-based innovation dynamics of contemporary societies (Carayannis & Campbell, 2010; Carayannis et al., 2012; Leydesdorff, 2012, 2013; Park, 2014). In particular, we adopt the Quintuple Helix model of innovation (Carayannis & Campbell, 2010; Carayannis et al., 2012) as a flexible theoretical framework within which an empirical operationalization is possible to yield informative results as to the effects that micro level characteristics and contextual factors exert on entrepreneurial views. As described by Carayannis et al. (2012: 2), ‘the Quintuple Helix represents a suitable model in theory and practice offered to society to understand the link between knowledge and innovation, in order to promote a lasting development.’ Indeed, the Quintuple Helix model allows for a holistic analysis of entrepreneurship as the outcome of forces and factors identified in five dimensions namely, the education system, the economic system, the natural environment, the media-based and culture-based public, and the political system (Carayannis et al., 2012). This perspective allows for a multi-layer approach to entrepreneurship as part of a National System of Innovation wherein individual and contextual factors interact in a dynamic manner (Acs et al., 2014; Carayannis et al., 2018). The multi-dimensional context of entrepreneurial potential is analysed here by testing for the plausible effect of a number of objective and subjective determinants. This in turn might yield informative policy insights as such a framework also allows for a distinction between the entrepreneurial constitution and entrepreneurial behaviours (Carayiannis & Stewart, 2014). Focusing on Greece is important given the special characteristics of the rural sector and its importance for the country’s overall economic activity. Available knowledge addresses a number of important issues such as agricultural modernization and the use of national and supranational (mainly EU) funds (Daskalopoulou & Petrou, 2002; Labrianidis, 2017), the socio-economic, demographic and cultural impacts of migration inflows (Kasimis et al., 2003; Labrianidis & Sykas, 2009), rural development policies, and the potential of rural areas to develop alongside sustainable rural development pathways (Koutsou et al., 2014; Petrou et al., 2007; Williams & Vorley, 2015). However, rural entrepreneurship is an ongoing challenge for Greece as a field that combines both opportunities and counterincentives. The excessive migration flows occurring during the mid-1990s and 2000s and, the financial crisis have further exacerbated the challenge to build viable rural entrepreneurial paradigms in the Greek countryside. To that extent, our findings aim to enhance our knowledge and understanding of the individuals’ views about rural entrepreneurship in Greece. In turn, these views can be thought of as a prerequisite of sustainable entrepreneurship, the latter defined as ‘the creation of viable, profitable and scalable firms that engender the formation of self-replicating and mutually enhancing innovation networks and knowledge clusters leading towards what we call robust competitiveness.’ (Carayannis, 2009 cited in Carayannis & Stewart, 2014: 6). At the empirical level, we study entrepreneurial views by means of analyzing a number of critical parameters that are identified by the vast literature on the subject and we elaborate on their interrelated effects under the multiple helixes approach (Carayannis & Campbell, 2010; Carayannis et al., 2012). The paper is organized in four sections. Following this introductory section, ‘Rural Entrepreneurship’ is devoted to a brief background discussion concerning rural entrepreneurship and the hypotheses proposed by the study. ‘Rural Entrepreneurship in Greece’ reviews the relevant literature on Greece. ‘Estimation Procedures, Data, and Variables’ is devoted to the presentation of the empirical estimation methods, and the data and variables used in the analysis. ‘Empirical Results and Discussion’ presents the empirical results and discusses their interrelation to the extant knowledge in the field. ‘Empirical Results and Discussion’ comments on the limitations of the study and presents further research issues. ‘Conclusion’ concludes the paper with a discussion of the study’s contribution and policy implications.",3

People with disabilities face a number of barriers accessing jobs, education, transportation, and health care. Barriers to access to information and communications amplify challenges facing people with disabilities and create a digital divide for these people. Countries that are lagging in establishing competitive digital economic and social ecosystems are further penalizing people with disabilities and their ability to experience higher levels of income and job opportunities (Bruyere, 2019; Ahmed-Haq, 2018; AHRC, 2020;  World Bank, 2020a; Yosef et al., 2019). The United Nations’ Disability and Development Report (2019a, b, p.21) covers two definitions of disability. The World Health Organization (WHO)’s International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) states: “Disability is defined as a limitation in a functional domain that arises from the interaction between a person’s intrinsic capacity, and environmental and personal factors.” ICF is the WHO’s system for measuring health and disability, and it is endorsed by its 191 member states. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) defines disability as: “Disability is an evolving concept and that disability results from the interaction between persons with impairments and attitudinal and environmental barriers that hinders their full and effective participation in society on an equal basis with others.” (United Nations, 2019a, b; CRPD, 2020; WHO, 2020). The lack of an inclusive and equitable economic and social environments for people with disabilities delays and jeopardizes the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Disability is included in a number of goals such as (a) “guaranteeing equal and accessible education; (b) promoting inclusive social, political, and economic growth; and (c) creating accessible cities, among other MDGs goals” (Sundar, 2018; United Nations, 2018, 2019a, b, 2020). This paper proposes an inter-disciplinary and trans-disciplinary approach to frame the nexus disability and employment. For this purpose, the Quadruple-Sextuple Helix is being introduced. Our framework builds on previously developed frameworks. The Triple Helix (TH) model of government-private sector-university introduced by Henry Etzkowitz and Loet Leydesdorff focuses on the production of knowledge and its use in these three dimensions. The Quadruple Helix introduced by Carayannis and Campbell expands the Triple Helix by adding a “media-based and a culture-based public.” Carayannis and Campbell have also introduced the Quintuple Helix connecting knowledge and innovation with the environment. These frameworks provided the impetus and background for this papers’s Quadruple-Sextuple Helix approach to assess the disability and employment nexus and its related ecosystem. (Etzkowitz & Leydesdorff, 1997, 2000; Carayannis & Campbell, 2009, 2010, 2014, 2019). The Quadruple-Sextuple Helix framework can also be perceived and utilized as a framework of analysis and assessment for a better and more comprehensive and holistic understanding of the nexus disability and employment. It is sensitive to social ecology and aware of the environmental context, leading to a broader integration of high-quality democracy and the social and economic environments. Without it, our understanding the broader implications of the disability and employment nexus is not fully developed. It also provides a top-down, a mid-level, and a bottom-up perspective. Thus, it addresses the fine-tuning of social innovations related to the disability and employment nexus. Clearly, the traditional approach to the nexus disability and employments lacks the scope and depth of analysis provided by the Quadruple-Sextuple framework proposed by this paper. Most of the traditional approach tends to focus on government-led initiatives.  Our framework also broadens the understanding and interactions within societies dealing with the implications of high-quality democracy, sustainability, and disability. It fosters and advances the concept of high-quality democracy as it embraces society and sustainability, as well as the disability dimension of both concepts. It stresses the human rights and the human development dimensions of disability as well. As stated by the United Nation’s Disability and Development Report: “Central to the definition of sustainability is the principle of equity and inclusiveness.” Thus, the Quadruple and Sextuple framework also addresses the equity and inclusiveness dimension of the disability and employment nexus from a sustainability and high-quality democracy point of view. It aims at a global and universal framework approach to the disability and employment nexus (O’Donnel, 2004; Carayannis & Campbell, 2010, 2014; United Nations, 2019a, b). The conjunction and interaction of institutional forces and players, represented by nations’ governments, academic institutions, private sector, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), represent the pillars of a nation’s disability empowerment ecosystem and its pillars of disability competitiveness. Their dynamic, continuous interaction and interdependence sets the pace and the coordination of efforts to promote the creation of jobs for people with disabilities. The quadruple helix approach proposed in this paper, when balanced, creates a self-reinforcing mechanism. A balanced and reinforcing quadruple helix is a must condition for the creation of a dynamic and creative ecosystem for the fostering and creation of jobs for people with disabilities. The sextuple helix must be present to reinforce and push the quadruple helix forward. The sextuple helix proposed in this paper includes six main factors: (a) ICT infrastructure and investments, (b) an inclusive and equitable social and economic environment, (c) an economic environment that leads to the creation of jobs for both people with and without disabilities, (d) an inclusive, equitable educational system that also fosters research and education related to people with disabilities, (e) an inclusive and equitable infrastructure that eliminates or ameliorates physical barriers for people with disabilities, and (f) an inclusive and equitable health care system that addresses the needs of a nation’s people with disabilities (Gouvea, 2012; Andreani et al., 2019; Appio et al., 2019; Baltac, 2019; Bhattacharya et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2020). The paper’s  objective is to test the feasibility of our proposed Quadruple and Sextuple Helix framework in assessing nations’ ability to foster the creation of jobs for people with disabilities. Will our framework of analysis provide a better understanding of the disparities in unemployment for people with disabilities amongst the nations surveyed in this paper? This is the main research question outlined and addressed in this paper. Traditionally, the role of the government in fostering employment for people with disabilities has been stressed. Table 1 highlights a number of nation’s laws and acts to foster employment opportunities for people with disabilities (Whitehouse et al., 2016; ILO, 2015). We collected data from different international databases to assess the degree to which our proposed framework of analysis would be able to provide insights into the nexus disability and employment. Data was gathered from Othering and Belonging Institute’s Inclusiveness Index, World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index, ITU’s ICT Global Development Index, WIPO’s and INSEAD’s Global Innovation Index, WHO’s Global Health Care Index, World Economic Forum’s Infrastructure Index, and ILOSTAT. It covers a sample of 37 nations, from North America, South America, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and Asia. These nations are at different levels of economic and social development. Our sample was constrained by the availability of international data on employment for people with disabilities and by the other dimensions of the sextuple helix, thus reducing the number of nations utilized to 37 nations. Very few nations provide accurate and current data on employment for people with disability. Moreover, data availability for the different dimensions of the Quadruple and Sextuple Helix further constrained our ability to have a larger sample than  what is analyzed in this paper. The section “Unemployment and People with Disabilities” summarizes the unemployment disparity for people with and without disabilities for all the countries in our sample. “The Disability Quadruple and Sextuple Helixes” outlines the disability quadruple and sextuple helix models. “Implications from the Sextuple Helix Model” elaborates on implications for nation’s disability strategies and policies implied by the disability quadruple and sextuple helix models. “Final Remarks” discusses future research implications from our main findings.",2

According to contemporary innovation concepts, the innovation process is based on many feedback loops among users, researchers, and innovators (Kline & Rosenberg, 1986). This interpretation also stipulates that innovation need not be the result of scientific research-and-development (R&D) per se; rather, it also occurs through co-creation with users, suppliers, or via firm-internal learning. Knowledge generation involves a variety of actors (Asheim et al., 2016), also driven by unique regional framework conditions (Boschma, 2005; Strambach & Klement, 2012), indicating that knowledge and innovation processes have become increasingly complex, interactive, and cumulative. Jensen et al. (2007) conceptualize two fundamental ways of innovating: the “Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) mode” and the “Doing, Using and Interacting (DUI) mode.” However, studies on innovation modes are inconclusive as to which mode (or combination) might be the most effective for innovation performance (Apanasovich, 2016; Haus-Reve et al., 2019; Nunes & Lopes, 2015; Parrilli & Elola, 2012; Parrilli & Heras, 2016). Debate continues as to whether DUI and STI are complements or substitutes (Chen et al., 2011; Haus-Reve et al., 2019; Thomä & Zimmermann, 2019). Furthermore, little is known about the individual components of DUI mode learning. Previous studies treated “DUI” as an abstract shell of learning mechanisms covered by diverse and interchangeable variables (Aslesen et al., 2012; Nunes & Lopes, 2015; Trippl, 2011; Trott & Simms, 2017). However, we argue that it is worth breaking the DUI mode into its core mechanisms to learn what constitutes the causal “recipes” for organizational learning that lead to high innovation performance in a specific region. This question is addressed in the context of innovation activities in small- and medium-sized enterprises in three German regions. Invoking insights from the innovation mode concept and economic geography literature on regional innovation, we propose that high innovation performance does not depend on specific conditions, but rather on a specific configuration of conditions—that is, high innovativeness is based on a bundle of conditions summarized as mechanisms of learning-by-doing, learning-by-using, learning-by-interacting, and learning-by-science. The complexity of innovation activities necessitates a research design that allows for extending, modifying or revising theoretical structuring and hypothesis during the research process (Mayring, 2002), and thus a circulation between theory and method. During innovation processes, complex and diverse mechanisms come into effect. A qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) is an instrument able to deal with such complexity (Rutten, 2020b). QCA is a set-membership analytical instrument appropriate for complex configuration analysis (Ragin, 2009). This method uses Boolean algebra rules to provide combinatorial explanations for small-N analysis (Amenta & Poulsen, 1994). Thus, it expects causal heterogeneity, assuming that different condition combinations (i.e., learning mechanisms) may influence a specific outcome (high innovativeness), rather than individual conditions per se (Ordanini et al., 2014). Hence, this paper intends to contribute to the question of which combinations of learning mechanisms lead to high innovation performance in SMEs by applying a QCA, which is a relatively new instrument in this field as well as in economic geography. A deeper understanding of how SMEs learn and transfer knowledge into innovations is extremely important for adjusting innovation policy to the needs of SMEs (Aslesen & Pettersen, 2017; Coletti, 2010; Cooke, 2014; e.g. Isaksen & Karlsen, 2013). Thus, this paper holds implications for the following: (a) SMEs themselves, and how the focus on specific configurations of learning can help find an effective innovation strategy; however, the analysis also shows alternative, potentially successful “recipes” for high innovation performance, reducing the risk of implementing putative “best practices” that do not fit a firm’s setting; (b) regional innovation policy searching for instruments to foster innovation activities in SMEs; and (c) measurement of innovations based on DUI-mode learning. This paper intends to answer two research questions: Which configuration of learning-by-doing, learning-by-using, learning-by-interacting, and learning-by-science leads to high innovation performance in SMEs? How and why do these configurations differ at a regional level? This paper is organized as follows: the “Theory and Literature Review” section presents the conceptual framework and introduces possible conditions for high innovation performance. After presenting the research design and QCA procedure in the “Method” section, findings are reported in the “Results” section. The “Discussion of QCA Results and Subsequent Case Analysis” section discusses the findings and implications. Finally, a conclusion is made.",6

This literature breaks with the traditional approach in that it incorporates political factors in its study of economic phenomena. It explains public policies or issues affecting the economy by the fulfillment of the interests of political decision-makers (Ruggie, 1982; Wagner, 1987). At the academic level, debate is mainly crystallized around the advantages of a democratic versus an autocratic political regime (Guadalupe et al., 2018). Democracy is broadly defined as “a free society, not oppressed by a discretional or uncontrollable political power, nor dominated by a closed oligarchy or restricted in which the government responds to the governed” (Sartori, 1987). Regarding the development effects of democracy, the literature identifies two mainly opposing viewpoints. The first viewpoint stipulates that democracy positively affects development. Indeed, by imposing constraints on the government, the democratic regime reduces the risk of expropriation of public and private agents and offers better protection of property rights. This will boost investment and development. Conversely, other authors consider that a democratic political regime penalizes the development process. In fact, in order to enhance their re-election chances, democratic governments pursue short-term goals. This will prevent them from making optimal economic decisions. The consequence would be a reduction of national income in democracies. Political economy theories of financial development stipulate that the development of the financial system is conditioned by the political regime type, i.e., a democratic versus an autocratic regime. Accordingly, access to finance and financial markets may be obstructed by political and industrial influential groups, who control political choices (Girma & Shortland, 2008; Rajan & Zingales, 2003). Overall, the literature identifies several transmission channels through which democracy could affect the financial system (Ghardallou & Sridi, 2020). These channels are the following: the protection of property rights channel (North, 1990; Haber et al., 2008), the human capital channel (Baum & Lake, 2003), and the technological innovation channel (Knutsen, 2012). Substantial empirical work has been conducted in order to test mechanisms by which democracy may impact financial outcomes. Yet, the results of the empirical literature have been mixed (Bhattacharyya, 2013; Ghardallou, 2016, 2021; Girma & Shortland, 2008; Huang, 2010; Yang, 2011). Several authors argued that democracy’s effects should not be considered in absolute terms but rather in relative ones. Specifically, part of these researchers claimed that the effect of democracy on development depends on some moderator variables that are considered requisites of democracy, such as economic development and political legitimacy (Lipset, 1959), political freedom (Barro, 1996), and corporations, media, and the elite (Goede, 2019). The moderating variables in the relationship between democracy and development show that the association between the focused constructs is non-linear. Besides, other parts of the literature consider that there exists a U-shaped or an inverted U-shaped curve relationship between democratic political institutions and development (North & Weingast, 1989; Olson, 1993; Barro, 1996; Zakaria, 1997; Acemoglu & Robinson, 2006). Therefore, as a continuation of these researches, this study aims to reexamine the impact of democracy on the financial system development in an attempt to explain empirical controversies. Specifically, it proposes to clarify this debate by investigating the non-linear effects of democracy on financial system development using panel smooth transition (PSTR) models as well as fixed and system GMM estimators. As far as we know, threshold effect of democracy on financial development was not investigated before. Indeed, previous studies have examined the democracy effects regardless of whether there exists a threshold effect from democracy on financial development. Moreover, the PSTR model has not been used formerly to investigate this problem, though it appears to be extremely pertinent. Definitely, this model permits inspecting the impact of democracy as indicated by its different levels. The PSTR model could provide new insights since this model endogenously identifies different regimes that correspond to distinct equations, as well as the optimal degree of democracy, i.e., the threshold value, with respect to which the sign of the relationship could be different. Furthermore, the originality of the PSTR models consists in the fact that individuals can shift between groups and over time, which is based on changes in the threshold variable. Because parameters fluctuate smoothly as a function of a threshold variable, the PSTR model also gives a parametric solution to cross-country variability and time instability of the democracy-development coefficients. These features cannot be accounted for by dynamic or static panel techniques nor by interaction effects. Accordingly, the paper contributes to the related literature in several ways. First, it extends previous studies by considering threshold effects between democracy and financial outcomes by the way of (PSTR) techniques. Besides, the study employs a large sample of developing countries, which will allow examining whether the effect of democracy varies between emerging economies. Second, it helps to understand contradicting empirical results that are dealing with the democracy effect, by reconciling the two opposing strands of literature. Actually, our findings indicate that democratic political regime could either promote or compromise the development of the financial sector depending on a certain threshold. This paper is structured as follows: the “Literature Review” section reviews the literature explaining the non-linearity of the relationship between democracy and financial development and develops the hypothesis of the study. The “Data and Methodology” section describes the methodology, the data, and variables used. The “Results” section discusses our econometric results. The “Robustness and Sensitivity Analysis” section shows robustness checks and the “Discussion and Conclusion” section concludes the paper.",5

In the investigations, it was found that a new coronavirus species mutated from the coronavirus family caused this disease, and in subsequent studies, this virus was named 2019-nCoV', Novel CoV-19, SARSCoV-2, and finally COVID-19 (Kumar et al., 2020: 97; Wu et al., 2020). Due to the high infectious effect of the virus, the disease has been transmitted to many countries in a short time and COVID-19 started to be a global problem especially after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that COVID-19 outbreak as a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. As a result of rapid contamination, the center of the epidemic became European countries and the USA after a short time. After the pandemic announcement, the necessity of joint struggle against COVID-19 has been underlined and joint studies have accelerated. Nowadays, where phase 3 studies on vaccination are ongoing, one of the most important methods of preventing COVID-19 cases is to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus by preventing the transmission and destroying local epidemics effectively, strongly, and rapidly (Salathé et al., 2020). In this process, WHO recommends taking certain measures such as quarantine, informing the public about the epidemic, complying with hygiene rules, using personal protective equipment, preparing emergency protocols, comprehensive case finding, rapid testing, emergency isolation of identified cases, meticulous contact monitoring, and strictly close contact with individuals to combat COVID-19 (WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease, 2019: 21–22). In order to combat COVID-19 effectively, cases must be identified and these people must be quarantined. In order to reduce the quarantines shaped by the incidence of COVID-19, we need to determine who has the infection and who has recovered from the infection (Kumleben et al., 2020). At this point, WHO recommends that diagnostic tests must be performed for detection. In particular, monitoring all confirmed contacts and testing to prevent severe acute respiratory failure is the key to successful prevention of the outbreak. It has been suggested that robust testing, home quarantine, and contact tracing (filming) in combination with strict social isolation can bring COVID-19 cases to controllable levels (Aleta et al., 2020). Testing can also reduce the period of uncertainty associated with cases (Brotherhood et al., 2020: 1). Studies indicate that the incubation period of the disease is five days, and the majority of infected people start to show symptoms within 10–14 days (Fang et al., 2020). Patients who show certain symptomatic symptoms of the epidemic should be tested to confirm the diagnosis of COVID-19 as soon as possible, and those with positive COVID-19 test results should be isolated from the community and followed up clinically (Peeling et al., 2020: 1). In addition, tests are also very useful in identifying populations at risk and evaluating the effectiveness of control strategies (Peeling et al., 2020). Finally, it is suggested that an effective testing strategy can be used as an important tool in loosening the applied social distance interventions (Aleta et al., 2020). WHO succinctly emphasizes the importance of testing all countries with the following sentence: “We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.” (WHO Director-General’s opening remarks at the media briefing on COVID-19, 16 March 2020). Some testing approaches can be used to diagnose COVID-19, and these approaches have different advantages and disadvantages (Kumar et al., 2020). The method choiced for testing is usually the real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) test. A major advantage of real-time RT-PCR testing is that the amplification and analysis are performed simultaneously in a closed system to minimize false positive results associated with amplification product contamination (Tang et al., 2020). Although PCR tests give good results, they are expensive and laborious (Kumar et al., 2020). Although PCR tests have high analytical sensitivity, the clinical sensitivity level is not very high because some COVID-19 positive patients cannot be detected due to no having enough viruses in the upper respiratory tract for various reasons (Fang et al., 2020). For this reason, it is very important to determine whether the test correctly detects the cases, even if the diagnostic tests are successfully applied. No diagnostic or screening test is perfect, and false results are inevitable. At this point, it should be taken into consideration that there may be false positive detections or false negative determinations while performing PCR test (Kumleben et al., 2020). It is stated that the highest sensitivity rate of RT-PCR tests is 90%. When all tests are evaluated even at this highest rate, it is obvious that false test results will lead to the spread and increased prevalence of COVID-19 cases. The extent of this negative effect can be better understood, especially when it is considered that these tests are applied in large societies or applied on healthcare personnel (West et al., 2020). It is recommended the strict application of infection control criteria such as physical distance, hand hygiene, environmental cleaning and disinfection, and especially the use of adequate personal protective equipment, especially by healthcare professionals and patients, to develop risk-stratified protocols for management of false negative test results, determination of risk levels before testing, and the development of accurate diagnostic tests to reduce the negative impact of false negative test results (West et al., 2020: 1128). Therefore, it has been suggested that re-testing may be beneficial in false-negative test results, especially in cases with high clinical suspicion (Fang et al., 2020: 2). Determining an effective testing policy, taking into account the stated advantages, disadvantages, and limitations, provides various gains in managing the epidemic. Salathé et al. (2020) summarize some of the benefits of testing as followings: Helps to keep the COVID-19 virus under control and prevent possible contamination by monitoring and isolating people who come into contact with positively diagnosed people. Testing enables the identification of infectious individuals and groups and allows contact tracing and precautionary self-isolation. Provides a more accurate estimate of death rates by confirming the relationship between the onset of the disease and death. Testing gives a clear picture of epidemiological situations achieved on the right ground. These data are very important in obtaining mild, severe, and critical patient ratios in order to better manage the problem. Testing allows us to get a clear picture of the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak. Testing allows us to reliably determine the proportion of the population infected with the virus. On the other hand, even if very good results are obtained by testing, factors such as (i) the people with symptoms are not known exactly, (ii) the test results can take a long time to obtain, (iii) the cost of testing is not negligible (Brotherhood et al., 2020), (iv) insufficient capacity of healthcare infrastructures, (v) failure to detect the disease due to individuals’ early days of contracting the virus, and (vi) failure to scale the centers required for testing on a very large scale and not meet the demand (Peeling et al., 2020) can reduce the gains from tests. Another important point in controlling COVID-19 is the issue of how the test is applied, which greatly affects the effectiveness of the test (Thunström et al., 2020: 2). At this point, different strategies can be followed by the authorities. Some may decide to test only those with symptoms or to test if any disease develops within 14 days from the first contact, and some can test all groups with or without symptoms (Peeling et al., 2020: 1). There are studies involving different views on this subject. For example, Thunström et al. states that the most effective testing policy under a certain time and test limitation is the method of random testing on a voluntary basis (Thunström et al., 2020: 15). Cleevely et al., on the other hand, suggests that the method of periodically testing groups stratified according to risk groups instead of global random testing is the best method of testing under limited resources (Cleevely et al., 2020: 1). Another factor that affects these strategies is the willingness of individuals to have tests. In the study conducted by Thunström et al. (2020: 13), it is stated that factors such as age of individuals, being extrovert and health-related lifestyle characteristics, and their status of having insurance may affect individuals’ willingness to have COVID-19 testing (Thunström et al., 2020: 13). This study is about determining to what extent the testing recommended by WHO affects the case control process. In this regard, this study illustrates that the effect of COVID-19 testing on controlling COVID-19 cases via econometric cointegration test. Our study may provide important contributions to literature. First, since studies about the effects of testing on the number of COVID-19 cases are limited, this study provides evidence to both literature. Since this study will also be an evaluation of the test policies implemented by the countries, it may contribute to the countries making an evaluation in their test policies. Countries are conducting a significant number of tests and trying to increase their testing capacity. Our study provides scientific evidence for their decisions. In addition, in terms of contribution to the literature, it will be able to form a basis for cost-effectiveness analyzes that can be made regarding tests, especially in terms of effectiveness measure.",6

However, this development was not uniform across all member states especially in states where local civil societies are considered to be weak (Clarke, 2016; Sotiropoulos, 2005). Being so, member states, such as Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria as well as countries in southern Europe such as Greece are increasingly developing non-profit organizations. Such organizations are assisting unfavorable classes in social matters. These social issues have been aggravated due to financial crises and refugee calamities (Zbuchea et al., 2019). In the recent years, Portugal was also affected by economic and financial crises, forest fires and more recently the covid19 pandemic. In this context, the most successful organizations are those based on knowledge (Kessler, 2006; Kong, 2015). These organizations have the ability to implement knowledge management strategies that may maximize the use of knowledge in their services or products, thus minimizing losses. Knowledge-based organizations must have inventiveness, creativity, and innovation. However, it is not easy for non-profit organizations to become knowledge-based organization as the surrounding environment on which they operate is constantly being affected by internal and external changes (Banks et al., 2015). Regarding the internal environment, many non-profit organizations depend on human resources who are loyal volunteers as they collaborate for the cause and not for employment or financial opportunity. However, human resources are extremely moveable, as organizations do not have the capacity to offer long-term contracts (for those who are not volunteers), which leads to job uncertainty and consequently knowledge loss. Concerning the external environment, some non-profit organizations face difficulties to recruit volunteers as funding opportunities are sometimes scarce or very bureaucratic to obtain and government policies not always include all non-profit organizations (Banks et al., 2015; Zbuchea et al., 2019). Previous studies on knowledge management in non-profit organizations are focused on the organizational context, more specifically, on knowledge transfer from the point of view of the infrastructure and organizational facilitators (Hasnain & Jasimuddin, 2012; Martin-Perez et al., 2012; Rathi et al., 2014). In this context, the Portuguese Voluntary Fire Brigades (FBs) are non-profit organizations and represent the main intervention force, both in fire prevention, firefighting and relief delivering to people and property in the event of accidents regardless its nature (Oliveira & Pinheiro, 2019). The operations of non-profit organizations need to incorporate the knowledge produced each day in the field. This tacit knowledge is an asset that is not easily found in other types of organizations, such as state services or companies (Zbuchea et al., 2019). FBs are constituted by people who carry out their activities based on volunteerism, whereby the use of professionals is intended exclusively to guarantee the provision of minimum regulatory services. Due to this volunteer link and the area of activity, tacit knowledge sharing of firefighters in viewed as an organizational learning of great importance and possibly decisive in operational success. However, this sharing is not easy to establish as a regular practice. Thus, this paper presents the results of a research on tacit knowledge sharing with the FBs commanders by assessing the prevalence of the main indicators mentioned in the literature translated into a valid diagnosis matrix to determine the effectiveness of sharing and subsequently converted into an performance matrix that may be adopted by the management of these organizations as an effort to provide FBs with greater organizational learning through this type of knowledge. This study complements the results of the article by Oliveira and Pinheiro (2020). For Hislop (2007), knowledge sharing is achieved by members of an organization who share relevant ideas for the task (skills, experience, and understanding), information and suggestions amongst researchers, policy makers, and service providers. For Hong et al. (2011), knowledge sharing indicates the dissemination of knowledge to improve the work of the entire organization and can be characterized by the transfer of part or the totality of knowledge from one person to another. For these authors, this knowledge sharing is a process by which knowledge once maintained by an individual is now converted into a form that can be understood, absorbed, and used by other individuals. By reviewing the literature on tacit knowledge sharing, it was possible to determine the following indicators that comprise units of analysis: time and opportunity, common language, mutual trust, network of relationships, hierarchy, recognition and reward, type of training for the task, transmission of knowledge, storage of knowledge, power, favorable environment for questioning, type of valued knowledge, and communication. The determination of the prevalence of these indicators in the organizations under study enables to meet the first objective and leads to the presentation of a set of measures to be implemented aiming the promotion a more effective sharing of tacit knowledge, which is sought with the second objective of this study. This paper starts with an introduction followed by the literature review that takes into account the main topics covered in the research. Next, the results are presented and discussed, followed by the conclusions, research limitations, and recommendations for future studies.",7

Data from the World Inequality Database (2018) show that the richest people captured over 20% of world revenue in 2016 and absorbed 27% of the proceeds of growth. They would have captured 20.4% of the riches but because of runoff and reverse streaming half of the poorest humanity in the world’s population had to be contented with just 9.7% of the said revenue in the same year. The analysis of Milanovic (2016) adds to that of Piketty (2015) according to which the gap between capital and labor returns is at the root of the income inequalities that we witness today. This idea is different from the assertion of Deaton (2013) according to which inequalities result from the insufficiencies of economic growth. He put to question the first analyzes of inequalities, especially that of Kuznets (1955). The Kuznets curve proposes a hypothesis according to which inequalities would attenuate as economic development progresses. This assertion is refuted nowadays, because income inequalities seem to be accelerating, thereby challenging the catch-up process of economically weak nations with those economically strong. African Union (2015) emphasized that the achievement of a strategic plan for economic development for the continent depends on reduction of inequalities which remain a real threat to the 2063 Agenda. The United Nations Development Program (PNUD, 2017) in sideline to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) adopted by the United Nations in 2015 in context to gradually reduce poverty emphasizes the acceleration of income inequalities in Sub-Saharan Africa between 1991 and 2011. Africa still remains one of the regions of the world with high levels of muldimensional inequalities. First, income inequalities have marked by the difference in income, and thus, the Gini coefficient remains a measure indicator. Second, housing inequalities are measured by the percentage of the urban population living in unsanitary urban areas. Finally, the environmental inequalities result from an unequal sharing of resources, lack of green space, and urban pollution. Illustratively, 10 of 19 countries in the world with highest inequalities are in Africa.Footnote 1 On a regional plan, Southern Africa regroups 4 most unequal countries in Africa. Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Seychelles presented a Gini index of above 0.60 in 2017 (PNUD, 2017). They are followed by Zambia and Lesotho with a Gini index that varies between 0.53 and 0.59. However, Tanzania seems to be a good student with a Gini index below to 0.39. Some West African countries (Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Sierra Leone, and Liberia) have a Gini index below to 0.44. Two central African countries have an average income index between 0.45 and 0.52 (Cameroon and Congo) and four have an index between 0.40 and 0.44 (Chad, Gabon, Democratic Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea). Inequalities are dependent of economic growth and on the arbitration between capital income and labor income. Among the solutions put forward to reduce inequalities, subsist good institutions (Adams & Klobodu, 2019). It seems that this assumption accepted today could be reconsidered in future if two indicators are not integrated: firstly, population growth facing developing countries with a high fertility rate. In sub-Saharan Africa, the birth rate is 5 to 7 children on average per woman. According to UN-HABITAT (2010), African cities are very unequal with a Gini index of 0.529 against 0.509 for Latin American and Caribbean cities, and 0.30 for Europe. In Nigeria, 61.9% of the urban population lived in unhealthy areas in 2010, with an urban population of 78.85%, compared with 28.7% in South Africa, 13.1% in Morocco, and 17.1% in Egypt (UN-HABITAT, 2010). Secondly, in the absence of good territorial governance and notably environmental, the development follows unequal space management and the protection of nature. For Boyce et al. (2016), different measures of environmental inequalities can be identified. For example, the management of waste and the pollution of the atmosphere through the emission of gases by companies established in the unhealthy zones. For UN-Environment (2018), pollution by plastics waste in the urban centers represents approximately 60% of environmental pollution. The emergence of inequalities in Africa has taken place in a poorly performing institutional framework. Precisely, Africa continues to be marked by a deterioration in institutional quality that hinders transaction costs, property rights protection, entrepreneurial activities, and innovations (Saima, 2015). Moreover, the colonial legacy has left Africa with less beneficial institutions with less coherent strategies for dealing with failures, which restrict investment, economic growth, and structural diversification. Half of Africa’s countries have performed poorly due to inappropriate institutions, distortive policies, a less glamorous institutional environment, political instability, and corruption (Aisen & Veiga, 2013). These aspects ensure high levels of corruption that amplify inefficient regulations, unable to mitigate the impact of external shocks, undermine diversification efforts, weaken the industrial base, and push Africa towards sustainable growth (World Bank, 2018). Kuznets (1955) underlines that the persistence of income inequalities in developing countries is associated with the inability of the political and economic systems to initiate practical policies that increase the incomes of poor. In theory, institutions favor the emergence of interest groups, trade unions, and political parties (Yi, 2013). Thus, theoretical and empirical investigation on the causes and consequences of inequalities has taken account political considerations. Przeworski (2010) pointed out that the relationship between institutions and income inequalities is at the heart of political and economic theories. The literature on inequality is organized around three orientations: first, the measurement of indicators (Wu & Rao, 2016); second, the effects of inequalities on economic and mesoeconomic variables (Mao, 2016); and finally, the economic and mesoeconomic determinants of income inequalities (Zhang et al., 2019; Piketty, 2015). Several studies have shown a relationship between political forms and income inequality (Ahmad, 2017; Kemp-Benedict, 2011), and between institutional quality and income inequality (Policardo & Carrena, 2018; Sunde et al., 2008). Others have studied the effect of redistribution in social democracies and how colonial history affects current inequality (Angeles, 2007; Piketty & Saez, 2003). In spite of past empirical efforts, there is no consensus on the relationship between institutional factors and inequality. Precisely, institutions can stimulate, hinder, or have no effect on income, housing and environmental inequalities (Adams & Klobodu, 2019; Ongo-Nkoa & Song, 2019; Hartmann et al., 2016). If for Zuazu (2018), the socio-economic determinants of inequalities have gained interest through the capitalist system which generates income disparities, the emergence of the New Institutional Economy underlines the importance of institutions. For Stiglitz (2012), institution also has to be given particular attention. In fact, inequalities are explained not only by the marginal productivity of invested capital but also by the political system which reduces the chances of some people and increases those of others (Shimeles & Nabassaga, 2018). This institutional analysis is undoubtedly closer to that of North (1990), who considered institutions as the real determinants of countries’ economic performance. The study contributes to the literature in several ways. On the positive plan, while a number of recent studies have examined the role of corruption on income inequality. This study extends the literature by exploring the impact of the institutional quality on income, housing, and environmental inequalities, which have been neglected in the past empirical efforts. In all likelihood, there are no studies on the subject of Africa, yet the continent is expected to be a privileged territory due to the strong population growth. In terms of methodology, the study goes beyond previous work, because it is based on Maximum Likelihood Method. Panel data allow to trace the dynamics behaviors, their heterogeneity, and reduce the risk of explanatory variables. At the strategic level, the repercussions of the demographic crisis plus emigration affect Africa given the decline in Official Development Assistance, imports and investment (UNCTAD, 2009). On logical point of view, each period emerges with an event that secretes thought on the scope of the same paradigm. The beginning of the millennium imposes the problem of the institutional environment in relation to inequalities which are imperatives to peace, security, inclusion, durability and development. High inequalities hinder the processes of economic growth and development, amplify injustice in distribution, exclude the poor from the decision-making process, and induce the involvement of the poor in illicit activities, criminal activities. Income inequality emerges from weak constraints on political elites, who carryout redistribution based on their self-interest (Ravaillion, 2009). Indeed, the institutional quality is a basis for generating inequalities. In this paper, we examine the effects of institutional variables on inequalities based on a sample of 48 African countries over the period 1996–2016. Consequently, we formulate the following research question: institutional quality improve inequalities in Africa? The identification of the postulates chosen requires the specification of a panel data model whose estimation is made by the Maximum Likelihood Method (MLM) lead to two main results: (i) Governance indices reduce income inequality and have a significant adverse effect on housing and environmental inequalities. (ii) The length of the political regime and the duration of the political party of the chief executive exacerbate the inequalities in all its forms. The rest of the study is structured as follows. The”Literature Review“ sketchs the state of the art and the theoretical positioning of the effects of institutions on inequalities The empirical model, estimation technique and data sources are discussed in the Empirical Strategy section. The Results and Discussion section presents and analyses the different results. The concluding section summarizes and provides some economic policy suggestions.",5

In spite of its importance and its great effect, and based on Wei-Loon et al. (2015), while it is clear that SE is derived from an entrepreneurship process, there is still confusion about its definition and application: especially noting the multidimensionality of different aspects which are relevant to it. This is why this study seeks to present an operational definition of this emergent concept. Independently of the theoretical limitations related to its definition, sustainable entrepreneurship is becoming critical for business continuity (Belz & Binder, 2017). It is known that continuity deals with profit. In this case, to appreciate the opportunity from this process, it is necessary to refer to performance, and especially to corporate social performance, but more precisely, it is necessary to consider this specific objective for the private sector, which is profit-oriented. Based on Majid and Koe’s definition (2012), sustainable entrepreneurship can be associated with innovative processes for exploiting opportunity, to achieve economic benefits, socially equitable outcomes, benefit for the environment, and equity in preserving cultures. Bell and Stellingwerf (2012) demonstrate that this innovative approach adopted by entrepreneurs and issuing from their sustainability knowledge contributes to the adoption and application of sustainable entrepreneurship. So, it is considered that there is an impact from SE on innovation. A direct association between SE and innovation is difficult to identify from the existent literature. The objective in this study is therefore to demonstrate that this effect exists, and then to identify how it can be stimulated. Osburg (2013) argues that SE is within the essence of the realization of sustainable innovation, with its different aspects related to sustainability (social, economic and environmental). More precisely, sustainable entrepreneurship represents efforts developed and defined to serve community through the definition of new solutions for new social and ecological challenges, to contribute to economic development as associated with ameliorating life conditions (World Business Council for Sustainable Development, 2012). This study follows on from Crals and Vereeck (2007), who link this process to industrial companies and present a number of requirements for the success of this synergetic effect, including time and financial resources. Schaltegger and Wagner (2011) explain this continual process as a focused and maintained combination of capabilities to define competitive advantage. The integrative model developed here will try to provide empirical evidence of such effects: especially when remembering that there is a lack of literature related to the different relationship adopted here.",10

The Role of Human Capital, Institutional Quality, and Economic Development",September 2022,Ridha Nouira,Sami Saafi,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The importance of export upgrading for growth and economic development is uncontroversial (see, for instance, Rodrik, 2006; Hausmann et al., 2007; Hidalgo et al., 2007; Santos-Paulino, 2011; Felipe et al., 2012; Jarreau & Poncet, 2012; Poncet & De Waldemar, 2013; Ferrarini & Scaramozzino, 2016; Lin et al., 2017; Albeaik et al., 2017; Zhu & Li, 2017; Stojkoski & Kocarev, 2017; Gala et al., 2018; Güneri, 2019; Shimbov et al., 2019; Mealy et al., 2019; Chrid et al., 2020).Footnote 1 According to the theory, economic development is perceived as a process of learning how to produce (and export) more sophisticated/complex products (Felipe et al., 2014). In this line of thought, it has been recognized that the development path of a country is determined by its capacity to accumulate the capabilities that are needed to produce more complex goods (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2009). Therefore, cross-country differences in income can be explained by differences in export complexity (McMillan & Rodrik, 2011). Countries with a more complex basket appear to grow faster. However, empirical evidence tends to suggest that the growth benefits from export upgrading are not unconditional, and depend on the production capabilities available in a country (Poncet & De Waldemar, 2013). Increasing export complexity for its own sake may be counter-productive (Chrid et al., 2020; Saafi & Nouira, 2018). In other words, industrial upgrading enhances economic growth only in economies that have already reached a minimum level of maturity (Chakroun et al., 2020). Therefore, an important question to ask is which specific factors that could affect the relationship between export upgrading and economic growth. Some recent studies have provided evidence that the level of a country’s development may be as one of the main factors that drive this relationship. In fact, Hausmann et al. (2007), using a panel of 133 countries over the period 1992–2003, found a positive and significant effect of export sophistication on economic growth in middle- and low-income countries, but insignificant in high-income countries. Sheridan (2014) explored whether the relationship between manufacturing exports and economic growth varies with the level of economic development. By using regression tree analysis for a panel of 92 countries over the period 1970–2009, the author showed that although increasing manufacturing exports play an essential role in promoting economic growth, this positive relationship only holds once a certain threshold level of development is achieved. In a more recent research, Chrid et al. (2020) considered three homogenous subpanels which are constructed based on the income level of the sample countries (high-, middle-, and low-income subpanels) to examine the long-run relationship between export upgrading and economic growth for 51 countries over the period of 1984–2015. By employing the common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG) technique, their results indicate that export complexity has a positive and significant effect on economic growth for the global, high-income, and middle-income panels, while this effect is insignificant for the low-income country panel. There are also some recent studies suggesting that other factors such as human capital and institutional quality may be relevant thresholds in the relationship between export upgrading and growth. For instance, Teixeira and Queirós (2016) employed the system generalized method of moments (GMM) to examine the importance of human capital in the relationship between structural change and economic growth for a panel dataset covering 30 countries over the period 1960–2011. Their empirical results indicate that the interaction between human capital and structural change in high knowledge-intensive industries plays an important role for economic growth. Zhu and Li (2017), using panel data for a sample of 126 countries over the period 1995–2010, reported similar results, as they found that a good interaction between human capital and complexity affects growth positively. Further insight is offered by Chakroun et al. (2020) who demonstrated by employing the heterogeneous panel framework that the growth effect of export upgrading depends on the level of human capital. On the other hand, Zhu and Fu (2013) argued that institutional quality is one of the main drivers of export upgrading. Employing binary logit models on data from 125 countries over the period 1960 to 2014, Sathyamoorthy and Tang (2019) showed that the validity of the export-led growth hypothesis is contingent on institutional quality. A widely used empirical approach to capture the presence of contingency effects in the relationship between export upgrading and economic growth is to include an interaction term between export upgrading and a conditioning variable (see, e.g., Zhu & Li, 2017; Chakroun et al., 2020). However, as already argued by Saafi and Nouira (2018), one shortcoming of this modeling strategy is that it imposes a priori restriction that the effect of export upgrading on economic growth monotonically raises (or declines) with the level of the conditioning variable. However, it may be that a certain level of the conditioning variable has to be achieved before export upgrading can have any impact on economic growth. This suggests the need for more flexible functional specification that can accommodate different kinds of export upgrading–growth interactions. Formally, to capture the presence of contingency effects, it is useful to extend the analysis to a nonlinear framework. However, the empirical evidence on the nonlinear relationship between export upgrading and economic growth is rather scarce. One exception is the study by Saafi and Nouira (2018) who employed a dynamic panel threshold model to examine the potential nonlinearities, i.e., threshold effects, in the export upgrading–growth relationship. Using panel data for 58 advanced and developing countries for the period 1995–2015, the authors showed that there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between export upgrading and growth. Against this background, the aim of this paper is to empirically examine whether human capital, institutional quality, and economic development affect the relationship between export upgrading and economic growth. Different from most previous studies, which include an interaction term between export upgrading and a conditioning variable, this article applies a novel FD-GMM method developed by Seo and Shin (2016) that is applicable for dynamic panel threshold models, to a panel data of 56 developed and developing countries over the period of 1995–2015. The novelty of this modeling strategy is that it allows for endogenous regressors and endogenous threshold variables. Furthermore, it captures the potentially contingency effects without imposing any specific nonlinear functional form. Our contribution to the existing literature is twofold. First, compared to the study of Saafi and Nouira (2018), focusing only on whether a threshold exists in the relationship between export upgrading and economic growth, the current study takes that a step further to address specifically which factors may be driving this relationship. In doing so, we attempt to provide new insight into the role of countries’ specific characteristics in reaping the growth benefits from upgrading export. Motivated by the empirical findings of studies discussed above, we focus on the particular roles of the level of economic development, the human capital, and the quality of institutions. Second, unlike most previous studies which include an interaction term between export upgrading and a conditioning variable, we employ the threshold regression approach to investigate the circumstances under which export upgrading is growth-enhancing. To the authors’ best knowledge, this study is among the first studies to employ the threshold approachFootnote 2 to examine the existence of contingency effects in the export upgrading–growth relationship. We believe that such an approach is suitable to get more valuable insights about the conditional relationship between export upgrading and economic growth. Particularly, we argue that while export upgrading can start from an early stage of development, it would not necessarily lead to a higher growth path unless the country sets up the requisite infrastructure and acquires the technological knowledge and skills required in labor markets. That is because, as pointed out by Zhang (2015), export upgrading is a long and gradual process. It should go hand in hand with the upgrading of the endowment structure, including human, physical, and institutional capital. As a consequence, as emphasized by Saafi and Nouira (2018), its relationship with growth is not expected to be linear. Countries’ specific endowments, productive capabilities, and stage of development condition their ability to move up the global value chains and translate their structural change into better economic performance (Chakroun et al., 2020). From a policy perspective, exploring the possible existence of contingency effects in the relationship between export upgrading and growth is of paramount importance. Indeed, it helps us to identify preconditions required for a country to optimize the growth-enhancing gains from export upgrading. By knowing these preconditions, policymakers will be able to formulate and implement sound policies. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. “Model Specification and Data” presents the dataset and econometric model used in our analysis. “Descriptive Statistics and Results” discusses descriptive statistics and empirical results followed by a discussion in “Discussion.” Finally, “Conclusion” outlines the key concluding remarks and discusses the main research limitations as well as future research directions.",10

For Krugman, productivity is not everything, but in the long run, productivity becomes almost everything (Krugman, 1997). He states that without it, there will be no long-term economic growth. Thus, several studies have focused on the factors that explain productivity growth. Many authors highlight the importance of the quality of institutions. According to North (1990), institutions are made up of formal (constitution, laws and regulations, political system...) and informal (value systems and beliefs, representations, social norms...) rules governing the behaviour of individuals and organizations, the latter being groups of individuals pursuing common goals (companies, unions, NGOs...). Thus, for example, countries with more secure property rights tend to have higher productivity and therefore higher per capita income levels (North, 1991). Hall and Jones (1999) explain that observed productivity differences between countries are related to differences in institutions and government policies; what they refer to as ‘social infrastructure’. Olson et al. (2000) empirically show that the quality of governanceFootnote 1 significantly improves productivity growth in fast-growing developing countries. Rigobon and Rodrik (2005) argue that when political and economic institutions strengthen and foster each other, they contribute positively to productivity and growth. In particular, some empirical studies have focused on the impact of institutional quality on labour productivity (measured by output per worker). For example, Mustafa and Jamil (2018) conduct a study of 12 Asian countries and find that government effectiveness and regulatory quality are positively related to average labour productivity. Over a sample of 22 OECD countries, Salinas-Jiménez and Salinas-Jiménez (2007) show that different indicators of corruption are negatively related to labour productivity. Jankauskas and Šeputienė (2007) analyse data from 23 European countries and find that several governance indicators are positively and significantly related to labour productivity. To our knowledge, there is no empirical study that has focused on the specific case of sub-Saharan African countriesFootnote 2. The region has the lowest labour productivity according to a World Bank Group (2018) reportFootnote 3. At the same time, sub-Saharan Africa has relatively poor governance performance (World Economic Forum, 2018)Footnote 4. Table 1 presents the classification of the last 10 countries in the region with low labour productivity with their respective average global governance indices over the period 1996–2016. It reveals that all the poor-performing countries in governance have low labour productivity. The emphasis on labour productivity in this work is explained within the context of sub-Saharan Africa, by the fact that a very large proportion of the active population is found in agriculture and the informal service sector where productivity and income are low, and there is a high degree of vulnerability to work (Szirmai et al., 2013). The region has the highest vulnerable employment rate in the world, at around 66% (ILO, 2018). According to World Bank data, in 2018, 60% of the unemployed in Africa are young. Moreover, even when they are employed, the majority are in the informal sector, where productivity is generally low. In its latest employment report, the ILO (2018) reports that 94.9% of people aged 15–24 on the continent work in the informal economy. In Africa, about 60% of jobs are considered precarious. Less than 1% of the unemployed receive unemployment benefits, and only 19% of the sub-Saharan population is covered by social insurance. Young workers and women are disproportionately affected by this scourge. In 2015, 32.1% of working men are considered poor, compared to 35.1% of working women (UNECA et al., 2017). Manyika et al. (2012) estimates that the African continent must create 122 million jobs in 2020, with demographics implying that by 2035, the number of people seeking employment on the continent will exceed that of China or India. However, Bhalla (2007) notes that job creation alone is insufficient. More specifically, she believes that most of the poor in developing countries are employed, but despite this they remain poor. She stresses that, in order to reduce poverty, to achieve a certain degree of inclusiveness, it is necessary to improve the productivity of existing jobs (with a view to making them more productive) and to create new productive jobs. If people are productive and contribute to the economic growth of their countries, then a whole society benefits. To achieve poverty reduction, then all people must have productive employment and decent work, which, if not achieved, may lead to unrest and disrupt peace. Improved productivity can lead to higher earnings for workers, better working conditions, better benefits and shorter working hours; these in turn can improve workers’ job satisfaction and motivation. Fairris (1995) suggests that appropriate policy measures and institutional changes can help improve workers’ productivity but also the quality of their working conditions. Low labour productivity may create unsatisfactory working conditions. An improvement in labour productivity growth will contribute to the creation of productive and decent jobs. The World Bank’s new report notes that the 43 countries in the world with the highest poverty rates are in fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS) and/or sub-Saharan Africa, which at the same time are characterized by weak governance and institutions (World Bank, 2020). The main objective of this study is to measure the effect of institutional quality on productivity growth. Specifically, its endeavours to identify the institutional quality indicators that contribute most to increasing labour productivityFootnote 5 in sub-Saharan Africa. To do this, we consider a panel of 31 countries over the period from 1996 to 2016. Thus, we construct an empirical model based on the stochastic frontier production function developed by Battese and Coelli (1995), to which we apply panel estimation techniques (static and dynamic), particularly with System-GMM and within estimators. Our results show that institutional quality indicators have a positive and significant influence on labour productivity. Political stability, government effectiveness and the rule of law are the indicators that contribute most to increasing labour productivity in sub-Saharan Africa. A series of robustness tests are performed to confirm our results. Specific indicators that contribute to labour productivity growth in sub-Saharan Africa are identified for the different sectors of the economy (agriculture, industry, services). The rest of the work is organized as follows: in “Institutional Quality and Labour Productivity: what the literature teaches us”, we review the literature on the relationship between institutional quality and labour productivity. “Methodology” describes the methodology used in this work. The model, data and sources and estimation techniques are presented. In “Effect of institutional quality on labour productivity in sub-Saharan Africa”, we interpret the results obtained. We end with the conclusion in “Conclusion”.",11

That is why they are described as natural disasters that are events due to natural causes, there are more than 10 deaths, or at least 100 people declared to be affected or a call to international assistance or declaration of the state of emergency (Rasmussen, 2004; Cavallo & Noy, 2009). The main factors contributing to the increase of natural disasters are, for example, population and urban pressure Mohleji and Pielke (2014), Hoeppe (2016). Natural disasters have a negative impact on economic conditions. On the one hand, losses of tax revenue and requests for relief assistance and reconstruction are putting enormous fiscal pressure on governments. On the other hand, disasters increase governments’ budget deficits Nadia et al. (2018). In addition to having undesirable effects on production, natural disasters represent a major obstacle to economic growth. At the same time, catastrophic events pose a significant risk to the health and are changing the way in which we consider the protection of vulnerable populations. The effects on human health will not be felt on the worldwide. Populations in developing countries, including those in small island states, arid or high mountain areas, and densely populated coastal areas are considered particularly vulnerable. Disasters can lead to increased health costs. Ultimately, it is important to emphasize that natural disasters will pose particularly a serious problems in some countries, probably threatening the basic needs of some populations. This study aims to determine the relationship between natural disaster, health spending, urban population, gross fixed capital formation, and GDP per capita for a sample of 10 lower middle-income countries. The data cover the period from 2000 to 2019. To do this, we propose to use recent developments in econometrics based on time series analysis. The adopted methodology is a three-step approach: unit root tests, Johansen cointegration tests, and Granger causality tests as part of Vector Error Correction Model (VECM). The following analysis is organized as follows: “Review of the Literature” presents some theoretical and empirical reviews of literature. “Data: Nature and Source” describes the data source. “Presentation of the Model” presents the methodological framework. “Empirical Results and Interpretation” discusses the empirical results. “Conclusion and Recommendations” concludes and proposes some recommendations.",3

The World Bank classified the world's economies into low-income countries (hereafter LIC), lower-middle income countries (henceforth, LMIC), upper-middle income countries (henceforth, UMIC), and high-income countries (hereafter, HIC). This paper attempts to: (i) evaluate the significance of ICT diffusion to the income groups’ process of industrialisation and economic growth: and (ii) examine the dynamic interrelationship between ICT diffusion, industrialisation and economic growth globally. To the best of our knowledge, empirical research on the ICT-industrialisation-growth nexus in the literature for the four income groups of countries are very scanty. The few studies that have examined industrialisation-growth nexus in the literature include those of Wells and Thirlwall (2003) and Opoku and Yan (2019). However, these studies basically focus on African countries without capturing the impact of ICT on industrialisation and economic growth. Filling this gap in the literature is very important because ICT/digital divide can further the goals of industrialisation and harness international’s natural and human resources that are meant to stimulate sustainable growth and development (Prakash, 2019). Since the 2000s, low-, lower-middle, upper-middle and high-income group countries’ ICT/telecommunication sector has experienced relatively rapid expansion (for example, see Fig. 1). This is because according to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the governments introduced policies to reform the sector. Some of these policies include new competitors/foreign investment in the sector, public–private partnership, privatization of state-owned enterprises and market liberalization. Over the past two decades, investment in the ICT/telecommunication sector and demand for ICT services (such as the internet, mobile phone, fixed-line services, etc.) have increased rapidly across the globe (ITU, 2016, 2019). But despite the expansion experienced in the ICT sector, the question that remains unanswered in the literature is the role that it has played in contributing to the levels of industrialisation in the four income groups of countries. Investigating the questions raised in this study is important because the industrial/manufacturing sector is identified in the literature as one of the key engines of economic growth in an economy (Kaldor, 1966, 1967). This assertion has been proven in East Asian countries because the industrial/manufacturing sector placed the region on a high path of economic growth that earned them the popular name, “the Asian Tigers”. The need to attain industrialisation for sustainable and inclusive economic growth for the four income groups of countries has become non-negotiable because industrialisation is an impetus for expanding export, higher productivity, learning and innovation, job creation and accessing capital (Szirmai & Verspagen, 2015; Necmi, 1999; Page, 2011; Chen, 1996). For example, the need to attain industrial development has become of such importance that international organisations such as the World Bank, United Nations (UN), African Development Bank (ADB), African Union (AU) and the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) have put policies and initiatives in place to stimulate growth and eliminate poverty through industrialisation in different countries and regions. (A) Manufacturing value-added as a percentage share of GDP for the four income groups of countries, 2000–2018. (B) Real gross domestic product for the four income groups of countries, 2000–2018. (C) ICT infrastructure for the four income groups of countries, 2000–2018 The relative growth patterns experienced in the income group of countries (see Fig. 1b) over the years has drawn the attention of both researchers and policymakers into the factors responsible for the growth trajectory. Thus, scholars have examined the impact of international trade, tourism, foreign direct investment, transport and financial development on growth, with mixed findings (inter alia: Adams, 2009; Zahonogo, 2016; Gui-Diby, 2014; Akinlo, 2004; Adams & Opoku, 2015; Sakyi et al., 2015). In the literature, however, the role that ICT plays in promoting sustainable industrialisation and inclusive growth, and in stimulating economic growth in low-, lower-middle, upper-middle and high-income group countries has suffered rigorous empirical investigation. A careful examination of the impact of ICT diffusion on industrialisation is important because according to Prakash (2019), “industrialisation supported by ICT could be a chosen pathway for regional growth/development, and the integration into global markets for goods and services”. Hence, to promote industrialisation and economic growth, the role that ICT would play is essential and widely recognised in the economy (Lerner, 2010). Given that low-, lower-middle, upper-middle and high-income countries could leverage ICT infrastructure to further their goals of industrialisation, and that industrialisation could serve as augmenter and mediator of both the agricultural and services; does the recent growth in the ICT infrastructure promote industrialisation and economic growth in the four income groups of countries? This research question deserves rigorous empirical investigation for major policy direction. Based on the above discussion, this study focuses on addressing crucial research questions which include the following: (1) are the income groups of the countries able to make significant progress in their efforts to industrialize and increase levels of growth by improving the quality of their ICT, essentially those of telecommunications? (2) Can ICT diffusion, industrialisation and economic growth exhibit a causal relationship? (3) does a long-run equilibrium relationship exist between ICT diffusion, industrialisation and economic growth in all the income groups of the countries? To what magnitude can future disparities in industrialisation and economic growth be explained by ICT diffusion? Furthermore, this study contributes to existing empirical literature in two ways. First, it estimates the three-way linkages between ICT diffusion, industrialisation and economic growth by employing a panel data from 171 countries, divided into the aforementioned income groups. We divided our panel data into four income groups for the following reasons: (1) given that we had a relatively rich dataset that included 171 countries, this allowed us to test how well each income group was performing; (2) we could explore the element of homogeneity within the context of examining the nexus between ICT diffusion, industrialisation and growth, since countries within the same income group sometimes share more similar political, social and economic or socioeconomic features; (3) we could compare the ICT-industrialisation-growth experiences of the income groups and then recommend appropriate policies that were best suited to each of them. Consequently, we could examine the important issue of whether one size in an income group does in fact fit all with regard to the causality between ICT, industrialisation and growth. Second, this study applied the newly proposed panel VAR model in a generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation technique which takes into account the endogeneity problem when compared to the traditional panel VAR estimation method (Abrigo & Love, 2016). The remainder of the paper follows this order: “Recent Overview and Patterns in ICT, Industrialisation and Economic Growth Across the Income Group of Countries” section presents recent overview and patterns in ICT, industrialisation and growth for the regions; “Literature Review” section presents the theoretical and empirical literature; “Methodology and Data” section presents the study’s methodology; “Empirical Results and Discussion” section presents the empirical results and discussion, while “Conclusion and Policy Recommendations” section presents the conclusion and policy recommendations.",18

It may contribute to the fulfillment of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations (Glass & Newig, 2019). In that regard, information and communication technologies (ICTs) to support governance strategies remains an important driving force for realizing this transition, particularly in the context of international market pressures and global competition. It presents incredible opportunities to innovate, strengthen, and improve the ways of working and creates plenty of advantages. However, the greatest rise of digitalization in history will not truly revolutionary until it benefits everyone in every part of the world (World Development Report: WDR, 2016). In order to seek the economic, social, and environmental needs sustainability, it is necessary to establish both good governance and electronic government (e-government) strategies by identifying the mechanisms, processes, and outcomes (Dhaoui, 2019a). Digitalization has underpinned every aspect of our daily life. Digital technologies—the internet, mobile phones, and all the other tools to collect, store, analyze, and share information digitally—have spread quickly, and we find ourselves in the midst of the greatest information and communications revolution in human history (WDR, 2016). The COVID-19 pandemic which forces social distancing and quarantine measures lockdowns has renewed and accelerated the role of digital government both in its conventional delivery of digital services as well as new innovative efforts in managing the crisis. Digital solutions have become vital to address isolation and keep people informed and engaged (UN, 2020). ICTs have influenced how firm operate and how people seek opportunities. Also, they have helped countries to increase growth and improve public service delivery.Footnote 1 More importantly, ICTs have enabled countries to develop e-government initiatives that have changed how citizens interact with their governments, creating an important development in their expectations (Dodd, 2000). To be inclusive, the benefits from using new technologies—digital dividends—should be widely shared among all stakeholders (WDR, 2016). Over the past decades, developing countries have made efforts to leverage ICTs as drivers of efficiency gains and enhance public sector performance.Footnote 2 While governments intend to achieve the objectives of sustainable development at various level (economic, social environmental, and so on) through the working system of the economy mainly through the development of institutions, there is further opportunities and contention also that government strategies may result into inefficiency, all depend on the reform success and the advances in accountability (Hauner & Kyobe, 2010). With the spread of ICTs, capable and accountable institutions are becoming more important. As adopting new technologies raise productivity, the competitive pressure increases. This emphasizes the critical role of a country’s business climate. It includes a suitable regulatory framework, i.e., good governance, which can reduce market distortions while building effective competition enforcement. In countries where fundamentals such as regulatory framework, institutions, and skills are weak, it becomes difficult that ICTs can boost productivity or reduce inequality (WDR, 2016). Thus, countries are obliged to reduce the gap between changing technology and unchanging institution. In the meantime, as technology progresses some skills become obsolete. Workers, entrepreneurs, and public servants must acquire and upgrade new skills that help them become more productive and to seize opportunities in the digital world, i.e., adapting their skills to the demands of the new economy (WDR, 2016). Despite all these debates, the arguments of whether the electronic government and good governance contribute positively to various aspects of sustainable development have become an accepted premise in most economies world over. To achieve broader policy objectives, developing countries have made efforts to leverage ICTs over the past decade and Middle East and North Africa (MENA) countries do not escape this pattern. However, digital government efforts in the region are still perceived as technical support activities and not as a core strategic component of public sector activities (OECD, 2017). The alternative would be that e-government should be value-driven instead of technology-driven. This paper analyses whether electronic government is a catalyst for boosting the impact of good governance and more importantly its impact on sustainable development in MENA countries. The paper also examines the impact of good government on the sustainable development. Thus, this paper attempts to answer the following three research questions: 1. What are the impacts of electronic government on good governance in MENA countries? 2. What are the impacts of good governance, i.e., good institutions, on the sustainable development in the region? 3. Does electronic government improvements accelerate the impacts on various aspects of sustainable development of MENA countries, i.e., whether the dividends from digital technologies are realized and the benefits are widely shared? The primary concern of the present paper is to obtain empirical evidence and to increase the level of awareness in relation to electronic government and good governance and their contribution to sustainable development in a sample of 15 MENA countries over the period span 2003–2018. The specific objectives are threefold: first to assess the effect of e-government on good governance and sustainable development in MENA countries; second to identify key success factors which make the difference in e-government development among MENA countries, and third to suggest relevant policy recommendations on e-government for sustainable development in MENA countries. The paper utilizes comparative analysis and advanced econometric measures such as ordinary least square, fixed effects, and random effects models to answer the three questions and accomplish its objectives. The empirical results from this investigation may be useful as fellows. First, they offer an assessment for electronic government and good governance and their impacts on economic, social, and environmental development. Second, empirical findings bring attention with regard to the importance of ICT improvements towards accelerating the impacts of good governance on sustainable development. Following the introductory motive, the remainder of this paper is set out as follows. “Insight from Literature Review” section discusses the literature review focusing on electronic governance, good governance efficiency, and sustainable development relationships. Data and methodology which are used by this paper to answer the three stated research questions and fulfill the intended objectives are presented in “Data and Methodology” section. While “Empirical Results” section deals with empirical results; “Conclusion and Policy Recommendations” section offers conclusion and policy implications.",17

Herrera,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Developing a strategy for intellectual property is a costly and time-consuming task, especially for patents. Firms around the world face a trade-off between having the best commercialisation and protection strategy, and simultaneously cutting costs to maximise the net present value of their R&D ventures. However, there is a significant number of possibilities for generating those strategies that do not depend exclusively on a technological component, but also include marketing, legal, and financial facts (Fernández-Ribas, 2010; Modlin & Glenn, 2006). At the same time, patents can be used not only for protection, but also for strategic proposes; patents could generate data about competitors for whom information is restricted, determine technological paths, or find possible future allied firms or inventors around the world. The disadvantage of this perspective is that there are some industries in which patent portfolios are used widely, but others extensively use industrial secrets, trademarks, and other types of protection; patent data is not as abundant for those latter industries (Ernst, 1997b). Given that firms developing high-technology products and services are usually cost-restricted, the development of a structured strategy is a fundamental task to reduce the structuration, filing, defence, and renewal costs of patents, but at the same time, firms must understand the potential value of a patent to develop those strategies and maximise their return. Keeping in mind that patents could generate valuable data about competitor behaviour, possible alliances, and individual strategies for technological protection; it can be understood that the value of information included in patents is higher than could be expected. Similarly, for companies with high financial restrictions, the use of patent data is crucial for consolidating technological portfolios, even though collecting this information is not an easy task, considering the cost and knowledge intensity required. In this sense, this study addresses this gap, to introduce a novel methodology to determine the countries in which a patent must be filed using both technological value, and market data about protected technology. Generally, the scope of strategic patent protection is not focused only on the country of origin of the technology or inventor, but is also based on a complex range of intellectual protections worldwide. Developing those sophisticated global strategies and protection portfolios could generate disincentives, especially for small, young, and cost-restricted companies and organisations (Manning, 2007; Storz, 2011). In this regard, it is worth noting the case of firms developing cutting-edge technologies. Those firms could be even more cost-restricted given the high uncertainty of future revenues, or the inexistence of a mature market for those technologies; an example of such organisations could be universities or high-tech firms performing fundamental research (Fernández-Ribas, 2010; Storz, 2011). A well-defined international patent filing strategy could increase the value of technologies. Several studies note that the international coverage of patent protection increases the value of the technologies when backed up by patents. If a firm perceives its technologies can get high cash flows in different markets, nations in which it will protect the patent will be broad. Thus, a well-structured national phase might affect technologies' market value (Ernst & Omland, 2011; Fabry et al., 2006a, b; Guellec & van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie, 2000; Kabore & Park, 2019; Lanjouw et al., 1998). However, firms will confront several restrictions to pursue a worldwide filing strategy. Restrictions arise given the high complexity of the process surrounding the filing of patents local and global. There are different routes to develop the patent process; however, the simplest method of protection, known as the Paris convention strategy, begins with a national filing in the applicant’s country of origin (Modlin & Glenn, 2006). After that, during the next 12 months, the applicant can start the process in other countries through a direct application. This last part of this strategy is the national phase process. Another valid strategy is the use of the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) that allows having more time for the validation and definition of patent countries to file the applications. The PCT process includes the following stages: filing, international search, international publication, supplementary international search (optional), international preliminary examination (optional), and national phases process (WIPO, 2010). Then, the Paris and PCT strategies both have as one of their steps, the decision of countries in which the protection will be requested; this is the national phase process. However, even when it is well known that selecting those countries is vital to generate an improved scope of protection, there is not much research on the methodologies used by companies to select those countries in the national phase of protection. This research contributes to filling that gap through a methodology focused on the definition of countries in the national phase of patent strategies. The proposed methodology uses both patent valuation and market research data. Given that might also be applicable to different patents, we have selected a biotechnology patent to describe the process. The paper is divided into five parts—first, the literature background about methods to identify patent application countries. Second, the research methodology is presented. First, this methodology includes patent valuation through patent analysis (novelty analysis, inventive steps, and industrial applicability), and secondly, market research (commercial and technical analysis). The proposed methodology results are presented as a case study for a biotechnology patent in the following section. The paper ends with a discussion and conclusions.",5

John Stuart Mill, Knowledge and the ‘East-West’ Distinction",September 2022,Manolis Manioudis,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"As is well known, the issue of smart growth refers to the conjunction between ecology and innovation which could lead to a different paradigm of economic development in both micro, meso and macro terms, namely among individuals (micro perspective), groups and organisations (meso perspective) and national systems (macro perspective). Smart growth appeared in October 2000 and gained a rapid ascent across developed countries (Warner, 2006, 169). In reality, smart growth provides the theoretical framework for delineating development decisions to the above-mentioned levels of analysis (Durand et al., 2011). Thus, smart growth is one of the priorities of the European Union member states since 2010 (Mlynarzewska-Borowiec, 2020). As Downs (2005, 367) acutely observes, smart growth was developed ‘as a reaction to what many planners believed were undesirable features of continuing growth through “suburban sprawl”’. During the last two decades smart growth is crystallised in state policies, and strategies, which promote the twin (green and digital) transformation of companies, organisations and economies. In the respective literature smart growth and sustainable development are presented as interconnected notions (Alexander & Tomalty, 2002). This is why smart growth is associated with an array ‘of very different policies, not all of which are necessarily compatible’ (Ye et al., 2005). It is indicative that smart growth is embedded, either directly or indirectly, in international economic organizations’ policy papers such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). These organisations promote the view that environmental (and social) protection and digitalization should be regarded as accelerators of sustainable economic development. However, it is increasingly obvious that environmental organisations, government agencies, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and interest groups define smart growth in their own way attempting to promote their own specific goals. Thus, smart growth does not mean the same thing to everyone. The end result of this process is contradictory in many ways so as to misrepresent the need to achieve an economic sustainable path in macro (regional/national/international-level) terms. In addition, smart growth is not an easily measured notion and thus cannot be evaluated in simple quantitative terms (Talen, 2003). For instance, smart growth policies reduce economic and social exclusion and promote inclusive economic development (Begg, 2010). Thus, the qualitative dimension of the smart growth is crucial and is tightly associated with knowledge inasmuch as knowledge is growth. Knowledge is regarded as the most valuable intangible asset at present (de la Vega Hernandez & de Paula, 2020). The smart growth construction could be better defined into the perspective of a global knowledge society. Following Warner (2006), we may suppose that smart growth principles and policies could lead, through knowledge networks, to a sustainable path of economic development. As Freilich and Popowitz (2010, 23) point out, the goal is to ‘establish a pattern of smart and sustainable development with a more unified, strategic approach toward reducing environmental impacts’. Smart growth is tightly associated with new urbanism, green development and renewable energy (p. 37). The aim of this paper is ambitious: to delineate the theoretical roots of the smart growth notion by putting it into the perspective of the history of economic thought and illustrate the qualitative tenets of the notion and its direct connection with the distribution of knowledge. The European Union’s smart growth strategy, which is crystallised in specific objectives (improving the quality and distribution of human capital, lowering the rate of school’s early leavers etc.), illustrates the way through which J.S. Mill understands sustainable economic development. J.S. Mill’s political economy could provide the theoretical and historical framework to understand the essence of a smart and green development paradigm. The epistemic roots of smart growth are crystallised in classical political economy texts. Both Adam Smith, and David Ricardo, stressed the role of innovation in activating and accelerating the absolute and comparative advantages of nations (Kurz, 2013). However, neither Smith nor Ricardo was caught up with the environmental effects of the course of economic development. The classical economist who pinpointed the crucial role of diffusing, and harnessing, knowledge in promoting economic, social and even ecological sustainable development was John Stuart Mill. For J.S. Mill, knowledge, which is dialectically associated with innovation and technical change, is the prime mover of socio-economic development. In the Millian political economy the advancement of knowledge, which is crystallised in society’s human capital, is the modus operandi of social progress. The liaisons between smart growth and J.S. Mill’s political economy are more than obvious. According to the relevant literature, smart growth is associated with the increasing role of education, knowledge, Research and Development (R&D), information services and innovation (Balcerowicz & Rzonca, 2015). J.S. Mill, by stressing the crucial role of the diffusion of knowledge, provides the framework to understand the emergence of smart growth theoretical construction. The relevant literature evidences the link between smart growth and knowledge. For instance, as Carayannis et al. (2017, 153) note ‘the smart specialization strategy adopted by the EU’ is tightly associated with the dissemination of knowledge. More specifically, as a classical political economist, J.S. Mill adopted a stage view of economic development believing that advancement is not simply material but is connected with the moral and intellectual progress and is typified linearly through the transition from hunting to pastoral societies and from agricultural to commercial-industrial ones (Meramveliotakis & Manioudis, 2021). J.S. Mill believed that the real motor of this transition is the transfer, and the subsequent harnessing, of knowledge among people and social groups. As such, according to his political economy, knowledge plays a pivotal role in directing and driving societal growth. On the other side, in many respects, he anticipates the notion of smart growth as his theory of economic development is directly connected with the intellectual and moral progress being associated with the perspective of sustainable economic development. More specifically, technical change, which is related to man’s control on nature, is promoted manus in mani with intellectual progress and social justice. For J.S. Mill, technical progress is ecologically sustainable (and socially fair) as the diffusion of knowledge could activate an alternative type of economic development, which is seated on demographic control and the sustainable use of natural sources. In J.S. Mill’s, political economy the human and natural capital, which consist ‘core’ tenets of smart growth, are considered as prerequisites of sustainable economic development. As Schumpeter observes (1954, 518) J.S. Mill, through his classic Principles of Political Economy (1848), is offering to us a colorful and dynamic picture of economic development which includes environmental, racial, class and even cultural elements. In sketching out this picture J.S. Mill justifies how knowledge is transformed into a catalyst of sustainable economic development. In his view, the differences in growth rates between regions in the mid-nineteenth century—such as North vs South or East vs West—are activated due to the differences in harnessing knowledge. Naturally therefore, according to his analysis, the differences in the diffusion and utilization of knowledge reflect different growth levels. For him (macro) economic development is sustainable and implies low profitability, cultural development, moral progress, social ecology and environmental protection. More specifically, in his analysis, the course of long-term economic development is crystallised in the notion of the ‘Stationary State’ which, in his heretic political economy, is tightly associated with the falling rate of profit, the diffusion of knowledge among people and the avoidance of the Malthusian trap, which is the result of population growth (Malthus, 1826). Evidently therefore, population’s control, which is achieved through knowledge’s diffusion, could lead to a balanced utilization of natural resources. The aim of this paper is to illustrate why J.S. Mill’s political economy provides the theoretical and historical framework for the understanding of the notion of smart growth, by pinpointing its direct relation to social, cultural and political development. As such, the notion of smart growth is put into the perspective of the history of economic thought by paying particular attention to J.S. Mill’s economic and social theory. This is done through two autonomous and interrelated sections. More specifically, in the second section, we propose how J.S. Mill provided the link between economic development and human progress, which is tightly associated with the implementation of smart growth policies. In the third section, we present J.S. Mill’s ideas on how knowledge is diffused and harnessed among societies by illustrating his sociological view of economic development. This is achieved by paying particular attention in the political economy of the Stationary State which is a stage of economic development that anticipates the ‘core tenets’ of smart growth. It is in this section we point out that Mill’s ideas help us to understand the differences among nations as being originated in the unequal diffusion of knowledge. In the final section we summarise our findings.",2

Evidence from the Czech Republic,September 2022,Oleg Sidorkin,Martin Srholec,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The justification of public support for business R&D has become highly debated in academic literature as well as in policy circles (Cunningham et al., 2012). As governments increasingly take an active part in financing business R&D activity, it is imperative to understand how effective such subsidies are and whether they achieve their goals. Policy makers and taxpayers are rightfully concerned that public funds are used to support R&D projects that firms would carry out anyway, hence that the additionality effect is low (David et al., 2000; Klette et al., 2000). Addressing these concerns is important for policy credibility, policy learning and maximizing the desired social impacts. Nevertheless, the additionally question is seldom cited by the government before a business R&D subsidy scheme is put in place and typically comes up only during ex-post evaluation of the programme. Far more often these subsidy schemes are in the sphere of practical policy-making justified on the overarching grounds of promoting competitiveness and growth. Less often the government explains what it really means. What are the underlying mechanisms that lead from more business R&D to increasing competitiveness and ultimately economic growth? Whose competitiveness is at stake, the whole economy or individual firms? What does competitiveness mean in this context in the first place? For this argument to work, especially in small and open economies, this means export-driven growth, thus international competitiveness (Fagerberg, 1996). The term competitiveness then becomes linked to what has been dubbed the external constraint given by the demand conditions of country’s exports in the post-Keynesian growth models (Kaldor, 1978; Thirlwall, 1979), and technological factors in the neo-Schumpeterian tradition (Fagerberg, 1988).Footnote 1 With this in mind, the main beneficial impact of the additional business R&D is to push specialisation of the economy away from declining towards expanding segments of the global markets and to compete more on technology than prices. This perspective, it should be noted, differs from mainstream theory, according to which the beneficial effects of changes in specialisation would be transitory, and not matter for long-run growth. After all, subsidising R&D just to provide that particular firm competitive advantage over its unsubsidised competitor on the domestic market would be hardly justifiable and could even end up fostering local oligopolistic market structures at the expense of fair competition with undesirable social outcomes. Hence, the success of the programmes should be judged on whether they stimulated the generation of new knowledge at the global technological frontier, which can meet the test of competition at advanced foreign markets and which in turn is of higher economic value than inventions of local relevance. In short, promoting competitiveness in this context implies making a breakthrough with the new technology abroad. As shown in the surveys by Cunningham et al. (2012); Zúñiga-Vicente et al. (2014) and Testa et al. (2019), there are dozens of estimates of the additionality effects of business R&D subsidies in the literature, but there has been surprisingly little research on whether the stimulated output is new in the local context only or provides a base for success abroad. Guo et al. (2016) is a rare example of a study that considered the effects of R&D subsidies on exports. The prime reason for this gap is probably that microdata on the degree on novelty of R&D outputs and/or on exports, not mentioning on the structure of firms’ exports by product groups, is difficult to obtain and even more challenging to merge with other data that is necessary for estimating the additionality effects. One feasible way to link up this literature to the debate on international competitiveness, however, is to rely on the distinction between aspiring to domestic only versus international intellectual property (IP) protection, for which relevant data is widely accessible.Footnote 2 To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to address this gap in the literature with the help of patent data. The paper examines output additionality effects of two major public R&D subsidy programmes IMPULS and TIP administered by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic (MIT), the combined budget of which was nearly 18 billion CZK over the period 2004–2016, and both of which highlighted promoting competitiveness as their main goal (MIT, 2003, 2009). Using a non-parametric propensity score matching estimator on a large firm-level database combined from PATSTAT (EPO, 2016a), Amadeus (Bureau Van Dijk, 2016) and ISVaV (Office of the Government of the Czech Republic, 2016), we compare to which extent the program participants developed applications for IP protection domestically and at the main patent offices in the world that would not have been made without the subsidy. The main finding is that there is some support for the fact that the subsidies stimulated firms to apply for IP protection at home but did not make a difference to the firms’ propensity to aim for IP protection abroad. From this follows that the additionality effects hold only for R&D outputs that are relevant domestically but not sufficiently novel to warrant protection in major foreign markets, in which new frontier knowledge is generally required to succeed. Since the subsidies were primarily justified on the grounds of boosting competitiveness and growth, in this regard, the programmes have fallen short of expectations. The results raise a number of questions on how subsidy programmes of this kind are justified and evaluated, which are of great importance for evidence-based decision making in public policy. In the meantime, however, evidence on the impact of R&D subsidies remains surprisingly scant in the Czech Republic. Using NUTS3 data for 13 Czech regions, Klímová et al. (2020) reported positive correlation of the amount of R&D support with business R&D expenditures, employment and the number of workplaces. Ratinger et al. (2020) examined effects of the TIP programme and detected with the help of a matching procedure positive effects of R&D subsidies on economic performance of small and medium firms but not large firms. More research based on large and rich micro datasets is clearly needed to improve our understanding of the impacts of public R&D programmes in the local context.",3
13.0,3.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,20 June 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00804-y,The Role of Universities in Social Innovation Within Quadruple/Quintuple Helix Model: Practical Implications from Polish Experience,September 2022,Joanna Morawska-Jancelewicz,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The present global challenges, exemplified in the United Nations Development Program ‘Sustainable Development Goals’, affect regional innovation systems that need to develop new approaches, new forms of collective actions between public and private stakeholders, as well as new solutions with the aim to address social challenges through innovation. Those challenges cannot be simply addressed from a unilateral perspective, and social innovation is recognised as an important component of this new framework. Thus, there is a need to find ways to foster innovation which generates social and public value (OECD, 2011). The COVID-19 crisis has pushed organisations, including universities, to test new ways of stimulating social innovation. The recently discussed concept of Society 5.0 and Industry 5.0 (Carayannis et al., 2021; Carayannis et al., 2020) highlights the need to re-think existing working methods and approaches toward innovation and to focus them on developing human-oriented solutions and social innovation. Undoubtedly, innovation policy must be confronted with the pressure of ongoing changes, what Edquist called broad-based innovation (2009), that encompasses new forms of innovation like open innovation (Chesbrough, 2003), lead user innovation (Hippel, 2005), user-oriented innovation (Arnkil et al., 2010), and social innovation (Adams & Hess, 2010; Klein, 2017; Mulgan, 2007, 2010; Moulaert, 2009; Murray et al., 2010). They are based on the active role of citizens and civil society organisations in the innovation process. This has a direct impact on innovation systems that have become not linear, network-based, and deeply rooted in a regional context (McAdam et al., 2016). Sources of innovation are no longer restricted to interactions between university-industry government in the traditional triple helix model of innovation (Etzkovitz & Leydesdorff, 1997). They become more heterogenous and socially distributed. The quadruple helix/quintuple helix model (QHM) expands the triple helix by adding the fourth dimension, that is civil society and the environment (Arnkil et al., 2010; Carayannis & Campbell, 2012; Carayannis & Grigoroudis, 2016; Carayannis & Rakhmatullin, 2014). Civil society is understood as ‘non-governmental organisations, as well as more or less formal associations and communities of interest and practice including engaging citizens as lead-users, co-developers and co-creators of innovative and entrepreneurial initiatives’ (Carayannis et al., 2019). This model relies on the understanding that additional perspectives must be added to comprehend innovation in the unfolding twenty-first century. This concept allows to integrate in the system a bottom-up approach (complementing the top-down policies and practices) and form a more inclusive, democratic system based on a dialogue and reflecting also values of the society. ‘In fact, democracy frames and changes our conditions of innovation’ (Cavallini et al., 2016, p. 14). A new approach is necessary to solve problems where social and technological progress co-evolves in order to generate social value. In this new paradigm, the importance of knowledge is not determined exclusively by competitiveness and productivity, but by taking into account the creation of social well-being, the impact on the quality of life and co-creation of knowledge as part of public–private partnerships. The existence of a well-developed network in a given territory makes it possible to combine and strengthen the actions of all entities (actors), which influences, as a result, the acquisition of a collective skill conducive to innovation processes. As Trencher et al. indicate (2013, p. 40), ‘the global transition to a sustainable society will ultimately be the sum of a decentralised transformation carried out by countless individual communities and regions across the planet that could significantly contribute to a local or regional transition to sustainability’. This represents a shift from the idea of merely contributing to economic and societal development via technology transfer and entrepreneurialism, to collaborating with diverse external actors to create societal transformations in view of materialising sustainable development. Existing global challenges and rapid technological progress make functioning in today’s world increasingly complex and complicated, and have led to growing expectations towards universities and their roles in modern ecosystems. Responding to sustainability challenges requires not only trans- and multi-disciplinary approaches but also high level of engagement of social and human capital. Social dimension of innovation is growing and results therefore from occurring social and economic changes for which new solutions are being sought. Today, universities are expected to fulfil manifold and increasingly challenging roles. Finding balance between participation in solving global issues and their local contexts is one of the challenges for the academic environment today. Different approaches and models are investigated that reflect those new university roles. They rely on the multi-stakeholder initiatives. As Dentoni and Bitzer argue (2014), they can be seen as a response to the increasing urgency of many wicked problems that call for transdisciplinary responses and collective actions. It is generally recognised that if universities wish to actively contribute to sustainability they need to go beyond their traditional functions of education, research and community outreach and to integrate social innovation in their core and new missions (Bayuno et al., 2020). A renewed EU Agenda for Higher Education (2017) emphasise ‘HEIs should be engaged in the development of their cities and regions, whether through contributing to development strategies, cooperation with businesses, the public and voluntary sectors or supporting public dialogue about societal issues. Outreach beyond the academic community in local languages should be incentivised and rewarded, including as part of career development’. Social innovation is well conceptualised and developed in literature, but less attention is given to universities as agents of change. The focus is put rather on civil society organisations or social entrepreneurs rather than research organisations and universities. As Bayuno et al. argue (2020, p. 2), ‘relatively few studies address issues related to institutional change and incentive structures that influences the ability of universities to engage in social innovation’. This argument is also in line with what Benneworth et al. (2020, p. 32): ‘although universities have a huge potential to contribute their knowledge and other assets to social innovation, a recent inventory of social innovation in Europe highlighted how underdeveloped and one-dimensional these contributions were’. This is first knowledge gap I aim to address in this paper by proposing of socially engaged university model focused on social innovation and universities internal dynamics and their core missions. However, the external dynamics should also be investigated given that the new paradigm of knowledge democratisation is build upon the cooperation with non-academic actors. Surely, ‘universities are complicated mixtures of different communities with changing power and specific relations with external actors’ (Arocena & Stutz, 2021, p. 4). Those new types of relations are reflected in QHM and ‘only few contributions have explored the connection between the social innovation concept and the QHM framework’ (Bellandi et al., 2021, p. 8). In this paper, I try to address this gap and argue that, apart from differences between universities (in terms of their history, relevance, missions, profile, research and education strategies, funding, etc.), their embeddedness in regional ecosystem of innovation is one of key dimensions that can influence their engagement in social innovation. I also argue in this paper that social innovation should be extended to all the missions and I try to overcome the dominating narrative in literature that concentrate on discussing this concept only through the third mission/community engagement concept. Still I acknowledge after Bayuno et al. (2020, p. 8) ‘that further research on how universities can benefit directly from social innovations teaching and research may entice universities to commit adequate resources to it’. Since the connection between QHM and social innovation is still in infancy (Bellandi et al., 2021, p. 5) I try to approach this concern through a case study of Polish public universities experience and by this I try to address the contribution of universities to social innovation. The literature analysis on the role of Polish universities in the process of social innovation pointed to a small number of empirical studies and relatively poor theoretical and source material covering this sphere of Polish universities activity. In fact, only one comprehensive work was available at the commencement of this study (Baran, 2016) that addressed the engagement of Central European universities (including Polish universities) in matters of social innovation. I refer to this work in a discussion and conclusions. This paper, however, attempts not only to analyse the existing experience, policies and practices of Polish universities in social innovation but also to address the need for more systemic approach resulting from the ongoing dynamic innovation processes. It tries to embed the social innovation in a broader context of new roles of universities in quadruple helix. My research focuses not only on internal dimensions of engaging in social innovation by universities but it addresses the ongoing global debate on the social and sustainable challenges and the responding new cooperative models in innovation systems. The main purpose of this article is to contribute to university policy and practice in implementing social innovation in a collaborative process. Specific research questions are the following: (1) What conditions must be met for universities to systematically support and/or generate social innovation? (2) What measures should universities take to stimulate and strengthen their functions within the QHM, i.e. a modern regional innovation system allowing for an active role of civil society organisations? (3) What are the key features of the socially engaged university model that contributes to social innovation in a systemic way? To address these questions, I conducted an empirical study based on a sample of 63 Polish public universities. As far as the practical aim is concerned, the paper proposes a model structure of a socially responsible and socially engaged university within QHM focusing on social innovation but extending far beyond and contributing to the development of the strategic approach to universities’ social missions and impacts in modern economies and societies. The starting point for these considerations is the assumption that. 
if universities want to build an effective system of cooperation with the social and business environment, they should create proper structures and mechanisms supporting the development and implementation of social innovations in a region, thus contributing to the practical application of university social responsibility.
 The organisation of the paper is designed in the following way. The theoretical part (section ‘Modern Processes of Innovation’, ‘The Growing Importance of Social Innovation’, ‘New Approaches to Universities Missions and Their Role in Social Innovation’) refers to the results obtained from the literature review on modern theories of regional growth, regional innovation systems, social innovation dimensions and definitions of social innovation. It also explains the specificity of university activity in the context of cooperation with its stakeholders and identifies the main directions of the development of the so-called third and fourth mission of universities and the role they play in regional and local networks of knowledge. Apart from scientific papers, the results of the chosen projects (e.g. IMPACT, SIC Europe, SI-DRIVE, TEPSI), as well as reports prepared by national and foreign organisations (NESTA, The Young Foundation, OECD, the European Commission), were an inspiration for this paper. They cover mainly the experience of Europe and North America. The empirical part (section ‘Research on the Potential of Polish Universities Regarding the Implementation of Social Innovations’, ‘Summary of Research Results’) concerns the conducted analysis of the use of the potential of Polish universities regarding the implementation of social innovations and contains an attempt to determine factors influencing their growth. I propose the conception of a model of a socially engaged university, the activity of which contributes to supporting the regional innovation system and to creating and implementing social innovations. The research results and the conclusions drawn therefrom may add value to the ongoing scientific discourse on the development of social innovation by universities and their importance for the innovative growth of regions within QHM.",24

The development of employees’ skills is the responsibility of human resources that must moderate several shortages, such as knowledge gaps (Hurd, 2005). HRM practices such as training and development influence KM processes and pre-knowledge management behaviors (Jimenez-Jimenez & Sanz-Valle, 2013), like the motivation to share knowledge (Gagné et al., 2019). The literature shows the relevancy of turning tacit knowledge into explicit knowledge and integrating it with conceptual knowledge and practical experience to support human resource development (HRD) (Slotte et al., 2004). Thus, there is a nexus between HRM and HRD (attracting and recruiting, motivating and retaining, and deploying) and KM (Horwitz et al., 2003), yet there is no study that addresses how KM contributes to HRD. Therefore, we want to fill that gap by exploring a conjoint review of both literatures. Thus, this research’s aim is to analyze the body of empirical literature (Post et al., 2020) that reports on this phenomenon at the organizational level in order to gather evidence to show that KM contributes to HRD. This way we will be able to answer our research question: how does KM contribute to HRD in organizational contexts? We answer this question through the analysis of the scientific empirical literature that was published between 2000 and 2019 on the two topics. With this research we aim to solve the scientific problem of uncovering the different ways that KM process contribute to HRD. By developing a literature review, we aim to gather evidence for the theory that KM contributes to HRD (Hardy & Clegg, 1997). Additionally, we offer a taxonomy that shows that the dimensions of HRD receive contributions from KM processes. Therefore, the goal of this study is not simply to uncover the contribution of KM to HRD, but to identify its significance and consequences by gaining a new understanding of the body of literature in question (Post et al., 2020). According to Webster and Watson (2002), analyzing other studies summarizes the components of a body of literature and offers guidance that shapes future studies. Following Webster and Watson (2002), the aim of our study is to motivate future research to pursue the involved topics. In the study, we explain the review’s contributions, describe the key concepts, delineate the boundaries of the research, review the relevant literature, develop a framework to guide future research, bridge the theoretical explanations and past empirical findings, and present conclusions for researchers and managers. Thus, we provide an exemplary and creative review article. The reminder of the study is as follows: First, from a theoretical point of view, we frame the topics addressed in the study: KM and its processes, HRD and its dimensions, and the rationale that relates KM to HRD. Next, we explain the methodological options and procedures and follow them with data collection, analysis, and discussion. Finally, we present the study’s conclusions and limitations as well as suggestions for future research.",6

Sustainable development is the most cited in the recent development literature by the policy makers and academicians. Sustainable development has been defined as “Sustainable development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.”Footnote 1 Further, sustainability is the capacity to provide wellbeing to future generations, which is indicated by a comprehensive measure of inclusive wealth, covering the marketed and non-marketed assets (Arrow et al., 2012). Sustainable development is holistic concept and global objective that is to be attained by all economies. Particular, in the context of the South Asian emerging economies, sustainable development achievement is much concern for the policy makers, due to the emerging issues like climate change, unemployment, population, educations, poverty, terrorism, and economic and financial crises. Despite the above issues, South Asian countries have sustained a period of robust growth that has reduced poverty to some extent, and mage notable strides in the education and health sector. According to the World Bank reports, the growth in South Asian countries increased from 6.2 to 7.5% between 2013 and 2016 as compared to other developing countries remained flat or even turned negative. The World Bank expects that countries in South Asia will continue this growth curve and estimated at 6.3% in 2020 and 6.7% in 2021 (World Bank, 2019). Furthermore, various proxies have been used to measure the sustainable development in the empirical literature. For example, Koirala and Pradhan (2019) used Adjusted net saving is as a proxy for sustainable development. They also argued that comprehensive wealth must increase from one generation to another for economic development to be sustainable. On the other side, sustainable development has three dimensions: environmental, economic, and social. Daly (1990) suggest a framework for sustainability consist of environment, equity, and economy. The base of the proposed framework is represented by the environment as the “ultimate means” that features natural resources as a prerequisite for decent livelihood with the economy on the next rung which serves as mode to achieve a decent livelihood, and placed equity at the top as the “ultimate end” featuring wellbeing. In similar vein, policy makers and economist argued the nation sustainable development is accompanied with economic growth, financial development, and environmental management. Like Kaimuri and Kosimbei (2017) investigate the determinants of sustainable development in Kenya using annual data for Kenya for the period of 1991 to 2014. Adjusted net savings rate is used as a proxy for the sustainable development. The study find that energy efficiency and unemployment rate have a significant negative impact on sustainable development, while resource productivity, real GDP per capita, and terms of trade do not have any significant impact. Koirala and Pradhan (2019) study the factors that determine sustainable development, as proxy by adjusted net saving, in a sample of 12 Asian countries using panel data for the 1990–2014 period. The study finds significant positive effect of per capita income and financial development on a country’s sustainable development and significant negative effect of the inflation rate and the natural resources rent on sustainable development. Gnègnè (2009) observed significant positive relationship between adjusted net saving and total welfare as measured by the infant mortality rate and the human development index for 36 developing and development countries for the period of 1971 to 2000. Further, Pardi and Salleh (2015) examine the determinants of sustainable development in Malaysia. Adjusted net savings are used as proxy for sustainable development. Inflation rate, financial development, per capita income, and minerals exports are used for economic indicators. The study reports significant impact Inflation rate, financial development, and per capita income including minerals export share on the country’s sustainable development. The main purpose of the present study is to explore the nexus between the sustainable development index score, adjusted net saving,, economic growth, financial development, and CO2 emissions in the emerging South Asian economies.Footnote 2 This study utilizes the sustainable development index (SDI) as proxy for sustainable development. Therefore, the present study contributes to the existing literature in two folds. As per our best knowledge, the present study is the first empirical study that uses sustainable development index (SDI) as proxy for sustainable development and its association between the economic growth and financial development. Secondly, the present study uses panel data for the three South Asian emerging countries for the period of 1990–2020. Further, the findings of the present study will provide useful implications for the Asian countries and other emerging countries, specifically, the South Asian countries. The rest of this study is organized as follow: In “Literature Review,” we present the previous literature on the nexus between economic growth, financial sector development, CO2 emissions, and trade openness. In “Methodology,” we explore the data and econometric method employed in paper. In “Empirical Results and Discussion,” we present the empirical results of the study. Further, conclusion of the study and policy implications are discussed in “Conclusion.”",10

Beyond the Employment Destruction/Creation Effects, Technology Adoption Affects the Working Conditions of European Workers",September 2022,Malo Mofakhami,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Economic research does not directly tackle the issue of the relationship between innovation and job quality. However, as noted in the introduction, we can identify in different approaches some hypotheses that offer references and guidelines for the empirical method. Neoclassical models provide a limited framework on qualitative aspects at the employee level. The multilevel and multidimensional characteristics of job quality and the peculiar nature of innovationFootnote 4 lead us to build the study mainly on neo-institutionalist scholarship. Additionally, qualitative measures of employment and work emerge within the institutionalist approach (Green, 2006; Brown et al., 2007; Bustillo et al., 2011) and, more recently, within the economics of happiness (Clark, 2005); therefore, we have to introduce the literature review with a brief presentation of this topic’s corpus. Innovation interacts through complex mechanisms in an evolutionary perspective (Winter & Nelson, 1982). For this reason, to facilitate understanding, we have to distinguish approaches that tend to rely on job quality considered as an input of innovation from those that rely on job quality as an output. The issue of job quality is somewhat recent and, since the end of the 1990s, has become a central concern in social sciences (Brown et al., 2007; Bustillo et al., 2011; Green, 2006). At the initiative of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and the European Commission (EC) during the Laeken summit (European Commission, 2001), this issue came up through the notion of “decent work” (Guergoat-Larivière & Marchand, 2012). However, this concept of job quality encompasses many research fields; its definition is broad and variable among scholars. Some focus more explicitly on working conditions, while others focus on the employment quality or the working environment. This concept is multidimensional, and many different methodologies are used. To better identify the differences between approaches, we present some seminal studies on job quality in Table 11. (in the appendix). The job quality methodology presented here is based on a multidimensional view that allows scholars to connect with other research fields, such as education, employment policy, inequality, and, obviously, technological change. By comparison, it represents a substantial departure from the firm or employment models, where all working conditions are often synthesized to the wage rate in a principal-agent case, including compensation mechanisms (e.g. Jensen & Meckling, 1976). In our study, we follow the approach developed by Bustillo et al. (2011) and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound, 2012, 2017a), which focus mainly on jobs’ characteristics at the worker level. The seminal research of Bustillo et al. (2011) restricts the methodology to a narrower definition, focused on worker job quality and omit the institutional setting of the labour market in the definition of job quality. Their empirical framework is based on the European Working Conditions Survey (EWCS), an employee-level survey. Bustillo et al. (2011) retain five dimensions of job quality: pay, intrinsic quality of work (autonomy and skills), employment quality (contract quality and opportunities), physical constraints, working time, and work-life balance. This perspective is work experience-based, and it leaves out institutional settings of job quality, especially at the national level, that are included in most European definitions. Unlike institutionally oriented frameworks such as the seminal analysis by Davoine et al. (2008), Bustillo et al. (2011) include additional individual aspects of job quality, such as autonomy and skills or learning practices. The European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions (Eurofound) provides a similar methodology (Eurofound, 2012, 2017a). Some recent studies (Clark, 2005, 2015) have developed the concept of job satisfaction within the economics of happiness. Based on the tools of job quality, these studies seek to measure an employee level of satisfaction for a job and thus relate an objective measure of job quality to a certain level of satisfaction to make policy recommendations. This methodology is convincing since it offers a direct measure of the final goal (satisfaction).Footnote 5 However, the empirical work based on this methodology encounters difficulties such as the weak degree of comparability (across countries, times, industries but also individuals), the weak interpretability of the underlying theoretical mechanism and, consequently, its ambiguous implications for public policy (Guergoat-Larivière & Marchand, 2012). Moreover, regardless of workers’ satisfaction due to new technology adoption, objectively identifying the changes in working conditions for workers induced by new technology is central. Nevertheless, Clark (2015) recently demonstrated the benefits of articulating both perspectives, subjective and objective measures. The two provide different aspects of job experiences and should be articulated to balance one’s limits by the other.",4

Perret,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In 1992 Lundvall introduced the concept of the national innovation system (NIS) into economic literature providing a comprehensive frame of reference to analyze the innovation dynamics in economies. Following the OECD’s 1999 report on national innovation systems, regional innovation systems are the essential building blocks of any NIS. The analysis of an NIS.The analysis of an NIS is therefore inherently of a regional nature. At the core of every NIS two concepts is of central importance: The generation and the diffusion of innovations and ergo knowledge; on the one hand inside the system itself and on the other across the system’s borders. The present study picks up on the aspect of knowledge diffusion and tries to quantify it in the context of the Russian Federation (RF)Footnote 1. The RF experienced over the last two decades a transition from a Soviet centrally planned economy to a market economy; however, it is still not considered to be a fully developed knowledge society comparable to Western European economies where the terms of knowledge society or knowledge economy can be interchanged with the term NIS. In this context the Russian Federation is a very interesting subject not only because it has a much different history and recent development path than most established knowledge societies but also because it is politically as well as economically in a phase which many developed nations have long since left behind. An analysis of the RF therefore allows us to take a look at how an innovation system—or at least the knowledge transmission mechanism—in such a developing economy under such specific restrictions looks and works. It can thus be taken as an analytical template for other BRICS countries or countries at a similar level of development and comparable economic characteristics like Indonesia. This study furthermore aims at uncovering in how far the RF reports patterns of an NIS comparable to Western European standards by analyzing inventor mobility networks across the regions of the RFFootnote 2. This approach considers one aspect of the transfer of tacit knowledge across regional borders, however, flawed the approach by itself or the data source might be. Aside from inventor mobility networks, different approaches could be used to study the knowledge diffusion mechanism in a NIS. The significant advantage of the first, however, lies in the fact that flows of tacit knowledge are observed as compared to flows of codified knowledge as is the case for example with patent citations. The advantage of studying tacit knowledge flows is that a significant share of knowledge if not allFootnote 3 is tacit and cannot be codified but remains bound to its human carriers. In this context the present study complements the study of (Perret, 2015) where codified knowledge flows have been analyzed. An advantage of using inventor mobility networks as compared to star researcher networks, an alternative tool to measure tacit knowledge flows, is that the units of observation are defined via the methodology and do not have to be specified beforehand. In this context inventor mobility networks—in particular the one in this study—consider the whole population and not just a sub-sample thereof. While the study of firm relocation offers an additional alternative to inventor movements, it follows the debate on incentives for foreign direct investments and an additional quantitative analysis could only add so much to the debate as inter-regional firm locations are only in part different from international firm location. Through quantification of the inventor mobility networks into panel data, it becomes possible to identify factors that have a significant influence on the different types of inventor/knowledge flows—inventor flows can be divided into inventor inflows and inventor outflows. In its proceedings and the applied methodology, the analysis in this study is strongly influenced by the studies of (Scherngell et al., 2007), (Miguélez et al., 2010), (Barber & Scherngell, 2011), (Emons, 2012) and (Welfens, 2012) among others. The study is structured in six sections. In the following second section a structured review of key publications on the topic of inventor mobility is given underlining the need for an RF-oriented analysis of interregional inventor flows. The implemented methodology is introduced in the third section as well as related aspects taken from graph theory and social network analysis that are needed to generate and interpret networks of codified and tacit knowledge flows. The fourth section presents and analyzes the inventor mobility networks. In this regard the generated networks are linked to the underlying concept of national innovation systems. Through quantification of the two types of knowledge flows, data are generated that is used in the second part of section four to construct a model of knowledge flows and explain them through the use of key influence factors. In the fifth section the results from the conducted analyses of section 4 are critically discussed and the insights gained are measured against real developments, in particular in recent years. The study concludes with and outlook and future research options in the sixth section.",1

A large segment of guidelines for the definition of efficient and effective approaches in decision-making processes have been defined as a consequence of the diffusion and understanding of specific social and economic dynamics (Calabrese et al., 2018). Managerial, marketing, and organisational studies have started to investigate the ways in which managers can support decision-makers and organisations in gaining a better understanding of and managing the emerging complexity (Caputo & Evangelista, 2019). The term internationalisation in research fields has various definitions that can be defined as a gradual process of promoting and strengthening the actions and activities of a company abroad (Johanson & Vahlne, 1977) or as an increasing external movement in the direction of international actions by one or a group of companies (Welch & Luostarinen, 1988). The term internationalisation in most contexts usually refers to the process of increasing participation and involvement in international actions in which the company’s activities and performance in terms of explaining the strategy, determining the structure and use of resources, or developing networks of business relations in foreign markets are solely subject to adaptation to international environments (quoted by Pham, 2019). Del Giudice et al. (2017) explained that high informal institutional distance leads to a preference for non-equity-based collaborative entry mode by SMEs. They also defined that positive time trends of the host country, positive perception of size, and resource of the local partner, as well as the local partners’ power, lead to a preference of equity-based collaborative entry mode by SMEs. Research shows that companies seeking to internationalise must have a strong organisational structure in line with their foreign activities and actions. In addition, they need to gain an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the many advantages and disadvantages that may exist in different ways of entering foreign markets (Laufs & Schwens, 2014). Market characteristics, cultural understanding, and knowledge management significantly affect management behaviour, while they do not significantly affect the Internationalisation strategy. Furthermore, management behaviour significantly affects Internationalisation strategy and can mediate relationships between market characteristics, cultural understanding, and knowledge management with Internationalisation strategy (Nurcholis, 2020). Knowledge has increasingly established itself as an asset to be acquired and has valued for the achievement of a competitive, lasting and defensible advantage by companies. Knowledge management in particular is considered as one of the disciplines supporting the formulation and the implementation of successful strategies. The theme of knowledge has been the subject of countless reflections ranging from philosophy to economics (Canestrino & Magliocca, 2019). In general, the ability to become international has become a necessity and a must for many companies, which makes both the survival and growth of the company in the field of globalisation (Raymond & St-Pierre, 2011) and a knowledge-based economy possible. The multidisciplinary character and the affirmation of multiple approaches to the analysis of the processes of creation and management of knowledge have led to an effort of systematisation, which from the analysis of interpretative paradigms of knowledge and knowledge management reaches examination of the most recent conceptual elaborations on Knowledge Ecosystems (Canestrino & Magliocca, 2019). Moreover, Canestrino and Magliocca (2016) define internationalisation as transferring knowledge through Cross-Border Communities of Practice (CCoP) which is used as a way for managing knowledge in a global socio-economic environment. It is mainly referring to the rising economies and explains that with reference to both the opportunities and challenges that characterise the rising economies. CCoP arises as the best suitable way to transfer knowledge at the international level, when firms from developed countries encounter firms from emerging countries. The process of internationalisation in SMEs is based on a learning process and requires a set of capabilities (Schweizer, 2012). Its impact has also been proven as one of the most important sources of corporate growth and performance improvement in many documents in the field of international trade and business (quoted by Joensuu-Salo et al., 2018). Dell’Anno et al. (2018) believe that the phenomena of Internationalisation involve every type of organisation: private and public, for-profit, and non-profit, and large and small; therefore, international start-ups by the accumulated knowledge stemming from the relationship between knowledge and internationalisation are able to identify the main factors influencing the choice of the market on the part of the knowledge-based firms. Hence, knowledge-based entrepreneurship as a virtuous combination of knowledge and entrepreneurship enables start-ups and SMEs to boost capacities for such expansion of firms originating from innovation and that have operations suited to a widely ultra-national context. The important point is that SMEs must consider the nature of the industry in question, the risk of producing and delivering non-tradable goods and services, the nature of their support systems as a source of knowledge, and the potential impact of rapid change in an internationally competitive environment. (Quoted from Gao et al., 2019). To define SMEs in the form of family enterprises, institutions with personal and cooperative ownership, or formal and informal companies, several factors have been considered. It includes the number of employees, amount of income such as annual turnover, years of activity in the field of business, and number of branches and locations (Khaidher et al., 2019). Factors and components affecting the success of SMEs in different countries have been studied by researchers, and depending on the conditions, several indicators have been mentioned by them. In this regard, Chawla et al. (2010) in their studies have concluded that small businesses in China are influenced by factors related to marketing, competitive forces, location, industry trends and trends, location, availability capital, and experience of the owner. Innovation and information technology (IT) are critical to effective knowledge management (KM). So, that increasing the level of IT can enhance SME’s internationalisation. SMEs are able to heighten their innovation by implementing comprehensive ERP and E-CRM which leading to higher export intensity as the primary method of internationalisation (Lecerf & Omrani, 2020). Caputo et al. (2020) have recognised internationalisation as one of the more recently debated topics in the management field and explained the influence of international R&D teams on companies’ innovativeness. By examining the studies conducted in this field, we can point two factors such as the benefits of internationalisation and the conditions of the target market and the destination country and the characteristics of the industry, country of origin, convergence, and adherence factor, organisation conditions. In an effort to organise SMEs internationalisation decision-making practices, Child and Hsieh (2014) proposed four models that SMEs leaders should follow. These models range from high to low levels of planning and rationality, which include reactivity, multiplicity, limited rationality, and reasoning of real choices. This approach is the highest form of rational decision-making in Child and Hsieh (2014) model, which is defined as the ability of managers to identify, maintain, and exploit real options in the business environment in which they operate (Driouchi And Bennett, 2011). The real option is a specific type of investment (in the international arena) in something of value with uncertain achievement and feedback (for example, joint ventures and investments in R&D units elsewhere). This type of decision implies that companies need to minimise their current investment when the level of uncertainty is high; however, still consider an option to invest at other times and in situations where uncertainty is expected to be lower (Brouthers et al., 2008, citing Ahi et al., 2017). Postponement or staging, growth, scaling, shifting, and releasing strategic investment choices are real options (quoted in Trigeorgis & Reuer, 2017). In the present study, the aim is the priority and importance of effective factors and criteria in decision-making to enter a new market and the degree of alignment with each of the decision options based on ROT. Accordingly, research questions include the following: What are the priorities and importance of influencing factors and criteria in deciding to enter a new market? Which of the main decision factors for entering the international market corresponds to which of the decision options based on the ROT?",12

Services have long been perceived as non-tradable goods, but technological progress, especially in information and communication technologies (ICT), along with the process of offshoring and development of global value chains (GVCs) has made many types of services increasingly tradeable. This phenomenon is confirmed by the latest World Trade Organization’s data, which highlights that services sector has become the most dynamic component of international trade and that its role has grown in importance. The service sector accounts for about 50% of GDP worldwide, on average. For developed economies, these numbers are much higher—around three-fourths of their GDP is created by services. The services share in GDP proportion is also rapidly growing in developing economies. Moreover, trade in services has been increasing on average 5.4% per year since 2005. In contrast, trade in merchandise has been increasing at a 4.6% pace since 2005 annually. Trade in ICT and R&D services has recorded the most rapid annual growth over the past decade. The organisation predicts that by 2040, the share of trade in services in total trade could increase by 50%. This phenomenon is the result of decreasing trade costs, digitalization process, and lifting restrictions (WTO, 2019). Due to the notable digital and technological developments, the service sector has significantly contributed to productivity growth. Progress, digitalization, and significant reductions in transport costs have made a number of services more tradable. Moreover, automation has changed the labour-intensive manufacturing sectors, and finally, services account for a much higher share of value added than manufacturing; in 2015, services (including construction) accounted for almost 71% of global value added (OECD, 2020). The perception of services has dramatically changed over time. Instead of being the corollary of manufacturing, services are nowadays among the most dynamic industries in many economies. In the literature, there are two views of the role of services—one view perceives services as a quite separate and independent activity that should be studied apart from manufacturing; the second view connects services to manufacturing, a phenomenon called “servicification” of manufacturing.Footnote 1 Unfortunately, in practice, it is difficult to distinguish between services sold separately and services embodied in other products, e.g., manufacturing goods. This problem is particularly vital in terms of ICT services. Therefore, the article presents the role of services in general (including “servicification” of manufacturing) and services within manufacturing goods. In connection with the above observations, this paper makes several important contributions to the literature. Firstly, it focuses on flows of value added as the more appropriate method of measuring the role of services in global production based on fragmentation than the standard merchandise flows. Secondly, the importance of cross-sectoral linkages has been demonstrated in many empirical studies at country level (some of them are mentioned in the next section), but there are limited studies on international dimension of cross-sectoral value-added flows (OECD, 2013). Thirdly, there is a gap in the literature regarding research on ICT services. The role of services in trade is widely discussed, but ICT as a subgroup of services have been very rarely tested themselves. Fourthly, Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) as participants of service GVCs are fairly overlooked in research. Analyzing service sector in these economies derives from the fact that the role of this activity in their GDP is increasing as these countries have moved towards more advanced economies. In the flagship industries (automotive and electronics), services have become an integrated part of manufacturing, and what is more, the turnover of services (in particular ICT services) as an individual activity is also vital. This article compares flows and places held by the CEE economies (11 countries: Visegrad countries—V4, Baltic States, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia, and Romania; EU-11) in GVCs in manufacturing, services, and their subgroup—ICT services, by relying on the trade in value-added data retrieved from the OECD’s Inter-Country Input–Output Database, available over the period 2005–2015 (sometimes till 2016). This database was similar to the World Input–Output Database, but provides the most up-to-date detailed statistics on sectoral input–output flows for the largest number of countries (in comparison to other available databases).Footnote 2 The author assessed the role of these economies in international production linkages using value-added methodology. This study led to the verification of the hypotheses: (1) the position of manufacturing in GVCs has been steadily weakening and (2) services, especially ICT services, can have a positive effect on participation of CEE economies in GVCs. The study consists of four sections, “Introduction” and “Conclusions.” Firstly, it discusses the role of ICT services and CEE economies in global production linkages in services in the light of the literature, followed by a brief description of the methodology applied in this study. “Method” and “Results” analyse the EU-11 in terms of paths of participation in GVCs. The last section consists of conclusions.",4

These entities manage complex operational activities, face uncertain environments, and serve in various marketplaces via foreign direct investment, vertical and horizontal integration, and so on. Yet, these entities largely incurred huge costs (both fix and variable costs) for operating internationally (Feinberg & Phillips, 2004). Theories regarding the emergence of MNEs stated that ample availability of high-tech, human, natural, and other resources in foreign countries enhances the knowledge and expertise of MNEs that can further boost firm-level innovation (Birkinshaw, 2016). As internationalization accelerates, cross-border trade and foreign direct investment are also up surging. Due to this internationalization, MNEs are not only encountering the domestic country institutional settings but also host country institutional settings, which are usually dissimilar to their home country and have different rules and regulations. (Wu et al., 2015). Moreover, from a strategic perspective, it is imperative to consider the host country’s institutional environment than the home country while measuring the firm performance and innovation performance of MNEs (Wu et al., 2016). This argument is more prominent for those MNEs, whose home country institutional settings are different from host country (Mahmood & Rufin, 2005), for example, when a firm incorporated in a developing country and expand its operations to developed country or vice versa. The host countries’ institutional environment is not only important to determine the firm performance and innovation of MNEs, but also critical for their survival and competitiveness (De Groot et al., 2004; Dollar & Kraay, 2003; Gao et al., 2010; Goerzen & Beamish, 2003). The institutional environment within a country includes norms, rules, regulations, legal procedures, and policies that undergo various institutions (i.e., political, administrative, social, cultural, and economic institutions) (Henisz & Delios, 2000; North, 1990; Sala-i-Martin, 2002). Such kind of institutions work as a collaborative system and have an impact on business entities within a specific country (Hollingsworth & Boyer, 1997). In order to operate smoothly, entities are bound to comply with institutional policies and procedures (DiMaggio, 1988). These arguments are more prominent in the case of MNEs from countries having different economic development status from the host country (Thite, 2013). Moreover, the effectiveness of such institutions is also important to foster economic activities. When we say institutional effectiveness, it means how better the institutions are working to support businesses, innovations, and performances. Effective institutional environment provides certainty, symmetric information, reduce conflicts, and properly allocate resources. Such traits increase incentives and reduce risk, which consequently enhance firm performance and innovation (Niosi, 2002). As compared to the developed countries, developing economies have lower level of social trust, ineffective legal setup, fragile administrative system, and instable political structure; therefore, these countries have weak institutional environment. Researchers in the field of business and economics studied the role of countries’ institutions (Delios & Henisz, 2003) and how different types of institutions operate globally (Kostova, 1999). One of the major challenges for MNEs is to adjust to the prevailing institutional environment of the host country. Such an institutional environment raises various issues faced by the MNEs, which ultimately affect their performance and persistence (Hymer, 1976). In order to overcome these issues, MNEs usually adopt a partnership mechanism and personal relationships with domestic enterprises and government authorities (Boddewyn & Brewer, 1994). Host countries’ institutions also influence marketplace opportunities, which ultimately affect the profitability and performance of MNEs. Strong host countries’ institutional structure also motivates MNEs to invest in risky and technological projects which leads to higher profits (Aguilera & Jackson, 2003; Redding, 2005). This study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by empirically evaluating the impact of host countries’ institutional environment on the performance and innovation of MNEs. So far, only limited studies are done on said topic. These studies are either limited to the home countries’ institutional environment (Yang & Stoltenberg, 2014) or focus on a specific country (Wu et al., 2016). However, this study covers both gaps by examining the host countries’ institutional environment and incorporating the developing countries. This paper is organized as follows. In “Literature Review,” we review the existing literature. In “Hypothesis Development,” we develop the hypothesis of the study. In “Methodology,” we elaborate on the methodology. In “Empirical Analysis and Discussion,” we show the empirical findings and discussion. Finally, in “Conclusion,” we provide a conclusion of the study.",9

Empirical Evidence from Central–Eastern European Countries,December 2022,Theodoros Christoforidis,Constantinos Katrakilidis,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"One of the main characteristics of open economiesFootnote 1 is the growing interaction and interdependence through the establishment and development of economic relations among them (Archibald et al., 2004; Bengoa & Sanchez-Robles, 2003; Popescu, 2014). A critical factor in this direction is the flows of foreign direct investment (FDI), which contribute to the economic development of the host countries. Multinational corporations (MNCs) are the primary vehicles of the FDI flows, which constitute direct capital inflows into the host country and generate positive externalities (Lee, 2013). FDI leads to economic growth through the transfer and diffusion of technology, the increase of productivity, and the introduction of innovative production methods and managerial practices. Thus, they may contribute to a competitive economic environment. In recent years, environmental pollution has been observed at an accelerated pace, mainly consisting of the greenhouse effect, deforestation, and biodiversity loss. One of the most controversial issues is whether FDI affects the quality of the host countries’ natural environment or not (e.g., Tamazian & Rao, 2010; Lee, 2013; Shahbaz et al., 2015; Baek, 2016, Jambor & Leitao, 2017, Shahbaz et al., 2018). In many cases, it is evident that FDI inflows result in the increase of energy consumption and the environmental degradation of host countries, due to the absence of effective rules and environmental legislation (e.g., Baek & Jungho, 2016; Abdouli& Hammami, 2017; Kocak & Sarkgünesi, 2018). The international community’s interest in environmental issues was formulated through international agreements. The first international agreement for climate change was the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC), which took place at the Rio Summit in 1992. The Kyoto Protocol, which was adopted in 1997, is the most well-known international treaty on environmental protection for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change. According to this protocol, during the first period 2008–2012, 150 countries committed to reducing GHG emissions including CO2 by 5.2% compared to 1990 levels (in the EU region by 8%). In the second period 2013–2020, where all the EU-28 members participated, there is a commitment by the parties to reduce GHG emissions by at least 18% (20% for the EU) below 1990 levels. In 2015 the Paris Climate Change Agreement was reached, which includes an action plan to overcome the global warming problem and keep its temperature rise well below 2 °C. This agreement has been ratified by all EU Member States, and its main difference with the Kyoto Protocol is that the participating States have also drawn up national action plans to achieve the stated commitments. Also, in contrast to the Kyoto Protocol, the new agreement describes similar requirements for developing and developed countries. Among the main atmospheric pollutants, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are considered to be the primary indicators of air pollution, but CO2 is the most important anthropogenic GHG (IPCC, 2007). The average temperature of the atmosphere on the surface of the earth has grown, due to increased CO2 concentration, which is owed to human economic activity that cannot be absorbed by nature. Its annual emissions increased by 80% between 1970 and 2004, that is, from 21 to 38 gigatonnes (Gt), and accounted for 77% of the total human-induced GHG emissions in 2004. Following the majority of scientific research (Grossman, 1995; He, 2006; Zugravu-Soilita, 2017; Shahbaz et al., 2015; Martinez-Zarzoso et al., 2016), FDI is related to environmental degradation through three main “effects”: the scale, the composite or composition, and the technical effect. The scale effect implies that with constant returns to scale, an increase in the scale of the host country’s economic activity induced by the FDI inflows leads to economic growth (direct effect). This effect is followed by an increase in energy consumption which finally results in environmental degradation (indirect effect). The composite effect is caused by the change of the host country’s industrial structure due to the FDI inflows. In the early stages of economic development, the host economy moves from rural to industrial and this is accompanied by an increase in energy consumption. As the economy reaches a mature stage of development, it shifts from the industrial sector to the less energy-intensive service sector, resulting in a reduction of environmental degradation (Martinez-Zarzoso et al., 2016). The technical effect involves the technological innovations which take place through the FDI inflows in the production and management process of the host country which cause the reduction of energy consumption and polluting emissions (Zugravu-Soilita, 2017).
 This study aims at examining the FDI impact on the environment of Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries based on the theoretical framework between FDI and environmental degradation which is related to four main hypotheses. Firstly, the pollution haven hypothesis (PHH) asserts that a country with lax environmental regulations attracts more FDI from pollution-intensive industries (Asghari, 2013). According to PHH, in free-market economies, the environmental regulations of the host countries tend to be the determinants of the FDI inflows coming from the developed countries.Footnote 2 The factor endowment hypothesis (FEH) states that the FDI flows from the home to host countries depend on their relative factor endowments and not the environmental policies implemented on the host countries (Martinez-Zarzoso et al., 2016). Capital-abundant countries (developed countries) have a comparative advantage in the production of polluting goods because the capital-intensive industries are considered to be highly polluting. Therefore, capital-abundant countries cause environmental degradation, while labor-abundant (developing) countries specialize in relatively non-polluting industrial activities. On the other hand, the pollution halo hypothesis which is often referred to as the neo-technological approach, claims that MNCs apply high environmental standards and transfer environmentally friendly technology and know-how through their investments in the host countries (Birdsall & Wheeler, 1993; Zarsky, 1999). Mostly coming from the developed OECD countries, these FDIs use clean (renewable) forms of energy and stringent-innovative environmental management practices in host countries that contribute to greater environmental protection. In parallel, the Porter hypothesis (Porter, 1991; Porter & Van der Linde, 1995) argues that countries that implement stringent environmental policies could lead companies to innovation, through the implementation of environmentally friendly technologies. Although the cost of compliance with high environmental standards may be high, this will be offset by the benefits of technological innovation (Mihci et al., 2005). In this way the use of energy becomes more efficient, the use of innovative practices is encouraged, and the competitiveness in host economies is increased.Footnote 3 Among transition economies, the economic growth of CEE countries has been substantially stimulated by FDI inflows (Sakali, 2015). The rate of investment including FDI is found to be an important determinant on the economic growth of the CEE region (Prochniak, 2011). According to OECD (2001), this group of countries includes Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, and the three Baltic states Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. From the beginning of their transition process (after 1990), CEE countries tried to move from a centrally controlled economy to an open market economy model. One of the fundamental goals through this process was to attract FDI in order to transfer new technology, know-how, and a substantial amount of foreign capital in their economies. However, it is becoming increasingly interesting to investigate whether FDI inflows in CEE countries affected their environmental quality by causing far-reaching consequences to their societies. In many cases, it is argued that the industrial development in the CEE region had been a priority over environmental protection, thus resulting in a large number of investments from polluting industries. On the other hand, it is supported that via FDI, foreign companies used good management practices and advanced technologies, which contributed to a clean environment in the host countries. The process of the CEE countries’ transition was accompanied by numerous structural changes that aimed at their smooth integration into the EUFootnote 4 and the market economy. During this process and through improvements in their institutional operation, their main concern was to attract capital flows in order to achieve economic growth. The bulk of these flows came from EU countries and from the USA (according to the latest OECD BMD4Footnote 5 FDI data) in the form of FDI inflows. Between 2000 and 2008, CEE countries showed higher rates of economic growth on average than developed Western European countries, due to their prospect of joining the EU (Popescu, 2014). Although the difference between the CEE and EU countries’ GDP per capita average substantially decreased over the period 2004–2012, there remains a big gap between them (except for Slovenia). In Bulgaria, GDP per capita was 35% of the EU moving average in 2004 and 47% in 2012. In Romania, it was 34% and 50%, in Latvia 47% and 64%, in Hungary 63% and 67%, in Poland 51% and 67%, in Estonia 58% and 71%, in Lithuania 52% and 72%, in Slovakia 57% and 76%, in the Czech Republic 78% and 81%, and in Slovenia 87% and 84%, respectively (Krajewski, 2014). During their transition period, CEE countries are considered host economies, attracting a high proportion of FDI inflows which contribute to their economic growth. The level of economic growth on transitional economies is associated with the operational quality of the domestic formal institutions (Grogan & Moers, 2001). The relation between economic growth and environmental degradation was first described as an inverted U-shaped curve (Kuznets, 1955; Grossman & Krueger, 1995; Panayiotou, 1993) on the basis of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. According to the EKC, in the early stages of economic growth, there is an increase in environmental pollution, which after a certain point of growth starts to decrease. Economic growth is accompanied by structural changes that lead to technological innovations and reduce energy consumption, thus contributing to environmental sustainability. The few existing empirical studies in the CEE region mostly accept the existence of EKC (Archibald et al., 2004; Pang, 2008; Tamazian & Rao, 2010). Furthermore, the existing empirical evidence regarding the FDI impact on the environment of CEE countries is limited and provides mixed results. Some studies report that FDI has a positive effect on the environmental quality of CEE countries (Tamazian & Rao, 2010; Jambor & Leitao, 2017; Zugravu-Soilita, 2017), while others report no significant evidence on the FDI role in environmental degradation (Archibald et al., 2004; Pang, 2008). This paper examines the relationship between FDI and environmental quality in the region of CEE countries from 1995 to 2014, using a panel data approach. Since CO2 emissions are considered the main pollutant, the study investigates how FDI inflows affect CO2 emissions in the CEE region and examines the relationship between FDI and environmental degradation under a non-linear framework. Therefore, the contribution of this paper could be summarized as follows: First, the existing empirical literature regarding the relationship between FDI and environmental degradation in the CEE region is very limited, presenting mixed conclusions. This treatise aims at enriching the relevant literature by examining how FDI affects the environment in the whole CEE area consisting of countries with a similar economic structure instead of examining this relationship solely in every single CEE country. Concurrently, we investigate the validation of the main relevant hypotheses in the CEE region. Second, testing the relationship between FDI and environment, we also use the variables of economic growth and energy consumption in our model specification in order to tackle the problems of model specification misuse and omitted variable bias. The incorporation of these variables in the model provides important policy implications regarding energy efficiency targets and green growth. Third, besides the use of conventional first-generation panel techniques, we examine the aforementioned relationship, assuming both the case of cross-sectional independent distribution and taking into account the presence of cross-sectional dependency. Finally, since FDI transfers technological innovation in host countries and large institutions tend to support environmentally friendly investments, the application of a non-linear functional specification similar to EKC in order to trace out a possible non-linear effect of FDI in the environment of CEE countries sounds reasonable. To our knowledge, there is no relative research that examines the FDI effect on the environmental performance of the CEE region under a non-linear framework. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: The first part presents the relevant literature. The second part describes the econometric methodologies used in the present study, while the third part presents the empirical model, data, and results. The last section contains some concluding remarks and provides useful policy implications.",20

FV and RoS measurement becomes more critical in today’s business context regardless of type, size, age, volume, and nature. FV maximization (Shah et al., 2015) and positive RoS to investors depend on sustainable economic and financial growth of a business, which can be achieved by adopting good governance, financial performance (FP), and economic value added (EVA) process; these core issues are now being discussed in modern finance and business economics theory. It is certainly important that few specific issues in the capital market, such as lack of good governance and information asymmetry (Bodie et al., 2014; Morck et al., 2000) of firms (explicitly FP and EVA), create enormous noise during making investment decisions by investors. Morck et al. (2000) scrutinize the influence of corporate governance (CG) role and symmetrical information availability on stock price movement on different stock markets. Their research reveals that firms in well-developed economies usually adapt good CG with proper disclosure of FP and EVA, which lead to offer higher stock returns rather than emerging markets. They also recognize that in the well-functioning financial markets, trader/investor gathers more information regarding individual firm’s before investing; consequently, share prices reflect on firm-specific information. In a summary, their research results spark me to examine (a) whether CG and firms’ performance-related information, i.e., FP and refined economic value added (REVA), influence to enhance both FV and RoS or not in the emerging market, and (b) if the FV is an important determinant to generate positive or negative RoS of different types of firm over the years, which are certainly important to investigate. As yet, the capital markets of developing economy are the full setup with frail CG exercise, where information asymmetry reassures, thus apposite information regarding firms FP and REVA fade to the investors. Therefore, unsymmetrical information creates serious problems to investors to determine the appropriate investment decisions, resulting to investors selecting adverse stock; hence, investors get a lower or negative return (Zaigham et al., 2019). This article empirically investigates the FV and RoS by considering CG, FP, and REVA under the lack of good CG and information asymmetric market environment. It is worth noting that according to the decision theory (Slee, 2011), investors of the efficient market assemble and analyze information regarding FP and economic growth relevant information before taking any investment decisions, and categorizing risky investment alternatives to maximize expected monetary value. Eventually, emerging economy capital market performance are far more different than well-functioning market, where investors become puzzled before investing in any company due to information asymmetry regarding firms’ performance. Thus, this is certainly important to measure how lack of good CG and degree of information asymmetry of FP and REVA sensitively create effect on FV and RoS of different categories of firm and generates expected monetary value for investors in the emerging market. Additionally, is the FV influencing the RoS? To justify these fundamental issues, I consider Bangladesh as the research object and introduce the concept to measure FV and RoS by reexamining the inter-relationship among CG, FP, and REVA of the firms. The contribution of this study to the literature on the determinants of FV and RoS are fourfold. First, I propose a new bundle of variables and construct econometric models to examine the relationship between FV and RoS. The choice of these variables is not limited to the annual reports, firm CG adaptation reports, and financial statements of listed companies, but also takes into account to measure the inter-relationship of CG, FP, and REVA under imperfect market development. I use three different sizes (i.e., small-medium local firms (SMLFs), large local firms (LLFs), and multinational firms (MNCs)) of firms to measure the degree of corelationships among CG, FP, and REVA, and use CG index (CGI), financial ratios, i.e., NOPAT, leverage, Tobin’s q, EPS, DPR growth over the years that reflect the financial performance, and REVA, to measure economic value creation for firms and investors of listed companies. Second, the findings of the study support the views of Ammann et al. (2011), Kaplan (2017, 2016), Kogan and Papanikolaou (2013), Baseri et al. (2012), Pourali and Roze (2013), Lee and Kim (2009), and Bacidore et al. (1997). Ammann et al. (2011) believe that good CG practice firms generate higher firm value by reducing the degree of information asymmetry in the process of FP and REVA reporting to shareholders, creditors, management, employees, and regulators (Bao & Bao, 1998). Also, avoiding large fluctuations in stock prices, thereby reducing financing costs and higher cash flow to investors, discretely. Third, this article empirically analyzes all listed companies in the Bangladesh capital market from 2013 to 2018 to measure the influence of FV on RoS. Thus, the result of this study assists Bangladesh businesses to reform management practice by adopting good CG as well as encourages managers to prepare FP and REVA reports in a timely fashion; henceforth, this will assist to develop sustainable investment and financing markets. Moreover, this research certainly could be a significant reference for reforming the capital markets in other emerging economies. Finally, the core contribution of this research is to introduce a safe investment management technique for investors and in value creation aspect for firm managers (Table 8 (possible strategic steps for the safe investment management techniques for investors) and Fig. 1 (for managers)). This paper has constructed the following steps. In the “Literature Review and Conceptual Framework Development” section, literature review and conceptual framework development have covered based on three mentioned firm performance measurement techniques to measure FV and RoS. Afterward, the “Research design” section has discussed data sampling and methodology by developing econometrics models based on hypothesis. Next, the “Empirical Results and Analysis” section has analyzed and interpreted the regression results of the composite data set and test hypothesis. Finally, the “Conclusion” section mentioned the concluding remarks and implications of outcomes.",7

As entrepreneurial collaboration becomes more common in the pursuit of innovation, managers need a better understanding of how they can oversee these groups to sustain innovation without wasting finite organizational resources, principally time and money. The prevailing belief among managers is that interfering with the entrepreneurial process is likely to douse the very spark for the novel solutions they are seeking (Kempster & Cope, 2010; Stevenson & Jarillo, 2007). The uncertainty in managerial approaches to entrepreneurial collaboration is the motivation for this study. Scholars agree that the very spark of innovation rests in the social bonds between individuals, referred to as social cohesion (Chan et al., 2006; Chen et al., 2017). Social cohesion must exist for synergy to develop, and synergy must be optimal for innovation to occur (Dundon, 2002; Witges & Scanlan, 2015). However, when social cohesion is excessive, innovation is unlikely (David et al., 2020; Quince, 2001; Schultz et al., 2016; Sulistyo & Ayuni, 2020; Wise, 2014). While the phenomenon of entrepreneurs working with one another is not new, studies do not explore how social cohesion moderation can optimize synergy. Therefore, this paper identifies a knowledge gap in understanding how managers can moderate social cohesion to foster sustainable innovation among collaborating entrepreneurs. To explore the vast array of scholarly resources available in entrepreneurship, collaboration, social cohesion, organizational synergy, and related issues, the authors adopted the methodology of the structured approach described by Webster and Watson (2002). To select the source material for this systematic literature review, relevant thought leadership and major contributions were sought in leading journals, including prominent conference papers, dissertations, and published texts. This task was made possible using The University of Liverpool online library, which utilizes Discover library collections of print and online content to search a wide variety of content from, among other resources, journal articles, conference proceedings and reports, theses, and dissertations, as well as print and eBooks. Of particular focus were search results from EBSCO’s premier aggregated database in Academic Source Complete, Business Source Complete, JSTOR, Emerald, Elsevier, Wiley, Springer, Taylor & Francis, Sage, IEEE, WOS, and Scopus. The methodological framework used in this study reveals active academic interest in social cohesion in the area of entrepreneurship and reveals an insufficient understanding of how social cohesion could be moderated to sustain innovation among collaborating entrepreneurs. Moreover, this study finds that managers cannot sit idly nor be self-assured that entrepreneurs will automatically, let alone sustainably, innovate. Managers must establish a collaborative agency in which they are seen as a resource by collaborating with entrepreneurs to support the development of interpersonal trust, sharing, and, most importantly, criticality. While providing a helpful overview for future researchers in locating and considering academic resources on the topic, this paper motivates new approaches to managerial intervention. The next section of this paper is structured to analyze the methodology for conducting the literature review followed by analysis results. The authors then critically analyze and synthesize the selected academic resources’ insights concerning the identified concepts. The study’s conclusions and implications are presented at the end of the paper, closing with the authors’ thoughts on limitations and future research possibilities.",2
13.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,30 September 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00833-7,Think Green: the Eco-innovative Approach of a Sustainable Small Enterprise,December 2022,Raffaele Campo,Oronzo Trio,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Safeguarding the environment has become an important issue for modern companies (Bhardwaj & Malhotra, 2012; Dogaru, 2020). Porter and van der Linde (1995) highlight that green innovation represents a source of competitive advantage, going beyond the concept of sustainability as a mere source of costs. In the literature, this kind of innovation is called eco-innovation, as well as environmental innovation, sustainable innovation, and green innovation (Bonzanini Bossle et al., 2016; Dias Angelo et al., 2012). More recently, Sumrin et al. (2020) have highlighted the relevance of eco-innovation as a source of competitive advantage. In order to explain this concept, some definitions of eco-innovation are reported. The Eco-innovation Observatory Report (2012) defines it as “the introduction of any new or significantly improved product (good or service), process, organizational change or marketing solution that reduces the use of natural resources (including materials, energy, water, and land) and decreases the release of harmful substances across the whole life-cycle.” (p. 8); Klemmer et al. (1999) highlight that it is linked to ideas, behaviors, products, and processes which contribute to reducing environmental burdens or ecological targets, while Fussler and James (1996), Wolff et al. (2020) and Oltra and Saint Jean (2009) note that it is the development of new products/processes/services which provide value to customers and business, with a lower environmental impact. In terms of determinants of eco-innovations Horbach et al. (2012) and Doran and Ryan (2012) underline that regulations (for reducing air and water emissions and for increasing recyclability), cost savings (for reducing energy and material use), and customer benefits (with regard to material efficiency, reduction of energy consumption, waste and the use of dangerous substances) affect companies and their environmental choices. Some scholars also classify eco-innovation drivers as internal and external (Bonzanini Bossle et al., 2016; Cai & Zhou, 2014). Internal factors refer to the resources, competencies, capabilities, and characteristics of firms, such as environmental commitment, financial resources, and technological competency; the external ones, in contrast, are those connected with external stakeholders (authorities, investors, research centers, for example) (Peñasco et al., 2017). According to Hojnik and Ruzzier (2016), regulation (see also You et al., 2019) represents the most critical driver of eco-innovation in companies, along with market pull factors; from this perspective, both Zhu et al. (2012) and Fernando and Wah (2017) note a link between international institutional pressure and environmental practices. In addition, with reference to SMEs (which is an emerging research topic according to de Jesus Pacheco et al., 2017), Triguero et al. (2013) find that those companies collaborating with universities, research institutes, and agencies in trying to increase demand for green products are more active in terms of eco-innovations; moreover, supply-side factors are important drivers for environmental processes and organizational innovations. Also, Sáez-Martínez et al. (2016) shed light on the role of technologies for SMEs that strive to be eco-innovative. Ociepa-Kubicka and Pachura (2017) distinguish four different typologies of eco-innovation, which have to be conceived as interdependent (Cheng et al., 2014): 1—Environmental technologies (technologies for controlling the emitted pollution and for limiting the use of resources and materials during the production process), see also Kuo and Smith (2018) and Levidow et al. (2016); 2—Organizational innovations (environmentally-friendly management, based for example on ISO 14001 and the life cycle assessment concept); 3—Product and service innovations (with regard to product design and service generation); 4—Green system innovations (new environmentally-friendly production and consumption systems). Another distinction has been made by Carrillo-Hermosilla et al. (2010), who identified four dimensions of eco-innovation: design, user, product service, and governance. Eco-innovation impacts on firms’ performance, as enlightened by Hojnik and Ruzzier (2017); as a matter of fact, they affirm that eco-innovation is a source of competitive benefits for companies with consequent better firm performances. Other benefits are highlighted by Cheng and Shiu (2012) and Sarkar (2013); in particular, the latter distinguishes direct benefits (cost savings from better resource productivity and logistics; sales) and indirect benefits (improved image, better relationships with suppliers, customers and authorities, more contact with knowledge holders, better safety and health, and workers’ satisfaction). In other words, it pays to be green. Recent interest in sustainability by SMEs is witnessed by the increasing number of manuscripts dedicated to this topic (see Kumar et al., 2020; Isensee et al., 2020; Eikelenboom & de Jong, 2019).",3

Since the revolution (2011), Tunisia has always tried to choose the necessary tools to encourage investment and business creation. Yet, Tunisian companies suffer from high-risk of bankruptcy. This can be explained by the presence of financial constraints, the deterioration of business climate, and the lack of planning before business creation. In fact, Tunisian entrepreneurs focus only on the business plan and neglect the importance of business model design (BM). The design of BM is, moreover, a central aspect in the entrepreneurial field (Blank, 2013) but historically neglected (Schaltegger et al., 2016). Prior literature reports that BM design contributes to improving firm performance (Bocken, 2015; Bouwman et al., 2019; Foss & Saebi, 2018; Wei et al., 2017; Zott & Amit, 2008). However, there are various firm–level factors moderating the BM-firm performance relationship. Brettel et al. (2012) observe that a company performance of BM depends on the relationship marketing efforts towards its key customers. Pati and Nandakumar (2016) note that novelty-centered BM (NBM) is more beneficial in high environmental dynamism, while efficiency-centered BM (EBM) is more beneficial in low environmental munificence. This study addresses the recent trend by proposing another factor which is “organizational culture” that may affect BM-firm performance relationship. Several empirical studies support the hypothesis that firms with high level performance are characterized by a strong organizational culture (Kilmann et al., 1985; Zheng et al., 2010; Pinho et al., 2014; Gao, 2017, Oyemomi et al., 2019; Upadhyay & Kumar, 2020). They find that performance increases in firms with a strong corporate culture as industry volatility increases. Hartnell et al. (2016) study the importance of the interactive effect of leadership and organizational culture on firm performance. They note that the firm performance will be lower when levels of task culture and leadership are similar, than when task culture and leadership are dissimilar. Elsewhere, organizational culture has an impact on strategic planning through one of its four dimensions which is involvement. The involvement of entrepreneur and top management makes it possible to put strategic planning more effectively, thanks to the information acquired (Bachmann et al., 2016). It can improve coordination and flexibility in the implementation of strategic planning. Building on this stream of research, we investigate the mediated moderating role of organizational culture in BM-firm performance relationship. The main purpose of this paper is to study the moderating role of organizational culture in BM-firm performance relationship, as well as the mediating role of strategic planning on the moderation effect of organizational culture in the Tunisian context. In other words, we aim to identify how organizational culture contributes to ameliorating BM-firm performance relationship. We construct a database collected from a sample of 107 nascent Tunisian entrepreneurs covering the period between the end of 2014 and the beginning of 2016. We use a quantitative survey conducted from a questionnaire. Our results show that the role of BM design in enhancing firm performance depends on the presence of strong organizational culture. Additionally, strategic planning mediates the positive moderating effect of organizational culture on BM-firm performance relationship. This research empirically demonstrates that BM of firms with strong corporate culture foster firm growth through high quality strategic decision making. Our paper contributes to the literature by proposing both direct and indirect effect of organizational culture on BM-firm performance relationship. The presence of strong organizational culture strengthens the BM–firm performance relationship. The effect of BM design influenced by organizational culture on firm performance follows the path through strategic planning. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. “Literature and Hypothesis Development” introduces the literature and hypothesis development. “Research Design” describes in detail the research design. “Results and Discussion” presents the empirical results and discussion. Finally, “Conclusion” concludes the paper.",2

Harris,Daniel Abernathy,Alexander Vinel,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Paper or digital two-dimensional (2D) drawings have been the predominant method of communicating engineering information in industry throughout the modern manufacturing age (Harris, Abernathy, et al., 2019). At the same time, advances in computing capabilities (both hardware and software) along with development of standards for data and information, now allow for completion of engineering and production analysis and planning in significantly less time, enabling the use of three-dimensional (3D) models as the authoritative source of truth. This, in turn, lets engineers communicate geometric and feature characteristics of the product, simulate the behavior of the product, and identify issues with form, fit or function greatly increasing capacity to analyze, and evaluate designs early in the product life cycle (Fischer, Rosche, and Trainer 2016). The term model-based enterprise (MBE) emphasizes the essential role of models in digital manufacturing (Frechette, 2011). In terms of digital capability, an MBE utilizes 3D models rather than 2D documents and drawings as the authoritative source for all engineering and manufacturing activities. MBE is a key component of a digitally enabled manufacturing system. There is a tendency for organizations to use the terms “digitization” and “digitalization” interchangeably. A distinction between digitization and digitalization must be drawn as these terms do not have the same meaning even though industry today often makes this mistake (Bloomberg et al., 2018). Digitization is the computerization of a manual activity, taking analog information and encoding it into zeroes and ones so that computers can store, process, and transmit the information. Converting an existing inefficient process to a digital format simply results in an inefficient digital process. However, digitalization is the replacement of a manual or digital activity and taking advantage of the capabilities of an application to remove wasteful actions from the process, resulting in a more efficient, effective, and value-creating activity. Digitalization is the optimization of the process and implementing a digital capability to improve process information flow and connectivity. In this manuscript, the terms digital capabilities and MBE are used interchangeably, since this research effort relied on a disparate set of sources, some of which refer to the former and some to the latter. With an MBE approach, users throughout the supply chain create, consume, and modify data without having to recreate previously developed models or information. The benefits to becoming digitally capable and crafting connections to complete the “digital thread” are significant (Lubell et al., 2012). Some areas in which there has been evidence of improvement include minimizing the need to re-create downstream models, reduction in cycle time and costs, reduction in downstream errors, and production of parts that better meet customer requirements and expectations (Fischer, Rosche, and Trainer 2016). Recent studies have claimed that the digitalization of manufacturing will drive a new wave of productivity improvement through the manufacturing sector; however, even though Industry 4.0 and the use of models promises lower costs, the relatively high investment necessary may make many companies hesitant to adopt these capabilities (Büyüközkan & Göçer, 2018; Kamble, Gunasekaran, and Sharma 2018; Moeuf et al., 2018). While this promise of improved competitiveness and profitability resulting from the new technologies of the 4th industrial revolution is within reach, there are indications that small- and medium-sized manufacturers (SMMs) in particular are unprepared to join their larger manufacturing customers in the digital revolution (Harris, Yarbrough, et al. 2019a, 2019b, 2019c, 2019d). Even though the benefits of reduced costs, shortened lead times, and increased innovation, would result in a more competitive manufacturing organization, adoption of digital capabilities has been slow (Moeuf et al., 2018; Schröder, 2016). Organizations struggle with making the changes required to move from legacy systems to take advantage of new technologies, even though they acknowledge the benefits associated with the change (Bao, 2009; Furr & Shipilov, 2019; Ghani & Jayabalan, 2000). In a workshop held by the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute (since renamed MxD (MxD, 2020)), more than 200 senior managers were asked about the importance of digital capability to the future competitiveness of their organizations. Of these respondents, 81% indicated that it is a top driver of future competitiveness (Fig. 1). This same study found that 53% of these senior managers agreed that digital capability is a priority, yet few have a strategy or plan to take advantage of the opportunity, and only 14% believe they have a “high” digital capability. A comprehensive understanding of market forces, needs, and issues in developing digital capability in a complex manufacturing organization is one of the most difficult steps in adoption and inhibits the implementation of new technologies (Prause, 2019). The business model for SMMs and the value proposition for developing the digital capabilities described by Industry 4.0 have yet to be made, leaving many with no real plan for achievement (Müller, 2019). Characterization of issues with adopting digital capabilities is a critical step toward the development of solutions. The overwhelming inertia of the current organizational culture requires a strategy if it is to be overcome. Hence, this research aims for a thorough analysis of independent studies with the goal of identifying emerging classes of issues, focusing on SMMs as the primary subjects. The research outlined in this article seeks to develop an understanding of the issues associated with the resistance to adoption of Industry 4.0 technologies, specifically the use of models and digital technical data by SMMs. We seek to categorize the issues and, in doing so, highlight opportunities for increasing the digitalization of the industrial supply chain. The remainder of the manuscript is organized as follows. In sect. “Evidence for the Existence of Implementation Issues in the Existing Literature,” we review the evidence of issue types with a look at the current literature. Section “Methodology—Data Sources” presents the different data sources used by this study and methods of application. Section “Results—Categorization of Issues” describes the results of the examination of the multiple data sources available to the researchers. Section “Discussion and Analysis” provides a discussion of the analysis and presents a preliminary categorization of the issues. Finally, sect. “Conclusions and Future Work” offers overall conclusions and opportunities for future research.",4

Menegaki,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Managers are key people to the improvement and progress of a business. Through their administration and organization strategies, as well as their personal leading examples, they can increase business profitability and business reputation and accelerate the incorporation of innovation. NT such as robotics, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and other automations constitute innovation that needs to be disseminated and adopted by all types of businesses which aim to keep pace with the technological evolution and increase their profit. Besides the objective limitation posed by financial constraints for new investments, whether or not a business will adopt NT is based on managerial decisions. Technologically informed and educated managers will not only embrace the notion of new technologies, but will also find the means to adopt them in their organizations. Managerial influence on the implementation or adoption of NT at work places had been documented quite early by Leonard-Barton and Deschamps in their seminal work in 1988. This study had resulted in that the diffusion of innovation in the work place is a two-step managerial process. Among other important findings, they found that employees with better performance and skills would adopt NT when it was made available, even without managerial influence and vice versa. Thus, this shows that there are some intrinsic characteristics of the individual that favor the adoption of NT and some other characteristics which discourage the adoption of NT. Therefore, our study investigates the adoption of NT and the attitudes of managers in two representative tourism organizations and actors, namely hotels and museums (with or without archaeological sites). Cultural heritage is an essential part of tourism. Not only is cultural tourism a particular category of tourism of its own, but it is certainly combined almost in all types of tourism. Even tourism trips which are purely for sea and sun (relaxation) are also combined with visits to museums and archaeological sites. Our study focuses only on managers’ attitudes and not the rest of the staff, because we regard managers as key individuals in this venture. Therefore, the study aims to record managerial attitudes and preferences and identify possible gaps in each of these two groups of managers (hotel managers and museum curators). This investigation will reveal the training and education needs of the managers that will make them embrace NT and eventually guide their staff to similar acceptance of NT as well as the guests and visitors. The study is interested in attitudes because an attitude consists of many characteristics that portray a positive or negative behavior and feeling towards a certain object (Triandis, 1971). In psychology terms, attitude consists of effect, cognition, and behavior and all that refer to people’s preferences, knowledge, reaction, and intention with respect to a certain object (Mantle-Bromley, 1995). Attitude has been empirically confirmed to be a factor that affects technology adoption (Bruess, 2003). Davis (1986) proposed a technology acceptance model and this is one of the most well-known models related to technology acceptance and use. This model can be regarded as a theoretical base and has been very useful in understanding the factors that predict acceptance of new technology (Hussein, 2017; King & He, 2006; Legris et al., 2003). Policy strategies also recognize the importance of the adoption of NT by tourism organizations. First, the European Commission has recognized the importance of the hotels and museums being equipped with NT. Quite early from 2007 to 2013, the European Union’s 7th Framework Programme for research, technological development, and demonstration had acknowledged the need for the cultural heritage moving away from an institutions-centered pattern of functioning and development, towards an individual-centered pattern. Through this endeavor for a new spiritual meeting between the individual with his/her cultural heritage, EU aimed to also stimulate social development and economic growth. Overall, the European Commission had acknowledged the existence of a gap between curators and museum visitors which could be bridged with new technologies (European Commission, 2007). Second, and more recently, a new priority has been put forward in EU, which concerned digitalization in tourism (Dredge et al., 2018). According to Xiang and Fesenmaierm (2017), there are three phases in the digitalization of tourism: phase 1 ranges from 1990 to 2000 and included the electronic cash registers, email, websites, video conferencing, etc.; phase 2 ranges from 2000 to 2010 with smart phones, computerized ticketing systems, online booking systems, customer reservation systems; and lastly, phase 3 from 2010 and up to date which encompasses examples such as augmented reality, virtual reality, mobile applications, cloud computing, chatboxes and instant advice, social media, etc. Thus, governments have realized the importance of adoption of NT both in hotels and museums. Given that tourism is also a very important sector for the Greek economy and that hotels and museums are the backbone of its tourism, this study focuses on the comparison of the perceptions and attitudes of their managers in front of NT. This investigation gives important insights and information not only to managers themselves, but foremost to the Ministry of Tourism, the Ministry of Culture, and other Institutional Stakeholders such as the Greek Hoteliers’ Chamber and the Greek National Tourism Organization about the needs of managers for information campaigns and seminars as well as investment support initiatives for the acquisition of NT through subsidies and tax reliefs and possibly other tools. Lack of training generally and lack of training with respect to NT in particular leads to substandard results, frustration, low employee turnover, lack of commitment. Most literature in the field reveals the positive effects of training for managers (Atef et al., 2010) and ongoing staff education on business turnover and profit indices, but none has provided particular diagnostics of the training required for these two particular groups of managers, curators, and hotel managers, and none has shown how different this training should be for the two, in order to achieve their goals. Thus, this study aims to recommend a training framework, based on the identification of the different training needs of the two managerial groups. Our study employs results from two core studies developed by Menegaki (2020a, b) on the investigation of the preferences of curators about new technologies in museums and the investigation of the preferences of hotel managers about NT in Greek hotels. Training is regarded as a means to change the behavior of managers towards the adoption of NT. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: part 2 provides a theoretical and conceptual framework, part 3 is the literature review, part 4 is the methodology, part 5 offers the results with their discussion, and last, part 6 concludes the paper.",4

The rapid urbanization rates observed in many countries could have a negative impact on environmental, social, and economic sustainability (Bennett et al., 2017; Bibri & Krogstie, 2017). Referring to smart cities, several different definitions are presented in the literature. However, a universally accepted definition is still lacking, given the multidisciplinary nature of the smart city field and the differences in the conceptualizations between academics and practitioners (Gil-Garcia et al., 2015). The smart city concept evolved as new technologies emerged (Anthopoulos & Fitsilis, 2014; Deakin & Al Waer, 2011). From digital/virutal cities in the late 1990s, to eco cities in 2012, and to more complex and intelligent ecosystems (Anthopoulos, 2017). A common-cited definition states that “smart cities connect physical, social, IT, and business infrastructure to increase their collective intelligence” (Harrison et al., 2010), while Giffinger et al. (2007) suggest that a smart city is “a city that excels, in a forward-looking manner, in six smart axes, i.e., economy, mobility environment, living, people, and governance, based on the smart combination of activities and endowments of independent, self-decisive and aware citizens.” The study of Lai et al. (2020) explored the technical standards related to smart cities in order to define the smart city concept, while Yigitcanlar et al. (2018) identified and linked several key drivers of smart development to relative desired outcomes constructing a multidimensional conceptual framework. New trends in smart city infrastructure encompass the utilization of Industry 4.0 technologies (Safiullin et al., 2019; Storolli et al., 2019), i.e., Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Services (IoS), Cloud Computing, and Big Data as well as Internet of Data (IoD), Internet of Energy (IoE), and Internet of People (IoP) (Lom et al., 2016), to promote decentralization and real-time monitoring and management capabilities in smart city initiatives. Modern smart cities need to be scalable in design, efficient in operations and flexible in planning (Bibri & Krogstie, 2017; Kim et al., 2017), while citizens should be viewed as key stakeholders of smart initiatives and not as simple users. Nonetheless, smart city development requires several barriers to be overcome, such as design and operation costs, encompassing a large number of heterogeneous devices, information security issues, collection and analysis of large amount of data, and maintenance of sustainability (Silva et al., 2018). Referring to standardization bodies, both the ITU-T FG-SSC (Kondepudi, 2014; Sang et al., 2015) and the ISO/IEC JTC 1 (ISO/IEC, 2015) denote the importance to encompass sustainability considerations within smart city’s definitions and assessments, with the former defining smart city as “an innovative city that leverages ICTs and other means to improve efficiency of operation and services, quality of life, and competiveness while it ensures that the needs of present and future generations in regard to environmental, economic, social, and cultural issues will be met,” Despite the differences observed among the various conceptual frameworks, the aforementioned six smart axes (Giffinger et al., 2007) appear to reflect a wide consensus in the literature (Anthopoulos, 2017; Camero & Alba, 2019). Several evaluation systems capturing different perspectives on smart city performance are presented in the literature. The study of Ahvenniemi et al. (2017) explored the differences between smart city and sustainable city assessment systems, denoting that the former systems include mainly tech-related indicators, while the latter mainly environmental aspects. Nonetheless, the majority of the evaluation models construct composite indicators, the usage of which present weaknesses in terms of results’ reliability, and robustness that mainly stems from the applied normalization, weighting, and aggregation techniques (Nardo et al., 2005). The current research develops a multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) framework to evaluate smart cities’ performance. Specifically, the PROMETHEE II method is applied in order to aggregate individual indicators and assess an overall smart city performance. PROMETHEE II is an outranking method that appears appropriate in the examined problem, since it can avoid the fully compensatory nature of composite indices and also avoid incomparabilities among alternatives (i.e., cities). Furthermore, the paper adopts a holistic approach for the assessment of “smartness” based on the six axes of Giffinger et al. (2007). The rest of the paper is organized as follows: “Alternative Approaches for Assessing Smart City Performance” presents alternative approaches for assessing smart city performance, including MCDA tools. The proposed evaluation framework is given in “Methodology,” including a detailed discussion of the evaluation criteria and a brief presentation of the PROMETHEE II method. “Results and Discussions” presents the evaluation results, the sensitivity analysis, and the comparison with other assessment frameworks. Finally, some concluding remarks and future research directions are given in “Conclusions.”",3

Actually, these organizations evolve in a dynamic process needing continuous adaptation. This adaptation seems to be necessary as these organizations need to be upgraded to new conditions. Therefore, they are expected to adopt redeployments, adaptations, and anticipations, which can help to consolidate and strengthen their resilience. Organizational resilience is a new and growing concept in management research that focuses on maintaining organizational viability related to change and transformation (Sutcliffe & Vogus, 2003; Linnenluecke, 2017; Tengblad & Oudhuis, 2018; Andersson et al., 2019).  Knowing that any innovative process will be resisted by actors who want to maintain or withhold a standstill state that seems useful or fruitful for them. Often, these resistances are generated by red tape and the extreme definition of the behaviors, especially related to the safety (Zid et al., 2018). This situation will contribute, therefore, to the organizational rigidity, which will strengthen the resistance to change loop (Mintzberg, 1994). Hence, it is, indeed, important to know how to overcome this resistance to change by adopting some managerial techniques focusing on: motivation, participation, training, and communication, and so on. Thus, the role of leadership is necessary in any endeavor to reduce these resistances and convince all actors about the usefulness of innovative changes (Self & Schraeder, 2009). Without the adoption of strategies based on anticipation and continuous innovation, systems cannot keep pace (Hamel & Välikangas, 2003). Besides, knowing how to manage “bad surprises” by a management rather oriented towards “fluctuation rather than invariance” becomes a new distinctive and critical skill tomorrow (Schuman, 1993). Furthermore, Tengblad and Oudhuis (2018) claimed that the proactivity aspect is important for organizational resilience, and Linnenluecke (2017) considered it an understudied aspect in business and management research.",

Globally, the size of internal migration is much higher than the international migration (750 million versus 250 million) (World Bank, 2019). There are many consequences of this migration along with posing challenges for governments; such as urbanization, housing, education, and healthcare services, access to basic utilities, safety, congestion free roads, and transportation (World Economic Forum, 2017). Urbanization is composed of natural population increase in urban areas, the size of migrants added every year to cities, and urbanizing the former rural areas (United Nations Development Program [UNDP], 2018). Estimates suggest that the size of world urban dwellers would rise up to 2.5 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2019). Among other regions, South Asia is 50% urban, and its urban population is expected to increase by 250 million by 2030 (World Bank, 2015). Pakistan is the fifth most populous country in the world, and the most urbanized in South Asia. The urban population of Pakistan is expected to rise by 80 million by 2030, nearly two-thirds of the total population (United Nations Development Program [UNDP], 2018). Pakistan was predominantly a rural country at the time of independence in 1947. However, the number of people living in cities is increasing 3.3% annually, as a result of structural transformationFootnote 1 of the economy and better employment opportunities (United Nations Development Program [UNDP], 2018). This may lead to more rapid urbanization as the share of industry, commerce, and other urban sectors increases along with changes in the geography of economic activities (Economic Survey of Pakistan [PES], 2017; Economic Survey of Pakistan [PES], 2018). Moreover, this rapid urban growth consistently goes along with congestion, pollution, deficits in the stipulation of municipal services, formation of slums, increase in crime rate, and urban poverty. The urban infrastructure of the major cities of Pakistan such as Karachi, Lahore, and Faisalabad has surpassed its carrying capacity as a result of rapid and unbridled population growth (United Nations Development Program [UNDP], 2018). This situation could be accredited to unbalanced development policies based on the assumed dichotomy between rural and urban areas as reflected in the division of policies. None of these initiatives has given much thought to the complex dynamics of rural–urban interactions and the ways in which urban and rural livelihoods are intertwined. There are various push and pull factors compelling rural settlers to migrate. Push factors are the negative characteristics of place of origin whereas pull factors are the positive characteristics at the point of destination. The poor economic opportunities, unequal landholdings, costly agriculture, insufficient educational and healthcare facilities, and insecurity, force rural settlers to move towards cities. Nonetheless, migration theory suggests that better economic opportunities, improved infrastructure, education and healthcare facilities, recreational facilities, security, and independent living act as the pull factors (Fields, 1972; Lee, 1966; Stark & Bloom, 1985). Migrants move in order to improve their living conditions and create overcrowding of cities, and suffer from urban poverty and remain unsatisfied (Ahmed & Ishrat, 2020; Imran et al., 2013). In Pakistan, the Punjab has the highest percentage of migrant population, within the province, and across provinces (Appendix 1). The major reasons for migration within provinces include moving with household heads and job transfer (Appendix 2). Nonetheless, studies suggest that major push factors of migration to cities include: uncertain income levels, labor demand from industry, expensive agricultural production, un-equal landholdings, oppressive lifestyle, and poor health conditions (Hussain, 2016). The migration statistics for cities are not published in government statistics. So, one cannot exactly measure the percentage of migrants adding up to cities annually. This shortcoming in the existing data sets also motivates to investigate the size of migration along with the reasons for migration towards cities. Lahore is the capital city of the Punjab province and the second largest metropolitan of Pakistan (Rana & Bhatti, 2018). It is the urban magnet and industrial hub attracting various kinds of people to move here. The total area of the city is 1776 sq. km. The population size of the city has increased from 6.3 to 11.26 million during previous 20 years (PBS, 1998–2017), The main objective of the present study is to investigate the push–pull factors of migration in Lahore city (Fig. 1). There is need to investigate the demographic and socioeconomic conditions of migrants, before and after migration. Moreover, the identification of factors contributing to the economic satisfaction of migrants also needs to be analyzed. Map of Lahore City showing expansion in area.

The present paper does not debate neither on anthropology, nor on ontology, but it does work with two concepts that are very much linked to our way of thinking, acting, and performing — sustainability and innovation. The term innovation derives from the Latin word innovatus, which comprises of the meaning of renewal and change. The misuse and misinterpretation of the concept of innovation deliver confusion in implementation (Kennedy et al., 2017). Many organizations consider that by creating something new, they innovate. The matter is a bit more complex than that, and the basis for any new model, product, or service stems from its value. The idea of sustainability, on the other hand, stems from the discussions regarding the quality of our environment, and it was not publicly heard and used of until the late 1980s (Andrew et al., 2007). It is basically a term utilized as a better replacer for the compound environmentally friendly both because it is shorter, and because it has a greater rhetorical impact. The United Nations have had a major role in promoting the concept of sustainability, of course, for clear reasons. They also underlined the importance of sustainable development — equity between and within generations, proposing as a result the essence of the concept. Personally, we view this matter more complex than simple assumptions and, therefore, the present paper will address the concept of innovation and sustainability transposed in the business sector of luxury apparel. Everything indicative of more than enough has been catalogued as luxus — the Latin word for luxury, and it has had been perceived for most of its short history as excessive (Kapferer & Laurent, 2016), to put it lightly. Odile-Bernez (2014) has beautifully introduced the concept of economic theory in the context of the luxury industry, where starting from the eighteenth century, the latter has been rewarded a lighter connotation and it has been associated with exhilarating the senses and created feelings of fulfilment, richness, and beautification of life itself. This led to the correlation between opulence and royalty, increased social positioning and liquidity — basically luxury, and the satisfaction and mystery it incites, the high status and favourableness it provides (Kapferer, 2014; Li et al., 2012; Zhan & He, 2012). The Cambridge Dictionary (n.d.) defines luxury as “great comfort, especially as provided by expensive and beautiful things,” while it underlines that luxury goods are “something expensive that is pleasant to have but is not necessary.” At the same time, innovation comprises of new ideas, products, methods, etc., that are being translated into reality under the form of a new interpretations with favourable outcomes for the industry it addresses. Sustainability represents “the quality of causing little or no damage to the environment and therefore able to continue for a long time” (Cambridge Dictionary, n.d.). The three concepts are not usually found together; nevertheless, the intricate modern consumer and the ever-evolving current luxury market indicate that the latter will ultimately have to rely on such concepts in order to remain relevant to the new consumer generations, and to have consistent economic impact within its competitive ground. Luxury has a number of characteristics, one of which being rather fundamental to the concept itself — the vagueness, the limit it sets, and the exclusiveness. Probably to carry on this last characteristic, there is not too much data on the activity of luxury brands, with the exception of general annual trend studies such as IPSOS (2019) and Bain & Co (2019). Therefore, information regarding the usage within the luxury industry of innovative and sustainable product management strategies has also fallen behind. Given the assembly of literature review on the topic of luxury, and focusing on integrating the principles of innovation and sustainability within the mentioned industry, we have worked on a systematic review of the previous research, in order to understand the extent to which this economic sector, with particularity the luxury clothing and accessories segment, has adhered to strategies incorporating new directions in terms of sustainable practices, and innovative processes and products. As a consequence, the curiosity of modelling a scenario in which the luxury apparel industry did adhere to some innovative and, more importantly, sustainable principles has ignited the realization of the following study. By manually gathering articles within the framework of the subject, and performing a systematic review of the former, a new perspective was unfolded. The question behind this study remains that of understanding how innovation and sustainability, two modern concepts of the economic perspective and of the modern civilization, can be included in the strategical direction of the luxury industry. The outcome, transposed under the form of a new business model for the luxury industry in general, provides important information from both perspectives of theory and practicality. ",3

It allows industries to carry less investment risks, while providing access to a broader range of expertise and advanced technologies than they have in-house. For academia, such governmental funding schemes provide a great opportunity to develop new knowledge and stay updated on industrial needs, in addition to external funding, patents, and licensees emerging from such projects. However, governmental incentives do not guarantee any success of collaborative industry-academia research and innovation projects. Fundamental differences in agendas, ways of working, and time perspectives create barriers for collaboration and decrease projects’ innovation potential (Ankrah & AL-Tabbaa, 2015; Galan-Muros & Davey, 2019; Perkmann et al., 2021). Even when industry and academia manage to collaborate effectively and achieve the results that are beneficial for industry, this is not always enough for successful technology realisation (Larsson et al., 2006; Perkmann et al., 2015). Lack of innovation outcomes is often linked to the so-called valley of death, which is a place where many of the results from industry-academia research and innovation projects end up (Maughan et al., 2013). Bridging the valley of death requires new approaches to traditional project management (Hansen et al., 2017; Jonsson et al., 2015; Laine et al., 2015). Previously, a qualitative research study was conducted in order to gain understanding of the underlying reasons for innovation project challenges, and how to facilitate the projects to better achieve the research and innovation goals (Hansen et al., 2017; Hansen et al., 2018; Hansen et al., 2019a; Hansen et al., 2019c; Hansen et al., 2019b). The study proposes management practices that can increase the innovation potential from industry-academia research and innovation projects. It is proposed that implementation of practices should be done in three project stages, including planning, execution, and evaluation. These management practices seemed to be associated with the agile principles, which are the fundamentals of agile project management (APM) (Highsmith, 2009). APM has proven to be very effective for innovation projects within software development (Rigby et al., 2016b). Nevertheless, due to its inherent focus on responding rapidly to changing conditions, APM has also dispersed into other areas like manufacturing, sales, and marketing (Conforto et al., 2014; Cooper & Sommer, 2016; Nelson, 2008; Rigby et al., 2016a; Rigby et al., 2018; Zhang & Sharifi, 2007). Agile development has also spurred interest in the research community within collaborative industry-academia projects, and several studies refer to beneficial use of the agile principles. However, the studies largely concern software development, thus necessitating a call for studies on the agile principles’ application in other areas of product development (Marchesi et al., 2007; Sandberg et al., 2011;  Sandberg & Crnkovic, 2017). To contribute to this body of knowledge, this study explores project leaders’ personal opinions about the importance of agile principles in industry-academia research and innovation projects in the manufacturing domain. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: “Background” gives insight into the theory of APM and the knowledge gap concerning the application of agile principles to industry-academia research and innovation projects. “Research Objective, and Research Questions” introduces the research objective and the research questions. “Methodology” presents methodology and research design, including the data collection and analysis method. “Results” presents the findings related to the research questions, while “Discussion” discusses these results. “Conclusion” concludes the study.",2

Carayannis,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The world is significantly changing, shifting from the industrial era to the era of intelligence, where connected products have had wide consequences for society and particularly for organisations (Sanchez, 2017). The rapid development of digital technology has brought profound shifts in the strategies and operations in diverse sectors worldwide. Digital transformation has been described as the modern struggle to survive the threat of digital disruption (Li, 2020). The challenge in leadership is not to develop new strategies and business models and new organisational projects carrying digital technologies, nor to carry them through as planned, but to successfully manage the transition between the present stage of the organisation towards the desired future condition, frequently evaluating and recalibrating the path and destiny of the organisation, using emergent intelligence (Li, 2018; Ross et al., 2019). Digital transformation technologies emerged as a growing dominant paradigm that should be considered to enable organisations’ viability and success through time. Digital transformation includes an array of technologies, such as cloud systems, big data, predictive analysis, and interactive platform technologies, which create opportunities and challenges in organisations today (Jackson, 2019). In the business environment existing today, companies are being pressured to rethink their business models, products, and processes, given the challenges and opportunities presented by what is commonly known as digital transformation (Daspit, 2017; Killian & McManus, 2015; Onetti et al., 2012; Rogers, 2016). Digital transformation (DT) has become increasingly more important, in the past decade, both in the academic world and in businesses (Babin & Grant, 2019; Li et al., 2018a, b; Lucas et al., 2013). By performing SLR, we can investigate the following questions: What issues related to digital transformation are considered when business strategies are the objects of study? How does digital transformation change business strategies? Answering these research questions brings a contribution that spans both academic and practical dimensions. The study presents a table with the studies produced in this area and their main findings, which provides an overview of what has been done in this field. Gaps in the literature are also identified and, consequently, a suggestion for future lines of research is made. In practical terms, the study contributes for organisations impacted by digital transformation to understand that they need to make changes in business strategy. In this scenario, it has become necessary to understand how digital transformation has changed business strategies. To fulfil this goal, a systematic review of the literature was performed, analysing 45 articles found in the Web of Science database, focusing on digital transformation and strategic management. The results show that studies dealing with the relationship between DT and strategic management are incipient. Furthermore, the literature review was categorised into six main thematic groups: (i) analysis of external environment, (ii) analysis of internal environment, (iii) strategy formulation, (iv) strategy implementation, (v) evaluation and control, and (vi) feedback and learning. The structure of the present article starts with the presentation of digital transformation and strategic management concepts. Next, it presents the methodology used and the process of literature selection utilised. Finally, the research results are presented, followed by conclusions.",17

13.0,4.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,17 November 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00851-5,An Empirical Note on the Long-Run Effects of Public and Private R&D on TFP,December 2022,Dierk Herzer,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Although industrial firms perform the bulk of applied research and development (R&D) that is necessary before introducing new products to the marketplace, the increase in academic patenting since the 1980s documents that researchers in universities and other public research organizations engage in applied commercial research and thereby directly contribute to the stock of applied technological knowledge—like their counterparts in industry. In addition, university researchers and other public scientists engage in basic scientific research. To the extent that basic scientific research in universities and other public research organizations enhances the productivity of applied R&D in industry, public R&D should also have an additional, indirect effect on the stock of applied technical knowledge. Thus, one would expect to find that both public and private R&D increase total factor productivity (TFP), with a greater long-run elasticity for public than private R&D. The evidence to support this expectation is, however, far from conclusive. Guellec et al. (2004), using a panel of 16 OECD countries over the period 1980–1998, Luintel et al. (2014), employing panel data for 16 OECD countries between 1982 and 2004, and Pegkas et al. (2020), based on data from a panel of 19 Eurozone countries for the period 1995–2016, find a positive and significant effect of private R&D and public R&D on TFP, but their results provide no clear evidence of a greater long-run elasticity for public R&D: in Guellec et al.’s (2004) study, the long-run public R&D elasticity is greater than the long-run private R&D elasticity in one of two specifications; the results of Luintel et al. (2014) show a greater long-run elasticity for public R&D in two of three specifications, and in Pegkas et al.’s (2020) study, public R&D has a greater long-run elasticity than private R&D in three (and the same long-run elasticity as private R&D also in three) of eight specifications.Footnote 1 Somewhat different evidence is provided by Soete et al. (2020a), who find, based on time series data for the Netherlands over the period 1968–2014, that both private and public R&D activities have a significant positive long-run effect on TFP and that the long-run elasticity for private R&D is greater than the long-run elasticity for public R&D. This finding is partially consistent with that of Ziesemer (2020a), who performs separate time series analyses for Austria, Canada, France, Italy, and Portugal for the period 1963–2014, and finds for Austria and Italy that public R&D affects TFP only indirectly through its positive effect on private R&D. However, his results for Portugal suggest that while public R&D has a positive long-run effect on TFP, private R&D has no long-run effect on TFP. For Canada, in contrast, he finds positive effects of both public and private R&D, whereas he reports negative effects of both public and private R&D for France. And for Japan, he finds in another study, based on data for the period 1963–2017, that public R&D affects TFP indirectly (positively) through its positive effect on private R&D (Ziesemer, 2020b). Similarly, Soete et al. (2020b) find in simulations based on separate time series analyses for 17 countries for the period 1975–2014 that the effect of public R&D is positive in 12 and negative in 5 cases (including Canada, France, Ireland, Spain, and the UK) and that this effect acts mainly through private R&D.Footnote 2 Bengoa et al. (2017), using a panel of 17 Spanish regions over the period 1980–2007, and Voutsinas and Tsamadias (2014), employing time series data for Greece for the period 1981–2007, however, detect a positive and significant long-run effect only for public R&D. In contrast, Coe et al. (2009) find, based on regressions for a 24-country OECD panel for the period 1971–2004, that while public R&D is not robustly significant, private R&D is positive and significant. This latter finding is partially consistent with that of van Elk et al. (2019), who find, in a panel study of 20 OECD countries for the period 1971–2002, that private R&D is consistently positive and mostly significant, whereas their results for public R&D are mixed, ranging from negative to positive effects. Finally, Erken et al.’s (2009) panel study of 20 OECD countries over the period 1971–2002 shows a significant positive long-run relationship between private R&D and TFP and a significant negative long-run relationship between public R&D and TFP.Footnote 3 Thus, the existing literature regarding the effects of public and private R&D on TFP is conflicting, and no studies provide conclusive evidence that both public and private R&D drives TFP growth and that public R&D has a greater long-run effect on TFP than private R&D. However, a potential problem with the existing literature is that all studies, whether using time series or panel data, measure public and private R&D activity using real stocks of public and private R&D capital, constructed from deflated public and private R&D expenditure data based on the GDP deflator. The R&D data underlying these studies are thus based on the assumption of identical price deflators for GDP, public R&D expenditures, and private R&D expenditures. Since this assumption is likely to be violated in many years,Footnote 4 changes in public and private R&D expenditures/stocks may, in part, reflect measurement error rather than real changes in public and private R&D activity, and this measurement error may lead to biased estimates of the long-run elasticities of TFP with respect to public and private R&D. Thus, it is possible that some of the conflicting and counterintuitive findings in the literature reflect biases associated with the use of stocks of public and private R&D capital. An additional potential problem with the existing literature is that the panel studies use so-called first-generation panel unit root and cointegration methods, which assume cross-sectional independence of the error terms and thus that there are no unobserved common factors in the error terms.Footnote 5 If this assumption is violated, these methods may produce biased results. Some studies, therefore, account for error cross-sectional dependence using time dummies (Guellec et al., 2004; Erken et al., 2009; Bengoa et al., 2017). However, the implicit assumption behind the use of time dummies is that the effects of the common factors are homogeneous across the cross-sectional units. If this assumption does not hold, then the use of time dummies may be ineffective in eliminating error cross-sectional dependence (e.g., Pedroni, 2007). Thus, some of the results in the literature may be biased because of failure to (adequately) account for potential cross-sectional dependence. A final critique is that the literature does not provide theoretical models of the effects of public and private R&D on TFP.Footnote 6 Indeed, the literature provides possible explanations for (i) why private R&D may have an insignificant effect on TFP, such as low levels of private R&D activity or low power of statistical tests with small samples (e.g., Voutsinas & Tsamadias, 2014); (ii) why public R&D may have an insignificant or even negative effect on TFP, such as crowding out of private R&D by public R&D or collinearity between the public and private R&D variables (e.g., Erken et al., 2009); and (iii) why public R&D may have a positive effect on TFP, such as direct and/or indirect TFP effects (e.g., Soete et al., 2020b), but these explanations would be more convincing if they were supported by a theoretical model that formalizes the effects of public and private R&D on TFP and provides a framework to predict these effects. Given these limitations and the conflicting findings in the current literature, further examination of the impact of public and private R&D on TFP is warranted. Clarification of this issue is important for two related reasons. First, TFP is a measure of the stock of technological knowledge, and most growth models predict that the accumulation of technical knowledge (technological progress), rather than factor accumulation, is the main cause of economic growth. This is supported by a growing body of evidence suggesting that TFP, rather than factor accumulation, accounts for most of the income and growth differences across countries and over time (e.g., Easterly & Levine, 2001; Hall & Jones, 1999; Hsieh & Klenow, 2010). It is therefore important to know what determines TFP. Second, semi-endogenous growth models suggest that TFP is determined in the long run by R&D effort (e.g., Jones, 1995, 2002).Footnote 7 Although these models generally assume that R&D is performed only by the private sector, an integral part of a nation’s research system is the public sector, which performs research in various institutions, including universities. It is thus of considerable interest to policymakers to know how specifically public R&D, as an active policy variable, affects TFP—particularly at a time of increasing pressure on public finances. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to provide further evidence on the long-run effects of public and private R&D on TFP, based on a theoretical framework and using an alternative measure of public/private R&D activity and a number of different estimation approaches. Specifically, this study makes three contributions to the literature. First, it is the first to present a theoretical model to formalize the intuition that both the long-run TFP elasticity with respect to private R&D and the long-run TFP elasticity with respect to public R&D are positive and that the latter is greater than the former. The theoretical model also provides a formal justification of the empirical model used to estimate the long-run TFP elasticities of public and private R&D. Second, we are the first to use first- and second-generation panel unit root and cointegration techniques to examine the long-run TFP effects of public and private R&D; second-generation panel unit root and cointegration methods explicitly account for potential error cross-sectional dependence. It should, perhaps, be noted here that our decision to use panel methods is guided by the fact that hypothesis tests based on panel data have higher power than that based on time series data and that the data availability does not allow us to perform separate, meaningful time series analyses. Third, and our main contribution, we are the first to use numbers of public and private researchers as measures of public and private R&D activity to estimate the long-run elasticities of TFP with respect to public and private R&D. The advantage of using the number of public/private sector researchers is that this measure does not depend on prices and is thus more likely to reflect real public/private R&D activity and thus to yield more intuitively plausible results than the perpetual inventory stock of public/private R&D capital. To support this argument, we also employ stocks of public and private R&D capital to estimate the long-run TFP elasticities with respect to public and private R&D and to compare the estimates based on the stocks with those obtained from using the numbers. To preview our main results, we find, using numbers of researchers in the public and private sector, that there is strong evidence of significant positive long-run effects of public and private R&D on TFP and that, consistently across all estimation methods employed in this study, the long-run elasticity of TFP with respect to public R&D is greater than that with respect to private R&D. In contrast, we find mixed results regarding the long-run effects of public and private R&D on TFP using public and private R&D stocks. The structure of this note is as follows. The “Theoretical Framework” section presents the theoretical framework that guides the empirical analysis. The empirical methodology, including the estimation equation and data, is discussed in the “Empirical Methodology” section. The “Empirical Results” section presents the results, and the final section presents implications and conclusions.",1

The impetus was mainly the dedication of globalization through the opening of markets, the elimination of various constraints, the rapid and steady increase in international trade, and the volume of financial transactions, including foreign direct investment (FDI), which has become a major milestone of the world economy. In this respect, many developing countries, including Tunisia, have sought to explore, in addition to their own available resources, external means of allowing the global economic system to achieve economic growth by relying on FDI inflows for its leadership, thereby supporting economic growth and stability. Most of the studies and theories that have discussed the reasons for economic growth have concentrated on the main role played by FDI inflows, that is, generating income by increasing the value of total production (Findlay, 1978; Hsiao & Shen, 2003; Kinda, 2010, Shahbaz et al., 2015). On other hand, studies have found that the level of urbanization and per capita income is largely correlated with no ambiguous evidence of causality direction (Henderson, 2010; Liddle and Messinis, 2015). From this perspective, FDI inflows can affect positively the urbanization in host countries because it leads to industrialization and growth. However, on the other hand, FDI inflows, urbanization, and industrialization may be positively correlated with environmental degradation, which in turn harms economic growth (Abdouli & Hammami, 2016). Despite consensus on the benefits of FDI for host countries, particularly in the process of economic development, there are differences regarding its impacts on environmental pollution in these countries. An assertion has been that developing countries depend on reducing their environmental standards to attract as many FDIs as possible. This phenomenon has led to the creation of the so-called pollution havens hypothesis (Grossman & Krueger, 1991). This hypothesis arises as developing countries compete with one another over FDI through continuation and reduction of environmental standards and controls imposed on industrial and productive activities because investors tend to be less stringent or have no regulatory frameworks (Gray, 2002). According to this hypothesis, FDI, through its enhancing of high-level economic activities in developing countries, increases pollution/gas emissions (Acharyya, 2009). Although FDI may improve the environment in developing countries when the investment climate is surrounded by the tools and legal regulations that ensure this (Shahbaz et al., 2015), according to this hypothesis, known as the “pollution halo hypothesis,” multinational corporations can have better environmental management systems for host countries, which increases environmental standards and environmental awareness in these countries (Hoffmann et al., 2005). What is more, there is an emerging view that the impact of FDI inflows on environmental quality depends on the quality of certain institutional factors such as good governance and on the technological development factors in the host countries. These factors are seen complementary to FDI in reducing CO2 emissions (Omri & Bel Hadj, 2020). Furthermore, there may be an indirect environmental impact of FDI by providing incentives for industrialization and urbanization (Chen & Wu, 2017). Therefore, it would be interesting to examine the dynamic relationship between FDI inflows, technological innovation, industrialization, and urbanization and their environmental impact in order to develop sound economic and environmental policies. The impact FDI inflows, technological innovation, industrialization, and urbanization on the environment have been intensively examined in a lot of empirical studies which are summarized in the literature review section; however, there are conflicting and inconclusive results. Some of the factors distinguishing the results include, among others, the method of estimation, the timeframe and the control variables employed. Interestingly, it is clear that these studies do not consider structural breaks in the series that are caused by, for example, certain shocks such as geopolitical, economic, social due to the lack of appropriate study techniques. In addition, these studies do not take into account the complementarities of certain factors that may influence the effect of other variables on the phenomenon under study. However, the failure to take these issues into consideration can lead to biased results and therefore to misleading policy recommendations. The present study attempts to avoid this gap by addressing the relationship among FDI inflows, urbanization, industrialization, and technological innovation and CO2 emissions in Tunisia. Meanwhile, our study extends the previous studies in several directions. First, we investigate the impact of urbanization and FDI inflows on carbon emissions for the Tunisian economy in the context of the Kuznets environmental curve (EKC). Furthermore, we examine the conditional impact of technological innovation on the linkage between FDI inflows and CO2 emissions. The technological innovation is employed as a policy variable, which reduces the adverse environmental influences of FDI inflows. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze this interaction between these variables for the Tunisian economy. Second, methodologically, we have applied the Shahbaz et al. (2019) new unit root test (SOR) to analyze the unit root properties of series contain structural breaks, both smooth and sharp. Third, we have determined the order of the cointegration among variables using the McNown et al. (2018) proposed bootstrapping ARDL testing technique which is seen as robust in terms of generating results by controlling for low power and size characteristics. Finally, we have looked for any causal relationship among the variables through a bootstrapping process based on the vector error correction model (VECM) Granger causality method. The remainder of the paper is as follows. The “Literature Review” section examines the corresponding literature. The “Model, Methodological Strategy, and Data” section poses the empirical model, the methodological strategy, and the collected data. The empirical results are presented and discussed in the “Empirical Result” section, and finally, the “Conclusion and Policy Recommendations” provides conclusion with policy implications.",6

Oil has also been a major determinant of the development path and quality in the Kingdom from the early 1970s to date. In this regard, Peterson and Sayigh (1984) highlighted that oil is a strategic asset since it is an important product in the industry and effectively affects various economic sectors, namely, finance and banking. However, oil is an important asset in global trade and a major source of revenue for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which leads to the accumulation of large financial surpluses that have had and still have a major impact on economic growth and development, particularly in the industry and services sectors. Oil prices and economic growth have always been historically intermingled. Indeed, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia—like other countries—was affected by global oil price shocks and has tried to bypass their negative log-term effects on economic growth through the vision 2030 scheme. The latter mainly aims at creating a favorable environment for business opportunities, enlarging the economic base, and creating jobs for all Saudis. This can be reached by highlighting Saudi Arabia’s unique location and potential, attracting the most qualified talent, increasing foreign investment, and launching and supporting the promising sectors in manufacturing to foster their success so that they become new backbones of the economy. Moreover, it is important to work towards localizing renewable energy and industrial entrepreneurship to enhance economic diversity and sustainability. Yet, despite being essential backbones of the economy, oil and gas have started boosting the investments into additional sectors. The importance of our study lies in designing a statistical model based on the vision 2030 economic hub goals, and this is precisely what differentiates it from previous studies. Thus, our approach relies on analyzing the effect of oil price shocks together with some significant macroeconomic variables conducted by the vision, as well as their effect on Saudi Arabia’s economic growth, especially that the Kingdom is regarded as an oil-exporting country in the light of vision 2030 during the 1969–2019 period. In line with the above, the issue to be raised here is whether oil price shocks permanently affect economic growth, and whether non-oil exports, foreign direct investment, domestic net investment, total reserves, and balance of payments have respectable deviations policies that make economic growth negatively affected by oil price shocks. The vision 2030 economic goals in the economic hub are outlined as follows. The first is increasing the non-oil exports share in non-oil GDP from 16 to 50%, so that non-oil government income will jump from SAR163 billion to SAR1 trillion. The second is boosting the oil and gas sector localization from 40 to 75%. Also, boosting the international level of foreign direct investment from 3.8 to 5.7% of GDP, so that the public investment funds will jump from SAR600 billion to over SAR7 trillion. In addition, vision 2030 aspires to boost by 5% the contribution of the non-profit sector to GDP and to attract one million volunteers annually (Vision 2030, 2016). Another goal is founding a diversified and effective financial sector as well as stimulating savings, finance, and investment; this can be achieved if financial institutions are given the opportunity to promote private sector growth, create an advanced capital market, and support financial planning. Finally, vision 2030 aspires to optimize oil and non-oil government revenues and attain fiscal sustainability (Vision 2030, 2016). Thanks to the National Companies Promotion Vision Realization Program, more than 100 firms had the chance to move from local to leading regional firms, and even from leading regional firms to leading international ones. Such an upgrade will enhance the overall quality of the services provided and contribute to cutting costs. Besides, this will reinforce the government’s focus on its legislative and regulatory role; hence, the vision 2030 targets can be met. Thus, in the light of vision 2030, the specific research questions that this study seeks to answer are as follows: • How global oil prices shocks affect the economic growth? • How do non-oil exports affect the economic growth? • How foreign direct investment affects the economic growth? and • How domestic net investment affects the economic growth? 
Also, in the light of vision 2030, the paper aims to investigate the following objectives:
 • The effects of global oil price shocks on the economic growth; • The effects of non-oil exports on the economic growth; • The effects of foreign direct investment on the economic growth; and • The effects of domestic net investment on the economic growth.",4

The COVID-19 pandemic is global shock and is the most acute global crisis of our time. It reflects the structural weaknesses of many countries and exacerbates economic inequalities. While countries have to face the consequences of the pandemic, policy makers seek effective and balanced solutions to address both: the public health challenges and the needs of economic recovery. Although it is too early to specify what economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic will be, economists largely agree that it will have serious negative impacts on the global economy (Makoni, 2020; Maliszewska et al., 2020; Ozili & Thankom, 2020). Observers highlight the fact that the economic damages caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are largely driven by a fall in demand (Ascani et al, 2020; Montenovo et al., 2020; Yagan, 2019). This may affect job creation, and unemployment is likely to increase sharply (Coibion et al., 2020a, b; Forsythe et al., 2020; Guerrieri et al., 2020). In the case of Tunisia, such a scenario would be catastrophic for the economy as the unemployment rate is already persistent and excessively high. The massive and brutal shock caused by the corona virus pandemic and by the business interruption measures taken to stem it represents the deepest global recession since World War II. Indeed, an unprecedented number of countries have witnessed a decline in their production per capita. As a result, economies are slowed down, causing many businesses to face disruptions in demand and supply chains; many of their employees stayed at home and were, therefore, unable to ensure production and service delivery. Developing countries were relatively spared from the consequences of the international financial crisis of 2008. However, COVID-19’s crisis has caused severe recessions. The collapse of trade and investment, commodity prices, and the drying up of external sources of finance were the main channels of transmission of the crisis to developing countries. Thus, vulnerable populations will, likely, pay the heaviest price bringing social issues back to the fore. Forecasts point to a significant drop in per capita incomes. That will cause unemployment and, possibly, extreme poverty over years. Indeed, lower middle-income countries (LMIC) find themselves in a particularly difficult position to deal with it. Hard hit by external shocks, LMICs undergo strong internal contractions caused by the spread of the virus and by the containment measures aimed at containing it. At the same time, scarce resources and weak institutions have limited the ability of many developing country governments to support their country's economy. For that, developing countries’ priority was to deal with the economic emergency. They must find solutions that restore economic recovery and tackle deepening poverty and unemployment. The crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was exceptional. It was shaped up to be the most severe recession in advanced economies since World War II. In these economies, economic activity was experiencing serious disruptions that have hit domestic supply and demand, as well as trade and finance. Developed countries that lean heavily on world trade, tourism, and exports were considered to be the most affected by the crisis. Tunisia has long stood out on the African continent by solid growth, by its openness to foreign trade and foreign investment in the “offshore” sector, but also by better results than its neighbors in terms of reducing the rate of unemployment, health, education, poverty reduction, and gender equality (Diwan, 2019; Labidi, 2019). Tunisia, after almost perfectly handling the first wave of COVID-19 in mid-2020, the country fell into a deep political, economic, and later health crisis. In this context, an immediate priority for the Tunisian government is to understand the extent to which the COVID-19 will affect employment in the different economic sectors. In fact, this study examines the impact of COVID-19 on the Tunisian employment. Compared to the work carried out until now, the novelty of this research lies in using the Markov Chain process to determine what will happen in the long run once the pandemic is gone. The Markov chain model is well suited to predict the structural changes, such as those caused by the COVID-19 pandemic when the discrete states are easy to distinguish. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. “The Evolution of Tunisia’s Employment Policy” section presents the evolution of the employment policy in Tunisia and the measures undertaken to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 on the labor market. “Empirical Studies of the Economic Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic” section reports the main empirical studies of the economic impact of COVID-19. “Model and Empirical Estimation” section presents the methodological and empirical results. The paper concludes with recommendations based on the empirical study and lessons retained from others countries.",3
14.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,07 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00831-9,Facilitating and Inhibiting Effects of Organisational Ambidexterity in SME: an Analysis Centred on SME Characteristics,March 2023,José Andrade,Mário Franco,Luis Mendes,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Studies made in organisational ambidexterity (OA) in recent years have followed different explanatory perspectives of how this phenomenon emerges in firms. In the context of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), careful analysis of the literature identifies various perspectives all explaining that process, above all relating the concept to a number of areas of research, such as innovation (Karlsson et al., 2015), organisational learning (Cegarra-Navarro & Dewhurst, 2007), dynamic capabilities (Li et al., 2014) or organisational performance (Bouncken et al., 2016). The multiple approaches to OA show both the fragmented nature of those studies and the need to construct a new explanatory model. From macro approaches to micro approaches, what has essentially been missing is an integrative approach to how OA can effectively be developed (O’Reilly & Tushman, 2013; Gibson & Birkinshaw, 2004; Chang et al., 2011). Some studies also tried to follow this path. The contribution of Raisch and Birkinshaw (2008) attempted to show the elements found at the basis of exploitation and exploration activities with an effect on the formation of OA environments, and Simsek et al. (2009) summarised the different knowledge by constructing a typology joining the main theories, antecedents and results. Other authors evidenced the dichotomic nature of OA based on exploration and exploitation and on the strategic perspective both hold for firms (Chang & Hughes, 2012), while other researches tried to discern the swings between exploration and exploitation according to management of existing resources (Dasí et al., 2014). However, the different proposals to explain the phenomenon point to a heterogeneous nature of OA, where the combined influence of internal and external elements affects its manifestation in SMEs. However, SMEs are a type of company with very specific and unique characteristics. These characteristics hinder the potential impact that these companies may have on the economy. Despite its importance in countries’ economies, a growing body of literature has focused on the conditions under which SMEs’ performance can be improved, particularly at the level of OA (Stettner & Lavie, 2014; Venugopal et al., 2019; Voss & Voss, 2013; Wang, & Rafiq, 2014). OA, as a capability (O’Reilly & Tushman, 2013), has attracted the attention of an important body of researchers in recent years. The contributions have focused mainly on the study of OA at the level of large companies, despite starting to appear in the relevant literature on SMEs (Yang & Li, 2011). However, regarding research in the context of SMEs, literature has not presented approaches focusing on SMEs’ characteristics and their relationship with OA. In this sense, and seeking to make an important contribution to literature, this study presents a theoretical approach that aims to launch a new research path with regard to OA in the specific context of SMEs and its unique characteristics, such as its small size, structure and internal context or low level of management practices. The unique characteristics of SMEs make this type of firms special regarding management and leadership practices that can be adopted. The difficulty often lies in these characteristics’ specificity and in the way in which these characteristics can relate to and influence objectives of competitiveness and performance. The relevance of this research topic is, therefore, important for management. Therefore, the objective of this study is to define a theoretical approach based on a multi-level perspective, explaining how SMEs’ characteristics can influence OA in these firms. The aim is to contribute to clarifying the potential influence of those characteristics on OA. From this perspective, and considering the specific nature of SMEs, a theoretical framework is drawn up aiming to understand how the characteristics of SMEs can influence OA. It is therefore important to propose a systematisation that explains how those characteristics influence the development of OA in the SME context. This study contributes to research on OA in four ways: (i) it gives a centralised vision of the possible combinations of SME characteristics for OA; (ii) it helps to align research on OA in SMEs; and (iii) it proposes a theoretical approach analysing how SME characteristics may act as antecedents of OA, from a multi-level approach; (iv) it contributes to spreading the concept in the common language of management and among SME managers. The article has the following structure: the first part analyses the bases of organisational ambidexterity, contextualised in the literature in the form of antecedents. The second part seeks to present a wide-ranging, systematised perspective and maps the characteristics of SMEs with the antecedents for OA. The paper ends with a synthesis of the main contributions to theory and practice, limitations, as well as guidelines for future research.",5

Existing literature has highlighted different methods in which foreign direct investment is influenced by institution indicators. Three vital factors have augmented the importance of the link between institutions and FDI. First, North (1990) proposed the institution’s importance in improving development and investment. Second, as seen from the previous two decades, developed countries are concerned about the improvement of institutions as a means to attract more FDI to their countries. Third, foreign firms are more concerned about the country’s quality of institutions in which they invest (Bevan & Estrin, 2004). Ali et al. (2010) highlighted that FDI is attracted by strong institutions but discouraged by poor institutions. Foreign investment plays a vital role in the development of G7 countries. The firms of G7 countries are concerned about the institutions in decisions of foreign investment and the natural resources present in host countries. In 2009, the FDI outward of G7 countries to OECD countries was 57 thousand billion US dollars, but in 2012, it increased to 60 thousand billion US dollars, and in 2017, it increased to 97 thousand billion US dollars (see Table 1). In 2009, the fuel resources were 7.13% and ore and metal were 6.6% in OECD countries, but in 2012, fuel increased to 9.34% and ore and metal increased to 6.99, and in 2017, fuel decreased to 6.58% and ore and metal decreased to 6.40 (see Table 1). Natural resources such as fuel and non-fuel resources have a vital role in “Institutions”. Wegenast (2013), Eregha and Mesagan (2016), and Aleksynska and Havrylchyk (2013) investigated whether better quality of institutions increases outward foreign direct investment and weak quality of institutions reduces outward foreign direct investment. Foreign direct investment has been revealed to boost economic growth in Asia (Hattari & Rajan, 2009) and to boost economic growth in OECD countries (Nair-Reichert and Weinhold, 2001; De Mello, 1999). Because a large segment of FDI goes to OECD countries from developing countries, in general, most papers in the literature deal with FDI to developing countries, for example, Busse et al. (2011) investigated bilateral FDI and rights of labor in developing countries, Frenkel et al. (2004) investigated bilateral FDI in G-5 to 22 emerging countries, Peter (2012) investigated bilateral FDI in Asia and global countries, Mengistu and Adhikary (2011) investigated governance and bilateral FDI in Asia countries, and Bannaga et al. (2013) investigated in Arab countries. In addition, it permits improved risk-sharing globally (Albuquerque, 2003). For more details of FDI relationships see Appendix Table 8. This study contributes to the previous literature through many aspects. First, institutions in OECD countries are strong but not trusted regarding exports of natural resources due to limited natural resources in OECD countries. Therefore, it is essential to recognize whether G7 countries are intentionally investing in the OECD countries that have strong institutions and limited natural resources or not? Second, in contrast to Kamal et al. (2020), we look at if the link between strong institutions and limited natural resources in host countries verifies the flow of G7 countries OFDI in a novel method, including exports of fuel resources and exports of ore and metal resources. Third, we use institutional factors and an institutional index of all factors as an interactive with natural resources exports to better identify the individual and collective impact of institutions on OFDI of G7 countries. Fourth, this study uses new data from 2009 to 2017 that did not find zero values, which was not used by previous studies because most of the previous studies used old data that reported many zero values that created issues in the model. Thus, we address the following major questions: What are the inspirations behind outward FDI of G7 countries to the OECD countries? What role does institutional quality of host countries play in the decision of G7 firms to invest in OECD countries? Does the strong quality of institutions and limited natural resources export influence G7 firms’ investment decisions in OECD countries? Does the strong quality of institutions, limited exports of fuel resources, and ore and metal resources of host countries attract more FDI of G7 countries to OECD countries? For this purpose, we apply system GMM by using the effect of institutional quality and natural resources of OECD countries on outward FDI of G7 countries. This study is structured as follows. “Theoretical and Empirical Literature”
 describes the theoretical and empirical literature, “Data” presents the dataset of the study, and “Econometric Methods and Model Specification” reports econometric methods. “Results and Discussions” explains the results and discussions of the study, and “Conclusion” presents the conclusions of the study.",4

The community is affecting from the development of the tourism sector in many ways because its role is recognized in boosting up economic growth and in the provision of other facilities to the locals. On contrary, tourism development is creating many negative externalities i.e. the communities are expected to agonize from traffic jams, crowding, increasing the crime rate, destruction of the environment and natural resources, and most prominently increasing the cost of living (Nunkoo & Ramkissoon, 2009). The attitude of locals is imperative because there are chances that a happy community is more likely to support and encourage tourism activities (Snaith & Haley, 1999). Several studies during the last decades explored the socio-cultural attitude and perception of the community towards tourism (Wall & Mathieson, 2006). Every community has different cultures, traditions, and values due to these facts the tourism development significantly affects them in many ways. This is the problem that is more prominent in the context of developing countries. Imperatively destination planner comprehends the perception of residents towards the impact of tourism. The movement of person from their home to other sites or countries for the sake of business and for recreational activities is recognized as tourism which involves societal and cultural factors. Tourism is a multidimensional viable activity which creates lots of job opportunities, revenue generation and most importantly tax collection from the hotel industries. It is the main source of foreign exchange earnings, economic development, new opportunities for business and entrepreneurial activities (Adnan Hye & Ali Khan 2013; Baloch, 2007; Goleldner et al., 2000; Khalil et al., 2007; Rana, 2015; Sinclair, 1998). To ensure the sustainable success in tourism, it is necessary to ensure the local community support and it became more important when it comes to the regional tourism destinations. Many researchers supported the fact that it is not possible to sustain tourism development without involving the local residents (Ahn et al., 2002; McCool et al., 2001; Twining-Ward & Butler, 2002). It is therefore, consideration of the local resident’s perception regarding the environmental, socio-economic and cultural impact on the local people would be very valued knowledge for the regional tourism development. Pakistan have world most beautiful places for visit, especially at its best in northern areas of Pakistan. This part of the country is famous all around the world because of sky high mountains, lush green valleys, mighty rivers, beautiful lakes, and amazing wildlife. The tourism sector is one of the potential sectors of Pakistan economy, which is growing at a faster rate. According to World Bank tourism revenue in Pakistan was USD818 Million in 2018 and is growing at an average rate of 3.13% annually. Gilgit Baltistan is one of the most beautiful places to visit in northern areas in Pakistan. It is one of the most frequently visited place by the tourists. The region has unique landscapes, evergreen forests, cold desert, snowcapped mountains, and a great cultural heritage. The people visit this place because of lush valleys, lakes, green meadows, high plateaus, and Rocky Mountains of Karakorum. It is worth mentioning the Gilgit Baltistan has 2nd highest mountain (K2) in the world, five mountains over 8000 m peaks, 101 peaks over 7000 m and 5100 Glaciers. According to the report of Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC), 1.7 million tourists visited Gilgit Baltistan in 2017 whereas Tourism Department, Government of Gilgit Baltistan, reported that the inflow of tourist to Gilgit-Baltistan is more than 150 thousand per anum. According to sources of Express Tribune, 700,000 tourists including local and foreign had visited Gilgit-Baltistan in 2021. Table 1 shows the basic information about the foreign and domestic tourist arrivals in Gilgit Baltistan during 9 years (2007–2015). In terms of numbers, the year 2007 witnessed the highest number of foreign tourists, while this number decreased to 2014 where it had the minimum number of foreign visitors. The decreased number of international tourists was attributed to the War on Terror, security issues and terrorism events in the country. Due to poor security issues in the country, the tourism industry has also been irreparably damaged. Such uncertain situations in Pakistan has prevented the majority of tourists from visiting northern-areas especially Gilgit Baltistan. For domestic tourists the data shows an increasing trend from 2007 to 2011 with a slight change in 2010 and a major shift in 2012. The year 2012 marked the minimum while 2015 marked the maximum number of tourists visiting GB. The year 2015 had the highest number of domestic visitors which shows a great change in people’s perceptions about security. One of the reasons for such increased numbers of domestic visitors was the use of social media and electronic media. People have shared hundreds of scenic pictures on social media platforms and a large number of news reports were also published from media houses which helped in the promotion of domestic tourism (Sadiq et al. 2019). The cultural tourism and beautiful scenery are very famous in Gilgit Baltistan. It is home to various cultural, linguistic, and ethnic groups. Its cultural, physical environment and landscape are reasons for attracting tourists from inside and outside the country. Hiking, climbing, paragliding, and camping are adventurous activities for tourists. Tourism plays a key role in producing income in the Gilgit Baltistan region of Pakistan. However, the increased economic activities from tourism have also increased the level of pollution, noise, and congestion, and put additional burdens on water and energy resources. Furthermore, mismanaged and unplanned tourism have certain effects on local communities and the ambient environment (Sadiq et al., 2019). Besides, Gilgit Baltistan is inherited by people from different sects and they have a diversity of their culture, customs, and traditions. However, the large influx of tourist in the area badly affects the local community’s norms, tradition, and culture. With this background, the present paper attempts to explore the perception of local community regarding socio-economic, environmental, and cultural impact of tourism in in highly frequent tourism spot Gilgit Baltistan, Pakistan. The paper also evaluates the local community participation in tourism development in Gilgit Baltistan. Finding of the paper will help policy makers to devise sustainable tourism policies for Gilgit Baltistan by involving the local people and incorporating their decision in tourism development projects. Findings of the paper can be used to improve the development of tourism, sustainability, and hospitality in Gilgit Baltistan.",3

In this context, the policy of the exploitation of research finds its origin in the law of orientation No 96-6 of January 31, 1996, stipulating that the national policy of scientific research and technological development aims to ensure the valorization of the results of research and their application. Referring to the law No 2008-19 of 25 February 2008, the mission of higher education is to enhance the results of research in the areas of training, research, and development. The emergence of what is now known as a knowledge-based economy has drawn attention to the production, distribution, and dissemination of knowledge, and especially the transfer of knowledge and skills from the research system to the knowledge-based economy. In the same vein, the investment in R&D is too low. It shows a good quality of scientific expertise, but the results of  the R&D production remain ineffective (Ramzi & Salah, 2018). It has no significant impact on the social or economic sectors. To ensure the well-being of their population, and for some reasons of international competitiveness, the governments of most industrialized countries, as well as major emerging countries, have invested significant sums in public research. Against this efficient policy, which considers strategic investment, the Tunisian government has decided to reduce funds dedicated to R&D to be just 0.6% of GDP in  2019 (1.1% of GDP in 2009), and much less after. Moreover, the major problem facing the national research system is the valorization of the results of  R&D that faced many difficulties. Tunisia is relatively strong regarding scientific output, more precisely, concerning the number of scientific publications. Nevertheless, it does not perform well regarding technological production by referring to the indicators relating to patent filings and technology exports. Despite the partial measures taken by the policymakers, research valorization is not progressing in Tunisia. Stagnation concerns the multiple forms of the valorization of research understood here in its broadest aspect is the set of relations between public research and the  industry. Significant parts of public research remain sidelined, especially in universities, and the rest of the public research institutions under the Ministry of Higher Education. The Ministry of Education and Scientific Research has created several financial devices and instruments since the 1990s. The purpose of this setup is to promote the process of developing academic research. However, it turns out that this launch is not able to establish lasting relationships with the actors of the socio-economic world. Until today, most of all surveys examining researchers’ views have focused on the biomedical and life sciences, prompting questions about whether researchers outside these areas share similar opinions. In our case study, we are going to make an intersection between the most important surveys on the theme of the valuation of scientific research, drawing inspiration from all these results to adapt our research tools to the context of the least innovative countries which are experiencing structural and organizational difficulties in the R&D sector, where the production of knowledge is not the only problem, but how to boost the process of valorization and stimulate the actors and the tools in it constitutes the real failure of this system. First, the data related to R&D are insufficient in terms of quantity and quality in developing countries. So, we will make an extra effort to overcome this issue by collecting data by using a survey and by addressing a wider population in a specific area, which is the R&D field. Two different, but compatible techniques will be used; these two methods form the basis of an extensive and perfect qualitative study, which is based on measurable and real data. First, through a survey dedicated to the various R&D players, the data will be closer to the reality of the sector. These data constitute the variables that will be used in an econometric analysis by deploying the PLS method. Furthermore, no theoretical or empirical study has simultaneously used both techniques, tools, which is an innovation in this article. No one has yet identified precisely which set of institutions and policies are the right ones to promote the valorization process of scientific knowledge. For example, McComas and Besley (2011) studied the influence of the external funding and academic-industry relationships on R&D directions in the Nanotechnology field, as well as the potential for conflicts of interest to arise and impact scientific integrity and public trust. A survey of 193 nanotechnology industry and academic researchers was conducted to explore whether they share similar concerns. The results of the survey show general agreement that funding sources are influencing research directions in nanotechnology; many respondents saw this influence in their work as well as other researchers’ work. Respondents also agreed that funding considerations were likely to influence whether researchers shared their results. However, our study is more extended, our results found differences in views depending on research fields, researcher’s institutional affiliation, and funding status. The present study extends this previous work to all R&D disciplines. This analysis adds to existing studies in two ways, it provides qualitative insights, thereby identifying details and issues not apparent in quantitative studies. A diagnosis of the research valorization process was conducted through a survey. This study is based on two objectives: first, it identifies the constraints that prevent the transfer of research results to the socioeconomic world. Second, it establishes solutions to promote the process of public research valorization based on the survey and the experiences of the pioneer countries in this field. Neither this sample of the individuals nor this period has been the subject of an investigation by other researchers in the literature. This study is organized as follows: The first part is dedicated to the literature review. The second part exposes our research methodology and results. The paper concludes with important recommendations and a discussion of implications for practice and further research. This issue remains an open debate between all theorists and academics, it is a part of the political agenda for governments of advanced countries, but it does not so for the less developed countries such as Tunisia. Public decision-makers are not yet aware of the importance of R&D as an engine of economic growth. If you have researchers and not enough funding, you cannot expect too much from R&D. The availability of public financial means is the ultimate problem for developing countries. R&D activity is mainly funded by two sources: public and private funding. The role of the government and the sector is very important in the promotion of R&D and the guarantee of a more efficient system of research valuation and transfer of knowledge. The government directly funds the R&D activities performed by public research centers and universities, and indirectly by lowering the cost of the R&D performed by the firms or the private institutions through subsidies and tax incentives or the generosity of the fiscal system. The governments must devote more resources to R&D more than other sectors. These resources have to modernize the infrastructure and cover the needs of the local researchers and engineers (Ramzi & Salah, 2018). According to Arrow (1962) and Nelson and Phelps (1966), state intervention must encourage public and private R&D by implementing incentives that affect the cost of private R&D and the quality of public R&D. Public funds directly finance the R&D activities carried out by public research centers and universities, and indirectly by lowering the cost of R&D carried out by the firms or private institutions through subsidies and tax incentives. The public financing of R&D increases wages and not the effort in research in the developed countries (Goolsbee, 1998). The study by David et al. (2000) confirms the complementary relationship between public funding and private investment in R&D (Coccia, 2011). Public and private R&D funding must increase together to cover the high cost of innovation. Porter and Stern (2000) were the first to study the determinants of innovation in OECD countries from 1973 to 1993. They insisted on the crucial role of public policy in the construction of an effective national system of innovation. Guellec and van Pottelsberghe de la Potterie (2003) studied the impact of public funding of R&D on private R&D in the case of 16 OECD countries between 1980 and 1998. They noted that public funding of R&D has a positive impact on the financing of private R&D, each dollar given to companies equals an average of $ 1.70 for R&D. Recently, Huergo et al. (2016) studied the impact of public support on the propensity of companies to engage in R&D in the Spanish case. They found that low-interest government loans for R&D projects stimulated private R&D. SMEs to benefit more than large companies. A loan as public support for R&D is an effective incentive in the Spanish economy. According to Jensen and Warren (2001), companies must be encouraged to invest in embryonic university research. Intellectual property rights are an incentive for innovation. Schumpeter (1942) indicated that R&D is an activity rewarded by the possession of a patent that generates profits for its owner. Indeed, the patent is a tool of protection against any attempt at imitation. It represents a position of strength for its holder and a reward that will generate sustainable cash flow for him. The stronger a country’s patent rights protection system, the higher is its R&D investment intensity (Ginarte and Park, 1997; Park and Lippoldt, 2005; Branstetter, 2006; Chu et al., 2012). Some economists such as Romer (1990) have admitted that the patent is an instrument for encouraging R&D and the transfer of scientific knowledge. The patent is not only a tool of protection. It should facilitate the production and transfer of knowledge among different actors in the research field. Mowery and Shane (2002) admitted that the university and the industry alliance are a form of the technology supply. Such alliances are a principal source for firms to acquire critical external knowledge. Sherwood and Covin (2008) collected data via a survey instrument from 104 industry managers who were used to explore the effects of various organizational knowledge interface factors on knowledge acquisition success in the university industry. They tried to explain how factors inherent in the knowledge acquisition context may affect the successful transference of technological knowledge from universities to their industry partners. Industrial organizations work with universities to gain access to intellectual knowledge and creative thinking within the academic environment. The development of a trusting relationship between the knowledge source and knowledge-seeking means the university and the industry. Furman et al. (2002) present an empirical examination of the determinants of country-level production of international patents. They introduce a novel framework based on the concept of national innovative capacity. A country with a strong capacity for innovation must be able to produce and commercialize a flow of innovative technology over the long term. To reach higher efficiency at the technological level, there are two factors: a modern infrastructure of R&D such as industrial clusters, a perfect environment in these clusters, and the strength of linkages between these two. They find that while a great deal of variation across countries is due to differences in the level of inputs devoted to innovation, more precisely to R&D manpower and spending. The production of international patents is centered around some policy choices like IP protection and openness to international trade, the share of research performed by the academic sector and funded by the private sector, the degree of technological specialization, and each country’s knowledge stock are the main mechanisms. There are several definitions in the literature on the concept of knowledge valorization, but they are not very different in logic. For example, Duranton (1999) defined this concept as the following: “To promote, is to make usable or commercialize the results, knowledge, and skills of research.” In specialized literature and international debates, experts sometimes speak of technology transfer offices (TTOs), sometimes of knowledge transfer offices (KTOs). According to Grant (1996), Grimpe and Hussinger (2013), universities are mostly regarded as a unique and valuable source of knowledge which is the most crucial asset for firms’ competitiveness. Mowery and Sampat (2004), D’Este and Patel (2007), and Veugelers and Del Rey (2014) claim that universities are the key organizations that generate and disseminate scientific knowledge widely. University knowledge is a substantial resource for industrial innovation and economic growth. The strongest link between scientific knowledge and industrial innovation is embodied in the interactions between university and industry. Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (1995, 2000) discussed the new “third mission” attributed to universities, which are becoming more active players in the research and innovation cycle in the university-industry-government helix. Consequently, universities have become more aware of the expected results of their R&D if they find the means to bring them to the market by establishing closer links with the industrial world or by establishing interface structures such as transfer offices of technologies and incubators (Etzkowitz, 1998; Baldini, 2006). Over the past decades, public decision-makers have encouraged public universities to actively contribute to R&D and to strengthen their interactions with companies by developing their activities beyond traditional teaching, and fundamental research missions (Giannopoulou et al., 2019). Therefore, universities must contribute more to economic innovation and growth by commercializing their research results. This new approach corresponds to the notion of entrepreneurial universities, according to Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff (2000). Veugelers and Del Rey (2014) argue that patenting and licensing are only a part of the transferring mechanism of scientific research results from academia to industry and may not even be the best means. Kline and Rosenberg (1986) and Stokes (1997) have shown that basic and applied research are not incompatible, but often complementary, and there is no unidirectional flow from science to industry. Moreover, Yongabo and Göransson (2020) suggest the importance to build the National Innovation System (NIS) to promote innovation. The gap between university researchers and the industrial sector is widening. In addition, the capacity to promote research results in universities and research laboratories remains insufficient in the absence of a real partnership between companies, research establishments, and specialized structures to promote R&D. Higher education research laboratories find that it is difficult to boost their applied research, knowing that they are doing more basic research. So, a collaboration between academia and industry is more essential. Coordination between universities and the socioeconomic world can accentuate the relevance of the university’s educational mission while proposing new avenues of more targeted and specialized research. The fundamental research in universities must be activated through university-industry partnerships (Ramzi & Salah, 2018). The literature defines other important and more interesting channels on the modalities of collaborations between university and industry such as advice, research collaborations, and student and researcher mobility informal networks (D'Este & Patel, 2007; Link et al., 2007; Bekkers & Bodas Freitas, 2008; Perkmann et al., 2013) Veugelers and Del Rey (2014) argued that industrialized countries rely heavily on generating knowledge and carrying out research and development to maintain economic welfare. The main objective is to integrate scientific research and technological advances. That is why policymakers want academic researchers to contribute much more to applied research, production, and even to the dissemination of technology. Collaboration in research is necessary for the industry more than for the universities. The firms search to maximize profits and to be competitive. Dooley and Kirk (2007) argued that the motivation for companies in the knowledge and academic thinking within universities. It can be utilized to deliver technologies, which can then help them improve their competitive positioning by building technology capabilities through developing enhanced products or services. The link between the research and innovation infrastructure and the industrial sector of a country is reciprocal: strong clusters and special intermediary agencies feed the common infrastructure and benefit from it. Collaborating institutions between the public and socioeconomic R&D sectors can link the two. However, Etzkowitz and Goktepe-Hulten (2010); Guerrero and Urbano (2012); and Philpott et al. (2011) adopt the idea that existing intermediary technology transfer agencies are not sufficient to integrate science and technology into the economy because their involvement extends the chain of knowledge and leads to the problems of creation and knowledge transfer. The university must change its classic role to be what is called the entrepreneurial university. It is a model of modern innovation, and its center of gravity is the university. Therefore, mainstream academics step out of their comfort zones, so they become entrepreneurial scientists. A country’s university system provides a particularly strong and open bridge between technology and business. However, it is not certain that the collaboration between university and industry is harmonious and tends in the same direction. According to Hillerbrand and Werker (2019), academia and industry face not only contradictory goals, such as maximizing profits or publishing as much as possible in the high impact journals, but also vague goals, such as solving the grand challenges of society, or transferring and applying knowledge from university to industry. Ivascu et al. (2016) proposed a general framework for the creation of a successful collaboration between universities and businesses. Private firms do not necessarily have all the competencies to succeed in the innovation cycle. Working together with universities makes it easier to reach problems that cannot be solved individually. To achieve these objectives, they used data collected in Romania. In this business model, they included knowledge sharing as a parameter. This essential element contains key success factors such as knowledge sharing publications, participation in face-to-face meetings and networking activities, mobility and employability availability, continuing education, lifelong learning, and intellectual property. These factors contribute to the development of relations between the university and industry based on open innovation win to win. Therefore, individual researchers in university-industry collaborations face vague goals on top of contradictory goals at the organizational level. Indeed, academics do not seem to face negative changes in their academic output when collaborating with industry partners. But, they generally remain hesitant to collaborate with the private sector. There are quantitative trials that have indicated there is no correlation between industry engagement and research performance concerning journal articles published by researchers such as the study conducted by Gulbrandsen and Smeby (2005). According to Lee (1996), academic performance, typically measured by publications, is not affected by collaborating with industry. University researchers remain skeptical of university-business collaboration. Carayol (2003) indicated that the sharing of intellectual property rights does not cover all aspects of collaboration with industry, leaving researchers to deal with it on their own. The last study was carried out by McComas (2012) which was a survey of 193 nanotechnology industry and academic researchers. The main objective is to explore whether they share similar concerns about the possible impact of private funding on the research direction and research ethics. Maybe, this kind of collaboration will distort the real value of public R&D, as well as the potential for conflicts of interest to arise and impact scientific integrity, and public trust. The results of the survey showed general agreement that funding sources are influencing research directions in nanotechnology; many respondents saw this influence in their work as well as other researchers’ work. The survey results indicated that a big part of the respondent agreed that funding considerations were likely to influence whether researchers shared their results. Irrespective of their institutional affiliation or funding status, twice as many researchers as not considered financial conflicts of interest a cause for concern, and three times as many respondents as not disagreed with financial conflicts of interest in nanotechnology were uncommon. Only a third were satisfied with the way that conflicts of interest are currently managed and believed current procedures would protect the integrity of nanotechnology research. The results also found differences in views depending on the researcher’s institutional affiliation and funding status. The ownership of the results of research partnerships can lead to tensions, and even disputes between the partners can be considered public laboratories as private companies. This is partly explained by the fact that universities and other public research organizations are evaluated partly based on the number of intellectual property titles (patents, etc.) They hold, while the exploitation of these titles is most often the responsibility of companies. Indeed, manufacturers will be in a strong position when research partnerships are financed almost entirely by private funds. The university must undertake this task to protect the rights of academic researchers. Universities and other public research centers can create new companies, so that, the academic research results must turn into an operational aspect. It is necessary to transform the discovery into a patent to make it transferable and exploitable from an economic point of view. The idea can be sold or exploited by creating a university spin-off. The creation of spin-off corresponds to the transition from research to industrial application. According to Pirnay and Surlemont (2003), the spin-offs are new firms created to exploit commercially some knowledge, technology, or research results developed within a university. The universities are searching for creative approaches and mechanisms that will stimulate and add further value to university-based spin-offs (Schiavone et al., 2014). Moreover, Battaglia et al. (2021a) have investigated how and why Proof of Concept programs (PoC) programs can favor the development and commercialization of research-based inventions (RBIs). In a recent study, Melnychuk et al. (2021) used a longitudinal analysis of a unique panel data set of 56 global pharmaceutical firms; they indicate that firms have successfully exploited valuable knowledge from preclinical research UIC in internal R&D, measured by the number of performing clinical trials. From a literature point of view, Pinto and Fernandes (2021a, b) identified the different university-industry cooperation (UIC) domains and the benefits of UIC. They argued that the collaborative R&D domain is the key ingredient for university-industry sustainable and long-term partnerships. According to Rip (2011), there has been a move toward the creation of alliances and mergers of universities, but also between universities and public research organizations. A new concept appears in several countries called research universities or the post-modern university. Such a university builds a more advanced partnership with centers of excellence, public laboratories of different types, and various private organizations managing and carrying out research projects. According to Hallonsten (2017), besides academia and private firms, the third sector of R&D deserves to be mapped and analyzed in greater detail to understand how various organizational actors interact to produce innovation. Most of the theoretical and empirical studies in innovation policy revolve around the role of universities and industry regarding R&D partnerships, where the focus is on technology transfer via the spin-offs and the promotion of industrial clusters around universities. However, Huenneke et al. (2017) argued that conflicts within faculty roles and other aspects of university operations influence the effectiveness of particular strategies for increasing research activity. In the literature, the third sector of R&D received less attention than the universities and the industry. Hallonsten (2017) argued that the attention of researchers to these organizations has been scarce. In this work, we will fill the gap in the literature by giving more importance to the third sector of national innovation systems which comprises nonacademic, publicly owned R&D organizations. Most theorists have shed light on the triple helix interaction, the R&D policies, and programs dedicated to foster research valorization. In some cases, the attitude and the preference of researchers toward R&D projects was a classic topic. Munari and Toschi (2021) used grant-level data from the European Research Council Proof-of-Concept (PoC) program to assess the impact of public funding on a broad set of science valorization outcomes. Their results indicated that the PoC program was effective in fostering the early valorization of scientific discoveries, thus supporting the importance of this funding mechanism. They also find that the impact of PoC funding is stronger in the case of researchers in the early stages of their academic careers, in line with the lifecycle model of science commercialization. In addition, Battaglia et al. (2021b) analyze the interplay that exists within PoCs between the project domain and the commercialization potential of funded RBIs. Besides, Ala et al. (2014) confirm that the economic growth is supported by the inputs to the knowledge value chain — science, new knowledge and technologies, which are all driven by R&D.",

In developing countries, factors that drive economic growth have themselves increased income inequality (Gasparini et al., 2016; Zhuang et al., 2014). Technological improvements, market-oriented reforms, and globalization are the key forces that have accelerated growth and have simultaneously raised inequality between skilled and unskilled workers and also between owners of capital and labor. In this paper, we argue that front-end Innovation (FEI)—which is a process that radically increases the chances that an invention will be successfully commercialized—is one of such factors that impact income inequality in frontier markets. For example, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) estimates that on average, only 21% of formal small and medium enterprises (SMEs) across south and east Asia, sub-Sahara Africa, the Middle-East, and North-Africa have access to formal credit (Abraham & Schmukler, 2017). Although, Financial Market Imperfection (FMI), has long been acknowledged as the reason why small firms cannot access finance in frontier markets (Beck, Demirguc-kunt, et al., 2005; Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, et al., 2005), demand-side factors like firm-level innovation can control the impact of FMI, on small firms’ access to finance (Berger & Udell, 1995 and 2002; Hellman et al., 2008; Peng, 2017). Researching FEI and income inequality is critical because the main indicator of FMI in frontier markets is information asymmetry (IA). In developing markets, IA manifests itself as a lack of data about the long-term financial viability of a venture, and most new firms are plagued by this problem. Banks want to be certain of the long-run profitability of a project,Footnote 1 which then makes it possible for the entrepreneur to repay loans. Subsequently, innovation which is required for small firms to reach commercial viability is needed to access finance. The success of this process of securing long-term profitability (innovation) and, thus, access to credit for new and small firms in frontier markets depends upon FEI. As a result of the central role, small firms play in economic development, the relationship between FEI and small firm access to credit has consequences for income inequality (Bannerjee & Newman, 1993; Santarelli & Vivarelli, 2007; Koen et al., 2014). Moreover, this incidence suggests that the few entrepreneurs, who have access to credit in developing countries, have been able to acquire higher incomes over time, in relation to FEI. Despite this connection, FEI is relatively little studied in the empirical literature. Although the impact of innovation on inequality has been studied extensively (Aghion et al., 2019; Antonelli & Gehringer, 2017; Permana et al., 2018; Wlodarczyk, 2017), the exact impact of FEI on income inequality is not properly defined in the empirical literature. Rather, due to contextual reasons, its effect may be lumped together with that of innovation. The objective of this study is to specifically investigate whether FEI has an impact on inequality, drawing from the experiences in frontier markets, where the lack of FEI is increasingly identified as a major driver of small firms’ inability to reach commercial viability, and thus, its consequences for economic growth and inequality. Likewise, this is the gap in the literature, and it forms the basis for our hypothesis and thus, our addition to theory. In this paper, we conclude that FEI has a significant impact on income inequality. We apply the same methodology with Aghion et al. (2019) with two differences: (a) Our sample contains countries instead of states or provinces and (b) we study FEI instead of innovation, and we use value-added as a metric for FEI and not patents. We start by using a panel regression with country, and year fixed effects, to explore the relationship across different countries over time and reveal an insignificant relationship. We then apply instrumental variable (IV) estimations, to confirm the robustness of our results, and discover a significant association. We conclude that the relationship partly reflects a causality from FEI to income inequality. The findings in this paper contribute to several strands of literature. Firstly, FEI plays a central role in ascertaining the commercial viability of new firms in frontier markets and, thus, access to credit. Access to credit means that small firms can expand and create jobs; FEI, therefore, has consequences for inequality. Given this link, we extend existing models of inequality by analyzing the impact of FEI on income inequality. Second, we also introduce adjusted savings: education expenditure (% of GNI) and gross value added at basic prices (GVA) (Constant LCU) as novel measures for FEI. Furthermore, we introduce household’s and NPISHs’ final consumption expenditure (% of GDP) and the statistical capacity score (overall average) as relevant instrumental variables for FEI in the emerging markets context. Third, our work enriches the literature on small firm finance in developing countries (Ayyagari et al., 2011; Beck et al., 2007; Beck, Demirguc-kunt, et al., 2005; Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, et al., 2005; Kapidani & Luci, 2019) by indicating that FEI is required for small firms to access finance. Fourth, we contribute to the endogenous growth literature (Aghion et al., 2015; Romer, 1990) by revealing that FEI is necessary for technological progress and, thus, sustained economic growth and income inequality. Fifth, we contribute to the literature on innovation and entrepreneur/firm income (Akcigit et al., 2017; Gabaix & Landier, 2008, Aghion et al., 2019) by establishing that FEI has a positive influence on firm/entrepreneurial incomes. Furthermore, firms/inventors that can successfully engage in FEI and, thus, access credit will reach the top income bracket. Our findings also relate to the literature on skill-biased technical change (Permana et al., 2018) where highly educated people, who are better skilled to use new technology, will receive higher income. We add to this literature by confirming that access to premium education enables entrepreneurs to acquire the skills needed to engage in FEI and, thus, end up in the top income bracket. Finally, our paper confirms that creative destruction and innovation (Jones & Kim, 2018) which are key factors in the dynamics of income inequality depend upon FEI. The results from this paper are consistent with findings from recent studies (Wlodarczyk, 2017; Aghion et al., 2019; and Antonelli & Gehringer, 2017) which conclude that innovation can decrease or increase income inequality depending on the measure used. However, we differentiate our paper from theirs by studying the impact of FEI on inequality in frontier markets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that provides robust evidence of the causal effect of FEI on income inequality for any set of countries. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In the “Literature Review” section, we discuss the dynamic between FEI and economic growth in frontier markets, as well as the literature review. We conclude the “Literature Review” section by outlining the hypothesis. In chapter three, we explain the empirical strategy and data used in this study. The “Data Analysis and Discussion” section discusses the empirical results, and the “Conclusions and Recommendations” section provides the conclusion, recommendations, and policy implications.",2

However, due to the early excessive pursuit of high-speed economic development aimed at scale and quantity, the domestic ecological environment deteriorated and natural resources were in short supply. In 2013, “Towards an Environmentally Sustainable Future: National Environmental Analysis of the People’s Republic of China,” issued by the Asian Development Bank, pointed out that less than 1% of China’s large cities meet the air quality standards of the World Health Organization. In 2016, the “Environmental Performance Index Report” released by Yale University pointed out that China has become the hardest hit area of PM2.5 in the world, and its air quality ranks second to last among participating countries (Yuan et al., 2019). With the deterioration of the ecological environment, natural disasters such as soil erosion, floods, and sandstorms frequently occur, which seriously affect the development of the social economy (Acosta et al., 2020). In addition, environmental pollution has increasingly become the most important factor affecting the speed of urbanization and the size of the city (Yang, 2019). Environmental pollution will affect the migration of migrants into cities, leading to the spread of labor (Chu et al., 2015). According to the “China Urban Statistical Yearbook” and “China Urban Construction Statistical Yearbook,” the floating population in China’s cities has shown a growth trend, increasing from 6,281,100 in 2006 to 103 million in 2015, with an average annual growth rate of 5.67%. This growth rate of large cities is 7.44%, which is higher than the national average. At the same time, urban environmental problems are improving. The average industrial sulfur dioxide emissions dropped from 74,300 tons in 2006 to 52,900 tons in 2015, with an average annual decline rate of 3.71%. The average annual decline rate in large cities is 4.66%, which is also higher than the national average (Yang, 2019). The influence of environmental issues such as smog on labor mobility is particularly obvious in developed cities (Xiao, 2016; Qin & Zhang, 2019). In order to improve the ecological environment and alleviate and solve the contradiction between economic development and environmental constraints, the government attaches great importance to and strongly supports the upgrading of industrial structure in each prefecture-level city. The upgrading of industrial structure has gradually become an important support for changing the original “high pollution and high energy consumption” development mode of China’s extensive economy and realizing high-quality economic development (Yin & Gu, 2020). Up to now, China has experienced three industrial structure upgrades,Footnote 1 especially after 2014, and the tertiary industry has gradually become the main driving force of China’s economic development (Gan & Wang, 2018). As shown in Fig. 1, since 2014, the contribution rate of the tertiary industry to the GDP has basically remained above 50%, and the pulling rate of the tertiary industry to GDP growth has always ranked first, followed by the secondary industry and the primary industry. The driving rate of the three major industries to GDP growth and the contribution rate of the tertiary industry to GDP from 2000 to 2019. Note: The contribution rate refers to the ratio of the increment of the industries to the increment of GDP, and the driving rate refers to the product of the growth rate of GDP and the contribution rate of the three industries Although the industrial structure is constantly upgrading, it is a disappointment that China’s economic development is still accompanied by high pollution and high energy consumption.Footnote 2 As shown in Fig. 2, China’s total energy and oil consumption showed an increasing trend, year by year, from 2014 to 2019. Although the total coal consumption showed a downward trend from 2015 to 2017, the range was small and it has risen again in recent years. In addition, pollution control has negative externalities (Huang & Chen, 2015), and the traditional assessment and promotion mechanism often leads to the problem of “emphasizing economy and neglecting environment” in local governments (Wu et al., 2014). In the face of sustainable development problems such as the decline of environmental carrying capacity and the lack of incentives from local governments, can the upgrading of industrial structure become the main driving force of China’s economic development and provide a new opportunity to reverse the situation of environmental deterioration? Can China’s economy and environment be “decoupled” or “linked?” Will this impact differ in cities with different characteristics? China’s total energy, coal, and oil consumption from 2014 to 2019 In order to effectively answer the above-mentioned questions, the effect of industrial structure upgrading on the decoupling of economy from environment is explored from the level of prefecture-level cities with smaller granularity. In addition, considering that urban air quality has become the focus of national pollution control and local governments also regard it as an important content of performance evaluation (Bai & Feng, 2020; Chen & Chen, 2018), the urban air quality is included in the analysis framework of this study; and the possible nonlinear effects of industrial structure upgrading on economy–environment decoupling are discussed in depth. The study is organized as follows: the “Literature Review” section examines the relevant domestic and foreign literature; the “Data and Indicators” section constructs elastic coefficient of the economy from the environment and inspects the decoupling relationship in 325 prefecture-level cities in China; the “Empirical Analysis” section discusses the influence of industrial structure upgrading on economy–environment decoupling from linear and nonlinear perspectives; the “Heterogeneity Analysis” section discusses whether urban heterogeneity will affect the relationship between industrial structure upgrading and economy–environment decoupling from the two aspects of “nature” and “humanity;” and the “Conclusions” section offers concluding remarks and puts forward relevant policy suggestions according to the research conclusions.",

However, many European regions have trouble turning S3 theory into policy implementation (Thissen et al., 2013), especially in lagging areas (McCann & Ortega-Argilés, 2019). A crucial implementation challenge concerns the role of institutions and institutional environments on regional development strategies (Rodríguez-Pose, 2013) and, more specifically, on the entrepreneurial discovery process (EDP), thereby shaping options for regional policy (Watkins et al., 2015). Prior empirical studies imply a significant relationship between a region’s institutional environment and its potential to develop effective S3 strategies (McCann & Ortega-Argilés, 2016). Where the relationship is weak, attention has shifted towards the impact of institutional change on S3 design and implementation (Gianelle et al., 2016; Rodríguez-Pose & Ketterer, 2018). Institutionalists argue that the combination of adaptive institutional environments with conspicuous knowledge resources creates higher potential for regional economic growth (Cooke & Morgan, 1998; Rodríguez-Pose, 2013). As a result, regional policies must incorporate in-depth understanding of the role played by local institutions to engage in learning and build innovation capacity (Fritsch et al., 2019), concentrating on both formal and informal institutions. However, the relationship between institutions and regional development tends to be context and geography specific, as well as characterised by multi-scalarity (Rodrik, 2004). Moreover, conceptual as well as empirical understanding of the role of institutional factors in ‘lagging regions’ (EC, 2017) remains limited (Aranguren et al., 2018) as such regions suffer from the ‘innovation paradox’ (Oughton et al., 2002) - regions most in need of effective innovation policies to revitalise their economy are those lacking proper framework conditions for effective policy action (Marques & Morgan, 2018). This paper addresses these gaps by investigating S3 implementation in two Greek regions. Firstly, it asks which specific institutions and features of their institutional environment have led to the emergence of policy implementation barriers (Morgan, 2017). We are specifically concerned with the relationship between the institutional environment and EDP. Secondly, it investigates what kind of institutional change is required to enable S3 implementation in the two regions (Kyriakou et al., 2016). A qualitative case study approach is employed, using interview data from Crete and Central Macedonia (CM). Attention is given to two Greek regions that have been among the hardest economically hit European areas, which increases the challenges of policy-making and implementation in lagging environments. In this respect, case study regions were purposely selected as both are in the process of self-exploring what institutional reconfiguration is needed in order to overcome prolonged recession and create a new favourable environment for public policy implementation. Fifty-one semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2014–2017. Our data contain comprehensive information on the influence of the institutional environment of S3 implementation from different sources. In the case of Crete, we conducted longitudinal analysis to investigate if change has effectively facilitated policy design and implementation of the S3 framework, or changed regional institutional environments, underlying systems of governance or legislation impact on local institutions. So far, policy research has been more oriented towards S3 design, such as how to include institutions in regional development policies (Grillitsch, 2015), rather than improving empirical understanding of how to identify and overcome place-specific implementation barriers. Thus, our main contribution concerns barriers to implementation associated with a region’s institutional environment. For instance, whether fiscal rules and administrative procedures obstruct or support entrepreneurial discovery, or institutional support for policy implementation. Moreover, we provide some insights on what kind of institutional change could improve EDP in Crete and CM. The paper is structured as follows: It provides the theoretical background of smart specialisation policy as a new regional innovation policy and provides recent theoretical and empirical insights on how EDP dynamics are associated with the institutional environment of the region. Then, it builds the conceptual framework and detailed research design to address two research questions. Finally, it provides the profiles of selected regions, followed by key findings, discussion and some concluding thoughts.",5

Creative industries are in strategic position to promote economic growth in all EU regions (Foray et al., 2012; Boix-Domènech & Rausell-Köster, 2018). They rely on creativity and intellectual capital, enhance entrepreneurial and innovation potential, and employ highly qualified and skilled labour that may drive local economies to prosperity and strengthen creative economy (Power & Scott, 2004; UNCTAD, 2010; Lazzaretti 2013; Boix et al., 2016; Kemeny et al., 2020). In creative industries, innovation is highly complex, dynamic, and primarily based on tacit knowledge flows. Creative industries require face-to-face communication, local capacities, and buzz to innovate and to comprise both tangible products and intangible intellectual or artistic services (UNCTAD, 2008), even though the products are often deterritorialised and highly global (Plum & Hassink, 2014). The knowledge base that influences their innovation potential and spatiality is dominantly symbolic (Asheim et al., 2007, 2011; Aslesen & Freel, 2012). The relevance of knowledge bases is shown by the fact that it predetermines the adaptability of an industry to overcome a crisis and take advantage of opportunities. Studies (e.g. Felton et al., 2010; Pratt, 2015) reveal that creative industries with symbolic knowledge base can contribute to regional resilience, and regional synergies established by the creative economic activities influence the long-term ability of regional economies for adaptation and development (Simmie, 2014; Martin & Sunley, 2015). Creativity and innovation have great significance in the development of competitive advantage of regions (Malecki & Hospers, 2007). Such competitive advantage is also highly dependent on institutional configuration in which regions are embedded (Swyngedouw, 2000). In Central Europe, the fall of the communist regime in 1989 and the massive transformation from a centrally planned economy to a decentralised market economy brought many threats, but also opportunities (Kornai, 2006). The transition to the new economic system — even if it did not begin immediately — resulted in, among others, higher GDP growth rates, higher labour productivity, and increased entrepreneurial activity. The transition was greatly accelerated by external factors, like geographical proximity to EU countries, adaptation of foreign examples, learning foreign experiences in educational institutions, developing trade relations, entry of foreign investors, and availability of modern technologies (Fidrmuc et al., 2002; Kornai, 2006). The time of centralised and planned economy was conducive to industrialisation, while the service sector was relatively under-developed, and creative economic activities were neglected. However, in Central Europe, as a result of political and economic liberalisation, everything has changed. Since the transition, and especially after the accession to the European Union (Bialic-Davendra et al., 2016), the window of opportunity has opened for the creative industries to grow in Central Europe rapidly. The question is whether creative industries have started to grow and can contribute to the development of post-socialist knowledge-based economies in Central Europe, if so, at what territorial level. In other words, the paper aims at answering the research question of whether the configuration of innovation systems in Central Europe with creative industries can be detected, if so, by dividing it into local, regional, and national components, which geographical level is the most prevalent. The aim of the study is to confirm theory-led expectations about configuration of systems based on creative industries. We build on the concept of configuration of systems (Leydesdorff et al., 2006) and presume that economic benefits of creative industries characterised by symbolic knowledge base emerge at the level of the local innovation system. To prove it, we measure synergy for the Central European (Hungarian and Slovakian) national, regional, and local innovation systems as the reduction of uncertainty using mutual information among the three dimensions of geographical location, technological knowledge base, and organisational size. Dynamic correlation among technology, geography and organisation generates synergy in innovation systems.",4

Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) ranks as the second most unequal region globally in terms of income distribution. Several approaches have been leveraged to reduce poverty and inequality and promote inclusive and sustainable growth in the area. These approaches include but are not limited to fostering trade, enhancing human capital, strengthening institutional quality, implementing sectoral policies (energy, technological development, etc.), developing the financial sector, and promoting financial inclusion. The financial environment of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) is mainly bank-based. As of December 31, 2020, the banking landscape of the zone consisted of 131 banks and 21 financial institutions. The primary objective of the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) monetary policy is to ensure price stability. However, the Central Bank also supports WAEMU's economic policies aimed at sound and sustainable economic growth. The banking sector underwent reforms to accelerate economic growth. All these reforms are in line with financial liberalization as advocated by the financial liberalization theories of McKinnon (1973) and Shaw (1973). Some of these reforms relate to the measures contained in the New Monetary and Credit Policy of October 1989 and supplemented by the 1993 reforms, which aimed, among others, at putting in place a mechanism that would encourage banks to finance the economy by ensuring the quality of the credits distributed, regardless of the beneficiaries, through the establishment of a single key rate, and the reorganization of the BCEAO’s rules of intervention. In addition, the BCEAO has reformed the banking system to improve the banking sector’s performance in financing the economy and strengthening the supervisory environment for greater efficiency. These reforms have certainly contributed to the good economic performance recorded in the WAEMU in recent years. Indeed, economic growth in the Union remains one of the strongest on the continent over 2013–2019, at 6.7% on average. However, this high economic performance has not been accompanied by a significant improvement in social indicators and living conditions. Most WAEMU countries have low levels of human development. The average Human Development Index in the zone only shows a slight improvement over the 2000–2019 period, standing at 0.360 in 2000 and 0.484 in 2019. According to the AfDB's African Economic Outlook (2020), only about a third of African countries achieved inclusive growth, reducing poverty and inequality, showing that much is still yet to be done to accelerate inclusive growth. While the role of the banking sector in financing growth could easily be verified concerning WAEMU's economic performance, the remaining question is whether the role of the banking sector is a decoy or a source of hope for inclusive growth. In other words, what is the impact of the banking sector on inclusive growth in the WAEMU? Therefore, this study aims to assess the effects of the banking system on inclusive growth. Specifically, this study seeks to: (i) describe the evolution of the performance of the WAEMU banking sector and its degree of inclusiveness; (ii) construct a multidimensional indicator of inclusive growth and analyze the level of inclusive growth in the region as a whole and at a country-specific level; and (iii) measure the effect of the performance of the banking system and its degree of inclusiveness on inclusive growth in the WAEMU. The rationale for conducting a study on the effects of the banking sector on inclusive growth, particularly in the WAEMU zone, is as follows. First, the financial environment of the zone is mainly bank-based and, given the banking sector’s role in affecting economic and social indicators, it appears essential to ascertain the potential impacts of the banking sector on inclusive growth, which actually has both economic and social components. The banking sector may affect the degree to which people’s economic opportunities are defined. Second, while the banking sector provides financial assistance to key economic actors, its activities may be non-performing, which may ultimately affect the banks’ future strategies and activities, and hence their ability to support socio-economic development. Although the role of the financial and banking sectors in economic growth and inequality is widely documented in the existing empirical literature, there is no clear understanding of the contribution of the banking sector’s performance on inclusive growth. Such analysis has so far hardly been the subject of empirical study, particularly in the case of WAEMU countries. This study contributes to the existing knowledge and literature on two fronts. First, inclusive growth is presented as a multidimensional concept that, according to our understanding, has not yet been addressed in the exclusive case of WAEMU countries. Instead of separately considering economic growth and inequality as in many previous studies, we instead focus on a broader multidimensional measure of inclusive growth and construct a composite indicator of inclusive growth. The remainder of this article is organized into four sections. In addition to the introduction, the second section presents a review of the literature on the role of the banking sector in inclusive growth. The data and methodology are presented in the third section while the fourth section presents and discusses the results. Finally, the fourth section concludes and provides policy implications.",

This includes the eighteenth century French-based Mississippi Bubble, the 1929 Crash, the Asian financial crisis of 1997, the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) that plagued the world economy from 2007 to 2009 (Sornette, 2017), and, of course, the ongoing Bitcoin drama (Huang et al., 2019). The rise of the knowledge economy since the last century has done little to alleviate market frictions, quite the contrary. More knowledge signifies greater innovation and a growing need for more fine-tuned organizational structures, which foster stronger knowledge-based societies capable of being even more innovative (Dubina et al., 2012). Amid the flow of knowledge, markets and corporations present at times moral hazard and questionable behaviors (Brunnermeier & Sannikov, 2014; Gheorghiu, 2013). At the core of most financial upheavals, speculation runs high: investors lose track of proper risk assessment and seek quick access to wealth, by whatever means, including recourse to deceit (Brunnermeier & Pedersen, 2009). This disconnect on the part of the investors from their initial financial needs, goals, and preferences is what has been coined as “financial spinning” (Mesly, 2020), a behavior aggravated by the fact that sellers feed consumers with meaningless and/or untrue information. In chasing the information that can help fulfill their misguided ambitions, consumers spin their wheel of fortune oblivious to how quickly they are taking on unsustainable debt loads. When spinning, consumers-prey cannot maintain ongoing, efficient relationships with their sellers-predators, something that would benefit the financial ecosystem, because they accumulate debt, which eventually kicks them out of the active market. When too many consumers and sellers engage in spinning, the effect may be too large for the market to handle, causing its failure. This conceptual paper proposes that consumers-prey’s ignorance (or obliviousness to risk) in unruly financial markets dominated by various dysfunctional agents — key conditions prevailing during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) in the USA (2007–2009) — serves the interest of sellers-predators by keeping their aggregation to a manageable level.  Market failure starts with interpersonal buyer–seller relationships, and possibly with principal-agent relationships, which grow to form aggregates that respond to predator–prey dynamics. When predatory information (designed to get other market agents to spin) reaches a tipping point, the system crashes. On the other hand, when a sufficient number of consumers-prey become discerning or experienced, they can outsmart the strategies of uncaring sellers-predators aimed at getting them to spend blindly as much as possible, irrespective of the risk of engaging in a debt trap (Miles, 2015). In the end, as exemplified during the 2007–2009 subprime crisis, corporations suffer from consumers’ abuse — and a similar pattern surfaced recently in the Robinhood-Reddit-GameStop wave (Haggerty, 2021). In the latter case, some large banks involved in short-selling suffered at the hands of a multitude of small investors (who shared information intensely on the Reddit platform, a good amount of it hype) when the shares of GameStop rose unexpectedly. GameStop share value was of USD 2.57 on April 3, 2020; as of January 15, 2021, it rose to USD 35.50 and culminated at USD 347.51 on January 27, 2021. Within 2 weeks, it fell to USD 52.40. Our research question therefore is: “Can we understand better the link between learning, financial spinning and predation, and market failure in markets that are affected by failure-inducing factors?” Answering this could open the door to developing a more general understanding of market dynamics pending further research and potentially help governments to prepare more adequately for market frictions. We organize this paper as follows: in the following section, we discuss the known sources of market failure (market failure factors). We then introduce our conceptual model. In the third section, we propose its mathematical basis via Lotka-Volterra equations and examine possible stylized market trajectories and analyze in part the results through the lens of the GFC. In the conclusion, we discuss the pros and cons of fostering rationality-rationed (information-starved) consumers in financial markets.",
14.0,1.0,Journal of the Knowledge Economy,24 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13132-021-00887-7,The Cyclical and Nonlinear Impact of R&D and Innovation Activities on Economic Growth in OECD Economies: a New Perspective,March 2023,Manzoor Ahmad,Jianghuai Zheng,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Innovation is considered one of the essential drivers of competitive success in various industries. It has gained significance because of globalization and the integrations of markets. Firms continually innovate to produce differential products due to market competition, protect profit margins, and moderate production costs. By developing new methods, firms increase the efficiency of production. The overall final impact of innovation can be observed by exploring the gross domestic product (GDP) (Schilling, 2016). Extant “new growth theories” by Lucas (1988) and Romer (1986) and others (Aghion et al., 1992; Grossman et al., 1991; Jones, 2002; Kortum, 1997; Segerstrom, 1998) identify innovation activity or new knowledge as production input for production technology (Hasan & Tucci, 2010). Grossman and Helpman (1993) asserted that industrial innovation and technological progression promote long-term growth. Among the pioneers, Parkes et al. (1943) seminal work suggested that the advancement of industrial innovation is an imperative factor of economic growth. Since then, numerous empirical studies have investigated how and to what extent innovation activities contribute to economic growth. Broadly, past research suggests that innovation makes substantial contributions to economic growth, directly or through its considerable spillover effects on economic growth (Cameron, 1998; Hasan & Tucci, 2010). Beyond the factors discussed above, innovation activities and economic growth also depend on foreign direct investment and trade openness (Erdal & Göçer, 2015; Shu & Steinwender, 2019; Walz, 1997). New technologies, introduced by multinational companies, are often transferred to local firms through backward linkages, demonstration effects, skilled labor, and reverse engineering. The existence of foreign products in local markets can induce domestic firms’ innovative thinking and push them to generate blueprints for new processes and products (Sivalogathasan & Wu, 2014). Trade liberalization is another factor that triggers productivity and innovation in emerging markets, where access to imported intermediates and export opportunities tends to induce innovation activities (Shu & Steinwender, 2019). Meierrieks (2014) argued that a firm’s innovation activities are linked to transaction costs and particular market frictions. These elements are moderated by the provision of specific financial services and activities of financial intermediaries, resulting in more innovation activity. This study aims to focus on the asymmetric connection between innovation activities and economic growth. It is crucial to understand nonlinear nexus or asymmetry because the effect of the variable’s negative or positive shocks can be dissimilar. The nonlinear nexus between variables relies on various elements. For instance, Shahbaz et al. (2017) found that one of these elements was linked to the economic system’s inter-related parts and the economic process. As innovation shocks are concerned, there is a broad consensus that the firm’s innovation activities are pro-cyclical (Ahmad, 2021; Arvanitis & Woerter, 2014; Ouyang, 2011). This implies that the enterprises increase their innovation inputs during the boom period and cut back in times of economic recessions, predominantly as a result of volatility in cash flows (Kotabe, 1992). While the economic upturn phase of the business cycle often represents a favorable market environment in which both noninnovative and innovative businesses can achieve fast growth, recessions result in an overall increase in market efficiency and competition (Bloom, 2014). Spescha and Woerter (2018) stated that enterprises that timely launch innovative products encounter stronger competition than noninnovative enterprises. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the pro-cyclical fluctuation of innovation activities may has a significant impact on an economy's growth and development (Stiglitz, 1993). This study contributed to the existing literature in the following ways. First, this study adds to existing theory by analyzing the factors, mechanisms, and processes by which cyclical research and development expenditures (R&DE) and innovative activities contributed to business cycles. Second, this study contributes to the current theory by examining the causes of cyclical R&D spending and innovation at the aggregate level during business cycles. Third, the study also adds to existing theory by establishing a novel economic model to investigate the cyclical impact of R&D spending, innovation, and economic growth during a boom and recession period. Third, previous studies have inspected the linear impact of R&DE and innovation on economic growth. However, previous studies have ignored the nonlinear or cyclical impact of innovation activities on economic growth during the economic boom and the recession periods. To the best of the author’s knowledge, no study analyzed the impact of innovation activities on economic growth in the presence of economic boom and the recession periods. The study of nonlinear and asymmetries is critical due to the continuous dynamics in the economy. The asymmetries arise due to the structural change or suddenly negative or positive oscillation in aggregate macro-indicators such as overall innovation activities, aggregate demand, aggregate supply, aggregate productivity, or aggregate real output. The variation in these indicators may have a deep impact on innovation activities and economic growth. Thus, ignoring the cyclical behavior of innovation activates may generate spurious, suspicious, inconsistent, and misleading results. Given these limitations, this study contributes to the empirical economic research by analyzing the dual (cyclical) impact of innovation activities on economic growth. The remaining part of this paper is categorized as follows. The “Literature Review” section comprises a literature review. The “Theoretical Model” section includes the derivation of a theoretical model. The “Model Specifications, Data Presentation and Estimation Method” section includes model specification, data presentation, and methodology.

Online legal advice, case management systems, electronic arbitration proceedings, or AI-based document analysis are already commonplace in law firms and legal departments across the world (Abramovsky & Griffith, 2006). Using advanced IT solutions to attain the objectives of both effective provision of legal services and representing the interest of law firms and legal departments has triggered the emergence of a new legal services sector, i.e. legal technology (abridged to legal tech) (Katsh, 1996).Footnote 2 The term covers all information and communication technologies used in the legal service sector such as contract management systems or document management systems, systems of e-discovery in litigation, or judicial predictive systems (Fenwick et al., 2019). The potential of using IT solution dedicated to the legal industry is reflected in business reports, suggesting that in 2018 legal tech investment reached USD 1 billion, that is almost four times more than in the preceding year (USD 233 million in 2017).Footnote 3 Correlating that data with a growing value of the global market of legal services estimated to reach a record-breaking USD 1.011 trillion in 2021, up from USD 849 billion in 2017, USD 886 billion in 2018, and USD 925 billion in 2019, one could conclude that the future of the legal services sector is moving towards a technological revolution entailing a business model change, process automation, and employment reduction (Bourke et al., 2020).Footnote 4 Although that data suggest growing trends as regards the value of the global legal tech market, the list of companies in the sector developed by a research project of Stanford University (USA) called Stanford Law School’s LegalTech Index, in November 2019 there existed (globally) a mere (or as many as?) 1249 entities (firms) offering technologies discussed here dedicated to the legal sector.Footnote 5 A relatively limited number of players generating that market’s great value makes one wonder and want to embark on advanced analytical studies that would allow for its realistic assessment (Wang, 2007). The sector has rapidly grown over the last few years, which can be seen in an increasing number of publications.Footnote 6 At the same time, the literature lacks a systematic review investigating the bibliometric and thematic analysis of the term (Snyder, 2019). It is necessary to consider the level of popularity of the topic, its potential, and interdisciplinary character. That is why the first step towards an in-depth analysis of any topic must involve becoming familiar with the current state of knowledge, which translates into the need to systematically review academic literature (Leith, 2000). The paper offers original contributions to the current literature. This contribution aims at performing the first step in research devoted to the legal tech industry, starting from just systematic literature review that would result in a preliminary assessment of the potential of the matter at hand as well defining the current state of knowledge, links with specific scientific disciplines, and followed by positing possible research gaps.Footnote 7 The paper is structured as follows: the second section presents the research methodology and the third one the bibliometric analysis covering analysis using the Google Trends tool. The fourth is concentrated on a thematic analysis of the reference repository (indicated in the “Bibliometric Analysis” section). The conclusion with the description of a scope for future research is located in the last section. When starting to analyse this topic, it is worth starting by explaining the origins of the term ‘legal technology’, which in the USA has been used since around 2010 and which derives from a combination of the terms ‘legal service’ and ‘technology’ (Hartung et al., 2017).Footnote 8 The term was originally used by the start-up community with a strong interest in the newly emerging field of IT services. Searching for earlier mentions of this related topic in the literature, one can find publications referring to lawyer support systems including expert systems dating back as far as the 1960s (Maiellaro, 1970). For the purpose of this article, this concept is understood as IT tools, including both hardware and software, used in law. On the basis of the completed literature review, in accordance with the methodological guidelines of conducting an integrative literature review, I have analysed the concept and its definition (Torraco, 2005; Burke & Hutchins, 2007; Shuck, 2011). An in-depth analysis of the definitions used within the repository of texts confirmed the lack of a homogenous definition of the concept of legal tech, which corresponds to the nature of the IT services sector studied, which does not require the introduction of normative definitions, characterised by an evolutionary nature, variable scope, and the need for constant adaptation to the needs of the market, mainly the addressees of its services — the lawyers.Footnote 9 In the surveyed repository, I found no definition of legal technology as such. Few authors indicated the author’s explanation of the subjective understanding of the concept, which was done, for example, by T. Kerikmäe, T. Hoffmann, and A. Chochia in the article ‘Legal technology for law firms: Determining roadmaps for innovation’ indicating that ‘Legal technology, or Legal Tech, in this context represents a broad range of solutions that affect both lawyers and clients on various levels’ (Kerikmäe et al., 2018). However, these are not attempts to introduce a systematic definition of the concept or to collate the terminology used so far in the literature on the topic. In the compilation of texts, however, I have encountered numerous references directly to the notion, which occurred in different contexts. On the basis of the gathered knowledge, I can state that whilst the authors do not use a definition of the concept, they all use it when referring to any IT solutions applied in the field of law. Not finding any attempts to define the notion of legal tech, I decided to introduce a division of the specificity of the texts included in the repository. Hence, I have singled out articles of the following natureFootnote 10: Case studies, offering in-depth descriptions of particular tools belonging to the field of legal tech (Giordano, 2004; Moxley, 2015; Gerami & Hawes, 2018); Technological, making clarifications in the area of applied technical solutions possible in specific tools or systems (Heintz, 2001; Hokkanen & Lauritsen, 2002; Ryan, 2017; Veatch, 2018); Overviews juxtaposing areas of technology application as translated, for example, into legal application practice (Oskamp & Lauritsen, 2002; Lettieri et al., 2018) or the historical context of the development of the legal tech field (Socha, 2017); Theoretical, analysing conceptual approaches to selected issues at the interface of technology and law (Leith, 2005; Ruhl & Katz, 2015); Opinion-forming, being expressions of a stance, the voice of authors regarding the further impact of legal tech on the legal service market (Marcus, 2008; Marin, 2011; Widrig & Tag, 2014; Dixon Jr,, 2015; Kerikmäe et al., 2018); and Empirical, describing the course of the research carried out and its results (Lambert, 2008).Footnote 11 In conclusion, the notion of legal technology, which has no legal definition, is therefore essentially a doctrinal concept, variously understood by authors. For the most part, authors give a descriptive account of the concept or try to put it into a functional framework. In addition to the search for a definition of the concept of legal tech, it is necessary to mention the process of digitalisation being the cause of the occurring changes on the legal service market, as well as the emergence and dynamic development of such sectors as legal tech (Oster, 2021). The process of digitalisation of law can be divided into three stages. The first was based on copying the content of the law into legal information systems, i.e. on their digitisation (Zeleznikow & Hunter, 1994). The second is based on the automation of decision-making processes, i.e. the creation of more or less sophisticated expert systems, using, amongst other things, inference mechanisms (Kerikmäe & Särav, 2017). The third consists in linking legal rules or contract content to programming codes, i.e. legal engineering (Goldenfein & Leiter, 2018). The digitalisation of services triggers a kind of legal-technological interdependence, as shown by the development of artificial intelligence, the current manifestation of which is the work on the creation of a European framework for functioning in this field published by the European Parliament on 20 October 2020 entitled ‘Framework of ethical aspects of artificial intelligence, robotics, and related technologies’.Footnote 12 The new algorithms being developed will have to comply with the rules and legal order of the European Union, and the guardian of this change is legislation.",4

This type of relation has had various designations, such as UF-C (Franco & Haase, 2015), U-F collaboration (Rybnicek & Königsgruber, 2019) and U-F partnership (Lascaux, 2019), among others. This study will use the term UF-C, understood as the interaction between those within the higher education system and firms (Ankrah & Al-Tabbaa, 2015). UF-C is assumed to have the aim of increasing the exchange of knowledge and technology between these organisations (Ankrah & Al-Tabbaa, 2015), in a mutually beneficial agreement (Galán-Muros & Plewa, 2016), able to promote regional development, through various elements such as social research, environmental innovation and critical reflection (Harrison & Turok, 2017). Therefore, the university, in the context of a knowledge-based economy, has an important role in stimulating development. The firm, in turn, exploits that knowledge to develop its mission, to generate profit. Cooperation between these two organisations can generate the results necessary for the development of both, in fulfilling their strategic objectives and those of the surrounding region. Through an inclusive review of the literature, the aim is to understand the role of UF-C in regional development. Studies summarising the literature on UF-C have been made in recent years. These highlight success factors of UF-C (Rybnicek & Königsgruber, 2019) and the key factors promoting innovation originating in that partnership (Sjöö & Hellström, 2019). However, Mascarenhas et al. (2018) underline the need for studies on the regional factors involved in this type of partnership. Thus, this study seeks to understand UF-C in regions with low technological development. In addition, there is a gap in the discussion about how UF-C is formed in the context of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises located in low-income regions. The results obtained here can be perceived in regional development. In general, the literature on UF-C has been focused on more economically developed regions (Thomas & Pugh, 2020), where innovation and cooperation between these institutions (UF) is already established (Budyldina, 2018). For the construction of the model to be proposed, we started from a literature review, which sought to identify the characteristic elements of the UF-C that can be found in regions of low technological development. Thus, the proposed model emphasizes cooperation through direct interaction between actors, such as consulting, internship programs, training of undertakers and other forms of interaction. Therefore, the results of this type of cooperation can be identified from the perception of entrepreneurs and show how this partnership can bring advantages to companies and to the region where they are inserted. After the methodology, the paper is structured setting out from university-firm relations and the models of interaction between them, followed by discussion of the effects of UF-C on regional development. Finally, a model is proposed for future analysis of UF-C, joining elements resulting from the cooperation on both the university and firm side and which can be reflected in regional development.",3

Though the IC is considered as part of the company’s capital, it is not reflected accurately in its financial statements. IC generates a future value for a company and give it a competitive advantage over its competitors. Recently, microfinance industry has been facing intense competition than ever before (Hossain et al., 2020; Mia & Soltane, 2016). With 139.9 million low-income and underserved clients and about 11.5% annual global growth rate, microfinance institutions (MFIs) are trying to attain their financial stability and social outreach goal (Microfinance Barometer Report, 2019). Unfortunately, empirical evidence shows that many MFIs can cover only a quarter of their expenses, and almost half of the world’s MFIs are still unprofitable (Guichandut, 2018; Turini, 2018). Moreover, MFIs’ expansion in outreach to new clients has been fluctuating steadily in recent years. Compared to the global scenario, microfinance expansion has plummeted in some regions. For example, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Africa region experienced reduction while the Latin America and Caribbean region exhibit negative growth by −0.3% (Microfinance Barometer Report, 2019). Besides, some studies indicated that most of the MFIs are financially and socially incompetent (Babu-Muneer & Kulshreshtha, 2017; Nourani et al., 2020; Wijesiri et al., 2017; Wijesiri & Meoli, 2015). Thus, the overall condition in financial stability and client outreach threatens the viability of MFIs’ sector. This situation also raises a question about the efficiency of the MFIs. Hence, this study aims to evaluate the MFIs’ financial and social outreach efficiency in-depth with a view to guiding their continuous development and sustainability. Previous studies have focused on a limited number of inputs and outputs to measure financial efficiency or social outreach efficiency. Most of the studies used operating expenses, total assets, and the staff size as input variables for both efficiencies. This study upholds these same inputs and uses the two output variables frequently used in the literature to assess financial efficiency such as financial revenue and gross loan portfolio (Bibi et al., 2018; Gutierrez-Goiria et al., 2017; Widiarto & Emrouznejad, 2015). As for social efficiency, Hermes and Hudon (2018) argued that social efficiency should be measured with multidimensional perspectives instead of using a single dimension. Aligned with this argument, borrowers’ geographical location and number of depositors are included as new social outreach indicators in addition to the existing indicators such as average loan balance/GNI per capita, total existing borrowers, and female borrowers. This study examines the efficiency using these input and output variables under the production approach. It incorporates the renowned data analysis tool namely, Data Envelop Analysis (DEA) to provide more robust efficiency results. The literature on the determinants of MFIs’ efficiency has not provided sufficient empirical evidence (Fall et al., 2018; Kar & Rahman, 2018). Very few studies have assessed the determinants of efficiency in a second-step statistical analysis (Adusei, 2019; Bibi et al., 2018; Gutiérrez-Nieto et al. 2009; Hermes et al., 2011; Widiarto & Emrouznejad, 2015; Wijesiri et al., 2017; Wijesiri & Meoli, 2015). The studies mainly used the traditional determinants such as the size of MFIs and gender diversity. Thus, there is scope to examine some other important determinants that can explain the variations in efficiency estimates. The literature on banking and other financial and non-financial industry shows that intellectual capital is a potential determinant that improves firm performance. In microfinance literature, intellectual capital studies are still scanty except Hashim et al. (2018) and Kamukama et al. (2010). Both studies were conducted based on primary survey data from a single-country perspective (Malaysia and Uganda). Therefore, this study seeks to provide answers to the following question: What is the impact of intellectual capital on microfinance institutions’ financial and social outreach efficiency? Theoretically, the components of IC are human capital, structural capital, and relational capital (Vidyarthi & Tiwari, 2019). These elements are essential for any organization to become an aligned and a balanced organization, thereby creating the best possible value for its sustainable operation. For instance, Ahamad et al. (2020) stated that human capital could significantly affect business performance. Several studies supported the hypothesis that human capital, structural capital, and relational capital have significant effects on firm performance in the banking and other industry (Kamukama et al., 2010; Vidyarthi & Tiwari, 2019; Xu & Li, 2019; Yalama & Coskun, 2007). Hence, it is necessary to examine the extent to which these IC elements influence the microfinance industry’s financial and social outreach efficiency. Furthermore, Pinz and Helmig (2015) and Hermes and Hudon (2018) argued that previous studies examined the direct effect of country governance variables on MFIs’ performance, while the potential interaction effect is overlooked. Besides, the empirical outcomes on the direct effect are mixed. For example, Bibi et al. (2018) found a positive direct impact of country governance variables on MFIs’ financial and social performance. However, Müller and Uhde (2013) found that external governance has a positive impact on financial performance while social performance is negatively influenced by external governance. However, some studies suggested that country governance variable could play a significant moderating role (Hermes & Hudon, 2018; Pinz & Helmig, 2015). Hence, this study also seeks to fill the research gaps by addressing the following questions: Does external governance have a significant positive moderating effect on the impact of intellectual capital on microfinance institutions’ financial and social outreach efficiency? Hence, the contribution of this study is threefold. First, since the literature on intellectual capital postulated that the components of IC (i.e., human capital, structural capital, and relational capital) could empower organizations to improve institutional efficiency (Kamaluddin & Rahman, 2013; Majumder, 2012; Vidyarthi & Tiwari, 2019; Xu & Li, 2019; Yalama & Coskun, 2007), this study extends these theoretical arguments to the microfinance industry. It tests the theoretical predictions by examining the impact of IC on microfinance institutions’ financial and social outreach efficiency. Furthermore, the Resource-Based View (RBV) theory posits that business performance can be improved as well as gain a sustainable competitive advantage if the firm has valuable resources (Wernerfelt, 1984). Thus, this study makes theoretical contribution to the literature by focusing on IC and its elements as intangible resources from the RBV theory. Moreover, intellectual capital theory opines that an organization could attain success by managing intellectual capital effectively (Edvinsson & Malone, 1997; Stewart, 1997). This study also seeks to validate this theory in the field of microfinance. Second, unlike other studies that focused on the effect of IC on firms’ financial stability, this study also examines the impact of IC on MFIs’ social outreach efficiency. Third, it contributes to the extant literature by incorporating external country governance as a moderating variable in the relationship between IC and the MFIs’ efficiency. To address the above issues, the current study used data of 661 MFIs from 86 countries from 2010 to 2018. The first stage result using the DEA technique shows that MFIs are financially efficient rather than socially efficient. The second-stage regression analyses confirm that MFIs with high IC can be more financially efficient. Besides, good external governance has a positive moderating effect on the impact of IC on financial efficiency. It also shows that IC influences social outreach efficiency, albeit external governance has no significant moderating effect on the impact of IC on social efficiency. Evidence from the analysis of the IC components confirm that these components play significant roles in microfinance’s efficiency. Apart from this introduction, the rest of the paper is structured as follows: the “Literature Review” section discusses the literature review; the “Methodology and Data” section contains the methodology and data; the “Findings and Discussions” section presents the findings and discussion; the “Implications and Recommendations” section presents the implications and recommendations; and the “Conclusion” section contains the conclusion, limitations of the study, and suggestions for future research.",5

With the development of research; it offers a good opportunity for the improvement of investment efficiency (Yermack, 2016). Nevertheless, there are many difficulties to the perfection of BT and its application. Blockchain technology maintains a competitive advantage and generates improved performance (Lu et al., 2014). Blockchain is a growing list of records that are linked together using cryptography; it is a distributed technology that increases the visibility and transparency of the stored transactions (Wang et al., 2019), that allows for the automatic execution of transactions (Lacity, 2018a) and that ensures a single version of truth which helps in building trust in the stored information (Queiroz et al., 2019). Yermack (2016) argues that blockchain offers a great deal of increase in accuracy, efficiency and transparency in corporate governance. Therefore, a much modern relationship between the shareholders and the management could be established by the utilization of this technology, which could certainly lower the agency costs in a corporation while improving the trust between the parties in this context (Van der Elst & Lafarre, 2017). Hence, in the blockchain infrastructure, there is no need for the principal to institute oversight and monitoring with the associated agency costs. Because of the governance guarantees embedded in code, blockchain addresses the inherent agency problems in modern finance and corporate governance comprehensively precise and timely records of who hold their shares, resulting in reduced settlement time. Directors have power to manage any other interest that they may possess (Boubaker & Nguyen, 2012), the blockchain offers new prospects to facilitate the agency relationship between corporate participants, thereby creating trust and transparency (Fearnley & Soohoo, 2018); Information asymmetries between principal and agent, censorship, opportunism of agents, breaches of fiduciary duties, liability rules for principals and agents, fraud or third party interference are removed entirely. All contractual terms are public and fully transparent. Accordingly, a company’s finances, for instance, are visible on the blockchain to anyone, not just to the company’s accounting department. Smart agency contracts run on a custom built blockchain that enables principals and agents to store registries of debts or promises, create entire markets, among many other aspects that have not yet been considered. Based on a sample of 297 European firm-years data (covering the 2014–2018 periods), our regression results show that implemented BT is significantly and positively associated with investment efficiency. Our results are robust to alternative proxy measures of corporate governance performance. Our findings extend the literature on the use of BT and the economic consequences engaging in certain types of. This paper contributes to the literature in two areas. Firstly, we propose a standard model to explore the influence mechanism of BT on investment efficiency. Secondly, we collected relevant information from BT listed in the STOXX Europe 600 during 2014–2018 periods and quantitatively verified the mediating impact of corporate governance on this association. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. “Background and Hypotheses Development” provides the background and the hypothesis development. “Research Design” describes the research design. “Results” presents the empirical results. “Discussion” offers discussions and “Conclusion” concludes the paper.",2

The financial industry has been undergoing a thorough transformation. In this continuous transformation, lack of financial education and insufficient understanding of financial services are seen as obstacles to digital financial inclusion (Gimpel et al., 2017; UNCTAD, 2014). The importance of financial management knowledge is self-evident (Ćumurović & Hyll, 2019; Lusardi et al., 2010). It can preserve and increase the value of our wealth and reduce the risks that threaten people’s lives, health, and property safety (Huston, 2010; Monticone, 2010; Remund, 2010). Most importantly, learning financial management knowledge is very important to realize personal financial freedom. Financial knowledge is seen as a blessing to promote financial inclusion (Hasan et al., 2020a, b). The importance of knowledge about financial technology (fintech) services is a widely well-known important force in developing financial systems in every country (Hasan et al., 2021). It has significant implications on different stages of the life of service recipients, such as choosing the right products, implementing the right strategies, using innovative products and services, and making major financial decision (Kezar & Yang, 2010; Lusardi & Mitchell, 2014; Maturana & Nickerson, 2019; Paiella, 2016). However, this knowledge can improve people’s understanding of different financial strategies and policies adopted by financial institutions, products, and concepts through various explanations, information, and suggestions, to develop skills that enable them to understand better financial risks and opportunities (Berry et al., 2018; Fan & Chatterjee, 2018; Frisancho, 2019; Opletalová, 2015; Sun et al., 2020; Urban et al., 2018). H. Sun et al. (2020) state the importance of financial education as “financially well-educated investors are more likely to be able to understand investment-related information and less likely to be tricked, hence can pressure managers to eschew misappropriate behavior.” Inclusive finance is one of the most significant parts of finance and economics. It is important to consider the contribution of rural consumers to the overall economy (Johnston, 2005; Le et al., 2019; Stein, 2010). Therefore, providing financial services is essential for rural people because it allows them to contribute to the overall financial system (Hasan et al., 2020a, b). In this case, access to financial technology is one of the most important factors that include them in formal financial systems. In addition to traditional banks and microfinance, fintech can also help those who are financially excluded from joining the formal financial system (Helms, 2006; Hussain et al., 2018; Zulkhibri, 2016). The necessity for rural people’s financial education has always been important, especially the saliency and relevance of financial education regarding financial products, services, and activities (Fernandes et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2020). However, the essential factor of financial exclusion is financial education or financial knowledge (Bongomin et al., 2016; Grohmann et al., 2018; Kodongo, 2018; Koomson et al., 2019; Lyons & Kass-Hanna, 2019; Mogilevskii & Asadov, 2018; Segre, 2018). Even due to the lack of proper understanding of fintech services, millions of people have been excluded from financial services. This exclusion process is also working behind as an obstacle for the economic and financial development process. Although technology is creating new ways and user-friendly financial service operating systems, some people cannot use banks or other financial services. Many reasons are working behind this critical problem; among them, financial illiteracy is one of them, which is considered the primary reason for this drawback. Based on the significance of financial knowledge, research on the pension plan, investment behavior, education system, institutional performance, microfinance development, economic development, and so on have already been carried out in respective fields. However, the financial knowledge of rural consumers on access to fintech has not been raised and explored yet. Research based on financial literacy and financial access has its high demand In Bangladesh and in the countries where financial inclusion is an emerging issue, a limited number of studies have also shown and compared the impact of financial literacy on financial access. This limitation is considering the gap in this research. The rationale for this research is also precise. In any case, the financial access of rural consumers is one of the pressing themes in fast-growing developing and underdeveloped countries, significantly, the countries with overpopulation, such as Bangladesh.Footnote 1 Due to the high population density and small land area, different financial and economic problems often arise, and access to financial products and services is particularly one of the most pressing issues. Nearly 53% of adults still cannot get financial access, especially when they are very poor (Kibria et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the development is still not noticeable in rural area as well as urban areas. It is difficult for the banking industry to reach the countryside (O’Toole & Newman, 2017), so it still needs time to include the most significant portion of working-level people from rural areas in the formal financial systems. The main critical reason behind these issues is financial education. For these reasons, Bangladesh is selected as one of the most appropriate research areas on this topic. After studying the literature focused on promoting financial access, financial inclusion, financial literacy, and so on, some basic questions were raised for the research. These research questions (RQ) are specified in the following sections: RQ 1: Does the knowledge regarding financial services influence rural consumers access to fintech services? RQ 2: How do these knowledge-related factors influence promoting inclusive finance (rural financial access)? RQ 3: Do these identified financial knowledge factors have implications in real life? Based on these questions, the research gap, the novelty of this study, and the available literature, the objective of this study are fixed to know the impact of financial knowledge on rural consumers access to fintech services. This study also extends the objective to test how demographic variables matters in rural people’s fintech access. In addition to demographic factors, this study specifies another objective to know how basic knowledge of banking and microfinance activities influences on getting fintech access of the rural consumers. In order to accomplish the objectives of this research, the empirical research method is used here to present the very specific outcome of this study. More particularly, based on the research outcome and data categories, three probabilistic empirical models are tested here with robust estimation. The findings of this study are also very straightforward. Demographic variables and knowledge regarding fintech services significantly influence rural consumers’ access to fintech services. However, basic banking and financial knowledge are not significant for rural consumer to get fintech access. This study presents the findings, specifically the effect of financial knowledge on specified and prominent issues. Also, the research questions are discussed in the “Discussion” section very specifically with proper evidence.",16

Evidence from Nigerian Manufacturing and Service Firms,June 2023,Adamu Jibir,Musa Abdu,Abdullahi Buba,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Human capital has long been acknowledged to be an important factor for improving the productivity of individuals (Schultz, 1961; Becker, 1962) and more recently has been increasingly recognized as a factor influencing the competitiveness and productivity of firms in an organization (Abdu & Jibir, 2018; Teixeira, 2002; World Bank, 2018). The nation’s stock of human capital endowment (knowledge and skills) embodied in individuals particularly the active population is more vital and crucial than any form of resources available in a country. Mincer (1981) stresses that human capital activities in a country involve not only embodying of knowledge but also the production of new ideas. The role of human capital in promoting labor productivity has spawned volume of studies in the last five decades. The critical question is how does human capital translates into labor productivity. We observed that majority of the previous studies are conducted for developed economies and mostly stressing on firm productivity (Blackman, 2014; Black & Lynch, 1996; Cörvers, 1997; Gabdullin & Kirshin, 2020; Goedhuys et al., 2006; Lebedinski & Vandenberghe, 2014; Yian, 2019). However, our intensive examination of the current literature indicates that the role of human capital and its impact on labor productivity have largely been ignored, in particular in Nigeria and other developing countries. In addition, most of the previous studies in Nigeria applied time series data which cause measurement problem due to different proxies to human capital and productivity which questioned the reliability of their findings (Umoru & Yaqub, 2013; Olayemi, 2012). The availability of primary data of the World Bank Enterprise Survey has made it possible to directly measure human capital and productivity variables without proxies and biasness. Hence, we turn our focus to country-specific study for Nigeria by using the World Bank Enterprise Survey data to empirically examine the nexus between human capital components and labor productivity. The contribution of this study to literature is threefold: The study makes a strong contribution to body of knowledge since it is one of the few studies focusing on the role of human capital on labor productivity at firm level as majority of the studies are done for developed countries (Gabdullin & Kirshin, 2020; Goedhuys et al. 2006). Secondly, we observed that the most serious limitation of the previous studies on human capital is the use of only one measure for human capital in empirical assessment. This study moves the debate further by considering more than one measure to ensure robustness of findings and more reliable results. Thirdly, the study also attempts to understand whether the relationship between human capital and labor productivity varies by firm size, age, and location, among others. The remainders of the paper are organized as follows: ""Literature Review"" briefly reviews literature on human capital and its effects on labor productivity. ""Methodology"" discusses the econometric methodology and sources of data.

However, the primary contradicting issues mainly deal with how the concept of TE can be quantified and measured as a discrete variable and the actual factors that can affect TE, both conceptually and quantitatively. The general purpose of this study is to reveal the national indices that can affect technology entrepreneurship at a pan-European level. This is significant, since policy makers need an answer on the core question regarding TE: Apart from the theoretical factors that can affect TE, what are the exact national indices that need to be boosted by governments and policy makers in order to practically enhance TE in the market environment? The definitions of TE vary, primarily regarding whether the primary prerequisites of an entrepreneurship type that is characterized as “technology,” exclusively involve the technology-oriented personal attributes of the entrepreneur and the technology characteristics of the firm, or TE constitutes a far broader systemic framework consisting of various heterogeneous elements. That framework typically includes the research undertaken prior and during production, the external environment factors under which TE is applied (regulation framework, business ecosystem, regional innovation policies), the corporate/managerial policy towards change, the technology advancement and innovation, the organizational and production procedures that include heterogeneous assets, the business strategy and leadership style, and the capabilities of the individuals working on the entrepreneurial environment (Antoncic & Prodan, 2008; Bailetti, 2012; Beckman et al., 2012; Dorf & Byers, 2005; Gans et al., 2018; Garud & Karnøe, 2003; Nacu & Avasilcai, 2014; Petti & Zhang, 2011; Phan & Foo, 2004; Shane & Venkataraman, 2003; Spiegel & Marxt, 2011). The aforementioned heterogeneous actors are just some of the internal ingredients that constitute TE, as researchers keep adding factors that may affect or get affected by TE, in order to build a complete conceptual framework. The majority of the definitions consider that the concept of TE mainly consists of three (3) discrete components that originate from the personal competences of the Entrepreneur (individual level), the technological attributes of the firm/organization (organizational level) and the general characteristics of the external environment (systems level) inside which TE is applied (Garcia-Morales et al., 2014; Gupta et al., 2009; Pathak et al., 2013; Petti & Zhang, 2011; Spiegel & Marxt, 2011). Similarly, McPhee et al. (2019) consider TE framework as a three-broad level system that includes micro-, meso-, and macro-level components, composed of the entrepreneur/team, the firm/ecosystems, and the region/policy factors, respectively. Some researchers add the attributes of the product/service as a fourth component that should be included, being one of the main agents that determine TE’s path (Garud & Karnøe, 2003; Spiegel & Marxt, 2011). These considerations foresee that the factors affecting TE which originate from the aforementioned components are actually independent with each other (Garud & Karnøe, 2003; Jelinek, 1996), while other researchers emphasize that the interdependence between certain TE attributes needs to be paid particular attention (Bailetti, 2012). Such a case is the interdependence pointed out by Jones-Evans (1995) between firm’s initiatives and the external infrastructure, implying the interrelation between the organizational and systems level. It becomes apparent that most of the factors affecting TE can be interpreted and processed as fully qualitative or semi-quantitative variables, since those originate from the two (2) major components, the micro-level and meso-level. For instance, Pathak et al. (2013) consider personal entrepreneur’s attributes such as age, gender, and educational level or behavioral attributes such as opportunity recognition and self efficacy, as variables that affect entry into TE at an individual level. Likewise, Matejun (2016) points out that the TE concept requires a synergistic involvement of the enterprises on areas such as firm’s technology levels and innovation potential. These types of factors normally require a qualitative or a semi-quantitative analysis, using Likert-scale or dichotomous variables that are able to include the full numerical extent of data concerning very large samples such as a European population. The main limitation of a qualitative analysis actually lies on its findings which cannot be extended to wider samples with the same level of certitude that fully quantitative analysis can, while ambiguities in the human language cannot fully imprint at an identical way the describing contents to all participating populations (Atieno, 2009). For the aforementioned reasons, this study’s aim is creating a statistical model that investigates the effects of specific indicators from macro-level. By utilizing these certain numeric variables that depict state-control data, a statistically accurate comparison between EU countries is feasible, designating the most effective policies that may promote TE at a national or pan-European level. The study results theoretically empower literature background on those indicators that affect TE and practically strengthen policy making frameworks in the direction of enhancement of those macro-level variables that can be directly boosted by central policy makers, highly promoting TE at the national and EU level.",3

In today's ever changing environment, improvement of organization efficiency and garnering, gathering, and saving of knowledge in an accessible form holds paramount importance in the long run. In recent times, the management of corporate knowledge and the lifeblood of organization have been recognized as a formal practice as advances in technology have made it possible for companies to collect vast amounts of data about their business and to retrieve and process them into information and disseminate and use throughout the organization (Sharp, 2003). The pace of technological change and the growing integration of the world economy are resulting in an entirely new economic order and reshaping the landscape of competition. The rates, magnitude, and complexity of environmental changes require an organization to introduce new modes of enterprise management (Chaudhary, 2005:01–03) and that has led to the emergence of knowledge management. Knowledge management is a new branch of management for achieving a breakthrough in business performance through the synergy of people, process, and technology. Its focus is on the management of change, uncertainty, and complexity (Saxena & Tiwari, 2013). It refers to organizational policies, practices, and tools that allow individuals to better understand and to help define the bigger picture of which their work is a part and to more easily benefit from and contribute to the work of others in the organization. Successful knowledge management requires a balance and coordination between the top-down articulation of policies and tools and the bottom-up cultivation and evolution of practice and culture in a workplace (Carrol et al., 2003). Over the last few decades, business have recognized the importance of managing their intangible assets especially in knowledge-based organizations (Zhao & Pablos, 2011; Carrol et al., 2003). In a knowledge-based organization like B-School, knowledge is the most important asset for developing and sustaining competitive advantage (Kambil, 2009; Jo & Joo, 2011; Neumann & Tome, 2011). Companies are spending huge amount of money on knowledge management (KM). For example, Ernst and Young spends about 6% of its revenue on KM; McKinsey and Co. spends about 10% of its revenue on KM; Buckman Laboratories, a speciality chemical firm, spends around 2.5% of its revenues on KM, and an author, Duane Sharp, finds that where KM practices have been successful, the returns generated by these practices (ROI) have often exceeded 10 times the original investment (Sharp, 2003). Moreover, a firm like Rank Xerox (the European arm of Xerox Corporation) has saved more than $1.5 billion over the past several years by identifying and replicating internal best practices which is an indispensable ingredient of KM. Many world-class corporations have adopted highly dedicated KM practices. To name a few, Ernst and Young — Knowledge Process Landscape, Hewlett and Packard — Knowledge Links, and KPMG Peat Marwick, USA, has developed an intranet called Knowledge Web (K-Web) as the basis of their KM practices. Thus, such huge spending is worth it if the organization can reap the real benefits. Although studies found that knowledge management is more relevant in enterprises that are operating in knowledge-intensive areas (Gupta et al., 2000). It is found that much of the existing work has concentrated on either people or technology often to the exclusion of the other two elements. Particularly, a processing element is paid insufficient attention. The process here means the business process of the organization not only the KM processes because the KM process has to be integrated with the business processes. So it is said that in KM, the way things are done is more important than what is done; i.e., the process is more important than content (Edward, 2011). Chiang adds that prior researchers about KM excessively stressed the operational and technological aspects of KM; however, people management is the approach that truly contributes to KM (Chiang, 2011). In this backdrop, this research was undertaken with an attempt to analyse the knowledge management practices at Indian B-Schools especially public B-Schools in a comprehensive manner taking into consideration all three aspects of knowledge management i.e., people, process and technology.",1

Better services will be provided if they are established and promoted by national institutions in collaboration with those who are committed to making meaningful contributions to the community interest. Service quality is a complex concept that is widely studied in marketing. The investigation of a particular service quality construct establishes the notion of a variety of service qualities that are generally offered and is thoroughly investigated in services. As a result, the concept of service quality continues to evolve and the need for models to assess the quality of services offered by the modern market is increasing (Gong & Yi, 2018). Customer demands should come first, followed by a favorable opinion about customer satisfaction and service quality (Kotler, 2000). Customer needs should come first, followed by customer satisfaction and favorable service quality assessment (Kotler, 2000). The spirit, attitude, and professionalism of civil servants have a significant impact on the quality of community services. According to Kotler, quality community services affect and affect people’s welfare. The gap between perceived performance and the general community’s assumption that it is one of the three general satisfactions determines the level of satisfaction. If the performance meets or exceeds expectations, the audience will be very pleased or delighted. Berry, Parasuraman, and Zeithaml investigated customer perceptions of service quality in service businesses (Rangkuti, 2003: 22). Customer feedback on items (products, services, companies, individuals, issues, events, topics, and their attributes) influences other customers and merchants (Chiou et al., 2014, Cao et al., 2013). User-generated content, which is becoming increasingly important as a data source, is used to collect this information. You can read and write other people’s opinions before and after the purchase, which shape their expectations and fulfillment (Qazi et al., 2014). The Central Kalimantan Civil Organization, the main vehicle of the state and an important component of every municipality, plays an important role in improving the welfare of its people and reducing poverty and local economic downturn. With such a grand goal, the Central Kalimantan Civil Organization must recognize the importance of supporting the ability of individuals to efficiently carry out this important obligation. In particular, the Central Kalimantan Citizenship Organization is responsible for governance, the creation of strategic actions, and creative and creative efforts to achieve social welfare in a just, democratic, and dignified manner that organizations do. According to the theory of good governance, the behavior of national civil engineering machinery (organizational commitment and professionalism) can set a precedent for good governance (Ganie, 2000). Government control can begin with the state civil society’s high organizational commitment to provide effective, responsive, and accountable services to communities. They will labor relentlessly as a result of this sense of belonging, and their abilities and professionalism will be valued and central. Customer demands must come first, followed by a positive customer satisfaction and service quality perspective (Kotler, 2000). The attitude, behavior, and expertise of civil workers determine the quality of their service. People’s contentment is also influenced by the quality of community service according to Kotler. Empowerment is defined by the perspective of empowerment theory (Deolalikar et al., 2015) as “the process of empowering individuals or groups to design and implement goal-oriented decision making that produces desired outcomes.” Impactive citizen empowerment requires creating a place for citizen engagement, as well as developing the skills and resources needed to implement citizen feedback and accountability systems. Good governance, in this opinion, can be a determining element in community empowerment. Communities and grassroots groups can seize power from the bottom up in a number of scenarios, according to empowerment theory (Deolalikar et al., 2015). If the target community has a positive view, authorized officials can empower individuals and communities from the top down. This suggests that a favorable community impression leads to contentment, which is one part of community empowerment. Unlike other studies, this one indicates that state civil society behavior is the driving force behind community empowerment and satisfaction, as measured by good governance and community service quality. Organizational devotion and professionalism are two characteristics that influence the behavior of state civil society. As a result, if the findings are validated, community service initiatives in Central Kalimantan will be boosted, and community satisfaction would rise.",1

Despite the complacency of the literature in its definition, the continent has high unemployment rates. Data from the World Development Indicators (2020) show that since 2010, several countries on the continent have seen their unemployment rate cross the threshold of 20% of their labor force. Unemployment is particularly acute among young graduates (Abé Ndjié et al., 2019). Unemployment is the source of many ills for the unemployed in particular and for the economy in general. A person who is unemployed loses confidence and may fall into depression (Rahmat & Saeidi, 2017; Maulani & Agwanda, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Usoro et al., 2021). Unemployment leads to a fall in income and, as a result, expenditure (Zhang et al., 2020). This fall in spending hinders trade and the smooth running of the economy (Rahmat & Saeidi, 2017; Maulani & Agwanda, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Usoro et al., 2021). Even the financial sector may find itself under pressure as unemployment increases, since people who lose their jobs, if they have taken out loans, can no longer make monthly payments to financial institutions (Zhang et al., 2020). These difficulties may lead unemployed people to turn to illegal or even criminal activities (Rahmat and Saeidi, 2017; Maulani & Agwanda, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Usoro et al., 2021). In addition, high unemployment encourages corruption among politicians. Corruption can be understood here as the illegal and abusive use by politicians of their positions in government (Lim, 2019). It can take the form of receiving bribes or other gifts (Lim, 2019). In return for these gifts, politicians have to render various services (Bouzid, 2016). Indeed, as explained by Oueghlissi and Derbali (2021) for example, in some countries, such as those in Africa, the public sector is the main job provider. In times of high unemployment, this sector receives an increased demand for jobs and politicians use corruption as a tool to demarcate between candidates. They further explain that such a relationship is more prevalent in democratic countries, where members of government seek to quickly enrich themselves before being replaced. This view thus reveals that bribing politicians can be a way out of unemployment. Many studies have looked at this relationship between corruption and unemployment or employment in African countries, but they have not yet reached a consensus. For example, while the work of Adjor and Kebalo (2018) finds that corruption reduces unemployment, others such as Onchari (2019) find the opposite. On the other hand, these studies focus either on one part of the continent, for example Southern Africa for Adjor and Kebalo (2018) and Kenya for Onchari (2019), or rather on one segment of the population, as in the work of Abé Ndjié et al. (2019) which focus on young people. Our study, on the other hand, distinguishes itself from these different points by considering an analysis of the whole continent, while taking into account the specificities of each country, and of unemployment as a whole. In addition, it focuses on the employment sector through which political corruption best affects unemployment. Finally, it mobilizes different measures of politician corruption to provide robust results. To achieve this objective, i.e., to determine the effect of political corruption on unemployment in Africa, this study uses data from 54 countries on the continent between 2012 and 2020. Corruption is measured by Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) Corruption Risk Index, and the Heritage Foundation’s Government Integrity Index. By using the generalized method of moments, the analysis first looks at the effect of corrupt politicians on public employment and private employment, and then assesses the effect of corruption on unemployment through these different sectors. The rest of this article is structured as follows: the first section reviews the literature, the second section gives details on the methodology used in this study to carry out the empirical analysis, and the third section discusses the estimation results.",1

Therefore, firms create a differential impact with not just tangible assets but also with their intangible assets (Cheikh & Noubbigh, 2019), such as knowledge assets and customer relations. Intangible capital includes investment in innovation via the utilization of human capital, and research and development capital (Yano & Shiraishi, 2019). Lately, intellectual capital (IC) has emerged as a vital tool for firms to grow and survive in a dynamic environment. IC has been conceptualized as the effective use of knowledge available in an organization (Bontis, 1998), and it consists of organizational capital and human capital (Bontis, 1998; Stewart, 1997; Youndt et al., 2004). From the macroeconomic perspective, IC not only leads to a larger share of the company in the stock market indices but also adds to the economic growth (Teplova & Sokolava, 2019). Edvinsson and Malone (1997) advocated that firms should focus on IC for their sustained growth. In the context of knowledge economies, IC has become a key factor of value creation, and its efficient management is crucial for the success of businesses (Abdulsalam et al., 2011) as it contributes 50–90 percent of the value created by firms in these economies surpassing the contribution of production and sale (Alipour, 2012). Therefore, the significance of IC cannot be undermined in evaluating the performance of the companies. Although there is an increasing importance of IC, many organizations fail to manage it because of measurement issues (Kim & Mauborgne, 2009). As a result, there has been a growing interest among researchers in studying the value of intangible assets to quantify the impact of investments in IC on a firm’s performance. The increasing importance of IC for businesses’ success and the continuous development of knowledge economies provide the primary motivation for the current study. The objective of the study is to highlight the significance of IC as a driver of firm value. Since IC is not reported in financial statements, the analysis can aid the managers and shareholders in determining the critical knowledge factors or value added intellectual coefficient (VAIC™) components that can enhance the performance of organizations. Various researchers have previously analyzed the association of IC and firm performance (e.g., Bontis, 1998; Chen et al., 2005; Moorman & Miner, 1997) in different countries. However, there is scant literature on the role of IC in the Indian economy. Therefore, this paper aims to elucidate the role played by intellectual capital in the context of Indian pharmaceutical companies, which can have important implications for other developing economies that are increasingly using IC for driving economic growth. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first studies using a comparative framework of VAIC™ model developed by Pulic (2000, 2004) and e-VAIC™ models developed by Vishnu and Gupta (2014) to assess the contribution of IC towards a firm’s performance in the context of the Indian pharmaceutical industry and evaluating if the latter performs better in explaining financial performance. The VAIC™ model classifies intellectual capital (IC) into three elements, capital employed, human capital (HC), and structural capital (SC), and measures the efficiency of each element of IC. The e-VAIC™ models include a fourth component: relational capital. Therefore, the results of the study can be used by the managers to manage their IC by applying these models to determine the changes required to harness their IC better and benchmark it against the competitors. The pharmaceutical industry is a knowledge-intensive industry that relies heavily on IC rather than on physical assets. The Indian pharmaceutical industry provides an excellent research opportunity for several reasons. Firstly, it is characterized by a high level of innovation and research and development (R&D) activities and is at par with its global counterparts in terms of advancements and technological developments (Vishnu & Gupta, 2014). Although the R&D expenditure of pharmaceutical firms in India is considerably lower than that of the developed countries, the average return on research capital of top 5 profitable Indian firms in 2018 (14.62%) was significantly higher than that of the top 5 profitable global firms (3.7%) (Reserve Bank of India, 2021). Secondly, the sector was valued at US$ 33 billion in 2017. It stands at the third position worldwide for pharmaceutical production by volume and at 14th position by value. It exports drugs to more than 200 countries, with the USA being one of its key markets. In addition to meeting 50% of the global demand for vaccines, India is also the largest supplier of generic medicines globally and meets 40% of generic drug demand in the USA alone (India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), 2021). The Indian pharmaceutical sector contributes 8% to the total merchandize exports and 1.72% to the GDP (Department of Pharmaceuticals, 2020). The industry is further expected to grow at a CAGR of 37% over the period of 2020–2025 to reach a market size of US$ 50 billion by 2025 (India Brand Equity Foundation (IBEF), 2021).Here, investment in IC plays a crucial role since it facilitates the dissemination of knowledge in the company to achieve the required competitive advantage (Dzenopoljac et al., 2017). The current study contributes to the existing knowledge by extending the understanding of the differential role played by IC in contributing to the performance and the value creation efficiency of these firms. The findings of the study highlight that VAIC and its components significantly enhance the financial performance of pharmaceutical firms in India, signifying the vital role of IC in influencing a company’s valuation and profitability. Therefore, managers should focus on developing strategies that enhance their IC efficiencies. In this regard, the VAIC™ method provides an important means for managers to integrate IC in the decision-making process (Alipour, 2012). The positive association also highlights that investors can benefit from the disclosure of IC information to assess the true market value of the firm while making their investment decisions. Furthermore, the variation in the contribution of VAIC components towards profitability and valuation suggests that decision-makers should develop strategies that not only capitalize on the most efficient IC resources but also improve the efficiency of other IC components for building long-term competitive advantage. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the “Literature Review and Conceptual Framework” section of the paper reviews the concept of IC, VAIC™, and the relationship between IC and performance. The “Research Methodology” section details the sample and model deployed for the study. The “Empirical Results” section presents the results and the “Discussion of Results” section provides a discussion of the results. Finally, Section “Conclusions” presents the conclusions of the research and the ensuing recommendations.",3

Thus, according to the created good, we can distinguish three main types of enterprises – production, transaction, and knowledge enterprises. The modern theory of the enterprise considers the three main types of enterprises mentioned above. Moreover, the knowledge enterprise is being investigated quite recently. In this study, we will use the term intelligent enterprise, which should be distinguished, despite the existing proximity, from a knowledge enterprise. An intelligent enterprise is an organization that creates knowledge, forms and develops intelligence, and conducts research. Although the production and transaction enterprises also have knowledge and intelligence, to some extent, they create it, but such activities are not basic for them but accompany the main work on creating products and services, which is the fundamental difference. In its purest form, an intelligent enterprise does not create a material product or a material service, although services in terms of knowledge transfer and training, the creation of certain abilities can be provided. Thus, despite the proximity, there is still some difference between a knowledge-based (knowledge-intensive) and an intelligent enterprise. This difference is that a knowledge-based enterprise can create knowledge and conduct research that can be sold as a product. In addition to knowledge itself, an intelligent enterprise creates ways of knowing, that is, methods and tools that can be used to expand the possibilities of analyzing, applying, and generating knowledge. By the way, these methods, techniques, and tools can also, in general, be sold, if it is possible to present them in the form of a certain algorithm, program, and database, that is, to put them on a different medium when they are separated from the person who owns them. These methods usually have unique characteristics, are often formed in a single copy, or represent the “know how” of a particular company – in this case, they are unlikely to be sold, unless in the event of bankruptcy or liquidation of the company. The manufacturing company is engaged in the development, design, and production of various products. The transaction enterprise provides services, is engaged in consulting activities, and provides the conclusion of agreements and contracts, information collection, and training. A knowledge-based or knowledge-intensive enterprise generates knowledge and carries out scientific work, which can be sold in the form of R&D. An intelligent enterprise does the same thing as a knowledge enterprise; plus, it creates ways to develop abilities and ensure the application of knowledge. The target functions of these three main types of enterprises differ significantly. The production company has a natural goal of creating a product with a market for it, that is, ensuring sales and high profits, and at the same time saving resources, which gives the efficiency of production. The production function connects the main factors that determine the production process – labor, capital, and material costs. Saving resources and obtaining the most acceptable, if not the greatest, profit is the main criterion for the functioning of such a company, justifying its emergence. The content of its activity is not only the creation of a new product (value), its manufacturing technology, but also the improvement of quality. A transactional enterprise in a semantic context is close to a production enterprise, only instead of a product, it creates, improves, and improves the quality of the service. Instead of the production function, a transaction function is used, the construction of which is usually similar or very similar to the production function. The transaction function includes the same factors – labor and capital, as well as transaction costs. The company strives to justify its existence, that is, to provide a positive balance, which can be done by striving for a certain profit that the services provided bring. These two types of enterprises change their technologies with the common goal of saving resources and costs, changing products and services, improving their quality, and replacing outdated ways of creating products and services, that is, replacing outdated technologies. The knowledge enterprise differs significantly from the first two types. It creates a good for which the market perspective is ambiguous. Moreover, there may initially be no consumer, which will arise after a significant time has passed since the creation of this knowledge. Of course, manufacturing and transactional enterprises, creating products and services, need knowledge, in particular, technological. They can acquire this knowledge either by buying the technology or creating it themselves. However, the main purpose of these two types of enterprises is to create products and provide services that have a real value at the time of creation and are sold on the market, since there is a demand for them. A knowledge enterprise is somewhat similar to the two types mentioned above, since it can conduct R&D and sell their results. At the same time, it is fundamentally different from the production and transaction enterprise in that the object of its activity is the creation of knowledge. Moreover, some of them can be sold in the form of R&D, and the other part cannot be immediately sold, since the knowledge needs to be fixed on some medium that can then be sold. In this regard, the target function of a knowledge enterprise is not to obtain an acceptable or the greatest profit, and not to sell on the market, but to generate a certain knowledge that has a prospect of application and therefore further prospects in the market. The ability to acquire new knowledge is defined by the intelligence of such an enterprise, by which we will understand the existing initial set of knowledge and experience of employees and management of the enterprise, their mental abilities to learn, taking into account the methods and tools (created inside or outside the enterprise) for analyzing the environment, applying this knowledge to obtain new knowledge. If the totality of the initial knowledge plus the specific knowledge created by the enterprise can be defined as its intelligent capital, then the ability and scope of applying knowledge to study various situations with a common goal of finding new knowledge can be defined as the intelligence of the enterprise. An intelligent enterprise is close in meaning to a knowledge enterprise, but its objective function is broader – it is the improvement of intelligence, all its parts, including abilities. As already noted, the difference is that it is not always possible to sell skills, and the labor market does not always solve this problem. Therefore, despite the existing clarifications and differences, nevertheless, an intelligent enterprise can be considered today as a kind of knowledge enterprise. However, if theoretical and applied research is devoted to the knowledge enterprise, then very little literature is devoted to the new phenomenon in the form of an intelligent enterprise, where the structure of intelligence is important. All types of enterprises have intelligence, because they have intelligent capital, that is, the initial and current-generated knowledge, as well as the ability to search for new knowledge and assess the environment. Moreover, these abilities are a function of the initial amount of knowledge plus the generated knowledge. A knowledge enterprise does not have a material product or service but knowledge as the content of its work. Moreover, the production or transaction function in this case does not describe the company’s activities. Knowledge creation is a very complex process defined by intelligence, consisting of initial knowledge, new knowledge being created, and abilities, including experience, aptitudes for search work, environmental analysis, perception, and research within specific areas of knowledge being created. For a knowledge enterprise, an intelligent function is needed that determines the amount of knowledge depending on the development of the intelligent abilities of the enterprise, its intelligence, presented here in the form of three main parts. The ability to research and generate new knowledge also depends on the perception, ability to analyze, and cognitive and mental characteristics of the company’s staff and management. Typically, such enterprises are not characterized by significant capital influence in the sense of fixed assets, although the premises and computer park, as well as information databases, including big data processing technology, and the Internet are used as the conditions for their operation. To generate relevant knowledge, you need intelligence rather than a room or even a computer park. Although, the conditions of information support for the work of such enterprises are of high importance. The classical theory of the enterprise, which is able to describe the work of a production and partly transactional enterprise, introducing the assumption of the desire for the greatest profit, completeness of contracts, and symmetric information (Becchetti et al., 2020; Ismagilova et al., 2015), is completely powerless in describing the knowledge, intelligent enterprise, especially when intelligence becomes the basic factor of the functioning of such an enterprise. This company, in fact, turns into a creative design, and we need a creative function. In fairness, it should be noted that in relation to the transaction enterprise today, the completeness of contracts is revised–turns into incompleteness–taking into account the asymmetry of information. Such enterprise models are widely used in the framework of new institutional theory or modified classical enterprise models (Buldyrev et al., 2016; Schmitz, 2017, 2020). Considering an enterprise as a multi-purpose organization that does not strive for the greatest profit, or at the level of shareholders that does not set a goal in the form of profit (Hill, 2020), also does not show a way out in the theoretical plane, since some goals can dominate, be the main ones. Therefore, individual enterprises do not show a multi-purpose orientation of their activities. A knowledge-based, intelligent enterprise may turn out to be just such an enterprise, since the research goal is quite specific, and many goals can be an unbearable burden for search and intelligent work. The asymmetry of information gives different conditions of choice, which affects the distribution of ownership rights and affects the decisions of the enterprise. In particular, the moral hazard ex-post makes the investment dependent on the relationship, which changes the incentives to invest in the enterprise. However, these changes, which bring the classical model of the enterprise closer to the plausible version, can be very carefully transferred to the functioning of the expanding number of intelligent enterprises in the economy. Thus, we are talking about creative work, which at the considered time intervals will not be associated with profit at all and the corresponding market development goals. Risk assessment will also have great difficulties, which were absent when considering the production and even transactional enterprise, where it was possible to take into account even the correlation of risks as a factor in the enterprise’s decision-making (Alghalith, 2016). If it is possible to take risks into account within the framework of the classical theory of the enterprise, since they are related to the markets of products and services, then this task becomes very difficult in relation to new knowledge, which is even more heterogeneous than products and services. The distribution of enterprises by size and the relationship with employment–the effects characteristic of a manufacturing enterprise–for an intelligent enterprise will be absent, since small employment and size can create a very significant amount of new knowledge and have a developed intelligence of the enterprise (Görg et al., 2017). Therefore, the size of an intelligent enterprise is not such a limiting parameter of its functioning. The evolution of the theories of the enterprise led to the creation of many theoretical constructions that greatly simplified and unified the enterprise, which gave rise to a number of significant limitations in the knowledge of the origin and functioning of such an organization. The most recent approaches are no exception. Thus, the “sustainability-oriented” theory of the enterprise (Lozano et al., 2015), which criticized the equity, aggregate, resource, and contract theories that do not clarify the aspects of ensuring sustainable development–economic, environmental, social, and temporal–is built solely on the basis of the criticized approaches, with the correction of the target function of the enterprise for ensuring sustainability. At the same time, different types of sustainability are not considered, although there is a clear step forward in relation to the classical version of the assessment of economic sustainability by the production function, which includes capital, labor, infrastructure, and materials (Dormady et al., 2019). The behavioral theory of the enterprise incorporates behavioral characteristics into the classical theory of the enterprise (Augier & March, 2008), developing analysis at the level of enterprise decision-making options. The Schumpeterian theory of “many quality enterprises” (Latzer, 2018) links the consideration of enterprises in the Schumpeterian structure (vertical innovation structures) to income inequality within the quality ladder. When the consumer of an enterprise’s products pays a significant amount for quality, it encourages investment in R&D and market share expansion. Vertical innovation structures with multi-product enterprises are emerging. The creative field of economics is more likely to be described by such enterprises–only not by product enterprises, but with diversified knowledge and developed intelligence, including the use of artificial intelligence. The emerging knowledge market will differ not only in its vertical structure, but also in its horizontal structure, which will be ensured by the multidimensional application of the same knowledge. Of course, to produce knowledge as a product requires intelligence. The problems of intelligence and the intelligent enterprise that grows out of the knowledge enterprise are reflected in the literature, to put it mildly, very modestly. However, the work of enterprises engaged in R&D or creating knowledge has been covered much better recently, due to the scope that the “knowledge economy” is gaining. For example, we research the impact of the knowledge management strategy and intellectual capital on the effectiveness of innovation (Buenechea-Elberdin et al., 2018; Cabrilo & Dahms, 2018), as well as the intellectual capital component on the performance of firms in various conditions of market dynamics (Holienka & Pilková, 2014), taking into account the size of the firm and financial leverage. In such studies, the so called intelligent value-added coefficient is introduced, which allows accounting for financial data, although it is not perfect. Using structural equations (SEM) and qualitative comparative analysis of fuzzy sets, the influence of relational capital on the effectiveness of innovation is investigated (Cabrilo & Dahms, 2018). In general, these studies allow us to obtain various options for the impact of intellectual capital on the functioning of firms, for example, on value creation under various factors and conditions (Cheikh & Noubbigh, 2019; Rossi & Magni, 2017). At the same time, the analysis of the impact of intangible assets on the development of firms is becoming widely used, and measurement methods affect the assessment and interpretation of this impact (Fiano et al., 2020; Nikolaou, 2019). Industry-specific applications of research in the field of knowledge management, in particular in healthcare, can be noted (Orlando et al., 2021). Summing up, we note that the problem of connecting knowledge and intelligence of a firm requires research, especially for a knowledge and intellectual firm. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to identify the properties and characteristics of an intelligent enterprise, as opposed to other types, to analyze the relationship between intelligence and knowledge of the enterprise with the allocation of its functioning modes depending on the structure of intelligence, which is represented by accumulated, created knowledge and the ability to use it, which is expressed in the decisions made by the enterprise. Here, the established criteria for decision-making, the content side of decisions, and the study of the differences that arise between an intelligent enterprise and other types of enterprises are also of great importance. The research methodology uses a structural and classification approach, a comparative analysis of the characteristics and competitive tools that can be used by intelligent enterprises. The use of these tools allows you to intercept the achievements of scientific and search activities, which will be shown in the general scheme of competition of this type of enterprises. Thus, the study includes three stages, embodying the consistent implementation of the following tasks: The study of changes in the theory of the enterprise and modern approaches in connection with the inclusion of knowledge and intelligence in the analysis, a comparative assessment of the characteristics of the main types of enterprises, with the allocation of the intelligent enterprise Representation of the structure of intelligence and its allocation of modes of functioning of the company, as well as models of the intelligent enterprise within the framework of the matrix “knowledge-intelligence” with appropriate management implications; obtaining the target function of the growth of the intelligent enterprise Description of the institutional competition of intelligent enterprises seeking to seize the initiative in the development of new knowledge (in the form of technologies, scientific research) Covering the three stages of the study and solving the tasks set will create a general picture and an approach to studying the influence of the company’s intelligence on its development. In part, the solutions obtained are applicable to the production and transaction enterprise, with an adjustment for the goal function that distinguishes them from the knowledge and intelligent enterprise.",

As elements of SEW, the first ingredient reflects the family’s actual/desired influence in the business, while the second can be characterized as the essence ingredient, which has attracted much attention from scholars, since family firms sustain their tradition through transgenerational succession (Berrone et al., 2012; Suess-Reyes, 2016). It is also the issue addressed by this research. The SEW approach considers five dimensions and the research is based on that construct. However, there is some controversy in the literature regarding the dimensions and their characteristics and interactions (Chua et al., 2015; Swab et al., 2020). The definition of the essence of family businesses includes the idea that the “intention or behavior is potentially sustainable across generations,” which is aligned with the SEW dimension “renewal of family bonds through succession.” The other four dimensions — (a) family control and influence, (b) family emotional attachment, (c) family identification, and (d) family social bonds — translate the “how to” of the family business personality. Thus, there are dimensions that are part of the day-to-day of the business, as well as an extremely important one related to the long-term goal. The more the family business continues as a family business, the more this fifth dimension is strengthened. The SEW approach covers “the non-financial aspects of the firm that meet the family’s affective needs, such as identity, the ability to exercise family influence, and the perpetuation of family dynasty” (Gómez-Mejía et al., 2007, p. 106). Besides containing quantitative, economic elements that are present in other approaches, it incorporates subjective elements that allow for a better understanding of the relationship between the family and organization. It helps account for strategic decisions that cannot be explained by applying the economic or risk avoidance framework (Berrone et al., 2012; Zellweger et al., 2012a, b). These subjective elements captured by the SEW approach (Berrone et al., 2012) can explain some managerial decisions that are not efficient according to purely economic analyses (Zellweger et al., 2012a, b), requiring mechanisms to handle the business and its relationship with the family owners. These mechanisms can be used, for instance, to stimulate knowledge transfer (Giovannoni et al., 2011) and the implementation of strategies in the organization (Acquaah, 2013; Martínez-Bobillo et al., 2021). The organization’s strategies need to address and balance the entity’s sustainability and the family’s concerns, which naturally lead to time pressures for results that may differ from non-family businesses. Although the “natural” way to run family businesses is through dynastic succession (Kimhi, 1997; Zellweger et al., 2012a, b; Berrone et al., 2012; Umans et al., 2019; Umans et al., 2020), this process may face some challenges and barriers, economically speaking and with regards to generational integration and the family and non-family interaction. First, considering the economic perspective, Martínez Romero and Rojo Ramírez (2017) discussed the rate of return for the owners based on the SEW. Discussions about the “price” of compensation for lost SEW are part of the family business’s life (Berrone et al., 2012). As a result of the SEW, it could accept lower earnings in the short run (Gómez-Mejía et al., 2007) and there could be high tolerance of lower performance even if the family has substantial control over the organization (Craig & Newbert, 2020). Capital structure, cost of money, and the correspondent risks are also relevant and may impact the trend of SEW (Molly et al., 2019). Second, regarding generational integration issues (Zellweger et al., 2012a, b) provided evidence on the longevity of family businesses based on the transgenerational entrepreneurship of families and relevant elements such as the incentives structures, plans, and performance measures implemented. Third, considering the family and non-family interaction, Umans et al. (2019) researched the relationship between the family successor and the non-family executives in an environment where the family has multiple goals and different modes of professionalization (Stewart & Hitt, 2012). The second ingredient (generational integration issues) seems to be deterministic considering that it is an assumption: it must happen. Alternatively to this approach, we may consider how to support and drive the organization to transgenerational succession in the long run, considering it as a challenge for family businesses (i.e., Giovannoni et al., 2011; Suess-Reyes, 2016). Management control is a mechanism that affects behavior according to the goals of the organization (Helsen et al., 2017; Kapiyangoda & Gooneratne, 2021; Einhorn et al., 2021). “If” and “how” it is used is important (Helsen et al., 2017), as the “overlap of family ownership and management has an important impact on traditional agency prescription” (Helsen et al., 2017, p. 5). A management model should contain artifacts for planning and control, taking into account the given organizational structure, and it should aim to ensure that people do what is expected of them (Macintosh & Quattrone, 2010). It should also preserve the accumulated knowledge for future generations. For this, there are artifacts such as the strategic planning process, budget, balanced scorecard (BSC), forecast, and budgetary control, used for diagnostic and interactive purposes (Adler & Chen, 2011; Einhorn et al., 2021; Merchant & Van der Stede, 2007; Quinn et al., 2018). The debate regarding family business continuity and transgenerational sustainability cannot be detached from management control; on the contrary, they should both be treated in an integrated way (e.g., Culasso et al., 2018; Mucci et al., 2021). A considerable stream of the literature focuses on the agent-manager perspective, but the structure to support decisions and management is not addressed, even though the words “management” and “control” are frequently found (Barros et al., 2017; Basco, 2014; Berrone et al., 2012; Craig & Newbert, 2020; Nason et al., 2019; Umans et al., 2020; Vazquez & Rocha, 2018). The combination of the family, ownership, and business (Davis, 2001) challenges any analyses due to the overlap. Despite the various recommendations provided by the references, there remains a gap in the literature regarding the management control mechanisms that can drive the organization to accomplish its economic targets and address the impact of the SEW and non-economic issues on the relationship between the family and the organization (Kapiyangoda & Gooneratne, 2021; Sbarba, & Marelli, 2018). Non-economic issues are part of the family business and “may benefit not only the dominant coalition who control the decision making but also other stakeholders as well” (Chua et al., 2015, p. 173). Moreover, the family’s non-economic goals may overlap and have causal synergic or substitute relationships (Zellweger & Nason, 2008). Management controls are usually treated based on the assumptions of agency theory (Lambert, 2006), which include economic rationality, and their impact on governance is strongly influenced by the idea that the roles are carried out by different people (principal and agent). However, in family businesses, these different roles may be carried out by family managers and there are concerns about the lack of a specific management control structure for family businesses (Acquaah, 2013; Helsen et al., 2017). If management control exists precisely to guide organizations towards viable activity patterns in changing environments (Berry et al., 2005), its role in family businesses must be addressed. The usage of mechanisms represents an important gap in the research due to its consequences for family businesses, such as in the implementation of strategies and regarding performance (Acquaah, 2013). The main conceptual contribution of this research lies in integrating the intention to be sustainable across the generations of a family business with management control mechanisms in order to provide a comprehensive perception of the phenomena and their implications. In addition, this paper addresses recent claims from the literature by filling the gap related to the link between management accounting and the particularities of family firms (i.e., Einhorn et al., 2021; Kapiyangoda & Gooneratne, 2021; Sbarba & Marelli, 2018). Therefore, we identify and discuss the following research question: considering the SEW perspective, how can elements of management control that could impact the organization’s potential sustainability across generations be captured? This paper is organized into six sections, including this introduction. In the second section, we present the conceptual background, which encompasses SEW and management control use in family businesses. This is followed in the third section by the conceptual model and research hypotheses. In the fourth section, we show the research design, and in the fifth section, we explore the results of the data analysis. The data analysis section includes the descriptive statistics, the structural equation modeling results, and the conceptual implications of our findings. In the last section, we conclude with the main discussions and contributions of the study.",4

An Empirical Analysis of 24 Low-Income Countries,June 2023,Ranjan Kumar Dash,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The contribution of international migration to economic development is a hotly debated issue in development literature. Migration has both direct impact in the form of remittance inflows and indirect impacts such as trade creation, financial development, skill development, technology diffusion, productivity enhancement, increase in public revenue, capital accumulation, and ensuring better quality of life (Fayissa & Nsiah, 2010; Barajas et al., 2009; Ratha, 2013, Rao & Hassan, 2012; Chowdhury, 2016; Hübler, 2016) for origin countries. Data from World Bank (2020) suggests that total remittances were $694 billion in 2018 with 77% of the remittances ($530 billion) accruing to low and lower middle-income countries which is three times more than the foreign aid received. Furthermore, low-income countries (LICs) have received around $22 billion in remittances which accounted for 3.5% of the total inflows, higher than the total FDI inflows at $13 billion. In fact, remittances constituted 5% of the GDP for LICs while FDI stood at 3.3% of their GDP in 2018. These trends suggest that international migration has significant tangible benefits in the form of remittances, as they currently represent the most important form of external financial flows for LICs. With the rise in remittances, the number of studies examining their development impact has also increased. Overall, studies suggest that remittances boost economic growth and reduce poverty by increasing consumption, savings, financial development, and human capital formation (Adam & Page, 2005; Rao & Hassan, 2012; Ratha, 2013; Chowdhury, 2016). While empirical literature has mainly focused on the link between remittances and growth (Fayissa & Nsiah, 2010; Barajas et al., 2009; Chowdhury, 2016), only limited studies have looked at the impact of remittances on domestic investment. Furthermore, the results of such studies have been inconclusive. Some studies (Balde, 2011; Dzansi, 2013; Dash, 2020) have highlighted the positive effects of remittances on domestic investment, but others (Tung, 2018a; Mallick, 2012) have found that remittances reduce investment as they may be used for unproductive consumption purposes. Moreover, most cross-country studies have examined the investment of remittances for developing countries as a whole, which may not hold for LICs as the conditions may be vastly different in such economies. Given the limited number of studies and their inconclusive findings, this paper examines the impact of remittances on domestic investment for 24 LICsFootnote 1 over the period 2004–2018. In this context, this study contributes to the existing literature in several ways. First, the study acknowledges that there exists wide variation in the nature of developing countries and focuses exclusively on LICs to capture the developmental impact of remittances for this particular group of countries. Second, in addition to direct effect, the study also examines the different channels effect through which remittances may affect investment, such as through its effect on financial markets, human capital, trade, and consumption. Third, the existing studies have not adequately covered the various financial channels through which remittances may affect domestic investment, as they tend to rely on only a single indicator for financial development. In comparison, this study uses a composite financial development indicatorFootnote 2 (covering various dimensions such as bank branches per one lakh adults, bank credit to GDP, and M2 by GDP) to study the same (Appendix 1). Fourth, the study also examines causality relationship between remittance and investment, which is vital for policy formulation but has been mostly neglected in the current literature. Fifth, the present study also uses second-generation panel estimation to deal with endogeneity, heterogeneity, and cross-section dependency more meritoriously. Besides the “Introduction” section, the study paper consists of five other sections. “Review of Literature” reviews the existing literature on the impact of remittances on the economies of the recipient countries. “Significance of Remittances for LICs” lays out the trends and significance of remittances for different countries grouped by their income levels. The model specifications, nature of variables, and data sources used in the empirical analysis are presented in “Empirical Model and Data Description.” The results of the empirical analysis are reported and discussed in “Analysis of Results.” Finally, the study concludes in “Conclusion and Policy Implications” where the overall results of the study and its policy implications are laid out.",

It includes three main areas of performance: economic performance, corporate social responsibility (hereafter CSR) performance, and environmental performance. Corporate social responsibility is defined by McWilliams and Siegel (2001) as involving “actions that appear to further some social good, beyond the interests of the firm and that which is required by law” (p. 117). Corporate social responsibility (CSR) refers to “the triple bottom line of economic, social, and environmental performance”, Aguinis (2011). The CSR concerns values of firms, culture, decision-making, strategy, and operations in a transparent and accountable manner and thereby establish better practices within the firm, create wealth, and improve society (Kirat, 2015). CSR is the expression in microeconomics for sustainable development (SD) (Simen & Ndao, 2013). Helfat and Martin (2015) and Liu et al. (2018) mentioned that superior managerial capabilities facilitate successful strategic changes, such as a digital transformation, realized as improvements in business performance. For that reason, good facts of a digital business strategy help managers proactively identify risks and find solutions for those risks (Xue, 2017). In this line, blockchain technology (BT) represents “the backbone” of a new digital supply chain (Figorilli et al., 2018; Kshetri, 2018), maintains a competitive advantage, and generates improved performance (Lu et al., 2014). Blockchain is a distributed database built on the principle of cryptography. Blockchain is a distributed technology that increases the visibility and transparency of the stored transactions (Wang et al., 2019), that ensures a single version of truth which helps build trust in the stored information (Queiroz et al., 2019), and that allows for the automatic execution of transactions (Lacity, 2018). In addition to promoting proxy voting, identity authentication, and personal social credit, BT also has the ability to convey value and solve the crisis of trust (Caro et al., 2018) and increases the efficiency, reliability, and transparency of supply chain management (Wamba et al., 2018a, b). Although blockchain reporting has much to offer, there are also significant challenges to its adoption in CSR. Now is the perfect time to learn about the technology while remembering that true transparency and ethical operations always involve the human element. The use of blockchain technology may be an excellent solution to ensure reliability, transparency, and security, especially for those commodities susceptible to fraud (Figorilli et al., 2018). Yermack (2015) argues that blockchain offers a great deal of increase in accuracy, efficiency, and transparency in corporate voting, share ownership, and record keeping, replacing the decades-old corporate practices. Therefore, a much modern relationship between the shareholders and the management could be established by the utilization of this technology, which could certainly lower the agency costs in a corporation while improving the trust between the parties in this context (Van der Elst & Lafarre, 2017). Companies aim at increasing financial performance by digitalizing their operational environments and infrastructures (Chae et al., 2018). Baumgartner and Rauter (2017) highlight that accepting the business value of sustainable strategic management requires that the company’s utility be analyzed. Sustainable development by companies can improve business opportunities, power the process efficiency and productivity, reduce risks to the environment and social impacts, and support more sustainable products and services. Thus, the resulting benefits may maximize the corporate social responsibility in the form of improved social performance or improved competitiveness. Nevertheless, the increased transparency and clarity that blockchain can provide could be useful for CSR initiatives. The corporate commitment to CSR creates opportunities for innovation (Castiaux, 2009). Chan et al. (2020) propose the use of disruptive technologies such as blockchain to entice the luxury fashion brand to create a CSR-improving situation. Investors want to know that companies are following through on their promises. Blockchain is one way the organization could help ensure CSR performance. If the organization decides to implement blockchain relative to CSR, the manager should make sure investors know what s/he has done and how this will benefit the organization and its values Interlogica (2017). In addition, management’s access to resources is expected to develop across different stages of the life cycle; thus, the relation between BT and CSR performance progresses depends upon the stages of the firm’s life cycle. We also argue that the association between BT and CSR performance is moderated by the firm’s life cycle stages. This interaction is also dynamic in nature and depends upon variation in economic factors such as the asset turnover, retained earnings, cash flows …Consequently, our overarching research question was: How will the life cycle stages moderate the association between BT and CSR performance enterprises? Through this enquiry, we expected to gain insights into the following sub-questions: RQ1. How does blockchain provide benefit for companies to conduct transactions within the company or with customers, other companies, stakeholders, and the government? RQ2. How does the life cycle impact the relationship between BT and CSR performance? Based on a sample of 297 European firm-years data (covering the 2014–2018 periods), our regression results show that implemented BT is significantly and positively associated with CSR performance. Moreover, the positive association is magnified for firms in the mature stage of life cycle development. Our results are robust to alternative proxy measures of CSR performance and life cycle stages. Our findings extend the literature on the use of BT and the economic consequences engaging in certain types of CSR activity. This paper contributes to the literature in two areas. Firstly, we propose a standard model to explore the influence mechanism of BT on CSR performance. Secondly, we collected relevant information from BT listed in the STOXX Europe 600 during 2014–2018 periods and quantitatively verified the moderate impact of life cycle stage on this association.

The defining characteristics of family businesses are focused on management engagement with congenital learning (Cegarra-Navarro & Wensley, 2009) and on the passage of these businesses from one generation to another (Ruiz et al., 2010). As Brumana et al. (2017) point out, family firms adopt strategic behaviour conditioned by their idiosyncratic characteristics (e.g. family ownership, management, and involvement) and motivations (e.g. transgenerational succession). This, in turn, facilitates the emergence of a culture focused on keeping the future in mind and reinforcing constancy (Moss et al., 2014). Open innovation has become one of the most relevant concepts in innovation management, and it basically involves opening the innovation process to collaborate with external agents or outsiders (Huizingh, 2011). Open innovation may be considered to be particularly troubling in family businesses where their managers are often constrained by a lack of resources and information (Popa et al., 2017; Jalilvand et al., 2019). Since open social media use (SM) can provide an opportunity to foster workplace collaboration of family businesses staff with external stakeholders (Aral et al., 2013; De Zubielqui et al., 2019), social media use can be seen as a source of external information (Mention, 2011; Mention et al., 2019) and a facilitator of open innovation (Mount & García, 2014). Previous studies have examined the impact of social media in knowledge creation and innovation processes (Papa et al., 2018; Pérez-González et al., 2017), its impact in fostering incremental and radical innovations (Torres de Oliveira et al., 2019). Following an open innovation perspective, De Zubielqui et al. (2019) empirically observed that external knowledge flows from market-based actors sourced by social media enhanced innovation, and they noted that it was necessary to better examine specific organisational mechanisms facilitating effective knowledge transfer in this process (Keegan & Rowley, 2017). It is worth noting that information is not the same as knowledge. Although the information provided by the social media use is valuable, it may be more appropriate to assimilate it and apply it to commercial ends (Cohen & Levinthal, 1990). In doing so, absorptive capacity has been recognized as a relevant prerequisite to develop open innovation activities (Huizingh, 2011; Ooms et al., 2015a, b; Spithoven et al., 2010). Absorptive capacity involves a set of organizational routines and processes through which firms acquire, assimilate, transform, and exploit knowledge in order to create value and obtain a competitive advantage (Zahra & George, 2002). Even though social media use has been considered as a key tool to facilitate open innovation, empirical research on the combined effect of social media use and absorptive capacity on enhancing open innovation has not been properly examined in the literature (Torres de Oliveira et al., 2019). These complex relationships raise a number of important KM-related questions. How does social media use enhance open innovation practices and absorptive capacity in family firms? Is there a mediating effect of absorptive capacity of the impact of social media use on open innovation? With the introduction of “social media use” and a subsequent measurement instrument, this study makes three significant contributions to the field of knowledge management in family firm context. First, this study conceptualizes social media use (SM) and distinguishes the construct from social media presence. A conceptual delineation is vital as it captures the essential characteristics of the construct, its observable manifestations and the interrelationships (Tajvidi & Karami, 2021). Second, by developing a measurement instrument to quantify the SM of Spanish family firms, this study addresses an important empirical challenge of family firms, which is the contribution of social networking to non-financial performances, such as open innovation and absorptive capacity (Chukwujioke Agbimi, 2019). Finally, testing both, the direct and indirect effects of SM on open innovation, this study reveals promising research opportunities by proposing absorptive capacity as a mediator between SM and open innovation. Therefore, the model offers future researchers a wide range of research avenues to uncover the black box of SM in family firms (Strike et al., 2018).",15

The central concepts that these combined democracies are freedom, equality, and control. These three dimensions are also necessary when determining the quality of democracy within a country (Lauth, 2004, 96f). Constitutive features of democracy find their expression in the participation of the people. In this article, the dimension of political control particularly, parliamentary committees of inquiry will be examined in detail. On the one hand, the effect of such parliamentary investigations on the quality of democracy will be assessed, and on the other, their innovative characters will be illustrated. Parliamentary committees of inquiry are particularly important for political control in democratic systems. Through their special investigative powers, they can inspect government files and documents. Thus, their control function extends further than any other parliamentary right of scrutiny. However, in the media and public, the results of the committees of inquiry are often doubted and presented as irrelevant. The reasons for this include the apparent lack of personnel consequences at the political level and the lack of consequences at the legal level (Keppel 2019). The following article explores these views through qualitative analysis to examine parliamentary investigations in Austria and Germany. The 2015 reform of committees of inquiry in the Austrian National Council made it possible to have the minority right to set up a committee of inquiry for the first time. In Austria, this followed the practice of the German Bundestag, which has been applicable for decades. This constellation makes it possible to observe the results of the investigations comparatively and pursue the leading research question: What influence do parliamentary committees of inquiry have on the political dimension of scrutiny, and what is the innovative power of this instrument of scrutiny? The theoretical basis of this study is Hans Joachim Lauth’s research on the three-dimensional concept of democracy, using the dimension of control (Lauth, 2004, 32ff) as the theoretical foundation. Lauth developed this concept to determine the quality of democracy and suggested using a 15-field matrix (Lauth, 2015). The indicators that are relevant for determining the degree of control are used for the review to illustrate the impact that committees of inquiry can have on the dimension of control. The theoretical description of the dimension of control will thus be subjected to a practical test based on the results from the committees of inquiry, which will also determine its innovative character. Innovation in this study is created primarily by generating knowledge about the agencies and institutions under investigation. The more knowledge obtained, the better the identification of the grievances in the democratic system, which can, in turn, contribute to increasing the quality of democracy. Based on a theoretical examination of the relationship between democratic quality and control, the “Introduction” section presents the 15-field matrix in greater detail. The “Quality of Democracy and Political Control” section of the article examines the parliamentary committees of inquiry in Austria and Germany. Based on these results, the analysis (the “Control and the Matrix of Democracy”) section answers the guiding research question. It generates hypotheses to guide further quantitative research and establish a concrete classification of the political, legal, and social influences of committees of inquiry. With reference to this, the influence of investigative committees on knowledge democracy (In’t Veld, 2010) will also be examined. The generation of knowledge is crucial for a further detailed determination of the quality of democracy. This adds an additional element to the relationship between knowledge and the quality of democracy.",4

S3 is a research and innovation agenda for regional economic transformation including a bottom-up, place-based approach to regional development and originated from the aim of closing the productivity gap between Europe and key trading partners such as China and USA (Foray et al., 2012). The achievement of an effective ‘collaborative governance’ within S3 has been introduced with a great emphasis (Lepore & Spigarelli, 2018), and the concept of EDP is based on this governance approach. EDP is an inclusive and interactive mainly bottom-up process in which participants form the quadruple helix engage with each other to identify potential new activities and competitive advantages as well as its challenges and priorities, all to be tackled throughout the implementation of S3 (Müür 2021; Esparza-Masana, 2021; Santini et al., 2015). As Esparza-Masana (2021) argues, EDP is a strategy to avoid a ‘one-size-fits all’ in order to maximise the effectiveness of the strategy. Moreover, the European Union enters now a new multiannual programming period from 2021 until 2027 including new strategies for sustainable, resilient, just, and inclusive growth. S3 will continue to play an important role under the policy objective of a smarter Europe. Actions to manage industrial transition and measures for international collaboration have been introduced to ensure continuity and impact. Moreover, the S3 concept will be adapted by embedding the directionality of the 2030 Agenda and goals of systemic transformation underpinning the Sustainable Development Goals. Within this framework, the Commission is developing the concept of Smart Specialisation Strategies for Sustainability (S4) defined as place-based innovation-led transformation for growth and sustainability. S4 will then combine top-down directionality with bottom-up processes of EDP, and the involvement of local actors will continue to be a key feature of place-based innovation processes (McCann & Soete, 2020). However, as Esparza-Masana (2021) argues when referring to the challenges of moving from ‘S3 1.0 into S3 2.0’, the implementation of EDP is still a difficult task. Actually, one of the major challenges of smart specialisation strategies today is the implementation of EDPs (Roman & Nyberg, 2017). Consequently, further study is needed as to the specific roles that governments play in this endeavour (Aranguren et al., 2018; Lepore & Spigarelli, 2018; Müür, 2021). The problem addressed in this paper is that although the literature on smart specialisation describes the features of EDPs and points out the need for the public sector to take on a new role in developing them, most contributions fall short when specifying what this role should consist of in. Many guides and handbooks offer insights to policymakers involved in EDPs (Mieszkowski & Kardas, 2015; Periánez-Forte et al., 2016; Gianelle et al., 2016; Marinelli & Periánez-Forte, 2017; Detterbeck, 2018). While some of them focus on specific operationalisation challenges (Todeva & Ketikidis, 2017; Vivanco et al., 2016; Martínez López & Palazuelos Martínez, 2015), others offer a holistic process approach (Roman & Nyberg, 2017). Müür (2021), for example, attempts to do so by analysing the role of intermediary agents who facilitate interaction among territorial actors in Estonia and Finland. However, Müur coincides with Carayannis and Rakhmatullin (2014) and Lepore and Spigarelli (2018) when arguing that literature on smart specialisation underlines the importance of considering the territorial strategic planning and multi-actor collaboration capability in order to advance, but ‘less attention has been put on how such coordination is organised or what it should look like’ (p. 28). Hence, it can be stated that the specific roles of policymakers within EDPs have not been comprehensively analysed and moreover, that the literature on EDP lacks actionable knowledge developed about these specific roles. The novelty of the framework and analysis of this paper is that it takes concepts already shared in the literature and integrates them in a knowledge co-generation process based in action research. This means that policy makers and researchers worked together in the context of policy making, simultaneously generating and applying knowledge. Therefore, the knowledge generated is both more contextual and more actionable. The novelty, thus, is not in the generic roles we share, but in the dilemmas, efforts, tensions, needs, power issues, challenges, risks, implicit conflicts, and difficulties we connect to these roles, which increase their actionability. Our contribution is oriented to researchers and policy makers interested not exclusively in the theoretical or conceptual discussion of EDP, but also in how they can address its challenges together. Our rationale is thus that there is literature on facilitating territorial development processes that can be adapted to the specificities of the EDP and help fill this gap in the smart specialisation literature; however, there is no literature on what makes these roles actionable. Coherently, we define a twofold research question: What are the roles of policymakers in facilitating EDP processes? What are the features that make these roles actionable? The case study used to test this framework is the urban smart specialisation strategy of the city of Bilbao (Basque Country, Spain), where policymakers of the city council and the city development agency (Bilbao Ekintza) have experimented with this role in the context of an action research project. Based on this research results, we propose here an analytical framework for facilitating EDP processes by policymakers, which we have called the six roles of facilitative policymakers in EDPs. Moreover, by using action research as the methodological approach, the case contributes to the discussion by Santini et al. (2015) about the challenge of bridging the gap between ‘thinkers’ and ‘doers’ in EDPs. As these authors underline, the EDP is an opportunity to fill this gap that can also be seen in many other fields. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: in the next section, we share our theoretical framework and argue that policymakers need to reformulate their role in EDPs. A conceptual section on this new role follows, together with a description of the case. We then present the discussion of the case together with the conclusions.",1

The knowledge economy and its related studies focus on the questions of innovation, technological progress, and their influence on the overall economy (Madrak-Grochowska, 2015). In previous decades, economic theory has attempted to catch up to these developments and move away from the classification of Stigler (1961: 213), where knowledge occupied a “slum dwelling” in the discipline. Numerous scholars tried placing knowledge and information at the center of economic analysis (Hayek, 1937, 1945; Stigler, 1961; Alchian, 1969; Marschak, 1969; Hirshleifer, 1973; Hurwicz, 1973; Koopmans, 1977; Grossman & Stiglitz, 1976, 1980; Sah & Stiglitz, 1985; Thomsen, 1992; Stiglitz, 2000, 2002; Myerson, 2009; Rothbard, 2009; Easterly, 2014; Koppl, 2018). The research on the economics of knowledge since then followed many different paths, from treatment of information as statistical induction to symbolic computation or “measures over partitions of states of the world” (Mirowski & Nik-Khah, 2017: 152). However, the overall project still exhibits a significant research gap up to this day, best summarized by Mirowski and Nik-Khah (2017: 151): “there is still no single orthodox economics of information, even at this late date, although there are trends that can be described, if not completely explained.” Unless such a single theory is created, the current efforts at studying the economics of knowledge are bound to remain disjointed, applicable only to niche fields of inquiry. Our research goal then lies in moving toward a single theoretical framework for economics of knowledge that is applicable to a large variety of cases. We believe that the concept of knowledge encapsulation, devised by Demsetz (1988, 1997), may provide a focal point for such efforts. Demsetz understood knowledge encapsulation as the existence of various algorithms which shape knowledge into an easily digestible form and enable its cost-efficient transfer between economic actors. The logic explicated by Demsetz is vast in scope, as it deals with a problem universally faced by all economic agents, namely, in overcoming the costliness of utilizing full, perfect knowledge. Unfortunately, Demsetz stopped short of any generalizable propositions and mostly focused on the study of firms. As such, it befalls to us to expand the conceptual scope of the Demsetzian knowledge encapsulation, so that it may become a centerpiece in a general theory of knowledge in economics. Our study has been structured in accordance with our research goal. The second part is a literature review that highlights the lack of a unified theory regarding knowledge in economics and shows how this problem may be overcome through the creation of a Demsetzian alternative. The third part delineates our research methodology. The fourth part outlines our general theoretical model. Fifth part applies this model to a wide range of cases to prove that the Demsetzian approach is broad in its applicability and thus may be considered as generalizable. Sixth part concludes.",

This has facilitated globalisation, learning and the integration of financial markets across the world (World Trade Organization, 2008; Bankole et al., 2015). The roles of telecommunication infrastructures/information and communications technology (ICT) in promoting growth and development and in reducing poverty have been well documented (see, for example, Cecchini & Scott, 2003; Bollou & Ngwenyama, 2008; Kottemann & Boyer-Wright, 2009; Qureshi, 2012, 2013; Ahmed & Ridzuan, 2013; Saidi et al., 2015, 2018; David, 2019a, b; Ahmed, 2020). Most of these studies that investigate the nexus between telecommunications, growth and development focus more on developed countries and less on developing countries while studies about the convergence of telecommunication infrastructures have suffered neglect among researchers. Research into convergence in telecommunication infrastructures is important because it has the potential to show the rate at which countries that are technologically backward are gradually catching up with the more advanced countries. Catching up in this context could also mean a lot for growth and development of developing countries. According to James (2007), the digital inequality between rich and developing countries as well as between rich and poor individuals is an issue of serious concern for many national and international organisations. This is one of the reasons the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) adopted the slogan “Connect 2020” in 2014 to encourage both the access to, and the use of, telecommunication services to bridge the digital divide and enhance ICT diffusion across the world. Recognising the disadvantages of this inequality, governments across the world have put different measures in place in order to promote telecommunication infrastructures (Wills, 1999). This study investigates whether or not less developed countries (LDCs) are catching up with developed countries (DCs). In this study, developed countries refer to sovereign states that have a developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less industrialised nations. While less developed countries are countries that do not have a lot of industrial activity and where people have low incomes/those countries which are seen as progressing towards but not yet having achieved a high level of development. The idea of convergence in economics (also sometimes known as the catch-up effect) is the hypothesis that the per capita incomes of poor economies will tend to grow at faster rates than those of richer economies. As a result, all economies should eventually converge in terms of per capita income. Developing countries have the potential to grow at a faster rate than developed countries because diminishing returns (in particular, to capital) are not as strong as in capital-rich countries. Furthermore, poorer countries can replicate the production methods, technologies and institutions of developed countries. But in the context of this study, telecommunication infrastructure convergence exists when two or more countries tend to reach a similar level (also sometimes known as the catch-up effect) of telecommunication infrastructural development. The notion of club convergence was originally introduced by Baumol (1986) in recognition of convergence within a subset of national economies and was later expanded by Phillips and Sul (2007). According to Phillips and Sul (2007), convergence may not occur in all economies but in those with similar characteristics; hence, the club convergence hypothesis that a set of economies may converge with each other. This is because such economies tend towards a common steady state position in the long run, whereas there cannot be any convergence across different sets. For its part, panel convergence happens when countries within the same sample group of analysis that have poorer economies tends to grow at faster rates than richer economies. As income is the front-end of an array of economic activities in different sectors (such as mining, wholesale trade and telecommunications/ICT), a potential question is whether a similar process of convergence can occur in the back-end sectors (such as the telecommunication sector). This article contributes to the literature on convergence in telecommunication infrastructures in several important ways. One is that we examine convergence in telecommunication infrastructures disaggregated by levels of development and income groupings. This is crucial because convergence in aggregate telecommunication infrastructures across countries can hide differences in income group and levels of development. Secondly, we provide an exploration of convergence in telecommunication infrastructures at national levels outside country-specific studies. This is important because it cannot be assumed that patterns in India are the same for all countries. Thirdly, we use the method developed by Phillips and Sul (2007, 2009) which has several advantages over previous tests such as the β- and σ-convergence tests. This allows for the strict testing of convergence clubs and in this way, the estimation of convergence transition paths in relation to common trends of the identified group(s). Convergence tests are applied to data sets on developmental and income groupings for 205 countries. Moreover, application of the Phillips and Sul (2007, 2009) method is relatively new and does not depend on strong assumptions on trend or stochastic stationarity in the data-generating process. In this regard, the few studies that have used the Phillips and Sul (2007) method to test for convergence in some form of ICT include Park et al. (2015) and Bera (2019) who investigate club convergence and factors of digital divide across countries as well as club convergence and drivers of digitalisation across Indian states. We use Phillips and Sul’s (2007, 2009) novel convergence test, the log t test, because of the following advantages it has over others. First, it does not start with specific assumptions that the stationarity of the variables and/or the presence of common factors are necessary. Second, it is based on a general form of nonlinear time-varying factor models. Third, it assimilates the possibilities of transition heterogeneity or transition divergence. Fourth, it helps to identify the existence of club convergence or clusters in which different convergence paths can be distinguished among heterogeneous economies involved in a convergence process. This is important for identifying convergence clubs and to address issues of individual heterogeneity, heterogeneous effects, economic structure, economic transition and convergence paths for 205 countries. In this paper, we ask the following question: To what extent do economic, human capital, financial deepening and demographic variables influence telecommunication infrastructure convergence across countries? Answering this question enhances knowledge on crucial variables that impact telecommunication infrastructures convergence in low, lower-middle, upper-middle and high-income countries, as well as in developed and less developed countries. Based on the dynamic panel model approach in the tradition of Islam (1995) and Caselli et al. (1996), we further contribute to the literature by using the System GMM to investigate the influencing factors (such as economic, human capital, financial deepening/development and demographic variables) of telecommunication infrastructure convergence across countries. Investigating these factors is important because it will reveal the role that they have played in the convergence process and then also guide government policies. This study used a dataset from the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) that covers a more expansive period and more countries than previous studies. This dataset allows greater reliability, consistency and more robust empirical results, inferences and conclusions. We capture telecommunication infrastructures through a composite index of telecommunications using principal component analysis measured by telephone landlines per 100 inhabitants, mobile phone subscribers per 100 inhabitants and the percentage of individuals using the internet. We examine the convergence of telecommunication infrastructures for 205 countries from 2000 to 2018. We disaggregated our data into DCs, LDCs and income groups. We based the income group disaggregation on Gross National Income (GNI) per capita, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method. Our findings from the club convergence algorithm results suggest panel convergence for developed, less developed, upper-middle and high-income countries, while divergence for the low- and lower-middle-income countries. This implies that there is strong evidence for conditional/relative convergence in addition to convergence and divergence of the clubs. The System GMM results further suggest that the economic, human capital, financial deepening and demographic variables play a significant positive role in telecommunication infrastructure convergence across countries. This study finds that the process of convergence in telecommunication infrastructures does reflect the desirable emanations of telecommunication services/policies sharing similar characteristics in developed, less developed, upper-middle and high-income countries and vice versa for the other income groups. The rest of this article is organised as follows: “Literature Review” is a review of the empirical literature while “Methodology and Data” presents a discussion of the Phillips and Sul (2007, 2009) and System GMM methodologies as well as a description of the data and variables. The results are presented and discussed in “Empirical Results and Discussion”, and the conclusion and recommendations are in “Conclusions and Policy Implications”.",6

This fact seems to have been helped by the removal of many national barriers in capital movements. There is a wide range of FDI determinants, the traditional ones being labour and capital costs, market size, and a consumer’s purchasing power. Nowadays, there is a tendency to examine the human capital sector of an economy. Unsurprisingly, the Global Competitiveness Report by Schwab and Martin (2018) states that almost a decade after the financial crisis, the vast majority of European economies are showing signs of recovery; however, the net investment is still weak. As a result, these economies cannot easily achieve productivity growth and compete successfully. In particular, countries with an open orientation found that an improvement in the human capital of their economies can lead to an improvement in their growth rates. Among other factors, this survey emphasises the policies that governments must adopt in terms of skill levels. Education, as the main instrument of human capital, is crucial, and many researchers have examined its influence on FDI. Compared with the other major world economies, the USA and the European Member States recorded the highest values for direct investments. Particularly in Europe, from 2003 to 2015, the total value of the FDI projects exceeded EUR 2.600 billion. The majority of these projects that have been invested from all over the world to Europe were mainly in the service (financial and insurance activities) and manufacturing sectors. In the last decade, however, the world FDI inflows decreased by 23% in 2017 as compared to 2015 and thus reached approximately the levels of 2013; that is from US 1.92 trillion to US 1.43 trillion. Europe after a sharp increase from 2003 to 2006 faced an analogous decrease between 2007 and 2009 due to the financial crisis and consequently reverted almost to the 2004 level. The periods of 2010–2012 were characterized as a stagnation session and afterward, 2013–2015, as a recovery period. The same fluctuations occurred for the Intra-European FDI (direct investment among the EU-28 members) as well as the Extra-European FDI flows for the period 2003–2015. More recently, after the last peak in 2015, the EU-28’s both inflows and outflows of direct investment declined in 2016 and again in 2017. Besides the fluctuations of FDI flows mentioned earlier, the majority of policymakers and governments across Europe found beneficial the direct investments from abroad as these are positively associated with their growth levels. The early empirical work on the FDI-growth nexus modified the growth accounting method, which was introduced by Solow (1956). This approach defined an augmented Solow model based mainly on technology, capital, labor and inward FDI. Since then, the majority of the studies resulted in different remarks on the actual effect of FDI on growth because the factors that affected FDI inflows were different across the income groups. Additionally, they found evidence of beneficial FDI mainly for the developing countries, and not for the developed ones; a further stimulus that leads us to place emphasis on European countries and to estimate other — nontraditional — parameters used until recently by researchers and policymakers. The study by Sunesen, Jepessen, and Theligaard (2018), emphasizes the main drivers of intra-European FDI across regions. Besides the traditional factors such as market size and openness, the analysis focused on high levels of innovation, labor abundance and industry clusters. However, one of the most important policy drivers of intra-European FDI refers to human capital and more concretely to the share of the regional population with Tertiary education. Based on the report, increasing this share by 1% is found to increase the likelihood of a given European FDI project being located in the region by 0.1%. As we know, firms and MNCs find it more beneficial to locate in foreign markets where, among other parameters such as technology and natural resources, there is a high-skilled educated labour force. In turn, the host economies will increase their capacity to absorb knowledge spillovers from foreign firms. Hence, Tertiary education becomes a critical resource and this occurs also in the case of extra-European FDI where a high level of education and skills is regarded as a significant driver for a host country’s FDI flows either for its urban region or capital metropolitan regions. The old Member States and mature economies are the main recipients of extra-European FDI. Germany, the UK, France, Italy, and Spain received almost 60% of the total extra-European FDI for the period 2003–2015. Furthermore, the UK alone attracted 16% of the total value of intra-European FDI and simultaneously accounts for 30% of the total value of Extra European FDI, of which almost the half-percentage originates from the USA. Also, the recent study obtained by OECD and FDI Quality Indicators (2019) suggests that FDI is associated with industries that have relatively higher R&D intensity in almost all OECD area and especially in counties such as the Netherlands, the UK, and Finland. According to the same study gender equality, human capital and skills are characterized as clusters of FDI qualities. The author’s previous study supported that female education plays a positive role in inward FDI and thus countries that have minimized the gender gap on Tertiary education (Germany, the UK, Scandinavian countries) and increased the women participation rate of their labor force together with skills, appear to raise quality FDI flows from abroad as compared to countries such as Italy, Greece and some of the transition economies. Based on the data availability, the purpose of the current analysis is to offer a clear picture of the intersection between human capital and FDI by emphasising discrete Tertiary academic levels, as depicted in the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED).",

Carbon emissions (CO2) from fossil fuels have risen dramatically from 1900. CO2 emissions have grown by over 90% since 1970, including fossil fuel burning and industrial activities accounting for around 78% of the total increase in carbon dioxide between 1970 and 2011. The second-largest drivers have been farming, deforestation, and change in land use patterns (IPCC, 2014). The increase in energy consumption and pollution level is critical for policymaking and future projections. Energy is regarded as a driver of industrial growth, based on the current empirical research, and it also has a bidirectional correlation with economic growth. Other research studies have used the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) assumption to explore the relationship between environmental contaminants and income growth in various countries. This research aims to investigate how human development index (HDI) affects energy demand and CO2 emissions in different nations due to variations in economic development. However, the energy consumption varies dramatically among income levels, as it does for other items. As families in developing countries attain middle-income levels, there is common anticipation of a significant increase in demand for energy (Wolfram et al., 2012). A restricted focus on economic growth ignores other important factors of human development, such as educational and life expectancy indicators that have not been directly obtained from economic growth Ouedraogo (2013). The HDI is a comprehensive metric for assessing performance in the fundamental elements of life. Rather than merely the size of the economy in which people live, human development is important (UNDP, 2019). The human development index is also seen as a key indicator of economic performance and human well-being. While the empirical findings from the energy, growth, and emission nexus are mostly unquestionable, the causal link between HDI, energy consumption, and CO2 is not adequately addressed (Van Tran et al., 2019). Akizu-Gardoki et al. (2018) reveal higher human development leads to lower carbon emissions. Emissions from the global sample as well as from developing and industrialized countries, however, there is no discernible link between carbon emissions and human growth. There is no evidence of this in the results. Neither the global sample nor the subpanel sample revealed a substantial causal link between energy use and human development. Developed countries are better than developing countries in various essential aspects of life like mortality rate, enough food, gender equality, population stability, human right, and better-quality water. Per capita energy and electricity usage have often been linked to economic growth and other metrics of contemporary lifestyle, with the implication that the more the electricity consumption, the better the life is (Ghali & El-Sakka, 2004; Nader & Beckerman, 1978; Rosa et al., 1981; Dietz et al., 2012). Hussain and Dey (2021) find the existence of EKC between HDI and CO2 emission by employing the fixed-effect model, and ordinary least square (OLS) methodology. The study revealed substantial evidence of EKC for the sample countries as well as for each of the separate groups of countries. In the inverted U-shaped EKC, both environmental problems and income are positively sloped; however, beyond a certain growth threshold, pollution begins to decline with an increase in income (Al-Mulali et al., 2015). While energy demand is a key measure of economic performance that drives economic growth, but it does not ensure that the growth in HDI will increase. Once the economy reaches higher levels of standard of living, it consumes environmental capital while also emitting pollutants, which inevitably leads to environmental pollution. Expanding economic growth indicates an increase in energy demand and greenhouse gases. Energy demand is undoubtedly, an important factor for economic growth. However, energy demand is useful for economic growth in one aspect, which significantly leads to human development. On the other hand, it contributes to environmental pollution and accelerates global warming (Omri, 2013; Dias, et al., 2006; Lee & Chang, 2008; Belloumi, 2009; Kraft & Kraft, 1978; Ozturk & Acaravci, 2010; Soytas & Sari, 2009; Ang, 2007; Hardt et al., 2018; Fodha & Zaghdoud, 2010) that suggests a long-run link between per capita emissions and gross domestic product (GDP) and CO2 has a linear relationship with GDP. Climate change is mostly driven by biochemical and carbon dioxide emissions. As a result, air problems caused by energy consumption have detrimental consequences for human health, posing a long-term threat to human development (Gore et al., 2014). This issue over climate policy is an important question whether emerging economies should pursue the route of developed countries to reach better levels of human development while emitting less per capita greenhouse gases must be resolved. Our research is linked with three different study areas, HDI, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. The first section, which has grabbed most academic interest, examines the link between HDI and energy consumption/electricity. The findings suggest that there is a negative correlation between electricity consumption and human development, but a positive correlation between energy consumption and human development in developing countries due to the constraints in the estimation of energy services (Banday & Aneja, 2020; Mazur, 2011; Ouedraogo, 2013; Pasternak, 2001; Zahnd & Kimber, 2009). Another aspect of research examines the link between CO2 emissions, energy usage, and human development. Increased energy and carbon emissions may not be an essential condition for obtaining a high degree of human growth, as demonstrated by Steinberger and Roberts (2010), Dias et al., (2006) and Jackson (2009). However, past empirical research results are still debatable, since they use a short sample size and different econometric approaches. Moreover, increasing energy usage and carbon emission are linked to high social development at various phases of development that is still discussed. It is possible that this ambiguity stems from the fact that nations with varying degrees of progress have diverse causality patterns. Millennium Development Goals and Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations are aimed at improving health and education, while the notion of human development is related to a variety of components including human rights and research (knowledge) to promote the accumulation of knowledge (Daitoh, 2010). Against this backdrop, it is convincing to link up HDI, knowledge economy, and knowledge-based development (Gremm et al., 2018). The main objective of our research is to see how far economic growth, energy usage, carbon dioxide emissions, and the human development nexus can be attained. We investigate the two models, first we analyse the impact of HDI and energy consumption on CO2. Secondly, we investigate the impact of CO2 and energy consumption on HDI for 20 countries using a panel quantile regression fixed-effect model. This study goes into further information into the factors that influence carbon emissions across the conditional distribution, particularly in the highest and lowest quantiles. This method offers fresh insight into how various factors influence carbon emissions. Thirdly, we add several relevant control variables in our analysis, which may alleviate the omitted-variable bias issues that have affected earlier investigations. We used the one-step approach suggested by Baltagi and Wu (1999) and two-ways OLS proposed by Bhargava et al., (1982) to examine the consistency of panel quantile estimators, thus making our empirical results efficient, robust, and consistent. When all series are not stationary at levels but stationary at first differences and are also cointegrated, Hammoudeh et al. (2014) recommend the use of a fully modified quantile regression estimator. For this research, we have used data for 20 emerging countries gathered between 1990 and 2014 by using quantile regression modelling techniques following (Koenker, 2004). The extant literature has largely ignored to analyse the nexus between human development, energy, and the environment in emerging countries. The gap filled by the present research study is to cater to the need of policymaking in emerging countries regarding human development and the environment using the sophisticated methodology. The advantages of using quantile regression model over ordinary least square model (OLS) are four folds: (1) it is useful in case of independent variables that exhibit different effects at various levels, (2) the outliers have no impact on parameters estimates Zhu et al. (2016a), Zhu et al. (2016b)), (3) the model has no normality assumption about the data, and (4) this model has no incidental parameter problem while estimating a large number of fixed effects (Zhang & Gao, 2016). The rest of the paper is as follows. “Literature Review” gives the literature related to energy usage, human development, and carbon emission. “Data and Methodology” defines data and econometric approaches. “Results and Discussion” reports the results of various econometric methods, and “Conclusion” ends with the conclusion.",7

Economic crises are often caused by market instability (Di Quirico, 2010; Khang et al., 2005; Hart & Tindall, 2009; Stiglitz, 2009; Chauffour & Farole, 2009; Petrakos, 2014), foreign trade and price shocks (Mendis, 2002; Francois & Woerz, 2009), political instability (Aisen & Veiga, 2013; Gasiorowski, 1995; Lagravinese, 2015), and civil unrest through the protests (Bartels & Bermeo, 2014; Grasso & Giugni, 2016; Bernburg, 2016). During the economic crisis of 1997 and 2008, a banking and financial crisis occurred which resulted in a slowdown in growth and a deterioration of the external position for the Asian and Latin countries. The appreciation of the dollar is explained by the loss of competitiveness of these countries, the deterioration of their external markets, the over-investment in unprofitable sectors (real estate), and the indebtedness of their domestic agents with foreign banks without foreign exchange risk hedging (Francois & Woerz, 2009; Jones, 2016). In previous years, the World Health Organization revealed various epidemics that infected a significant number of citizens around the world. China has been affected by several epidemics including SARS which spread in 2003 and affected more than 8000 citizens. In 2002, the silent epidemic of HIV/AIDS reached alarming proportions, affecting nearly 2 million people in Latin America. Recently, both regions have been devastated by pandemic uncertainty of Chinese origin. According to WHO (2020), this global pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is among the most serious health crises in human history (Fonds Monétaire International, 2020;  Toquero, 2020; Almarayeh & Almarayeh, 2021; Ashraf, 2020). On January 30, 2020, the WHO announced an international public health emergency prior to the formal declaration of COVID-19 as a pandemic. Recently, a new pandemic was reported in Wuhan, a city in China, which has spread rapidly and has prominently distracted the lives of people around the world. Palese (2004) confirmed a 5% drop in gross domestic product in the USA following the flu. Hai et al. (2004) found that EBOLA caused more than 11,300 deaths worldwide, pain in the money market for the USA through an economic deficit of $53 billion. Financial Times (2020) declared that 400,013 have died from COVID-19 worldwide since June 07, 2020. The balance sheets continue to grow especially in Latin America, where Brazil is among the most affected countries with 36,455 deaths including 691,758 cases. Mexico, too, has passed 46,000 deaths and has become the third country in the world in terms of coronavirus-related deaths. This COVID-19 epidemic negatively influenced the economic environment and caused the deterioration of the gross domestic product by 1%. In fact, it has caused economic damage of $54 billion worldwide. It is against a backdrop of low inflation, low interest rates, and bleak growth prospects that the coronavirus or COVID-19 is hitting the world. This pandemic has negative consequences on economic activity following government measures such as the decrease in production and tax revenues resulting in an increase in household aids such as transfers of unemployment benefits and wage subsidies (McKibbin & Fernando, 2020; Atkeson, 2020; Baldwin & Tomiura, 2020; Cecchetti & Schoenholtz, 2020; Mann et al., 2020; Meninno & Wolff, 2020; Voth, 2020; Cochrane, 2020; Wren-Lewis, 2020; Wyplosz, 2020; Baker et al., 2020; Albulescu et al., 2021).This would worsen the budget balances (worsening budget deficits) of most countries in the world and increase the public debt ratios of some (in 2019, public debt represented 83% of global GDP), as the IMF maintains (2020) in its report on the effects of COVID-19 on public finances around the world. With great concern, the world is preparing to deal with the economic and social impact of the COVID pandemic by assessing the avenues and opportunities to reduce its impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy; it has touched the global travel industry, national health systems, the food industry, education and global commerce. Due to globalization, spillover effects on emerging and developing countries are expected due to their dependence on developed countries for the import of goods and services (Ozili & Arun, 2020). According to the World Bank (2020), the COVID-19 pandemic is destabilizing the world economy and would lead it to a recession due to the decline in activity observed in China (during the first quarter of 2020) and which should impact other countries hit by the pandemic, in particular the USA and the Eurozone. According to WHO, the pandemic cost 41 billion Euros. This figure includes the fall in tourism revenues (− 80% in China) and a shortfall of the order of 50% for airlines, tourist agencies, restaurants, and taxi drivers. In 2003, South East Asia fell by 2% of GDP in the second quarter of 2003. The slowdown in commodity prices since 2014 and an imminent crisis in China before the market pandemic particularly affected Latin America, leading to currency depreciation. The COVID-19 crisis has aggravated the low international position of Latin American currencies and their degree of convertibility. In March 2020, the real Brazilian peso, the Colombian peso, and the Mexican peso depreciated by more than 10% against the US dollar, while the currencies of Chile and Peru depreciated by about 5% (UNCTAD, 2020). In other words, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to international production risks induced by international trade shocks, including the Tōhoku earthquake and the 2011 tsunami in Japan and the 2011 floods in Thailand. In addition, Latin American exports entered negative territory for the first time since 2015, with an estimated 29.5% year-on-year in the first half of 2020. This is explained by the slowdown in exports to important markets such as the USA (− 19.5%), the European Union (− 18.6%) and China (− 1.0%).In addition, this pandemic has led to a drop in production and, in turn, a fall in the profits or profits of firms, lower wages, lower demand, increased social pressures, and uncertainty. This leads us to say that the world is facing a twin crisis, both health and economic (Dauvin et al., 2020; Fernandes, 2020). According to Martin et al. (2020), tensions in the goods and services market and that of foreign exchange, budget deficits, declines in imports and exports, a contraction in economic activity with containment measures, the decline in the power of purchase, and worsening poverty tend to limit the state’s room for maneuver in the response to COVID-19. In response to this severe outbreak, governments around the world have rushed in with emergency actions, such as lockdowns, travel restrictions, public events canceling, and social distancing. Against this background, Hoof (2020) noted that a third of the world’s population has undergone the lockdown measure to curb the spread of this pandemic. Additionally, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development/UNCTAD (2020) found that 48 countries have implemented a partial or full lockdown. Moreover, governments have developing several responses in terms of economic as well as heath measures, to address the consequences of COVID-19. In fact, these actions might reduce the negative impact of COVID-19 and prevent from an economic and financial recession. However, their effectiveness depends on the severity of the epidemic’s spread. Several empirical studies have been developed to assess the impact of coronavirus disease on financial and economic systems. Some studies have studied the effect of COVID-19 on financial markets (Alfaro et al., 2020; Ali et al., 2020; Altig et al., 2020; Ashraf, 2020; Dai et al., 2021; He et al., 2020; Louhichi et al., 2021; Zhang et al. 2020, among others). Other studies have investigated the economic impact in the era of COVID-10 (Gans, 2020; Susskind & Vines, 2020; among others). All of these factors have contributed to significant macroeconomic instability. This is why understanding the above horrors of COVID-19 and revisiting macroeconomic variables is a crucial moment. This literature, to the best of our recognition, has overlooked the interaction effects between Corona and government interventions. Our study aims to complete this literature by evaluating the macroeconomic aggregates at the age of COVID-19 by considering the government response as well as the intensity of the pandemic. For clarity, our study provides comprehensive information on the pandemic and its impact on the most important macroeconomic variables. Therefore, we aim to examine the exchange rate and inflation which may cause economic instability or crises in conjunction with the coronavirus outbreak in the two worst affected regions of the world. We examine the reaction of the inflation rate and the exchange rate to three types of government actions, including the government response index, the economic support index, the total number of school closures, among others. We choose regions of Asia and Latin countries because on July 26, 2020, the Latin American region becomes the most affected in the world in terms of the number of coronavirus infections, and scenes of corpses in the streets in Ecuador. Based on monthly data from January to September 2020 for 5 Asian countries (Malaysia, India, Indonesia, Japan, and China) and the 5 Latin countries (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador), we are studying the expected economic impact of government actions to fight this unexpected pandemic. The choice of this period is motivated by our objective of evaluating the first wave of the pandemic. On the one hand, our analysis focused on two economic variables such as inflation and the exchange rate since they can create an economic uncertainty, where they are collected from the DataStream database. On the other hand, COVID-19 news data is measured across monthly confirmed COVID-19 cases for each country on the Coronavirus Resource Center (JHU-CRC) website at Johns Hopkins University. Deeper, we use the Coronavirus Government Response Tracker composite index developed by the University of Oxford and based on 5 response indicators to specify and confirm the expected economic impact of government actions such as the government response index and the economic support index, the closure and confinement of schools and the health index, during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the performance implications of the determinants of economic growth differ and vary across a number of factors, our empirical results show that government measures have a dual impact on economic indicators. Moreover, while these measures are accompanied by a significant increase in inflation, they significantly reduce the exchange rate. Most importantly, the increase in confirmed cases reduces both inflation and the exchange rate due to an increase in demand over supply. This could be partly explained by the fact that the virus was first discovered in China and that the Asian and Latin economies are based on export and tourism and are therefore facing a free fall in productivity and a dramatic drop in GDP. In this context, there are several channels through which this epidemic will affect economic activity in Latin countries and Asia. Thus, the remainder of this study is organized as follows: “Literature Review” presents the literature review. “Data sample and methodology” details the data use and empirical methodology. “Results and Discussion” deals with results and discussion. The last section “Conclusion” is devoted to the main conclusions and policy implications.",9

The economy has witnessed a shift from the traditional production system into a more service-oriented economy known as the ‘knowledge economy’ (modern economy). The modern economy term is used to describe the rapidly changing global economy pace spurred by the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) (Tapscott, 1996). The modern economy has witnessed rapid changes in almost every economic sector coupled with long-term growth and lower inflationary pressure (Stiroh, 1999). This new economy applies human know-how in almost every economic sector (Servoz, 2019; Tapscott, 1996; Choong & Leung, 2021). Healy (2002) indicated that one of the most crucial features in the new economy is changes in the creative industry, an industry in which people work with their brains. It is also described as an economy in which people think for a living (Davenport, 2005). Currently, the skills and creativity of workers are becoming more critical than physical labour (Drucker, 1969), leading to the rise of knowledge workers (KWrs) (Davenport, 2008; Spencer et al., 1993). According to Gartner’s report (Roth, 2019), the global population of KWrs has exceeded one billion. The future of work will witness the continuous rise of knowledge work and KWrs (Kudyba et al., 2020). Therefore, organisations will need to develop or enhance their current skills and strategies due to the global market challenge.",5

Fast moving markets, information flows, and the tendency to copy successful products, services, or processes force organizations to rely more on factors like leadership and knowledge to improve organizational performance. Knowledge management is starting to gain organizations’ recognition as a foundation of future success. It is not a question of if but rather how to implement knowledge management (Pérez‐López & Alegre, 2012) as it is viewed as a part of companies’ strategic pillars, together with traditional factors of success like brand name, asset structure, and financial equity (Pillania, 2009; Shahzad et al., 2016). As a consequence, leaders are focused more on establishing environments that promote trust, creativeness, and knowledge in order to achieve their organizational goals (Braun et al., 2013; Mittal & Dhar, 2015). Leaders who do not recognize the importance of knowledge management not only limit organizations’ development but also endanger their existence. Understanding efficient knowledge management helps leaders to better manage business risks and improve a company’s overall performance (Birasnav, 2014; Khan, 2015). However, if goals are to be met, leaders must also be able to recognize and address the challenges of organizational structure, organizational culture, and informational technology to maximize hidden potentials (Claver‐Cortés et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2011). Conley and Zheng (2009) showed that successful implementation of knowledge management depends on factors like leaders and leadership, organizational culture, strategy, organizational structure, knowledge management processes, information technology, organizational learning, rewarding desired behaviours, and measuring effects. Similar results were obtained by Ho (2009) and Yeh et al. (2006), who recognized strategy and leadership inter alia as the most important factors of knowledge management success. Providing an appropriate business environment, resources, efficient leadership, and knowledge management raises the question of measuring its impact on organizational performance. Heisig et al. (2016) showed that future studies on knowledge management will have to put special focus on its effects. Many financial and non-financial measurements were developed to measure organizational performance with non-financial being recognized in recent years as more in-depth indicators of success. Organizational performance can be measured by researching financial data or conducting a survey. Perceived organizational performance is measured with various Likert-scale questionnaires that focus on aspects of performance like innovation, growth, or value creation (Masa’deh et al., 2016; Noruzy et al., 2013; Sankowska, 2013). Leadership style and knowledge management are still relatively unknown concepts in the Slovenian private and academic sectors, especially as regard their relation to organizational performance. Nonetheless, some studies have indeed been conducted on the relation between knowledge management and organizational performance (Dermol, 2011; Rašula et al., 2012), organizational learning and organizational performance (Dimovski et al., 2008; Škerlavaj & Dimovski, 2006; Škerlavaj et al., 2007), leadership style and organizational learning (Zagoršek et al., 2009), and managerial competencies and company performance (Verle et al., 2014). This study was designed with the aim of expanding existing knowledge on this research topic in Slovenia as well as to provide new insights for scholars and managers on the topics of leadership style and knowledge management. As Slovenia evolved into a modern economy in the last 30 years, research was expanded by using the moderating variables of ownership type and capital origin (Maček et al., 2021; Trunk & Stubelj, 2013). Knowledge management is still relatively unknown concept in Slovenia, especially in public companies (Colnar & Dimovski, 2017). Research results can provide additional insights into differences between the influence of foreign capital and private initiatives on relations between leadership style, knowledge management, and organizational performance in transitional economies. The aim of the study was to determine relations between leadership style, knowledge management, and organizational performance. Additionally, effects of moderating variables, such as type of ownership and capital origin, on proposed research model were explored. Literature review was used to propose conceptual model of relations between constructs. The model was analysed applying partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The rest of this paper is structured as follows: literature review, postulation of research hypotheses, and research methodology, followed by results, and a discussion of results with its conclusion complete the paper.",4

Efficiently designed institutions reduce both the transaction costs and the uncertainty in exchange which usually characterises the interactions between uncoordinated agents who have incomplete information. It turns out that institutions play a key role in maximising the gains from trade and increasing productivity. The design of an efficient institutional environment and its evolution over time are therefore fundamental in explaining both the stages of development and the economic performances of countries (Boettke & Fink, 2011; Myrdal, 1957; North, 1994). The beneficial effects of increased institutional quality on long-run growth have been largely documented in the literature (Hall & Jones, 1999; Acemoglu et al., 2001; Dollar & Kraay, 2003; Acemoglu et al., 2005, Acemoglu & Robinson, 2010). According to these papers, the observed diverging patterns in the levels of per-capita income across countries are essentially caused by differences in the efficiency of the institutional system and in the ability of the latter to protect and efficiently define property rights. The advent of the endogenous growth theory has instead highlighted the relevance of the technological progress as main source of economic growth (Aghion & Howitt, 1992, 2007; Aghion et al., 2016; Lucas, 1988; Romer, 1990). Given the strong existing linkages between growth, institutions and technological development, a large amount of literature has been devoted to the analysis of the effects of institutions on innovation. The theoretical literature, see for instance Immordino et al. (2011) and Anderlini et al. (2013), has investigated the institutional conditions under which the level of R&D investments is socially efficient. Specifically, Immordino et al. (2011) propose a theoretical framework based on four institutional regimes, namely, laissez-faire, ex-post penalties, lenient authorisation and strict authorisation. They show that laissez-faire is the optimal regime provided that the probability of social harm from innovation is small, while ex-post penalties and lenient authorisation should be imposed for moderate likelihoods of social harm from R&D investments. Strict authorisation is instead the optimal institutional regime when the probability of social harm from investments is high. Anderlini et al. (2013) develop a theoretical model aimed at assessing the effects of legal institutions on innovation, partitioning the legal system in rigid, where the set of rules is determined before technological progress takes place, and flexible, where rules are defined once the technology is observed. They show that the flexible regime maximises innovation, welfare and output growth at intermediate levels of development, while at its early stages a rigid system must be preferred because of commitment issues. While the theoretical literature has tried to identify the institutional and legal conditions under which innovation is socially optimal, a significant amount of empirical research has instead been devoted to the analysis of the effects of corruption and political stability on innovation. Examples of such a vast literature are the contributions of Anokhin and Schulze (2009), Aghion et al. (2016), Ervits and Zmuda (2018), Dincer (2019), Ellis et al. (2019) and Lee et al. (2020), which provide favourable evidence for the “sanding the wheels” hypothesis, as corruption has a negative impact on innovation, with innovative firms that are disproportionally more victims of corruption compared to their non-innovative counterparts (Ayyagari et al., 2014). Paunov (2016) documents a non-significant effect on corruption on patents, though she finds that higher corruption has a detrimental effect on the likelihood of obtaining quality certificates and reduces the demand of machineries and other inputs which are complementary to innovation processes. According to these papers, the monopoly power of corrupted bureaucrats can be tough of as a tax on innovators, which, in turn, decreases the expected gains of innovative projects, hence preventing firms from investing in innovative activities. Another strand of the literature has instead dealt with the relationship between political stability and innovation (Alesina & Perotti, 1996; Waguespack et al., 2005; Hoti & McAleer, 2006; Allard et al., 2012; Gholipur, 2019), the general consensus being that higher political instability, increasing the likelihood of coups through unconstitutional means, heightens the risk of expropriation and reduces the trust in the courts and in the rule of law, therefore discouraging firms from undertaking innovative projects. More closely related to the following paper, at least with respect to the measures of government quality employed, are the contributions of Tebaldi and Elmslie (2013), Rodríguez-Pose and Di Cataldo (2015), Oluwatobi et al. (2015), Kwan and Chiu (2015), Alam et al. (2019) and Rodríguez-Pose and Zhang (2020), which rely on various indices of governmental quality, such as risk of expropriation, control of corruption, rule of law, regulatory quality, government effectiveness, voice and accountability, with unanimous consensus in ascertaining a positive effect of governance upon firms’ investment decisions. The six pillars of governance proposed by the World Bank, i.e. control of corruption, government effectiveness, rule of law, political stability, regulatory quality and voice and accountability, (see Kaufmann et al., 2010) have instead been applied in the contributions of Giménez and Sanaú (2007), Soumaré and Tchana Tchana (2015), Asongu et al. (2018), Cahn et al. (2019) and Clò et al. (2020), which provide additional evidence of a positive relationship between improved institutional quality and innovation. This literature further identifies the main channels through which the quality of government can affect innovative activities. Firstly, however, it must be highlighted that R&D investments are risky and characterised by a significant uncertainty concerning their outcome (see for instance Esposti & Pierani, 2003; Dewett, 2007; Muscio & Ciffolilli, 2020), with the implication that the uncertainty related to R&D innovation might be exacerbated by the presence of weak and unstable institutions. In particular, the presence of effective governments and efficient rule of law respectively allow to implement credible long-term innovative policies and to strengthen intellectual property rights, enhancing R&D activities (Rodríguez-Pose & Di Cataldo, 2015). Higher voice and accountability, according to Faust (2008), limits the power of narrow interest groups and promotes a favourable business environment, hence encouraging innovation. According to Waguespack et al. (2005), higher political stability is beneficial to R&D activities as it reduces the uncertainty related to the appropriability of innovation and reduces the risk of expropriation, while following the lines of Ayyagari et al. (2014), it can be argued that higher control of corruption reduces the costs of R&D and fosters the adoption of new technologies. Finally, a stable regulatory discourages corruption among bureaucrats (Lee et al., 2020) and promotes science-oriented educational systems (Varsakelis, 2006). Though the main literature agrees in ascertaining that countries with better governance display a higher propensity to undertake innovative activities, one limitation of these contributions is represented by the fact that they deal with a single dimension of innovation, summarised by the amount of patents issued, while other relevant dimensions have been largely neglected. Examples of this limited literature include the paper of Sobel (2008), De Waldemar (2012), Jiao et al. (2015), Castellucci (2015) and Barasa et al. (2017). Specifically, Sobel (2008) studies the effects of institutional quality on entrepreneurial activities, finding, in line with Baumol’s hypothesis, that better governance spurs entrepreneurship and growth, while De Waldemar (2012) investigates the effects of corruption on product innovation, showing that increased corruption discourages the introduction of new products in the market. Jiao et al. (2015) instead address the role of government effectiveness on technological innovation, process innovation and managerial innovation, finding evidence of a positive relationship between the efficiency of the government in providing public services and all the afore-mentioned dimensions of innovation. Castellucci (2015) deals with the impact of legal, financial and institutional constraints using data for 20 Latin American countries, finding that the innovative performance of firms is better in those countries with a better governance and with less institutional constraints. Similar results are obtained by Barasa et al. (2017), who exploit data for Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, to examine the nexus between regional governance and product innovation, showing that the propensity to innovate is positively affected by a healthier institutional environment. Differently from these contributions, in this paper, combining firm-level data collected by Capitalia and the Institutional Quality Index (IQI) dataset developed by Nifo and Vecchione (2014) at provincial level (NUTS3), we test the effects of government quality on additional dimensions of innovation, namely, marketing innovation, organisational innovation, product innovation and process innovation, whose relevance has largely been highlighted in the literature. Indeed, according to Cohen and Klepper (1996), product and process innovation are fundamental for firms as they allow them to spread the price–cost margin of the output sold. Further, while product innovation is intended to increase the price of goods, process innovation allows firms to reduce the average cost of production. Organisational innovation is instead relevant for firms as, on one side, it facilitates the development of new products and processes (Camisón & Villar-López, 2014) and, on the other, provides firms with a competitive advantage by affecting their performance and increasing productivity (Caroli & Van Reenen, 2001). Finally, according to Karlsson and Tavassoli (2016, pp. 1485–1486), marketing innovation allows firms “to give the firm’s products a new position in the market with the intention to increase sales incomes”. This paper tries to provide an answer to the following research question: How does the quality of government influence different types of innovation of manufacturing firms? The empirical findings presented here reveal that rule of law is the only governance measures which is found to stimulate marketing activities. Once the focus is on organisational innovation, results suggest that the control of corruption, regulatory quality and voice and accountability positively contribute to this dimension of innovation, while product and process innovation are mostly driven by variations in government effectiveness, regulatory quality and voice and accountability. The paper is structured as follows: “Data and Variables Selection” section describes the data and the main variables employed to assess the nexus between government quality and the various types of innovation, while “The Empirical Specification” section describes the empirical framework. “Empirical Evidence” section discusses the empirical findings, while in “Robustness Checks” section various robustness checks are performed. “Limits of the Analysis” section assesses the main limitations of our contribution, while “Conclusions and Discussions” section concludes and discusses the main policy implications.",1

As such, innovation became a key national policy issue (Edler & Georghiou, 2007; Lamine et al., 2016), and science parks are an essential innovation agent that supports the operation of new technology-based firms (NTBFs) (Arauzo-Carod et al., 2018; Ng et al., 2020). They are part of national innovation systems and play an important role in innovation policy agendas (Silva et al., 2020; Sofouli & Vonortas, 2006), as well as their creation seems to be a generator of innovation and economic development (Shearmur & Doloreux, 2000; Cheng et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2018; Hobbs et al., 2020). In fact, science parks are highly beneficial to NTBFs, they provide them an interactive internal environment for knowledge sharing (Chen et al., 2010; Balle et al., 2018), offer management support (Albahari et al., 2019; Ng et al., 2020), and mediate the relationship between NTBFs and external agents (Minguillo et al., 2014). Scholars have taken different approaches to study science parks. In the analysis of their internal characteristics, Ng et al. (2019) classified the types of science parks, whereas Ng et al. (2020) systematized the benefits they provide to tenants. Other studies involve the types of managerial support and the importance of tenants’ evolution (Albahari et al., 2019; Kyoung-Joo & Eun-Young, 2018). Regarding the interaction of NTBFs hosted in science parks, there exist studies that have focused on the effect of science parks on tenants’ innovation performance (Lindelöf & Löfsten, 2003; Yang et al., 2009; Liberati et al., 2015), knowledge transfer (Inkpen & Pien, 2006; Henriques et al., 2018), research and development (R&D) (Lamperti et al., 2015; Schmidt & Balestrin, 2015), and networking (Koçak & Can, 2014). The literature on science parks that takes a geographical perspective is unbalanced. Most of such studies are targeted to Europe, Asia, and North America (Hobbs et al., 2017; Lecluyse et al., 2019). However, there are studies in several countries around the world such as Australia (Phillimore, 1999; Kharabsheh, 2012), Brazil (Balle et al., 2018; Schmidt & Balestrin, 2015), China (Cheng et al., 2013; Xie et al., 2018), India (Vaidyanathan, 2007), Italy (Corrocher et al., 2019; Ferrara et al., 2015; Lamperti et al., 2015; Liberati et al., 2015), Japan (Fukugawa, 2006), Singapore (Koh et al., 2005), South Africa (Chan et al., 2010), Spain (Arauzo-Carod et al., 2018; Vásquez-Urriago et al., 2016), Sweden (Albahari et al., 2019; Löfsten & Lindelöf, 2002), United Kingdom (Siegel et al., 2003a, b) and Taiwan (Huang et al., 2012). Further, many of the studies on science parks analyze agents in only one country; Hansson et al. (2005) and Albahari et al. (2013) are among the few that consider science parks more than in one country in their analysis. Science parks are key agents of regional development, even though they have an important global role as well, given their inclination toward technology and knowledge developments. As such, the several geographic layers where the innovation agents interact presented by Carayannis et al. (2018), local, regional, national, supranational and global can be used to give a more systematic view about how science parks interact with the actors of their external environment. However, assuming an inside-out perspective—that is, from the local (municipality/cluster), regional (state/province), national, continental, to global—the geographic scope of studies is still fragmented and biased toward one or, at most, three levels, such as only national (Albahari et al., 2013; Claver-Cortés et al., 2018), national and regional (Minguillo et al., 2014), local and national (Appold, 2004), local and regional (Arauzo-Carod et al., 2018; Bellavista & Sanz, 2009; Bigliardi et al., 2006; Chang et al., 2012; Hobbs et al., 2020; McAdam et al., 2016; McCann & Folta, 2011), and local and international (Cadorin et al., 2017). Additionally, given the relationship of science parks with external agents, the studies have evolved from taking a fragmentary and situated approach (e.g., the influence of innovation policies in the development of science parks, as in Vaidyanathan, 2007; Sofouli & Vonortas, 2006; Huang et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2020) to a more holistic one (e.g., the relationship between science parks and national innovation systems, as in Albahari et al., 2013; Etzkowitz & Zhou, 2018). Also, in line with this perspective Koh et al. (2005) introduce a model for the assessment of science parks approaching local, regional, national, and global features. In a more recent study, Albahari et al. (2019) presented a view of the innovation ecosystem of two Swedish science parks. They discussed several types of actors, such as government, private sector, universities, along with several associations at the local, regional, national, and global levels, but with a view focused on the types of services provided by science parks for their tenants. Despite the abovementioned studies, a gap in the literature still remains: there is little clarity on the relationships between science parks and several types of external agents, especially in the context of different levels of geographic scope. The goal of this article is to present a systematic view of external agents from the perspective of science parks as well as of the types of relationships existing between science parks and these agents. In this regard, we employ a two-stage qualitative approach. First, we conduct a deep documental analysis of 30 science parks located in Brazil and Portugal. The findings are then clarified and validated through interviews involving a sub-sample of 11 science parks. The geographic dimensions are categorized into five levels of the geographic scope of the external agent: local, regional, national, continental, and global. This method permitted an in-depth and systematic analysis. The main agents identified in the science park context are classified as universities, governmental agencies, associations, and companies. Six types of relationships are identified: foundation, investment, knowledge transfer, management, technical–scientific partnerships, and partnerships (networks/associations). Additionally, the multilevel analysis shows that the density of relationships between science parks and external agents varies among the different levels of geographic scope. Further, agents of the same type tend to establish different kinds of relationships with science parks owing to differences in their relative geographical scope. We identify and, thus, discuss several differences attributable to the location of science parks (Brazil and Portugal). The remaining paper is organized as follows: ""Literature Review"" provides a review of the literature on science parks and their relationships with the external environment. ""Data and Methodology"" expounds the data and its sources as well as the methodology that was used. ""Results"" presents the results, and ""Discussion"" discusses them. ""Conclusions"" concludes the study.",
