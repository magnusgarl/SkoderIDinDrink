In Junge and Kugler (2013), we limited ourselves to a comparison of the social costs and benefits and concluded that long-run benefits exceed long-run costs by a substantial multiple.Footnote 1 In this paper, we present an attempt to determine the optimal leverage and capital ratios for Switzerland’s global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The economic debate about the appropriate minimum level of regulatory capital requirements for banks from society’s perspective is highly controversial. At one end of the spectrum, Admati and Hellwig (2013, p. 179) argue that there are no social costs associated with higher equity capital requirements and propose a leverage ratio requiring equity capital on the order of 20 to 30% of total assets. At the other end, banking industry representatives continue to emphasize that higher equity capital requirements in particular reduce the availability of credit and retard economic growth.Footnote 2 The conflict over the appropriate minimum level of banking capital also blocked the finalization of Basel III at the beginning of 2017. Some members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) emphasized that only strongly capitalized and highly liquid banks can support economic growth, while others argued that the pendulum of the Basel III revisions had already swung too far and undermined the economic recovery.Footnote 3 In October 2015, Switzerland amended its Too-Big-To-Fail (TBTF) legislation and decided to raise the required going concern leverage ratio for Switzerland’s G-SIBs—Credit Suisse and UBS—to 5%.Footnote 4 This decision was based on the recommendation of the “Group of Experts on the Further Development of the Financial Market Strategy in Switzerland” that Switzerland should be among the countries with the most stringent capital requirements.Footnote 5 Designing Swiss capital requirements along the same lines as foreign standards is one choice, as well as the orientation on international competitiveness.Footnote 6 However, as relevant as they are, these considerations should be complementary in nature as they do not address the key question of whether the new TBTF capital requirements are appropriate from society’s point of view. An optimal level of bank equity capital should be determined by some aggregate welfare objective taking into account that higher equity capital requirements benefit the economy by reducing the likelihood of banking crises while simultaneously imposing economic cost in terms of a lower potential economic output. Along these lines, we extend Junge and Kugler (2013) and seek to determine the long-run steady-state optimal leverage and capital ratios for the Swiss G-SIBs.Footnote 7 This approach is in accordance with a major strand of economic research on bank capital and regulatory requirements. After the financial crisis of 2007/2008, the approach was applied by, among others, the BCBS (2010a), Kashyap et al. (2010), and Miles et al. (2011 and 2013).Footnote 8 Our article is arranged as follows. In Section 2 we present an updated estimate of the size of the Modigliani-Miller (M-M) effect for Switzerland’s G-SIBs, extending the sample period of Junge and Kugler (2013) by 5 years up to 2015. Based on the M-M effect, we calculate in Section 3 the banks’ overall cost of funds and the social cost of higher equity capital requirements using a translog production function. In Section 4 we re-estimate the effect of banking crises using a novel and extensive data set from 1892 to 2016 and combine this with the analysis of Junge and Kugler (2013) to obtain a social benefit curve for additional equity capital requirements. In Section 5 we compare the social cost and benefit associated with higher equity capital requirements and determine optimal leverage and capital ratios under different capital definitions. Finally, Section 6 concludes.",

The Danish central bank first introduced a moderately negative deposit rate of − 0.05% in 2012.Footnote 1 The European Central Bank gradually reduced its deposit rate into negative territory starting in 2014, leading to a deposit rate of − 0.4% in March 2016. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) introduced negative interest rates on sight deposit account balances of − 0.75% in January 2015 and thus pioneered cutting policy rates much deeper into negative territory. Denmark and Sweden have since followed suit with similar sized cuts. And after more than 7 years of holding short-term interest rates at zero, the Bank of Japan cut its main policy rate to − 0.1% in January 2016. Bech and Malkhozov (2016) analyzed the rate cuts into negative territory by the four European central banks and found that the transmission of modestly negative policy rates to money market rates works the same way as with positive interest rates. An important question for central banks is how short rate changes are transmitted to longer-term yields, which are relevant for consumption and investment decisions. What makes the transmission mechanism at very low interest rates special is the presence of a lower bound on nominal interest rates. This lower bound has implications for the relationship between short- and long-term interest rates, even when rates are still above the lower bound. Ruge-Murcia (2006) used a simple term structure model to show that when nominal interest rates are constrained by some lower bound, the expectations hypothesis of the term structure implies a nonlinear relationship between changes in short-term interest rates and changes in longer-term yieldsFootnote 2. As short rates approach the lower bound, (1) the effect of short rates on longer-term yields declines and (2) the effect of short rates on longer-term yields becomes increasingly asymmetric, with short rate increases having a larger absolute impact than short rate declines. These effects work through market expectations of future short-term interest rates. The closeness to the lower bound influences the distribution of likely future changes in the policy rate, and hence long-term interest rates. Because market participants anticipate that future short rate shocks are constrained by the lower bound on nominal interest rates, expected future short rates and the yield curve are effected even when short rates are still above the lower bound. When short rates are closer to the lower bound, a short rate decline will produce a smaller downward shift in expected future short rates and thus also a smaller effect on long-term yields. This paper investigates how changes in short-term interest rates transmit to longer-term interest rates when the policy rate is at very low levels or negative. For this empirical analysis, data for Swiss franc short- and long-term interest rates are used. Switzerland is an interesting case study for our purposes because the SNB has lowered interest rates further than any other central bank. If the effective bound on nominal interest rates is the same across countries, then one could argue that Swiss interest rates are closest to what constitutes an “effective lower bound”. Therefore, if the nonlinearities predicted by term structure models such as Ruge-Murcia (2006) are important in practice, it should be possible to detect them in the Swiss term structure. Our empirical approach follows Ruge-Murcia (2006) and Grisse (2015): we regress daily changes in long-term bond yields on positive and negative changes in short-term interest rates. To allow the strength of the comovements between short- and long-term interest rates to depend on the interest rate level, we estimate this regression separately for four sub-samples. The results can be summarized as follows. In the pre-crisis sample, which lasts until the lower bound of the target range for the Swiss National Bank (SNB) for the Swiss franc 3-month Libor reaches zero, we find no statistically significant difference between the impacts of negative and positive short rate changes on long-term interest rates. As short rates turn lower, the effect of short rate increases rises, while that of short rate decreases remains stable, contrary to what theory predicts. During the minimum exchange rate regime of the SNB, the impact of positive changes in short-term rates drops and loses statistical significance, but it rises again after the introduction of negative interest rates. Hence, the impact with negative interest rates is less asymmetric for positive versus negative short rate changes than at times when the policy rate was at the zero lower bound. This finding shows that the transmission from short-term to long-term interest rates normalized after the introduction of negative interest rates, perhaps because that introduction was associated with a decline in the market-perceived lower bound. While the previous literature has found that the transmission to longer-term interest rates is impaired when the policy rate is close to its perceived lower bound, we find that this has not been the case in Swiss data. It also suggests that market participants changed their beliefs about the level of the effective lower bound and do not consider the effective lower bound to have been reached yet at the current policy rate of − 0.75%. In this paper, we look at the general daily correlation between short- and long-term interest rates, rather than at the transmission of policy rate changes. Nevertheless, our findings are suggestive of the following important policy implications for the use of negative interest rates as a monetary policy tool. First, the empirical results suggest that a move of policy interest rates into negative territory not only transmits well to money market interest rates, but also to longer-term interest rates such as government bond yields. Second, the results for the zero lower bound period are consistent with the asymmetric effects of positive and negative short-rate changes that are predicted by the Ruge-Murcia (2006) model. As short rates are normalized after a period close to the lower bound, positive changes in the short term rate may have unusually strong effects, and long-term yields may adjust very quickly to changes in the policy rate. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The “Swiss monetary policy implementation” section summarizes the developments in the implementation of monetary policy in Switzerland since the global financial crisis. The “Theoretical motivation” section presents a summary of the Ruge-Murcia (2006) model that motivates the empirical analysis and discusses its applicability in periods when the central bank intervenes on the FX market. The “Empirical analysis” section presents the empirical analysis of the effects of Swiss franc short-term on long-term interest rates, and the “Robustness” section provides several robustness checks. Finally, the “Conclusions” section concludes.",2
154,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,03 April 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-017-0015-6,"The economics of secession: a review of legal, theoretical, and empirical aspects",December 2018,Thierry Madiès,Grégoire Rota-Grasiozi,Cyril Trépier,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Neither the binding referendum held in Scotland on 18 December 2014, nor the unilateral declaration of independence in Catalonia on 27 October 2017 created a new state. The former gave victory to the “No”; the latter, less well prepared than the Scottish referendum, led to the destitution of the Catalan government and to new regional elections to be held on 21 December 2017. Despite their differences, both events remind us that states are not immutable. Separatist forces are still present in certain EU member states. In their seminal and influential paper about the breakup of nations, Bolton and Roland (1997) state that “the entire map of Europe, from the Atlantic Coast to the Urals, is being redrawn and issues of separation, unification, and the redrawing of borders are yet again at the forefront of European concerns. Many of the issues raised by this process are primarily of a political, cultural or linguistic nature. However, there are also economic considerations that bear on this problem”. Switzerland has not escaped from secessionist desires. The most famous case is that of the Canton of Jura which was created on 1 January 1979 after having seceded from the Canton of Berne. Dominicé (2006) points out that “when for a specific matter there is no federal rule, international law is applied as a substitute […] In the case of the Canton of Jura, important questions were settled by reference to customary international law under the laws of State secession.” Secessionism is obviously not only a threat to European states but is also a concern in a great number of developing and ethnically fragmented countries, where it takes often a violent form. Since World War II, the number of new sovereign states has dramatically increased from 51 in 1945 to 99 in 1960 and to 195 in 2017 mainly due to the decolonization process of the 1960s and the breakup of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia in the 1990s. Sambanis et al. (2017) estimate the number of groups that have made separatist claims in 120 countries over the period 1945–2012 at 464, that is to say twice as much as the figures provided by former studies. Widespread secessionism exists even in the face of high uncertainty about the economic impact of secessions. In fact, secessions may well be economically costly. Smaller countries face a steeper cost of providing public goods, and their small internal markets do not allow to reach maximum efficiency in the production of private goods (except if they enjoy the proximity to a large integrated market such as the European single market). Indeed, Reynaerts and Vanschoonbeek (2016) estimate that newly independent countries tend to grow more slowly than other comparable countries. The authors find, on average, that the cost of secession is equivalent to 20% of GDP per capita, and it remains strong in the long run. There seems to be, however, a considerable variation: Secessions seem to have been particularly costly among ex-USSR Republics and French colonies but to have been much less costly in ex-Yugoslavia and ex-Czechoslovakia. The fact that so many regions seek independence—even when secession is associated with economic costs—suggests that there are strong non-economic benefits of secession. Economic theory assumes that the greater homogeneity (geographically, culturally, linguistically, and otherwise) that characterizes smaller countries explains the importance of non-economic benefits. Regions that are geographically and culturally distant from the center may not receive much public goods and/or may have sharply distinct preferences on the type of public good they want. Some proponents of Scottish independence argued that secession would indeed be desirable as the preferences of Scots on social policy are very different from those of the rest of the UK. Desmet et al. (2011) argue that the breakup of the ex-Yugoslavia would not have happened for economic reasons alone and required a preference for cultural homogeneity. Both political and fiscal decentralization have been widely used by central governments as a means to accommodate the claim of geographically concentrated groups and minorities for self-determination, with mixed results. This may be explained by three main reasons: The first one is that decentralization tends to be used by central governments to appease separatists, hence a seemingly positive relationship between centrifugal forces and decentralization. The second one is that subnational groups or entities that are granted greater autonomy might use the available resources in their hands to foster separatist tendencies. The third reason is that decentralization may have different meanings for central (federal) governments and subnational jurisdictions. Central governments very often want to retain power so that decentralization actually boils down to a simple deconcentration, i.e., responsibilities over taxes and public expenditures are actually transferred to a representative of the central government at the subnational level and not to locally elected officials (Dafflon and Madiès 2011). The aim of this paper is to present a survey on secessions covering both legal issues and the main contributions of the economic literature, with a particular focus on the question as to whether decentralization fosters or hinders the desire to secede. More specifically, the paper is organized as follows. The first part deals with both international and EU law regarding the secession phenomenon. The second part presents the main contributions of the economic theory of secessions. The third part presents empirical evidence that confirms the main determinants of secessions identified by the theory. A more specific focus is put on ethnic conflicts and decentralization.",9
154,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,20 March 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-017-0013-8,Money demand under free banking: Switzerland 1851–1906,December 2018,Stefan Gerlach,Peter Kugler,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Before the foundation of Swiss National Bank in 1907, banknotes were issued by private banks in Switzerland. Thus, all components of M1, except coins, were issues by private banks under a regime of free banking. Under such circumstances, an increase in the money supply may occur at the extensive margin through an increase in the number of banks or at the intensive margin through an increase in the money supply by existing banks. Moreover, the years since the creation of the Swiss franc as a national currency in 1850 witnessed a strong change in the composition of the M1. In 1851, approximately 87% of M1 were coins and the rest was shared by banknotes and sight deposits. In 1906, the share of sight deposits increased to 74% and that of coins shrank to 7% (Baltensperger and Kugler 2015a, 2015b, Chapter III.1). This development is mirrored on the one hand by an increase in the number of banks from 520 in 1851 to 610 in 1880, a level which remained largely constant thereafter. On the other hand and more importantly, the aggregate bank balance sheet total was six times larger in 1906 than in 1851. Switzerland thus underwent a substantial change in financial structure and a rapid development of banking during this period which needs to be taken into account in analyzing money demand and monetary dynamics. The rapid financial development of the US compared to the financially highly developed UK economy in the nineteenth century was discussed by Friedman and Schwartz (1982). They found that from 1867 to 1903 increased financial sophistication in the USA lead to a long-run increase of M1 beyond the growth of nominal income. Based on their analysis, they calculated an adjusted US money stock attempting to put into account financial developments. In this paper, we follow a different approach by including the developments of the banking sector directly into the analysis of money demand and monetary dynamics in Switzerland from 1851 to 1906. There are two reasons for why doing so is interesting. First, an increase in the number of banks and in their activities has a direct effect on money demand as banknotes and sight deposits become more attractive by increased bank coverage of a country. One would thus expect that the growing activity of banks increased the demand for money. Whether or not this is so is an empirical question that, as far as we know, has not yet been analyzed econometrically. Second, Baltensperger and Kugler (2017, Chapter 9) estimate money demand functions for Switzerland before WW I and report a point estimate of 1.62 for the income elasticity. After the WW I, however, the income elasticity is not significantly different from 1 and exhibits an impressive stability over time. Since the growth of the banking system occurred in a period of strong income growth, one obvious possibility is that high-income elasticity estimated by Baltensperger and Kugler results from the fact that they do not incorporate the growth of the banking system in their analysis. As a consequence, its importance for money demand is instead attributed to income growth. The paper is organized as follows: the “Free banking in Switzerland 1850–1905/1907” section gives a brief account of the development of free banking between the creation of the Swiss franc in 1850 and the establishment of the Swiss National Bank in 1905–1907. This period started with nearly unregulated competition in banknote issue, but the harmonization of privately issued banknotes required by federal banking law of 1881 undermined this system and finally led to the creation of SNB. The “A simple model of money demand under free banking” section then considers a long-run model of money demand in which we take into account explicitly the banking activity in a model with four cointegrating relations. Money demand depends on the ratio of the bank balance-sheet-total-to-GDP and the number of banks as additional variables. The ratio of balance-sheet-total-to-GDP depends on real income. The same applies to the number of banks which depend in addition on the spread between the interest rates for mortgage loans and savings deposits which is also governed by a long-run relationship. Our empirical results are reported in the “Empirical results” section. The main finding is that banking activity is an important variable in long-run money demand as well as in the monetary adjustment process under free banking. Finally, the “Conclusions” section concludes.",2

From a theoretical viewpoint, the dominant or “conventional” idea, according to Elmendorf and Mankiw (1999, p. 1617), whose expression we will use henceforth, states that in the long term, a high public debt slows down economic growth. However, this point of view remains very much debated. From an empirical angle, researches tackling this question were already numerous before exploding subsequent to the worldwide financial crisis of 2008 and the “influential” (Panizza and Presbitero 2013, p. 180) work of Reinhart and Rogoff (2010). Nevertheless, on the one hand, these empirical researches suffer, for now, from several methodological flaws, weakening their conclusions (Panizza and Presbitero 2013). On the other hand, a non-negligible part of them finds that this debt does not clearly or significantly influence economic growth.Footnote 1 This article is aimed at empirically testing the conventional idea on the Swiss case between 1894 and 2014. In this respect, our research presents a first contribution. Several empirical studies that seem particularly interesting, because they have tested this idea for a high number of countries and over a very long-lasting period, take Switzerland into account, in particular the series of analyses based on the database established by S.A. Abbas.Footnote 2 This database certainly has the advantage of supplying figures relative to the public debt in Switzerland that go back to 1899. However, these figures concern only the debt contracted by the central state. Panizza and Presbitero (2013, p. 193 and p. 197) underline the methodological importance, for any empirical research, of the “definition of the debt itself,” as it is possible to have an “enormous range” between “central government debt [and] general government debt.” This is exactly the case in Switzerland. Since her creation in 1848, until today, Switzerland has remained one of the most federalist states in the world. This means that in Swiss public finances, the regional state structures (that is, the 26 cantons) and the local state structures (the thousands of municipalities) have more weight than the central state (the Confederation). The result is that not only does the central public debt usually form a minor part of the general public debt; it is also the case that the central government debt does not follow the same trend as the general government debt. Some figures show it clearly (two points) in 1910, 1925, 1950, 1975, and 2000, the central gross public debt accounted for, respectively, 8.8, 40.5, 61.5, 27.3, and 49.8% of the general gross public debt.Footnote 3 So, any empirical analysis based solely on central public debt must inevitably be strongly biased. Therefore, an important contribution of this research is to provide a dataset—the first of this kind—on the general gross public debt in Switzerland covering a long period: from 1894 to 2014 (see Additional file 1: Table SA.1).Footnote 4 Secondly, to our knowledge, there exists only one published empirical study specifically concerning the Swiss case: the one done by Schwab (1996, pp. 134–136 and pp. 162–169).Footnote 5 The author himself underlines that due to the “relatively short” period of time studied (1963–1992), “it is difficult to come to conclusive appraisals about the relations between public finances and economic growth in Switzerland” (Schwab 1996, p. 169). Thus, the second contribution of the present research is to remedy this problem by analyzing the Swiss case over a long period of time, namely 120 years. A third asset of this paper is the use of various atheoretical methodologies in order to consolidate conclusions. Three analyses are performed: a study of correlations between GDP-weighted variables, a study of the correlation between residuals of ARIMA models, and reduced-form vector autoregression (VAR) modeling allowing us to test Granger causalities. For all analysis, time series are studied independently on economic growth (boom) phases, recession phases, and all phases together. This study empirically tests two hypotheses supported by the conventional theoretical conception (Brunner, 1986; Schwab, 1996, pp. 103–104 and pp. 157–158; Elmendorf and Mankiw 1999, pp. 1615–1669; Blanchard 2008): Hypothesis 1 Public debt has a negative impact on economic growth. Hypothesis 2 Public debt raises long-term interest rates. The first hypothesis forms what we can call the general or basic hypothesis of the conventional theory. Following the large majority of other studies, this hypothesis will be tested by examining relations between the general gross public debt and the gross domestic product (GDP) in Switzerland. The second hypothesis is more restrictive but plays a central role in the conventional theory. As a matter of fact, this theory often puts the increase of long-term interest rates at the very heart of mechanisms having a negative impact on economic growth. Hypothesis 2 will be tested by analyzing relations between the general gross public debt and the nominal yields on Confederation and/or Swiss Federal Railways bonds, which, in Switzerland, are generally considered to be the benchmarks for long-term interest rates. This paper is divided as follows: the “Data” section presents data used for our research; the “Analyses and empirical results” section contains statistical analysis descriptions, results, and discussions; and, finally, conclusions are found in the “Conclusions” section.",

One of the tools used by policy makers to stimulate the labour supply of mothers is through the expansion of childcare. In countries in which female labour force participation is already high, the effects produced by childcare are usually minimal (Bettendorf et al. 2015). Recent studies in many Scandinavian countries indeed show that subsidised childcare has had no significant impact on female labour supply (Lundin et al. 2008; Havnes and Mogstad 2011b).Footnote 1 As these studies suggest, this is probably because the services provided in these countries meet the demand for childcare among all social classes almost perfectly. This does not appear to be the case in Switzerland, where, as in Germany (Wrohlich 2008; Bauernschuster and Schlotter 2015), the demand for childcare is much higher than the supply (Banfi et al. 2009). In Switzerland, female labour force participation is now very high, with 79.8% of women actively participating in the labour market (OECD 2015). The participation of women with children, however, is much lower, and as in the Netherlands, the majority of this high rate of work force participation is part-time work. This finding suggests that childcare could potentially influence working hours rather than labour market entry itself. The extensive margin of female labour force participation linked to the availability of childcare has been studied in many countries, and results appear to differ depending on the national context (see Cascio et al. 2015 and Del Boca 2015 for a review of recent studies). Evidence of the effects on the intensive margin is something that has been studied only recently. This paper contributes in this respect by examining a natural experiment of childcare expansion in Switzerland. This paper analyses the effects of the increase in the number of childcare places driven by public subsidies, applying a quasi-experimental design in 24 Swiss cantons. The Swiss federal system is peculiar in its characteristics because each canton can legislate over many aspects that affect the socio-economic life of its population. This wide variety of legislation creates variability in the data, which becomes useful for evaluating policies. In addition to this political diversity, the Swiss context is interesting because many aspects of its welfare state have led it to be classified among liberal countries. Unlike modern Anglo-Saxon countries that have promoted women’s independence since the beginning of the twentieth century, the values and gender roles of this country have been traditionally anchored in the classical male breadwinner model. This means that the government intervenes only sporadically to regulate family matters and that social norms do not create strong work attachment among women. In addition to this, many factors intervene in women’s decisions to participate in the labour market. These factors include the preferences of the individual and of the partner, culture and discrimination (Milligan 2014). Recent studies show that a gender egalitarian culture is still not widespread in Switzerland (Epple et al. 2015) and that decisions regarding paid employment for mothers are strongly influenced by their partner’s income (Gerfin and Leu 2007; Ernst Stähli et al. 2009). As highlighted by Asai (2015), in Japan, the participation of fathers in childrearing could substantially reduce mothers’ hardships in reconciling work and family life. In Switzerland, the influence of partner’s income on female labour force participation declines 4 years after childbirth, but not before (Liechti 2017). In this context, the evaluation of the effect of childcare policies is not a trivial exercise. This is true for several reasons. First, when formal childcare places are rationed, the creation of new slots or the introduction of subsidies might simply substitute other non-institutional childcare arrangements among mothers who are already working (Givord and Marbot 2015). If this occurs, the political effort put into the expansion of childcare may appear unsuccessful (Havnes and Mogstad 2011b). Second, when most women prefer part-time work arrangements,Footnote 2 it is difficult to measure full-time equivalents because women may use childcare at different rates. Analyses of the effects of an expansion of childcare places should therefore take into account these preferences and select a variable that can detect subtle changes in working hours. In addition to this, when most women work, changes are expected to be found more on the intensive margin than on the extensive margin. The expansion of childcare places in a country with high labour force participation and widespread part-time work translates into an expansion in the number of days per slot available. Third, prices can be a deterrent for the use of childcare among certain types of households. In this case, when prices are not directly available, it is important to test the assumptions on a broad spectrum of household types in order to have a reliable picture of the overall effects. Fourth, childcare services may be steered by parental demand for this type of service and by political interests based on the specific characteristics of local labour markets. If the supply is driven by demand, then estimates are likely to be biased. It is therefore important to correct for this possible endogeneity. This study uses data from the Swiss Labour Force Survey (SLFS) and a newly established database with cantonal data on the number of childcare places in recognised private and public childcare facilities for early childcare. The identification strategy consists of a quasi-experiment created by different degrees of expansion of childcare places among 26 Swiss cantons between 2002 and 2012. The target population comprises mothers with at least one child between 0 and 3 years of age. A difference-in-differences analysis is used to evaluate the effect of the expansion of childcare places on the labour market outcomes of these mothers. The results demonstrate that an expansion in childcare places stimulates part-time employment of between 20 and 36 h per week by 2 percentage points for mothers of 3-year-olds. The reform has not triggered any change in female labour force participation but has allowed working mothers to work longer hours. The effects appear greater for married or cohabitating mothers with upper-secondary education. Significant effects are registered for mothers of two children. No effects are found for fathers.",4
154,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,19 June 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-017-0005-8,On the rewards to international investing: a safe haven currency perspective,December 2018,Jean-Pierre Danthine,Samuel Danthine,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The appreciation of the Swiss franc since the start of the financial crisis has been a traumatic experience for Swiss-based investors, repeatedly turning their currency exposures into severe losses. The impact of this experience is hard to overestimate. Ten years later, broad anecdotal evidence and current account statistics suggest that the propensity of Swiss-based investors (and corporates) to assume currency risk has been durably reduced when not annihilated. With extremely low—in fact currently negative—risk-free interest rates in francs, this implies that prudent investors—notably pension funds—face a very high hurdle in order to deliver the investment returns that are counted on. Macroeconomically, the reluctance to take on currency risks has meant the end of the previously prevailing external balance of payment equilibrium whereby the current account surplus is compensated by equi-proportionate external net capital flows. As a consequence, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) has been forced into substituting public capital flows to the missing private ones and in so doing has accumulated a balance sheet exceeding 100% of GDP as of this writing. The sudden and massive appreciation of the franc during the crisis is one of three factors rendering particularly challenging the natural desire of residents of a small country such as Switzerland of reaping the benefits of international portfolio diversification. The second determinant of the specific challenge facing Swiss franc-based investors is the secular tendency of the franc to appreciate in nominal and also, according to Baltensperger and Kugler (2016), in real terms against the major alternative currencies. This trend presents a significant hurdle when the proceeds of international investments are converted back into the home currency. Acting as a countervailing force, however, is the persistent negative interest differential—sometimes termed the Swiss interest island—that has characterized the returns on CHF-denominated assets (relative to those observed in other major markets) almost since the first world war but notably since the end of the Bretton Woods period (Baltensperger and Kugler 2016). Using data from 1980 to 2003, that is before the Great Financial Crisis, Kugler and Weder (2004) came to the conclusion that the negative interest differential outweighed the tendency of the franc to appreciate so that an unhedged rolled over 3-month position in dollars, UK sterling, and euros converted in Swiss francs delivered superior returns to a pure Swiss franc investment in 3-month securities. They thus observed that uncovered interest parity (UIP) had not been validated over their period of observation. This result is consistent with more general observations made in the carry-trade literature (see Menkhoff et al. (2012) and the extensive literature cited therein) but the interest rate island, that is, the persistence of the sign of the interest differential in the case of the CHF and, as a consequence, the length of the investment holding periods contemplated by (Kugler and Weder 2004) made their results distinctive. (Kugler and Weder 2004) further observed the over-performance of an unhedged investment in foreign currency 10-year bond portfolios while a Swiss franc equity investment had delivered a superior return compared to equity portfolios in each of the three foreign currencies after conversion into francs. Taken at face value, the Kugler and Weder (2004) results could lead to the conclusion that the current reluctance of Swiss-based investors to take on currency risk is misguided, possibly due to a behavioral bias resulting from the size of the trauma mentioned above and its historical proximity. Such a sweeping conclusion would be premature, however, because their sample did not include a crisis period which is precisely when the safe haven characteristics that are the counterpart of the interest island manifest themselves in a way that is meaningful for long-run investors. In this paper, we return to this issue with the benefit of a severe crisis being part of our period of observation. The Swiss negative interest rate differential has been a puzzle for a long time (and it is the focus of Kugler and Weder’s inquiry). We believe the additional period of observation permits reaching a coherent and logical explanation for this phenomenon. The recent literature on safe haven currencies emphasize the high frequency reactions of the CHF and the yen notably in times of surges in market volatility (Ranaldo and Söderlind 2010). We complete this view here by adopting a long-run perspective. A safe haven asset is also one which provides insurance against rare but severe shocks with a long-lasting impact. This insurance must have a price in the form of offering lower returns in normal times (thus making it a natural funding currency for carry traders), or else, the asset in question would be a dominating assetFootnote 1. It is not surprising therefore that, in the case of the CHF, uncovered interest parity does not hold, possibly for long, crisis-free time periods. But this normal return deficit may be made up in crisis times when the safe haven characteristics of the currency manifest itself with a vengeance. We will see that this view is consistent with the observations over the last 36 years and highlight the ensuing challenges facing Swiss-based investors. Our interest for the current problematic of investors based in a small country leads us to push the inquiry one step further and make a comparison between hedged and unhedged returns, taking the cost of hedging into account. Our goal is to address what we perceive as the currently dominant practice of Swiss-based investors which is to form highly internationalized portfolios, if only for lack of opportunities given the limited size of the Swiss capital markets, but systematically hedge the corresponding currency risks. We observe that the question of whether it pays to hedge or not is directly related to the existence of significant and long-lasting deviations from UIP. In other words, in a world of long-lasting deviations from interest parity, currency hedging is not the free lunch; it is sometimes made to be and often hoped for at the current juncture. But the crisis behavior of the safe haven currency may render unhedged international investment portfolios (or a permanent carry trade position for that matter) excessively risky. We suggest that a selective hedging strategy based on the strength of the franc has good chances of being successful and provide an example of a simple-minded strategy that would have dominated a systematic hedge over the past 36 years.",2
154,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,17 April 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-017-0014-7,The Swiss franc safety premium,December 2018,Jessica Leutert,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The recent financial crisis and the subsequent European sovereign debt crisis provoked a large flight to quality among investors and caused strong upward pressure on the Swiss franc (CHF). It appreciated against the euro (EUR) by almost 40% within the relatively short time span of only 3 years. Major exchange rate interventions by the Swiss National Bank did not lead to the desired tension release, so that in September 2011, fearing an overvaluation of its currency, the Swiss central bank announced a lower bound of 1.20 on the EUR/CHF exchange rate. A currency that has a general tendency to appreciate during episodes of intense crisis and offer hedging value against global risk is a currency that we would expect to earn a safety premium, defined as the compensation that investors require to short a safe currency and invest in a basket of foreign currencies. And as the willingness to short a safe currency decreases during risky episodes, we would expect this safety premium to be time-varying and to reach its highest values during periods of crises. One objective of this paper is to examine whether the Swiss franc earns a safety premium and to give an idea about its approximate size. Studying the potential safety premium of the Swiss franc might help to understand the dynamics of the Swiss franc exchange rate. Given Switzerland’s strong trade linkages with the rest of the world, variations in the Swiss franc exchange rate are not only an important factor in determining the profitability of Switzerland’s major export-oriented sector, but are also an important factor in determining domestic inflation. Hence, its dynamics will have major implications for monetary policy makers. Furthermore, the safety premium is a priced factor that can be reflected in many internationally traded assets. While the focus of the recent empirical literature mainly lies on the analysis of unconditional safety premiums and ex-post currency excess returns, I make an attempt to calculate the time-varying Swiss franc safety premium, based on the conditional version of an International Capital Asset Pricing Model. An obvious way to estimate such a model would be to use a multivariate GARCH process, as has for example been done by De Santis and Gérard (1998). In a recent paper, however, Maggiori (2013) calculates the US dollar (USD) safety premium using another estimation methodology, based on the three-step instrumental variable approach developed by Duffee (2005). As compared to a GARCH approach, such a setup imposes less structure on the dynamics of the conditional covariance and has a higher flexibility. Maggiori (2013) presents promising results. In a first step, he calculates an estimate for the conditional covariance between a USD exchange rate index and the MSCI stock market return index. His results clearly show that this conditional covariance peaks in times of crisis, meaning that investors expect strong appreciations of the USD after negative stock market shocks. In a second step, Maggiori then estimates the risk price coefficient and finds a positive and significant value. By multiplying the conditional covariance by this risk price estimate, he gets an estimate for the USD safety premium, he finds the monthly USD safety premium to be around 10% in crisis times. Applying Maggiori’s procedure to a trade-weighted Swiss franc exchange rate index and the EUR/CHF exchange rate, I expected to find similar patterns, but found results that are unsatisfactory. The conditional covariance estimates indeed confirm that investors expect the CHF to appreciate in times of crises, in other words, that they consider the CHF to be safe. At the same time, however, my results suggest that this safety is priced negatively, which is highly unrealistic. Given that investors are on average risk averse, theory and common sense tell us that the price of risk should be positive. Consequently, there seem to be some limitations in the methodology. So, a further objective of this paper is to provide a possible explanation and solution to these limitations. I argue that a potential problem lies in the construction of the dependent variable of the model: By definition, the safety premium is equal to the sum of the interest rate differential and the expected exchange rate change, which is unobservable. Maggiori suggests using the actual ex-post exchange rate change instead, which incorporates the prediction error made by investors. Given that forecasting exchange rates is difficult, this prediction error and hence the measurement error in the dependent variable are likely to be big. The solution to get around this problem is simple: The measurement error in the dependent variable can be avoided by choosing a different measure for the expected exchange rate change. I test two alternatives: The first one is to set the expected exchange rate change equal to zero, and the second one to set it equal to the prediction of an augmented Fama regression. For the Swiss franc, both options improve the results, but the second seems to dominate the first one. When using the prediction of the Fama regression, the risk price estimates become more realistic and closer to what I get when estimating the model, for comparison, with a multivariate GARCH specification, the Dynamic Conditional Correlation model by Engle (2002). Once a potential structural break in the relationship between Swiss franc exchange rate returns and equity returns in early 1999 is taken into account, these results reveal that the CHF safety premium is indeed time-varying, highest in times of crisis, and was equal to around 4.5% with peaks of up to 12.5% during the recent financial crisis, supporting the view of the CHF acting as a safe haven during periods of high risk. Overall, my contribution shows that the three-step instrumental variable procedure proposed by Maggiori does not work for the Swiss franc and reveals a potential source of imprecision. I suggest a slight modification in the procedure that helps to improve the results for the Swiss franc. In my opinion, however, the instrumental variable approach still has some shortcomings compared to the maximum likelihood-estimated GARCH models: While maximum likelihood allows to estimate the model elegantly in one single step, the need for three separate steps to estimate it with instrumental variables is a source of impreciseness. Each individual step adds some uncertainty. Furthermore, an instrumental variable approach can only lead to convincing results when the available instruments are strong, which, at least in my sample, appears not to be the case. The structure of the paper is as follows. The “Related literature” section gives an overview of the empirical literature on exchange rate returns and currency risk premiums. In the “Some descriptive evidence” section, I provide some descriptive evidence on the relationship between Swiss franc exchange rate changes and stock market returns. The “Safety premium model” section discusses the theoretical safety premium model. In the “Estimation strategy” section, I present the three-stage instrumental variable approach and in the “Data” section the data. The “Results” and “Time-varying price of risk” sections discuss the results and some extension. Finally, the “Comparison to a multivariate GARCH-in-mean specification” section compares the results to results obtained when using a GARCH specification and “Conclusions” section concludes and summarizes the main findings.",5
154,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,05 February 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-017-0011-x,Methods to identify linear network models: a review,December 2018,Arun Advani,Bansi Malde,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Researchers and policymakers are often interested in identifying whether and the extent to which direct connections between agents affect their outcomes. For example, does the schooling performance of an individual depend on that of her friends? Does the health seeking behaviour of one’s relatives influence one’s own health seeking behaviour? Are firms’ investment and pay decisions influenced by the behaviour of firms in the same or closely-related industry? The identification and estimation of such social or network effects—direct spillovers from the characteristics or outcomes of one agent to the outcome of others—is of central interest in empirical research on networks in economics. This paper reviews recent developments in methods to identify linear peer effect models using networks data—data with detailed information on the exact interactions between agents—when a single cross section of data is available. Linear models are the most widely used in empirical work, with many econometric methods developed to work with these, making them a natural choice to consider in this reviewFootnote 1. Moreover, panel data on the network have until recently only rarely been available, so the majority of methods focus on the case with a single cross section of dataFootnote 2. We provide an overview of a number of commonly used empirical specifications, the underlying theoretical models that generate them; and the conditions for the causal identification of parameters with cross-sectional data. We first consider three ‘local’ models, where only an agent’s direct connections (or neighbours) affect his outcome. The three specifications allow this effect to depend on the average outcome, total outcome, or both, of his neighbours. In the absence of information on interactions within a network (or group), identification of social effect parameters is greatly complicated by the so-called reflection problem, a form of simultaneity where it is not possible to identify who influences whom within the network or reference group (Manski 1993). Information on the exact interactions within a network can break this simultaneity for a wide range of network structures, allowing for identification of social effect parametersFootnote 3. Recent theoretical analyses have shown that the structure of networks, as well as positions of agents within them influences agents’ overall outcomes on dimensions such as information diffusion and risk sharing, among others (Bloch et al. 2008; Jackson et al. 2012; Banerjee et al. 2013). The availability of detailed network data has motivated the testing of implications of these models in recent work. We thus next discuss models where the entire structure of the network might matter for an individual’s outcome. Finally, we discuss how experimental and quasi-experimental variation could be used to provide additional variation to uncover social effects. Our objective is to provide an overview of methods developed under the assumption that the network is (conditionally) exogenously formed: that is, there are no unobserved individual variables within the network that determine who links with whom. This is an important issue that is the subject of much recent research. A companion paper (Advani and Malde 2016), as well as other recent reviews (e.g. Graham 2015; Chandrasekhar 2015; de Paula 2016), provide overviews of this issue and of possible methods to deal with this. An important issue in the practical estimation of social effects relates to the definition and measurement of the network. Our review proceeds assuming that the researcher perfectly observes and measures the network (or network neighbours) relevant for the outcome(s) of interest. Clearly, the researcher’s choice of network to use will influence the estimated parameters and potentially lead to different policy implications. However, few existing datasets collect information on more than one type of network, so that in practice, researchers are often restricted in their definition of the network by the available data. Nonetheless, existing studies indicate that the definition of the network is important. For example, Sacerdote (2001) finds that only students’ individual room-mates affect their college performance, while a broader set of peers matters for decisions related to social group participation; Renna et al. (2008) document that adolescents’ weights are more responsive to those of their friends of the same gender, while Patacchini et al. (2016) find that adolescent friendships lasting longer than 1 year have persistent effects on adolescents’ education outcomes, while shorter-lived friendships do not. Measurement error on the network will also bias parameter estimates. A more detailed overview of this issue, as well as of methods to deal with it, is provided in Advani and Malde (2014) and another companion paper (Advani and Malde 2016). To illustrate the practical restrictions imposed by each of the different models, empirical specifications and conditions for causal identification, we will use a simple and widely studied question in the education and labour economics literatures: How is a teenager’s schooling performance influenced by his friends? This is also a question of great policy interest.Footnote 4 More specifically, this paper will provide an overview of methods that can yield answers to questions such as ‘Is a teenager’s schooling performance influenced by the average schooling performance of her friends?’; ‘Do teenagers gain more utility from studying if their friends also study?’; ‘What is the relative importance of the average schooling performance of a teenager’s friends, and of complementarities arising from one’s friends’ studying decisions in shaping a teenager’s overall schooling performance?’; and ‘How does a student’s popularity influence his/her schooling performance?’ The same methods can also be applied to answer analogous questions about interactions between many other types of agents. The literature on methods for networks data is broad and developing rapidly. We therefore focus our review on the issues outlined above, leaving aside a number of other interesting areas, including methods to deal with endogenous network formation and measurement error in the network, which we survey elsewhere (Advani and Malde 2016). In addition, though many of the methods reviewed here either build on or apply methods developed in spatial econometrics, it is not our objective to provide an overview of spatial econometric methods (see instead Anselin 1988). Boucher and Fortin (2015) provide a complementary review, though they do not cover methods using experimental and quasi-experimental variation. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The “Notation” section outlines the notation used in this paper. The “Local average models” section provides an overview of the local average model, where the average of neighbours’ outcomes is allowed to affect an individual’s outcome. In the “Local aggregate model” section, we cover the local aggregate model, where instead it is the total of neighbours’ outcomes that matters. In the “Hybrid local models” section, we consider hybrid local models, which allow both local average and local aggregate type effects. We consider models including network statistics that are not purely local, in the “Models with network characteristics” section. Finally, we show how experimental and quasi-experimental variation can be used to identify social effects in the “Experimental variation” section, before concluding.",5

Between the price of London bills, as expressed in the current rate of discount, and the price of foreign bills, as expressed in the current exchange rate, there exists at times a close sympathy [...].” Clare (1902, p. 87) The introductory quote is not remarkable for emphasising the close connection between the foreign exchange and money markets, which features prominently in the interest-parity condition, but for having been taken from a guide first published back in 1891 to provide “A Money-Market Primer and Key to the Exchanges”. The author, George Clare, wrote this book for the practitioner in the banking industry. Although Clare never reached academic fame, his work was praised by none other than Alfred Marshall as “the only tolerably good small book dealing with Banking and The Exchanges” (Groenewegen 1985). Apparently, before the year 1900, bankers had already developed a solid understanding of the connections between the exchange and interest rate (or at the time the discount rate). Indeed, according to Einzig (1962, pp. 184–185), during the nineteenth century, “the establishment of closer relations between banks [...] led to a considerable increase in the volume of exchange arbitrage [...] and also the volume of interest arbitrage” and the corresponding techniques were “described in detail in innumerable practical books and articles”. Specifically, it was arguably mainly in the economically and financially most advanced European nation states such as Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, where banks had the option of reinvesting idle deposits in the local money market, or earning short-term interest by purchasing bills of exchange involving foreign currencies. Reflecting the importance of this so-called investment demand for bills of exchange, numerous contemporaneous books can be found discussing interest-parity transactions involving European bills of exchange (Clare 1895, ch. 14–16, 1902, ch. 9; Spalding 1915, ch. 7; Thomas 1921, ch. 8). In his famous portrait of the London money market in Lombard Street, even Bagehot (1873, pp. 45–46) touches briefly on this issue. By way of contrast, around 1900, academic research about the foreign exchanges was still in its infancy. Early fragments of the interest-parity condition can already be found in Thornton (1802, ch. 5), whereas Goschen (1861) and Lotz (1889) published more extensive, but still highly informal, discussions. It was only during the first part of the twentieth century when formal theories that exchange rate movements offset, on average, the differences in interest rates between currencies began to establish themselves in the academic literature (Einzig 1962, ch. 17 and 21). In particular, Fisher (1896, ch. 9) and Keynes (1923, ch. 3.4) are often quoted as path-breaking contributions relating to, respectively, the uncovered and covered interest-parity condition. Compared with the voluminous empirical literature testing the interest-parity condition with modern data, for the major European financial centres during the era of the classical gold standard, the corresponding question has hitherto received much less attention. Although a small empirical literature including Goodhart (1969) and Coleman (2012) has tested the uncovered interest-parity condition around the year 1900, these contributions have looked at the dollar-to-sterling exchange rate and, owing to the slow dissemination of information and substantial transaction costs, found only scant support for the interest-parity condition. However, at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century, interest arbitrage arose arguably primarily as regards the investment demand for bills of exchange issued in London and in the main financial centres across the English Channel. Corroborating this, the contemporaneous guides emphasise that, rather than with New York, close links existed between the discount rate in the open money markets of Paris, Berlin, Amsterdam, and Brussels and the demand for London bills of exchange (Clare 1902, pp. 129ff.). As regards the covered interest-parity condition, Flandreau and Komlos (2006) provide an empirical study about early arbitrage transactions between Berlin and Vienna, where a forward foreign exchange market had already developed during the second half of the nineteenth century. Conversely, for the major currencies around the world, regular forward exchange transactions did not occur until after the First World War (Einzig 1962, pp. 182–183, 1967, pp. 7–8). Finally, rather than testing interest-parity relationships, they have also been employed to extract implied, or shadow, interest rates from international bills of exchange transactions. This approach, which takes the interest-parity condition for granted, has mainly been used for the pre-modern era, for which interest rate data are often unavailable and, when they were reported, were often subject to the constrains from usury laws (see e.g. Flandreau et al., 2009). However, Obstfeld and Taylor (2004, pp. 87ff.), for the case of London, New York and Berlin, and Flandreau and Rivière (1999), for the case of London and Paris, present corresponding results for the late nineteenth century. Against this background, this paper endeavours to contribute to the literature by testing how closely the discount and exchange rates were connected between the leading European financial centres during the era of the classical gold standard (1880—1914). In so doing, the fact that bills of exchange were the dominant security for short-term investments and managing exchange-rate risk will be taken into account. Based on weekly data, the results suggest that the bills of exchange versions of the interest-parity condition held remarkably well between European currencies, which were known for their long-standing stability as regards the convertibility into gold. Specifically, when comparing the continental discount rate with the exchange-rate adjusted return in London, the postulated proportional relationship tends to arise. Furthermore, even for investments by a London-based bank on the continent, where the lack of suitable long-bills made it difficult to hedge against future exchange-rate movements, the interest-parity condition holds reasonably well. The paper is organised as follows. The next section explains the historical role of bills of exchange for determining the relevant market exchange and discount rates during the gold standard. The “Weekly discount and exchange rate data” section discusses the data. The “Methods” section explains the peculiarities of interest-parity conditions involving bills of exchange. The “Results and discussion” section introduces the econometric strategy and presents the results. The “Conclusion” section summarises and concludes.",3

Deininger,Lukas Mohler,Daniel Mueller,Male,Male,Male,Male,"As many other European countries, Switzerland has revised its environmental and energy policy strategies in order to comply with GHG emission reduction goals and foster the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energyFootnote 1. Specifically, Switzerland has decided to reduce GHG emissions by 20% by 2020 compared with 1990 levels. In 2008, a carbon tax was introduced at 12 Swiss francs per metric ton of CO2. The tax was raised to 84 Swiss francs in 2016, and a further increase is possible if emissions are above target. Large emitters are exempted from the carbon tax and instead participate in a cap and trade system. Moreover, small- and medium-size companies can also be exempted from the tax provided they commit to legally binding CO2 reduction goals. Policy makers are confronted with the challenge of achieving the environmental targets without negatively affecting the overall economy and the competitiveness of firms. To evaluate the economic impact of such policies, a better understanding of substitution possibilities at the level of individual firms is needed. In this contribution, we analyze the relationship between factor substitutability and the energy intensity of Swiss manufacturing firmsFootnote 2. Our panel dataset comprises approximately 7400 observations at the firm level from 1997 to 2008. Using this micro panel data, we estimate substitution elasticities between capital, labor, energy, and material inputs using the linear logit as well as the translog cost function. Our work is related to the few existing studies that estimate substitution elasticities using firm-level data. Woodland (1993) is the first study to use micro data to analyze substitution between capital, labor, and four energy types in Australia. Nguyen and Streitwieser (1999) examine whether plant size in US manufacturing has an impact on the degree of factor substitution. Arnberg and Bjorner (2007) apply cross-section and panel data techniques to a dataset of Danish firms, and Tamminen and Tuomaala (2012) estimate substitution elasticities for 71 sectors employing a large panel of service and manufacturing firms from Finland. Similar to the last two studies, we employ a panel of manufacturing firms and estimate substitution elasticities controlling for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. As a novel contribution to this literature, our focus lies on the relationship between factor substitutability and the energy intensity of manufacturing firms. To perform our analysis, we classify the firms into three subsets according to their energy intensity and estimate elasticities for these subsets. We stress three main results: First, we find evidence for substitutability between energy and the input factors capital and labor for firms with low-energy intensity, implying that upon an energy price increase, factor use of labor and capital will increase in order to optimally compensate for the decreasing energy use. In contrast, capital and energy are estimated to be complements for the energy-intensive subset. Specifically, these energy-intensive firms substitute the decreasing energy (− 1.03%) and capital (− 0.09%) use upon an energy price increase of 1% with a higher input of material (+ 0.11%) and, to a lesser extent, labor (+ 0.03%). Second, by gradually excluding the firms with the lowest energy cost shares from the energy-intensive subset, we are able to show that the higher the mean energy cost share of the remaining firms is, the stronger the complementarity between energy and capital becomes. This result indicates that it is important to account for the heterogeneity of firms when estimating substitution elasticities: Even when using micro panel data, estimating the elasticities over a broad range of firms with heterogeneous characteristics seems to average out the specific substitution behavior of firms at the margin—in our case, the most energy-intensive firms. Third, these results bear strong policy implications: If energy and capital are complements, higher energy prices lead to lower capital levels, i.e., a reduction in investment. Energy taxes can thus be harmful and negatively affect competitiveness and overall economic performance. As is argued by Tovar and Iglesias (2013), in such a case, it would be beneficial to encourage technological innovation instead of increasing energy prices to achieve reductions in emissions or energy use. Our result thus lends support to policies that exempt certain firms from energy taxes in favor of implementing efficiency measures. In Switzerland, most firms have the choice between paying the carbon tax and committing to reduction goals. There is initial evidence in Oberauner (2010) that, in fact, the higher a firm’s energy intensity is, the more likely it will make use of this possibility. Hence, this may be a policy strategy to prevent the aforementioned harmful effects for energy-intensive firms from realizing. Such a strategy may also be eligible in other countries if evidence for complementarity between energy and capital is identified. As another consequence from a policy perspective, our results hint at possible issues using computable general equilibrium (CGE) models for policy evaluation, since these models often do not take into account the possibility of this kind of complementarity. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: the “Related literature” section gives a brief overview and discussion of previous micro data studies in the field of factor substitution. After introducing the applied methodology in the “Methods” section, the empirical analysis is provided in the “Empirical analysis” section. In the “Interpretation of the complementarity result” section, the results are interpreted and policy implications are derived. The paper concludes with the “Conclusions” section.",1

They supplanted lawyers in government and historians in the public sphere. As such, they have been involved with some of the most consequential decisions that societies make—decisions having to do, for instance, with the level of unemployment that might be left unattended, because it should be considered “natural”; with whether or not to authorize the purchase and sale of untested financial products or with how to organize the delivery of clean water, vaccines or electricity. This involvement has come at a cost. As Robert Chernomas and Ian Hudson put it, “economics has the awkward distinction of being both the most influential and the most reviled social science” (2016, 3). We might add: economics may be the most reviled social science precisely because it is the most influential. First, for better or for worse, economics has become the science of making social choices, and as such it always cuts right through the heart of politics and morality. The acknowledgement that (to quote Karl Marx) “[political economy] is—for all its worldly and debauched appearance—a truly moral science, the most moral science of all” (2005, 361) would have been no surprise to a long line of distinguished economic thinkers, from the classical economists to the founders of welfare economics, from John Maynard Keynes (who saw economics as a branch of ethics) to Tony Atkinson, who recently reminded the field that economists constantly enounce normative judgments (Atkinson 2009, also see Randazzo and Haidt 2015). Strangely enough, however, consideration of the normative hypotheses and criteria that underlie these judgments is often brushed aside as inconsequential. It is not. Economists tend to, well, economize, and societies often resist. Applying cost-benefit analysis to a host of social problems might increase efficiency, but it might also create or reinforce social inequalities in access to goods and services. It might crowd out moral norms, work ethics, and civic ideals. Certain proposed solutions (like value-added models to calculate teachers’ compensation, a recent fad in education) could quite simply feel distasteful and divisive. So the moral debate is, in fact, inevitable—and perhaps should be. As philosopher Michael Sandel (2013, 138) put it in the pages of the Journal of Economic Perspectives, “The more economic thinking extends its reach into social and civic life, the more market reasoning becomes inseparable from moral reasoning.”",9

154,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,25 January 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-017-0010-y,The sovereign money initiative in Switzerland: an economic assessment,December 2018,Philippe Bacchetta,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Swiss people will vote in 2018 on an initiative for monetary reform. The proposal is to have sovereign money, where only the Swiss National Bank (SNB) can issue money and where money includes banknotes and scriptural money from non-banks.Footnote 1 In principle, scriptural money means sight deposits included in M1. The reform would imply that all sight deposits in Swiss francs would be transferred outside commercial banks’ balance sheets and would be deposited at the SNB. The SNB would control the quantity of these sight deposits. The initiative also proposes that the SNB distributes funds to the state or directly to households. These funds would come from the existing sight deposits the SNB receives and from new money creation. The objective of this paper is twofold. First, it reviews the main arguments behind the reform, and second, it discusses the potential impact of its implementation on the Swiss economy.Footnote 2 The perspective taken in the paper is the one of an academic and of a macroeconomist. As a macroeconomist, I would like to put the reform in the perspective of current knowledge in the field. As an academic, I would like to examine the intellectual rigor of the arguments. From both perspectives, this review will be critical. First, even though it is a reform of macroeconomic nature, the motivation behind the initiative fundamentally ignores most of the existing literature in macroeconomics. Second, the arguments are often vague and incomplete and sometimes misleading or incorrect. The sovereign money reform is obviously related to the proposals for full reserve banking and to the “Chicago plan,” where commercial banks are imposed a 100% reserve requirement on deposits. Sovereign money is similar to full reserve coverage, but it goes one step further as it gives full control of sight deposits by the central bank.Footnote 3 Moreover, the initiative goes much further than the concept of sovereign money. It would introduce constraints on monetary policy and would imply that SNB liabilities are no longer matched by its assets. It would also impose restrictions on minimum holding periods for non-monetary financial assets such as savings deposits. A major feature of the sovereign money reform is that money would not bear any interest. This implies that there would never be interest on checking accounts, even in periods of high interest rates. This means that the reform would increase the cost of holding money. As pointed out by Friedman (1969), holding money is in general costly, because it bears a return below the one on other assets, and this opportunity cost should be minimized. Instead, the Swiss sovereign money reform would increase this cost. While the idea of full reserve requirements has received some attention in the literature,Footnote 4 it is difficult to find much literature on sovereign money. Consequently, the proponents of the initiative often refer to studies on full reserve requirements, even though they insist that sovereign money is different from reserve requirements. However, the references mentioned do not examine all the aspects included in the initiative and do not consider the Swiss case. For example, the paper by Benes and Kumhof (2012) is often cited in support of the initiative, but it does not consider the same policy experiment. Moreover, as explained in the “The arguments behind the initiative” section, the model of Benes and Kumhof does not fit the Swiss economy.Footnote 5 Advocates of sovereign money also refer to heterodox views of monetary economics, for example, a literature labeled as Post Keynesian monetary economics or Modern Monetary Theory. However, authors in this literature reject the arguments behind sovereign money reform (e.g., see Fontana and Sawyer, 2016, 2017, and Nersisyan and Wray, 2016). The idea of sovereign money is actually based on a manifesto written by Huber and Robertson (2000), henceforth HR. These two authors do not relate their arguments to the existing literature in monetary economics. Even though the motivation for monetary reform is not totally clear, they provide several arguments behind their proposal, some of which I will review in the next section.Footnote 6 At this stage, it is interesting to notice that the original sovereign money proposal by HR preceded the global financial crisis, so that avoiding crises was not its main motivation. Even though some of the arguments are not fully explicit, there are several hidden assumptions that run counter to our current knowledge in macroeconomics. In particular, a major argument behind the sovereign money proposal is that controlling money allows the stabilization of credit.Footnote 7 This in turn will help stabilize the business cycle. If this is left to commercial banks, HR write: “They expand credit creation in upswings, and reduce it in downswings. The result is that bank-created money positively contributes to overheating and overcooling business cycles, amplifying their peaks and troughs,...(p. 37)”. However, HR provide no evidence for their claim. While their first sentence is correct, there are two fundamental problems with their second sentence. First, there is little empirical evidence that money amplifies business cycles in modern economies. On the contrary, bank deposits tend to decline before financial crises (see Jordá et al., 2017). Second, the link between money and credit is weak. As I discuss below, there is no correlation between changes in money and changes in credit in Switzerland. Looking at developed economies, Schularick and Taylor (2012) show there was a close link between credit and broad money before World War II, but there has been a decoupling after World War II. Schularick and Taylor also discuss the distinction between the “money view” and the “credit view” in macroeconomics. The defenders of sovereign money clearly worry about credit, but they want to control it by controlling money. This perspective is inconsistent with empirical evidence. The arguments in favor of the reform are also often backward looking, citing facts, or reasonings in the nineteenth century or early twentieth century. But the role of money used for transactions has clearly changed in the last decades. It is likely to keep changing in the near future, and the liquidity services of demand deposits will most likely drop.Footnote 8 With a decline in the demand for transaction money, the potential revenue for the central bank, one of the main arguments for reform, would also shrink. The development of new forms of e-money will also require a different analysis. However, at this stage, we ignore what form of e-money will be widely used. An important question is whether central banks will issue e-currency in the future. Here, we need to distinguish between two different cases. First, central banks could offer e-currency directly to non-banks in addition to the existing system. This is the option currently considered by some central banks. It remains to be seen if there would be a demand for such a product.Footnote 9 The second case is where e-currency would replace all sight deposits, i.e., it would be compulsory to use central bank e-money instead of sight deposits at commercial banks. The latter system would be similar to a sovereign money system. As I explain in more details in the “The arguments behind the initiative” section, given our current state of knowledge, it is difficult to see much benefit from the reform. The arguments behind the reform are inconsistent with much empirical evidence and find little theoretical support. It is typically argued that sovereign money could avoid financial crises. But runs on bank deposits are not the main source of recent crises. The initiative is also based on the surprising idea that money is not a liability. I also discuss the issues with this idea in the “The arguments behind the initiative” section. Finally, the “The arguments behind the initiative” section discusses why bank credit is unlikely to be the source of money creation at the macroeconomic level and relates this view to the “mystique of money.” Independently of its motivation, the next question is to assess the potential impact of the reform for the Swiss economy. This is done in the “The impact of sovereign money in Switzerland: stage 1” and “The impact of sovereign money in Switzerland: stage 2” sections. The reform is planned to be implemented in two stages. In the first stage, sight deposits, that are part of M1, disappear from bank liabilities and are deposited at the central bank. But the overall banks’ balance sheets may not be affected as the central bank could lend its reserves back to banks. The first stage of the reform and its impact is examined in the “The impact of sovereign money in Switzerland: stage 1” section. In the second stage of the reform, the central bank no longer lends its reserves to banks. This means that banks need to find alternative sources of financing. It also means that the central bank could use its reserves in different ways. These aspects are reviewed in the “The impact of sovereign money in Switzerland: stage 2” section. The “The impact of sovereign money in Switzerland: stage 1” section examines quantitatively the impact of the reform’s first stage on the state, on banks, and on depositors, using a simple model of monopolistic competition in the banking sector. In the current situation of the Swiss economy, the aggregate impact of the first stage would be negligible because of very low, even negative, interest rates and of a massive level of banks’ reserves at the central bank: in 2017, the proportion of banks’ reserves to deposits in M1 is larger than 90%. To have an assessment in a period of positive interest rates, I consider data for the 1993–2006 period. I find that the overall impact of the reform is negative and annually represents − 0.4% of GDP. First, seigniorage of the central bank increases, while tax payments by banks decline. Consolidating the SNB and the government, the state gains by 0.7% of GDP. However, depositors would be the main losers (1% of GDP) since they no longer receive a return on their sight deposits. Banks would naturally also lose (0.15% of GDP). Results in the “The impact of sovereign money in Switzerland: stage 1” section basically represent the impact of imposing full reserve requirement at zero interest rate. But they do not include the impact of the other dimensions of the sovereign money initiative, which are discussed in the “The impact of sovereign money in Switzerland: stage 2” section. The “The impact of sovereign money in Switzerland: stage 2” section reviews the alternative sources of funding for banks in the second stage of the reform. It points to potential instability with some sources of funding. Then, it reviews the implications of a mismatch between SNB’s assets and liabilities. Finally, it discusses the constraints and the dangers for monetary policy.",2

Haab,Thomas Nitschka,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper examines a recently proposed predictor of the US bond and stock returns in a different country-specific context. Such international assessments help to shed light on the issue of whether conclusions drawn from empirical studies based on US data hold for other economies as well. For example, Cochrane (2008) shows that the US dividend-price ratio predicts US stock market returns but does not forecast dividends. However, international evidence provided by Engsted and Pedersen (2010) or Rangvid et al. (2014) suggests that dividend-price ratios predict dividend growth in various countries. Our paper focuses on an intuitive predictor of asset returns and the state of the economy proposed by Duarte and Kapadia (2017). Changes of large firms’ stock market capitalization relative to the changes in the aggregate stock market capitalization, “Goliath versus David” or GVD, forecast US stock and bond returns as well as macroeconomic variables. To the best of our knowledge, the in-sample and out-of-sample forecast ability for stock returns and bond returns makes it unique among predictors of US asset returns (Duarte and Kapadia 2017; Goyal and Welch 2008). Swiss asset markets provide an ideal “out-of-sample” test case for the predictive power of GVD. Rey (2004) and Nitschka (2014) highlight that the time variation in excess returns on both Swiss stock and Swiss bond markets predominantly reflects cash-flow news, i.e., dividend news in the case of stock market returns and long-term inflation news in the case of government bond returns. In this respect, Swiss stock markets appear to be representative of other European stock markets (Nitschka 2010). By contrast, time variation in the returns on the US stock and bond markets is primarily driven by discount-rate/expected-return news (Campbell 1991; Campbell and Ammer 1993; Campbell and Vuolteenaho 2004). Duarte and Kapadia (2017) highlight that GVD is supposed to capture variation in discount rates. Against this background, it is not clear whether we can expect a Swiss version of GVD to predict returns on Swiss asset markets at all because cash-flow news appear to dominate their variation. Moreover, we have access to data at the individual stock level for all stocks that have ever been electronically traded on the Swiss stock exchange. This information allows us to construct Swiss versions of GVD with data that matches the quality of the US data. To the best of our knowledge, our stock-level data is extraordinarily detailed compared with stock market data of other small, open economies. However, since electronic trading started only at the end of the 1990s, our empirical assessments of return predictability are restricted to the sample period from January 1999 to December 2017. We analyze the predictive power of a Swiss version of GVD for Swiss stock and bond markets. Similar to the US evidence, we find that a Swiss version of GVD forecasts Swiss stock market returns at time horizons of 6 to 12 months in- and out-of-sample. Even though the out-of-sample evidence is by far less pronounced than the in-sample evidence, our findings are qualitatively similar to the US evidence of this variable’s forecast power (Duarte and Kapadia 2017). However, we find that the distinction between the two components of GVD matters for its ability to forecast Swiss stock market returns. This is not the case in the US.Footnote 1 GVDnew (differences in net new equity issuances between large firms and the aggregate market) dominates variation in Swiss GVD. It is this component that exhibits the in-sample predictive power for Swiss stock market returns. GVDold (differences in the returns on existing capital between large firms and the aggregate market) exhibits some forecast ability for Swiss bond market returns, but its predictive power is by far less pronounced than for its US counterpart. Since financial markets are globally intertwined, we additionally evaluate whether the Swiss version of GVD adds additional predictive power for Swiss stock market returns in the presence of global (US) predictors of national stock market returns. Our results suggest that the US dividend yield is the best global predictor of Swiss stock market returns in our sample period. However, the predictive power of the Swiss GVDnew survives in the presence of the US dividend yield. On Swiss bond markets, the US term spread predicts Swiss government bond returns in-sample as well as out-of-sample and thus outperforms the Swiss GVDold. Lastly, we evaluate whether our findings have an impact on one of our motivations to examine a Swiss version of GVD, namely the different characteristics of Swiss and US asset return dynamics, i.e, whether cash-flow or discount-rate news dominate the time variation in asset returns. Our results suggest that the general conclusions from earlier studies (Rey 2004; Nitschka 2014) qualitatively still hold. However, once we additionally take the US dividend yield and the US term spread explicitly into account, we attribute more of the variation in unexpected Swiss stock market returns to discount-rate news than in the earlier studies. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and their sources. Section 3 presents the baseline empirical results. Section 4 assesses the implications of our main findings for decompositions of asset returns into news components. Finally, Section 5 concludes. The Appendix provides additional results and robustness checks.",
155,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,11 September 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-019-0042-6,Confederation debt management since 1970,December 2019,Basil Guggenheim,Mario Meichle,Thomas Nellen,Male,Male,Male,Male,"This paper empirically analyzes the Confederation’s debt management based on new data vintages on marketable debt emissions and total outstanding debt from 1970 on. Debt management is about deciding which debt instruments the government uses to finance itself over time. In so doing, treasuries face the trade-off between the debt servicing cost against potential costs of roll over and interest rate risk. For instance, predominantly issuing short-term debt to reduce servicing costs can increase the level and volatility of tax rates when short-term rates rise. This is associated with deadweight costs of increasing taxation. These risks may partly be hedged issuing longer term maturities next to short-term debt. Switzerland is an interesting case study as the Confederation—despite increasing debt levels in the 1990s—has not accumulated debt levels exceeding 60% of GDP during the analyzed sample period and is considered as one of the most stable political countries with a high degree of central bank independence. Thus, the Confederation’s prime trade-off is indeed between the cost of debt servicing and the costs of roll over and interest rate risk rather than costs related to the Confederation’s default risk. Also, the Confederation has been facing constantly decreasing debt levels since 2006 in response to the introduction of the debt break in 2003, a rather unique feature among developed economies worldwide. Given the sample, we are further able to shed light on the Confederation’s response to the global financial crisis (GCF) and the subsequent low and ultra-low interest rate levels. Additionally, the Confederation’s total debt consists to a substantial and vastly changing degree of non-marketable debt. Going beyond existing literature, we explicitly account for non-marketable debt and how non-marketable debt affects debt management. Similar to the USA, we find that the Swiss Federal Treasury (henceforth the Treasury) increases marketable debt maturity with an increasing marketable debt-to-GDP ratio. Hence, the Treasury hedges actively against roll over and interest rate risk. This is done despite comparatively much lower levels of debt. While we cannot rule out that the positive correlation between increasing maturity and marketable debt-to-GDP levels may be driven to some degree by technical factors,Footnote 1 the qualitative and quantitative evidence provided over a period of 46 years with constant, increasing and decreasing debt-to-GDP levels suggests that the Treasury actively steers roll over and interest rate risk. However, in contrast to the USA, the Confederation does not do so by targeting a specific maturity target. The evidence rather indicates that the Treasury engages in active asymmetric and one-sided interest rate positioning. Interest rate positioning is asymmetric, as the Treasury mostly relies on bonds to influence debt maturity. In other words, the share of short-term debt seems to be less actively used to affect marketable debt maturity. This points to a cash management-driven use of short-term debt. Furthermore, qualitative evidence from the state financial statement (SFS) indicates that the Treasury engages in one-sided interest rate positioning. In other words, the Treasury seems to increase the maturity of bonds only in response to a favorable interest rate environment, but appears not to actively reduce debt maturity when the interest rate environment is unfavorable. This can be interpreted as long-term interest-rate fixing in order to lock-in a favorable interest rate environment to reduce and stabilize the future interest burden. While asymmetric and one-sided interest rate positioning is most visible during the last part of the sample, qualitative and descriptive evidence suggest that this policy has been followed before and was not a mere reaction to the low interest rate environment after the GFC. Most strikingly, despite decreasing debt-to-GDP levels, the Treasury has increased the average maturity of bond before the GFC. To engage in this study, we harvested a new data set on all emissions of marketable Confederation debt from 1970 onwards. These data include zero-coupon instruments (bills and notes) and new emissions, replenishments, and sales of own tranches of bonds. Additionally, we present data on yearly debt composition extracted from the state financial statement (SFS; Staatsrechnung), i.e., the Confederation’s finance and balance sheet report. The latter data are annual and serve to disentangle total debt into marketable and non-marketable debt. Increasing public sector liabilities of the Confederation and changes in debt accounting allowed to fund an increase of total debt in the late 1970s and early 1980s.Footnote 2 This led to a growing non-marketable debt share with peak shares in total debt of over 65%. From the 1990s onwards, the increasing marketable debt share was driven by the strong increase in the total debt level of the Confederation and a shift toward marketable funding sources. Thus when analyzing the Confederation’s debt management, it is important to account for non-marketable debt. The evidence suggests that non-marketable debt plays a negligible role in marketable debt management. In particular, the share of non-marketable debt-to-GDP does not affect the issuing behavior neither in terms of outstanding bond maturity nor the share of short-term debt. This is consistent with the fact that non-marketable debt primarily consists of public sector deposits. These deposits are perceived to behave similar to bank deposits in that they represent an inexpensive and stable source of funding being subject to slow-moving political processes. Also, interest rates on these deposits react similar to bank deposits, slowly rising if facing interest rate increases and quickly falling if facing interest rate increases. Thus, non-marketable debt is prone to considerably lower roll over and interest rate risk than marketable debt. Consequently, we find that the Treasury’s debt management primarily reflects the extent of marketable debt and the prevailing interest rate environment in its issuing of marketable debt. The Treasury’s debt-issuing behavior became more regular and demand-oriented with increasing marketable and total debt levels in the 1990s. Before this, the Treasury’s issuing behavior was more infrequent and largely driven by changing funding requirements depending on budget outcomes or changes in non-marketable funding sources. Exceptions were the more regular emission activities for notes and bills. While notes only slowly ceased after the introduction of bills in 1979, their issuance was rather insignificant and—related to discount-window needs—became demand-driven after 1979. Several changes in the early 1990s marked the move to regular debt management. The possibility of replenishing outstanding bonds by means of a regular auction process was introduced in 1991. In 1993, the Treasury introduced so-called own tranches, i.e., the Treasury sells own tranches directly to one or several investors. These changes coincided with the Treasury serving more and more maturities when issuing new bonds or replenishing existing bonds. Furthermore, the Treasury introduced an emission calendar in 1992, informing investors about auction dates and expected yearly gross and net volumes. While the introduction of replenishments contributed to a more frequent and regular issuing pattern, both the use of direct placements of own tranches and the use of replenishments further indicate the Treasury’s demand orientation. We fill a void in the literature by looking at the Confederation’s debt management from a broad perspective.Footnote 3 The notable other paper on Confederation debt management is Ranaldo and Rossi (2016). They analyze a specific aspect of Swiss debt management, sketching out the history of the Confederation’s debt auctions that started in 1980. They describe how the institutional set-up evolved over time (i.e., bidding requirements, class of bidders, communication, etc.), and they elaborate on why the Confederation chose the uniform-price auction as its preferred type of emission procedure.Footnote 4 Conceptually, our approach is inspired by Greenwood, Hanson, and Stein (2015) who understand optimal debt maturity as a simple tradeoff. On the one hand, due to its liquidity and its safety, government debt is valued above commercial debt. Thus, if the government tilts its issuance to shorter maturities, it faces lower expected financing costs. On the other hand, given that future market conditions are unpredictable, a strategy of short-term financing exposes the government to roll over and interest rate risk. As a number of other papers have noted, these risks may lead to real costs insofar as they could increase the tax level and its volatility.Footnote 5 Methodologically closest to our paper is Garbade and Rutherford (2007), who analyze data on US federal debt, suggesting that the US Treasury actively manages its issuance and repurchases to achieve a target maturity of outstanding debt. Also, similar to Greenwood et al. (2015), we estimate equations that can be interpreted in terms of a partial adjustment model of the maturity of government debt. They find the average maturity of newly issued debt to increase with the debt-to-GDP ratio. Thus the US government gradually adjusts the maturity of its new issuance toward longer-term debt if the debt-to-GDP level increases. Our data harvest newly allows to address related research fields with Swiss data. Renewed interest in a particular aspect of debt management, namely the maturity structure of government debt, was triggered by the large-scale asset purchases in the USA. Taking earlier scholars such as Culbertson (1957), and Modigliani and Sutch (1966) as their starting point, there is a growing literature that documents significant deviations from the predictions made by standard asset-pricing models with regard to the term structure of interest rates. To mention two recent papers, Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2012) find that the liquidity and safety of government debt drive down their yield relative to other assets, while Greenwood and Vayanos (2014) analyze how government debt maturity and the debt-to-GDP ratio influence the term structure of interest rates. The before mentioned branch of literature has more generally renewed interest in the optimal maturity structure of government debt going back to the work of Barro (1979) and Lucas and Stokey (1983) on optimal taxation and debt management over the business cycle. Buera and Nicolini (2004) and Angeletos (2002) represent benchmark specifications in an incomplete market setting with debt of different maturities. These models fail to observe typical treasury behavior that more recent literature tries to replicate by means of restricting the government from going short in any maturity (Lustig, Sleet, and Yeltekin (2008), restricting the government’s ability to commit (Debortoli et al., 2017), tying model closer to observed asset prices (Bhandari et al., 2017), considering the price impact of each issuance of an impatient government (Bigio, Nuño, & Passadore, 2018) and restricting the government ability to rebalance its portfolio (Faraglia et al., 2018). Additionally, the GFC led to a rethinking of the relationship between monetary policy and debt management. Greenwood et al. (2015) propose debt management as a macroprudential instrument. Insofar as there are negative externalities associated with private money creation, the government should tilt its issuance more toward short maturities. Because the government has a comparative advantage relative to the private sector in bearing refinancing risk, the government may crowd out the private sector’s excessive use of short-term debt.Footnote 6 Greenwood, Hanson, Rudolph, and Summers (2014) also analyze how monetary policy at the zero lower bound interacted with government debt management during the financial crisis. While the Federal Reserve System (FRS) tried to reduce long-term debt, the US Treasury tilted its debt management toward long-term debt issuance, partially off-setting the effects targeted by the FRS’s quantitative easing programs. They suggest revising institutional arrangements to promote greater cooperation between the US Treasury and the FRS in setting debt management policy, particularly during times when monetary policy is constrained (for instance by the effective lower bound).Footnote 7 Section 2 presents data on emissions and total outstanding debt. Section 3 is devoted to debt management and issuance behavior. Section 4 discusses the maturity composition of marketable debt and factors that influence it. Section 5 provides an econometric analysis of the issuing behavior of the Treasury. Section 6 concludes.",1

In the context of environmental policy, this may not only include the choice of the primary policy instrument for correcting the environmental externality but also the mechanisms to compensate additional spending (in the case of subsidies for environmentally friendly behavior) or revenue (in the case of taxes on polluting activities) by the government from the primary instrument. The literature on the double dividend (Goulder, 1995) has found that the mechanisms for revenue-redistribution can play an important part in keeping overall costs of pollution taxes low. At the same time, it has been recognized that questions of political feasibility, which depend to a large part on the distribution of policy costs across economic agents, competes with overall efficiency for determining the preferred policy (Bovenberg, 1999). One concern is that if the government taxes the use of greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting fossil fuels, low-income households might pay a disproportionately high share of the policy’s cost (Carattini et al., 2017). Analyses of household expenditures indicate that low-income households spend a larger share of their overall expenditures on energy than do households with a higher income in some cases (this depends on country and fuel that are considered) but not in others (Sterner, 2012; Decoster, 1995). In any case, regressive impacts on the expenditure side can be reversed when taking into account revenue recycling options and impacts of policies not only on consumer prices, but also on income. Rausch et al. (2011) highlight the importance of including effects on income effects using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of the US economy. And several studies in the European context show that revenue recycling has a crucial effect on overall distributional outcome (e.g., Landis and Heindl, 2016; Speck, 1999). With this paper, I contribute to the study of the trade-off between efficiency and equity in designing tax-based climate policy. I couple a CGE model with a micro-simulation of household expenditure which gives household level detail in its impact assessment. Employing a social welfare function that incorporates inequality aversion, I am able to show how equity concerns influence the ranking of policy options. While this framework has been previously applied elsewhere (see Böhringer et al., 2017), this is the first such analysis in the context of Swiss climate policy. I attempt the first comparison of different revenue recycling options within this framework. In the Swiss context, Imhof (2012) and Böhringer and Müller (2014) studied the trade-offs between efficiency and equity in designing tax-based climate policy. Using a CGE model of Switzerland and representing household consumption by 5 income quintiles (Böhringer and Müller, 2014) detect a trade-off between efficiency and equity. If carbon tax revenue is used to reduce income taxes, employment increases, which is efficient on the national level, but most of these benefits go to high-income households. Their analysis does not use a social welfare function that takes equity concerns into account, and it cannot rank policies due to this trade-off. Imhof (2012) uses a CGE model representing household consumption by representative agents corresponding to 10 income deciles of working age households and 4 income quartiles of retired households. He finds a trade-off between equity and efficiency as well and uses different assumptions about the appropriate inequality aversion to calibrate welfare functions. If inequality is an issue, it is the recycling scheme with the highest aggregate cost that should be chosen. When using welfare functions that take equity concerns into account combined with rough aggregates of households, however, variation of income and policy impacts within those aggregates is averaged out. Still, in agreement with Imhof’s study, my results indicate that revenue recycling via per-capita lump-sum transfers is not the most efficient in terms of aggregate productivity but becomes the preferred among the considered choices if equity is of concern. This can be seen as vindication of the current practice of recycling part of the revenue from climate taxation by lump-sum per-capita refunds to personal health insurance bills.Footnote 1 My results highlight the importance of considering disaggregated households rather than household aggregates when analyzing inequality questions. Also, my results show that the design of revenue recycling may be as important as the concrete design of carbon tax policy if inequality aversion is of concern. The outline of the remainder of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, I describe the numerical framework which is used to compare the different policy options. Section 3 describes the policy scenarios that are considered in the analysis. Section 4 presents the results of the numerical analysis, and in Section 5, I summarize the main conclusions and compare them with the actual Swiss policy design.",6

France’s Minister for the Ecology announced plans to ban the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2040 and to implement a feebate system designed to remove such vehicles gradually from the streets. In Norway and Germany, similar schemes could be implemented as early as 2025, while the Netherlands has a target of the year 2030. Amsterdam has recently announced that cars will be banned from the city centre by 2025, in order to reduce air pollution levels. Other cities have similar plans or plan to implement selective road tolls that will discourage polluting cars. The European Commission proposes targets for average CO2 emissions for new passenger cars and vans for 2030 that are 30% below those of 2021, as part of a broader programme of modernization for European transport (European Commission 2016b). Many other countries, such as China, have also announced ambitious quotas for electric vehicles. Even if these are so far only announcements, they place strong pressure on carmakers to reform their vehicle production. Thus, Volvo announces that by 2025 half of the cars it produces and sells will be electric. The replacement of fossil fuel cars by electric vehicles will still require major technical improvements in batteries and their recycling and vast investments in the production and maintenance of cars and in the generation and distribution of electricity (Kannan and Hirschberg 2016). In parallel, innovation in driving technologies, in car ownership and sharing and in the alternatives of public transportation and soft mobility is profoundly reshaping the transportation sector, with strong potential for lowering its CO2 emissions. Compared to these developments, Swiss plans regarding the CO2 emissions in the transport sector look very timid, indeed. They do not deviate from a tradition of leniency towards the automobile sector, which could essentially set itself its targets for fuel efficiency improvement and CO2 emission reduction and compensation. In this paper, we show how transport-related CO2 emissions evolved in the recent past, we estimate their evolution under the existing set of measures implemented or planned with a view to reducing them and we simulate ambitious targets, compatible with deep decarbonization by 2050. In particular, we estimate the welfare cost of preferential treatment granted to the transport sector and compare it to the welfare cost of another form of preferential treatment: the emissions trading system (ETS) for large emitters. The context is given by the deep decarbonization simulations performed in the context of the Swiss Energy Modelling Platform (SEMP) (Landis et al. 2018). The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we review the existing literature on the decarbonization of the transport sector. In Section 3, we detail the existing situation regarding Swiss CO2 emissions from the transport sector, describe Swiss policies already implemented in this sector and evaluate the resulting CO2 savings since 1990. The modelling of the transport sector in GEMINI-E3 is described in Section 4. In this version of the model, we represent electric cars as well as biofuels as substitutes to fossil fuels. In Section 5, we present the results of our simulations with an emphasis on the transport sector. The last section provides a conclusion.",7

Countries involved in the agreement have committed to different short-term targets in the Nationally Determined Contributions to the UNFCC. Now, countries face the challenge of deciding on the stringency of their long-term commitments and the policies through which such commitments would be achieved. In deciding on their mitigation targets and strategies, countries must take macro-economic side effects into account. Such effects include, among others, economic growth, capital intensity, and market structures. In this paper, we investigate possible effects on the Swiss economy of alternative long-term targets and policy settings to reach those targets using a numerical modeling approach. By comparing targets with different stringencies and alternative carbon taxes, we shed light on the additional economic impact—in terms of foregone utility from consumption and structural changes—of increasing the stringency of Swiss commitments to the Paris Agreement and the effectiveness of different policies. Switzerland is an interesting case study since it is a small open economy with ambitious climate change mitigation goals. The Swiss 2050 Energy Strategy aims at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy consumption as well as increasing the use of renewable-based energy sources while also phasing out nuclear power. The long-term goal of the Swiss Federal Council is to reduce GHG emissions to 1–2 tonnes of CO2 per capita in 2050 from around 6 tonnes of CO2 per capita today. Using a Computational General Equilibrium (CGE) model, we analyze the economic effects of meeting two targets consistent with these goals: 1.5 and 1.0 tonnes CO2 per capita for 2050. The Swiss Federal Government is changing its climate and energy policy approach, from subsidies for renewable energy and energy efficiency measures moving towards steering-based policies. By using steering-based policies, the Swiss Federal Government provides consumers and producers with price signals that incentivize them to comply with carbon abatement goals (Swiss Federal Council, 2015a, b). We simulate three alternative steering-based policies that include (1) a uniform carbon tax in the economy, (2) differentiated taxes for the sectors regulated by the emission trading system (ETS) and non-ETS sectors, and (3) further differentiating the non-ETS sectors between heating and transport fuels. From an economic theory perspective, the first policy (a uniform tax) should lead to the lowest costs of achieving the climate target. However, distortions in the economy can explain the need for tax differentiation: international cooperation and spillovers, carbon leakage, tax interaction with pre-existing taxes, and social equity aspects. In the same way, real-world policy proposals hardly ever consider a uniform carbon price on the economy. For instance, a carbon price through a cap on ETS emissions (where the energy-intensive sectors are included) is used in many countries/regions, such as the EU, China, New Zealand, South Korea, some US states, and Quebec. Thus, the second instrument we evaluate in this paper is a differentiated carbon price between ETS and non-ETS sectors, which is in line with EU policies and allows for future harmonization of the EU and Swiss climate policy. Finally, in Switzerland, the carbon tax on transport fuels is lower than that on other fuels. A possible reason for this deviation from the uniform economy-wide tax is the interaction with high pre-existing taxes. High pre-existing taxes on transport fuels mean that Swiss use fewer transport fuels even before introducing more carbon taxes. This implies that some mitigation is already taking place and additional abatement efforts would imply higher costs. Hence, the last carbon policy scheme analyzed in this paper is a further differentiation of non-ETS sectors between heating and transport fuels. We evaluate the impact of differentiating carbon taxes on the efficiency of the policies in terms of economic growth. To conduct our analysis, we use the CITE (Computable Induced Technical change and Energy) model, a multi-sectoral dynamic CGE model of Switzerland with fully endogenous growth (Bretschger et al. 2011; Romer 1990). In the model, purposeful investments in research and development (R&D) increase the number of varieties of intermediate inputs and the stock of knowledge, which supports growth by raising productivity. The CITE model is an appropriate tool to analyze the growth impact of alternative climate policies given its ability to endogenously determine R&D decisions. This feature allows the model to differentiate potentially opposing effects from carbon policies: negative effects on the production of intermediates but also structural changes and increases in R&D labor that sustain research and development, which can boost economic growth. These opportunities, however, are not exploited without modeling knowledge spillovers. Overall, we find that reducing per capita emissions in Switzerland from 2.8 to 1.5 or 1.0 tonnes CO2 per capita—regardless of the policy pathway—implies moderate costs to the economy reflected in a slight reduction in consumption. Nevertheless, these effects are compensated with sectoral shifts and increases in investments that have positive effects on the economy. Moreover, our results show that the choice of policy instrument affects the costs of achieving the climate policies and that differentiating sectors increases mitigation costs. Importantly, we find that the effects of increasing the stringency of the target are independent from the policy instrument. Our simulation results show that reducing emissions, in the text-book case of using an economy-wide uniform tax, implies lower total consumption but positive effects on investments and a relatively unaffected economic output. The yearly growth rate of consumption decreases by −0.21 and −0.28 p.p while that of investment increases by + 0.46 and + 0.55 p.p. (for the 1.5 and 1.0 tCO2 p.c. target, respectively). The larger investment that foster economic output is achieved through the endogenous growth mechanism and changes in the structure of the economy. The sectoral changes follow the interplay of three factors: relative energy intensity of the sectors, substitutability from energy in the production of the intermediate varieties, and the relative attractiveness of research. While the first two effects are present in virtually all CGE models, the third one arises from the endogenous growth and implies larger investments due to shift of labor from manufacturing to research. The economy-wide carbon tax is the most effective option when we consider the effects on utility. Differentiating ETS sectors has relatively low impact while applying lower taxes on transport fuels results in lower utility driven by inefficiencies in the sectoral mitigation efforts. The differences between the two carbon tax alternatives are given by two factors: (1) the changes in carbon price in the differentiated tax—decided a priori in the policy setup—and (2) the importance in terms of emissions of the differentiated sectors. Our paper relates to two strands of the literature and is a part of a major Swiss research project: the Swiss Energy Modelling Platform (SEMP). First, we contribute to papers analyzing the efficiency of tax differentiation, and second, we add to analyses on Swiss climate policy. Several papers have analyzed the efficiency of tax differentiation using theoretical and numerical models, see for instance Hoel (1996), Markusen (1975), Böhringer et al. (2014), Boeters (2014), Landis et al. (2018), and Abrell et al. (2018). This paper complements these analyses by using a numerical model with endogenous growth that represents the positive impacts from climate policies on the economy driven by the endogenously determined R&D. Different studies using numerical models have evaluated the realization of different carbon reduction goals in Switzerland, see for instance Marcucci and Turton (2012); Sceia et al. (2012); Böhringer and Müller (2014); Kannan and Turton (2016); Bretschger and Zhang (2017b); Karydas and Zhang (2017); Landis et al. (2018). This paper is part of the Special Issue of SEMP (Landis et al. 2019). The SEMP exercise aims at giving coherent and complementary answers to the options for reaching Switzerland’s climate policy targets for 2050, by running and comparing several models that use synchronized assumptions and policy scenarios. Our contribution focuses on the macro-economic impacts and other aspects are analyzed in the rest of the Special Issue: distribution effects, the transport sector, and differences across models. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the CITE model and the scenarios that we analyze in the paper, Section 3 presents and discusses the results of the SEMP scenarios, and Section 4 concludes.",2
155,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,25 July 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-019-0034-6,A survey-based estimation of the Swiss franc forward term premium,December 2019,Lucas Marc Fuhrer,Basil Guggenheim,Matthias Jüttner,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Predicting the future path of monetary policy is of great importance for financial market participants. To do so, interest rate futures are widely used by researchers, analysts, and central bankers to infer expectations of future interest rates (see, for instance, Bernanke and Kutner (2005), European Central Bank (2005), and Jordan (2012)).Footnote 1 Literature has shown that differences between interest rate futures and realized rates at maturity of the futures contract, so-called excess returns, are, on average, positive and statistically and economically significant (see, e.g., Piazzesi and Swanson (2008)). Thus, interest rate futures are, on average, higher than effective realizations. Moreover, excess returns can be decomposed into a (forward) term premium and forecast errors (see, e.g., Friedman (1979)).Footnote 2 While forecast errors result from false expectations (i.e., unexpected interest rate changes), the term premium is the markup that market participants are willing to pay to hedge against interest rate risks or to speculate on interest rate movements. Hence, interest rate futures may deviate from interest rate expectations due to the term premium. Findings for major currencies suggest that the predominant part of excess returns result from forecast errors, while the term premium is considerably smaller and also time varying. In this paper, we estimate excess returns in Swiss franc (CHF) interest rate futures and decompose excess returns into its two components, an analysis that has not been undertaken yet. Moreover, we contribute to the literature by shedding light on the key determinants of the term premium. The analysis is of particular interest as interest rate futures are based on the 3-month CHF London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), which serves as the monetary policy target rate for the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Therefore, CHF LIBOR futures are often used as an indicator of market participants’ expectations of SNB’s future monetary policy and its “correct” interpretation is relevant for market participants and policy makers. To empirically identify the term premium we use a model-free approach which employs survey data on interest rates expectations (interest rate survey). Surveys cannot be traded and hence should not be influenced by any term premium. Consequently, the term premium can simply be identified as the difference between interest rate futures and interest rate expectations derived from surveys. This also implies that the term premium is known at any time, whereas forecast errors do only materialize ex-post using effective interest rate realizations. The key findings from our analysis are as follows. First, we show that excess returns in CHF LIBOR futures are, over the last 25 years, on average positive and statistically significant which is in line with the existing literature. Being more concrete, our analysis highlights that LIBOR futures with a maturity date in 3 (12) months contain an average excess return of 12 (63) basis points (bps). Therefore, interest rates implied by CHF LIBOR futures are in the long run significantly higher than realized rates. Second, we find that for CHF LIBOR futures the term premium is, on average, close to zero but time varying, while forecast errors are positive on average. Positive forecast errors result in our sample period as market participants have been surprised by unexpected economic downturns and corresponding interest rate declines. Third, we show that the term premium in CHF LIBOR futures has been persistently negative between 2010 and 2016. Thus, there is evidence that in a period with close to zero or negative interest rates, market participants pay a premium to insure themselves against interest rate cuts. Fourth, we provide empirical evidence that the magnitude of the absolute term premium is affected by interest rate uncertainty. In periods where interest rate uncertainty is high, the absolute term premium (i.e., irrespective whether the term premium is positive or negative) is large. Fifth, we show that the term premium is positively related with the Swiss business cycle. In an economic upturn (downturn) the term premium is positive (negative). Related to this point, we show that the time variation in the term premium is correlated with changes in short-term interest rates. In times of increasing (decreasing) interest rates, the term premium increases (decreases). This may imply that market participants pro-cyclically hedge interest rate risks or speculate on interest rate movements. Our results are relevant in the following ways. First, the fact that the term premium is, on average, close to zero implies that CHF LIBOR futures do not under- or overestimate interest rate expectations, on average. Second, the time variation of the term premium implies that CHF LIBOR futures can significantly deviate from interest rate expectations during certain time periods. Our results show that these deviations increase with interest rate uncertainty and are pro-cyclically related to economic variables. Thus, one conclusion could be that if CHF LIBOR futures are analyzed on a daily basis, they should be adjusted by the estimated term premium to extract interest rate expectations, especially during periods with elevated uncertainty about the future interest rate path. Third, we show that forecast errors are considerably larger for contracts with maturity dates further into the future. Thus, a consequence could be to use interest rate futures and surveys only for the near future (next few quarters). The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the literature. Section 3 describes the institutional details of the LIBOR futures market and the SNB’s monetary policy framework, while Section 4 introduces the notion of excess returns, term premium and forecast errors. Section 5 describes the dataset used and provides descriptive statistics. Section 6 presents the regressions analysis, while Section 7 provides robustness checks and a discussion of potential drawbacks of interest rate surveys. Finally, Section 8 concludes.",
155,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,25 June 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-019-0033-7,Nominal stability over two centuries,December 2019,Daniel Kaufmann,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Nowadays, central banks usually announce to stabilize inflation around a numerical target. No modern central bank currently targets the gold price in domestic currency, or issues a commodity money, despite that economic historians report that metal currency regimes provided a high degree of nominal stability and firmly anchored inflation expectations. On the one hand, metal currency regimes may have fallen out of favor because they limit discretionary stabilization policies in favor of long-term price stability (Bordo and Kydland 1996). On the other hand, recent research for the USA suggests that the price level was less stable and less predictable under the nineteenth century metal currency regimes than under twentieth century fiat currency regimes (see Cogley and Sargent (2015)). In this paper, I assess for Switzerland which monetary regime provided a stable monetary environment over the past two centuries. The quote by Bernanke (2003) highlights that this assessment should consider various macroeconomic indicators. I therefore compile a novel Swiss data set covering four indicators of nominal stability: consumer prices, wholesale prices, a Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflator, and nominal GDP per capita. In order to abstract from short-term fluctuations (over which the central bank has less control) and measurement errors (which would distort the analysis), I extract a permanent trend using an extension of the unobserved component-stochastic volatility (UC-SV) model by Stock and Watson (2007), which has recently been proposed by Chan (2013). The extended model allows for a moderately persistent transitory component with time-varying volatility. This property is particularly important when analyzing historical data with possibly persistent measurement errors. In addition, the time-varying volatility allows for the importance of transitory fluctuations to change over time. This captures that transitory measurement errors and supply shocks were likely more important during the nineteenth century than under modern fiat currency regimes because of the emergence of modern statistics and changes in the consumption basket, respectively. The descriptive analysis of these trends suggests that our current monetary regime, flexible inflation targeting, provided a relatively stable monetary environment. Although the point estimates indicate that trend inflation was also relatively stable during the nineteenth century, the uncertainty associated with these estimates is too large to support this result with much confidence. In addition, I show that the decline in trend inflation since the Bretton Woods System can explain a relevant part of the trend decline in nominal interest rates. This poses new challenges for the conduct of monetary policy because of the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates. The main contribution of this study is to analyze nominal stability on a long historical data set for Switzerland. It is therefore related to studies on the USA and UK that estimate UC-SV models to assess price stability and movements in trend inflation. These studies deal with measurement errors in historical data in several ways. Cogley and Sargent (2015) estimate a univariate UC-SV model on US wholesale price data controlling for persistent measurement error identified from overlapping, methodologically consistent, data sources. Cogley et al. (2015) estimate a model on CPI data for the UK without overlapping data sources; they instead assume that the measurement error variance and persistence changes only when the sources of the historical series differ. Because of data availability, it is not possible to exactly replicate these approaches for Switzerland. Instead, I focus on the permanent component of the nominal indicators after removing a serially correlated transitory component. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section defines seven monetary regimes and provides some historical background to highlight their main characteristics. This sets the stage for the empirical analysis, in which I first describe the data. After presenting the model, I discuss the main results against the backdrop of the historical review. The last section discusses the implications for the conduct of Swiss monetary policy and concludes.",1

Their specific safe-haven status has been documented among others by Fatum and Yamamoto (2016), Auer (2015), De Bock and De Carvalho Filho (2015), Botman et al. (2013) as well as Ranaldo and Söderlind (2010). In times of increased global risk aversion, these are the only currencies that appreciate against all other currencies, including the US dollar (USD). The troubled times experienced by the world economy after the outburst of the subprime crises in August 2007 have brought about further evidence of the safe-haven status of these two currencies. With the intensification of the international crisis, both currencies experienced waves of massive appreciation. The magnitude of the appreciation and its consequences in terms of deflationary pressures and output loss in the face of the zero-lower bound constraint forced monetary authorities in the two countries to adopt unconventional policies to limit the appreciation of their currencies in order to achieve their broader policy goalsFootnote 1. As depicted in Fig. 1, this is reflected in the unique increase in the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and Bank of Japan (BoJ) balance sheets. In this paper, we will summarize the adoption of these unconventional monetary policies under the term regime changeFootnote 2.
 BoJ and SNB: total assets to GDP ratio The safe-haven status of these currencies implies that the demand for CHF and JPY is crucially driven by shocks that raise the general level of uncertainty on the international financial markets. This principle, however, leaves a series of questions open. To which pieces of information do safe-haven currencies really react? Are responses symmetric? How was this link influenced by the crisis? Does a stronger monetary policy focus on the exchange rate modify or even break the link? An abundant literature has investigated the connection between macroeconomic surprises—defined as the difference between the value released and the corresponding market expectation for a given macroeconomic indicator—and asset prices. These studies have shown that unexpected developments in macroeconomic indicators can generate significant and rapid reactions in asset prices. The standard view in this literature is that macroeconomic surprises are perceived by market participants as a change in fundamentals for a given economy. This leads, in turn, to a reassessment of the future monetary policy stance and thus to a repricing of assets. However, macroeconomic surprises can be seen not only just as a source of information that feeds into a revised baseline scenario but also as a factor affecting uncertainty. News reflecting unanticipated economic weakness may spark risk aversion and foster the demand for safe assetsFootnote 3. Conversely, any piece of information that points to stable and balanced international growth may reduce markets’ risk aversion and thus the demand for safe-haven assets. If this is the case, one should expect safe-haven currencies to be particularly sensitive to macroeconomic surprises and crises times to further accentuate this sensitivity. The circle of factors that may influence risk perception is obviously much wider and disparate than standard macroeconomic indicators. The general market environment, as we will call it, may be affected by factors like corporate news or even rumors, economic policy news, political news, and more. The trouble with these potential sources of uncertainty and market volatility is that they are much harder to measure in a systematic way than standard macroeconomic surprises. That is why research traditionally takes an indirect approach: a popular proxy for general market uncertainty and risk aversion is the CBOE VIX index of implied volatility of the S&P 500 index options. In this paper, we rely on the standard VIX measure as well as on a novel index based on Bloomberg wires to capture broad market-environment conditions. Based on a very broad sample of high-frequency data covering the period between January 2000 and December 2013, we study the effect of macroeconomic surprises stemming from ten different economies, the general market environment and the monetary policy regime on the CHF and JPY exchange rates. We show, first, that safe-haven currencies are much more responsive to macroeconomic surprises than other currencies. In our regressions for the JPY and CHF, we obtain R2 that are higher than benchmark results in the literature. The same message emerges when running regressions for a control group of currencies: Australian Dollar (AUD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), and British Pound (GBP) are substantially less sensitive to macroeconomic surprises than CHF and JPY. Second, we find strong evidence that the sensitivity of CHF and JPY to macroeconomic surprises was substantially magnified by the crisis. Third, this observation is resilient to the changes in monetary policy regimes cited above. Fourth, we find some evidence of asymmetries: both currencies tend to display larger reactions when a surprise provokes an appreciation than when it causes a depreciation. Finally, according to our results, swings in the general market environment affect exchange rates on top of standard macroeconomic surprises. Market environment and macroeconomic surprises are thus complementary factors. The Bloomberg-based variable turns out to be strongly correlated with the VIX index. On the one hand, this further legitimizes the use of VIX as a proxy for market-environment conditions. On the other hand, however, our alternative market-environment measure displays various convenient features when compared to the VIX. First, it is not influenced by the macroeconomic surprise variables that we employ. Secondly, it is not bounded at zero and can thus fluctuate in an untruncated manner. In doing so, it captures phases of strongly positive market sentiment better than VIX. Our results do indeed suggest that the Bloomberg-based variable is better positioned than VIX to capture the impact of extreme conditions on safe-haven currencies. This paper is organized as follows. The next section summarizes the lessons learnt from the existing literature. Section 3 describes our dataset and defines our variables. Section 4 sketches our empirical approach and presents the results while Section 5 concludes.",5
155,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,25 March 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-019-0030-x,How can states benefit from the equity premium puzzle? Debt as revenue source for Swiss cantons,December 2019,Ramon Christen,Nils C. Soguel,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper argues that governments can benefit from higher indebtedness. When the price of the borrowed capital falls below the return rate in the capital markets, the government can issue bonds and invest the raised capital on the capital market. These leveraged investments yield a net profit to the government, which is reinforced when taking the equity premium puzzle into account. The equity premium is the discount on the interest rates of public bonds in comparison to other asset classes that remain after deducting the risk premium. Nevertheless, such a practice has its limits, because an ascending debt level amplifies the default risk, leading lenders to ask for higher yields. If the government stretches it out, the costs of borrowing exceed the return rate and the leveraged investments become unprofitable. The combination of a fixed return rate and a dynamic interest rate motivates the main research question treated here. What is the optimal debt level of a government that utilizes available but uncommitted financial assets for leveraged investments in the capital markets? To establish this, one needs to first identify what determines the interest rate of the public debt. The debt level itself is the most salient of these determinants, and taken together, they make it possible to trace an interest rate curve along the debt axis. The interest rate curve then allows one to estimate an interest rate for each debt level (ceteris paribus) and also suffices for estimating the optimal debt level. In the last step, we report profit estimates a government can expect if it follows such a debt optimization strategy. In our model, when the government increases its debt, the interest rate on the debt grows exponentially. Based on our estimates, raising indebtedness by 1000 Swiss francs (CHF) per capita makes the spread between the risk-free rate and the interest rate on the debt (the interest spread henceforth) increase by 5%.Footnote 1 Since the model is non-linear, the absolute values of the interest rate depend on all the other determinants of the debt’s interest rate. On average from 1997 to 2015, the optimal debt level of the Swiss cantons amounted to 17,736 Swiss francs per capita, more than double the mean actual debt of 7027 Swiss francs per capita. If one always set the debt at its optimal level, this would add 4.78% to total cantonal receipts. With more conservative strategies, this would, on average, drop to below 1 %. It is striking that the optimal debt level exceeds the actual debt level by this much, but it results from the temporary high return rates in the capital markets, the relatively inelastic interest rate with respect to debt, and from our assumption of a risk-indifferent government. Yet, doubling the current debt does not yield aberrant values since cantons are in general moderately indebted. Accounting for profitable assets on state balance sheets adds to the existing literature on the sustainability of public debt. The classic public finance literature considers high indebtedness problematic because it carries a risk of falling into the debt trap. Blanchard et al. (1991) consider a fiscal policy to be sustainable over the long run if the debt-to-GDP ratio remained stable. Their model included only gross debt, GDP growth, the interest rate, receipts, and expenditures, and was based on holding the tax rate constant and using an intertemporal budget constraint. In its simplicity, this model neglected two important aspects that affect debt sustainability. First, focusing on gross debt disregards assets. Referring to the same model, Blankart (2017) justifies the preference for the gross over of the net debt by arguing that a government’s assets are usually assumed to be inalienable: subtracting them would present the fiscal situation as better than it actually is. Moreover, asset valuation can vary significantly, which makes it hard to compare. However, both arguments are untenable for assets composed of liquid financial investments (Giammarioli, Nickel, Rother, and Vidal, 2006). Second, excluding assets ignores the revenue they can potentially generate. The literature which focuses specifically on the management of government assets and liabilities does acknowledge the contribution to revenue which spare (uncommitted) funds make. However, these articles tend to treat the returns from uncommitted funds as a welcome byproduct rather than as main objective of asset management. Instead, the asset and liability management literature subordinates the debt level in favor of guaranteeing constant solvency (Das, Lu, Papaioannou, and Petrova, 2013). Bohn (2002) goes one step further in his consideration of strategies a government that holds uncommitted funds could take. One of his proposals argues that “a positive [equity] premium provides an arbitrage opportunity for the government [ …] to earn seigniorage-like profits by issuing debt and investing the proceeds.” While this strategy implies the existence of an optimal debt level, Bohn leaves the question unanswered of how to determine this optimum. To our knowledge, there is no other literature which discusses such asset and liability practices. As a result, our paper links two strands of argument together. The first strand relies on earlier studies estimating the influence of debt on the borrowing cost of a state. The second draws on the literature about the equity premium, meaning the spread between the interest rate on public debt and the return rate from other assets on the capital market (the return spread henceforth). The list of publications estimating the interest rate curve in relation to the debt is long and covers not only different layers of government but also several geographic regions. The first studies dealing with the dependence of public debt on the interest rate focused on the USA. Barth, Iden, and Russek (1984) reviewed some of the early studies that examined this effect at the federal level and replicated them successfully. Later, researchers improved on the models and analyzed other levels of government (Bayoumi, Goldstein, and Woglom, 1995; Capeci, 1994; Poterba and Rueben, 1997). Later on, the geographical scope widened not just to Canada (Booth, Georgopoulos, and Hejazi, 2007; Schuknecht, von Hagen, and Wolswijk, 2009) but have included comparisons of 20 industrialized and developing countries (De Mello, 2001), and emerging market countries (Akitoby and Stratmann, 2008). Later, the work of Manganelli and Wolswijk (2009) and Attinasi, Checherita, and Nickel (2011) offered an overview of the European area. Küttel and Kugler (2002) and Feld, Kalb, Moessinger, and Osterloh (2017) focused on Swiss cantons. In the many national and international studies addressing this question, the debt level has always served as an explanatory variable and, if it is significant, it usually affects the interest rate positively. Most studies have analyzed panel data and began with simple fixed effects estimators. Because of endogeneity and autocorrelation, more sophisticated methods integrating instrumental variables often followed, not least because endogeneity creates a major problem in the econometric estimations. More precisely, whereas Capeci (1994) assumed a reverse causality between the debt level and the interest rate, Bayoumi et al. (1995) looked at factors that simultaneously influence both. The functional form of the interest rate curve has also been intensively discussed, with Baldacci and Kumar (2010) finding some evidence for non-linearities in the relationship. Our research incorporates both concerns. The endogeneity problem is tackled using the system general methods of moments (GMM) estimator (Blundell and Bond, 1998). As regards the functional form of the interest rate curve, we follow Akitoby and Stratmann (2008), who theoretically deduced an exponential link between the interest spread and its determinants. The second strand of literature related to leveraged investment investigates the return spread, whereas the risk-free rate is usually put on a level with long-term government bond yields. The classic financial market theory that accounts for the risk premium and the default premium does not entirely explain the return spread. Apparently, the solution hides within the surprisingly cheap borrowing costs of the government. Put differently, “[t] he equity premium puzzle may not be why was the average equity return so high but rather why was the average risk-free rate so low” (Mehra and Prescott, 1985, p. 158). So either investors are particularly risk-averse and therefore accept a special discount for risk-free bonds, or transaction costs, in the form of credit ratings, disappear in the case of government bonds, as they are considered risk-free anyway. Based on these two explanations, Bohn (1999) examined the conditions under which exploiting the equity premium puzzle is beneficial from a taxpayers’ point of view. However, his understanding of exploiting low-interest rates confined itself to the analysis of generational risk distribution. He did not consider profitable investments. In a later empirical investigation, he found that the equity premium disappears at a certain level of debt. The government should therefore keep its debt level below a certain threshold in order to benefit from generous interest rates (Bohn, 2011). For our purposes, this literature strand justifies the focus on the interest rates of government bonds, as they constitute the origin of the inexplicably large return spread. When it comes to testing the theory, the Swiss cantonal setting, a second layer of government comparable to USA states, is valuable because it enables an empirical test of the theory. In terms of fiscal, economic, demographic, and institutional factors to investigate, the cantons vary considerably. Yet, the cantons are uniform in terms of the definition and measurement of fiscal indicators (Krishnakumar, Martin, and Soguel, 2010). Based on panel data from all 26 cantons over the period from 1980 to 2015, we estimate the interest rate as a function of the debt level. After that, we relate the estimated interest rate with the median performance of the Swiss pension funds which serves as a reference value for the revenue achieved in the capital market (see below). The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 highlights the methods. More precisely, it takes up the theory of the classic debt trap and adds assets together with their revenues to it. The following two subsections are dedicated to the identification strategy and to the declaration of the empirical field; it also contains the data. The subsequent section three presents our estimations of the interest rate curve and the attainable profits. Section 4 concludes the paper.",
155,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,27 February 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-019-0029-3,The Balassa-Samuelson effect reversed: new evidence from OECD countries,December 2019,Matthias Gubler,Christoph Sax,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The Balassa-Samuelson (BS) hypothesis—stated by both Balassa (1964) and Samuelson (1964), with a research precedent in the work of Harrod (1933)—is one of the most widespread explanations for structural deviations from purchasing power parity (PPP)Footnote 1. According to the BS hypothesis, differences in the productivity differential between the non-tradable and the tradable sector lead to differences in price levels between countries when converted to the same currency. The hypothesis assumes that the law of one price for tradable goods holds. Ceteris paribus, a productivity increase in tradables raises factor prices, i.e., wages, which in turn leads to higher prices of non-tradables and thus to an appreciation of the real exchange rate. In contrast, when the relative productivity of non-tradables increases, marginal cost cuts result in a lower price level. The empirical evaluation of the BS hypothesis has gained a great deal of attention. As argued in a survey by Tica and Družić (2006), the major share of the evidence supports the BS model, but the strength of the results depends on the nature of the tests and set of countries analyzedFootnote 2. In particular, cross-sectional studies have been more successful in finding support for the BS hypothesis than panel data studies. There are, however, several studies based on a disaggregation of the tradable and non-tradable sector that find empirical support for the BS hypothesis (see, e.g., Calderón (2004); Choudhri and Khan (2005); Ricci et al. (2013) or Berka et al. (2018)). In particular, since sector-specific data for OECD countries on total factor productivity (TFP) have become available, various studies have tested and confirmed the BS hypothesis using panel data (De Gregorio et al. 1994; De Gregorio and Wolf 1994; Chinn and Johnston 1996; MacDonald and Ricci 2007). All these studies are based on the discontinued International Sectoral Database (ISDB) provided by the OECD. This paper applies two panel cointegration models to estimate the long-run relationship between the real exchange rate and key explanatory variables, focusing on the effect of the TFP differential between tradables and non-tradables. Panel cointegration methods have become increasingly important in testing the BS hypothesis (Tica and Družić 2006). We use a novel OECD data set (PDBi) with annual sector-specific TFP data from 1984 to 2008 to eliminate some of the shortcomings of the ISDB. With this new data set, our estimations cannot confirm the broad-based findings of previous research based on the ISDBFootnote 3. In fact, the results point to a negative relationship between tradable productivity and the real exchange rate for OECD countries. In other words, for the time since the mid-1980s, an increase in the productivity of tradables has given rise to a depreciation of the real exchange rate. This finding is the opposite of what is claimed by the BS hypothesis, but it is in line with the empirical evidence for OECD countries documented by Égert et al. (2006) and Fazio et al. (2007). Our analysis, however, differs from these studies in a number of dimensions, including the estimation methodsFootnote 4, the data set, the sample period, and the set of OECD countries analyzed. Importantly, while these authors find a statistically significant negative relationship between the labor productivity of tradables and the real exchange rate, our analysis also relies on sector-specific TFP, which is the preferred measure for productivity as noted by De Gregorio and Wolf (1994)Footnote 5. However, we can confirm this result when TFP is replaced by labor productivity (LP) using the OECD Structural Analysis (STAN) data set, which covers more countries and a longer time period, from 1970 to 2008. A rigorous analysis reveals that the finding of a negative coefficient on the productivity in the tradable sector for the time since 1984 is robust against the choice of the productivity measure (TFP or LP), the choice of the country sample, the precise start of the sample period, the exact model specification, and the inclusion of additional explanatory variables. Moreover, it seems that the negative effect of tradable productivity on the real exchange rate has strengthened over time. Our analysis further indicates that the choice of the model specifications matters for the finding as to whether the empirical relationship between the productivity of tradables and the real exchange rate is negative or positive for the time period from 1970 to 1992, using the ISDB. So far, the literature has primarily proposed deviations from the law of one price, such as a home bias in consumption preferences, as a possible mechanism for this reversed BS effectFootnote 6. Benigno and Thoenissen (2003) develop a new open economy model in which a TFP shock in the tradable sector weakens the real exchange rate because the effect of the decrease of the price of its traded goods relative to that abroad dominates the effect of the increase of the relative price of non-traded goodsFootnote 7. More recently, Berka et al. (2018) provide a detailed breakdown of the real exchange rate based on a New Keynesian model. In particular, they show that the traded goods real exchange rate depends on three factors: (1) differences in relative non-traded goods prices across countries capturing distribution costs, (2) terms of trade (ToT) capturing home bias in preferences, and (3) deviations from the law of one price as deviations between the foreign price of identical goods relative to the home price. Thus, the authors distinguish between the effects of ToT and the explicit law of one price and assume that the latter holdsFootnote 8. We adopt this assumption because the aggregation level of our data set does not allow us to consider this third factor in the estimations. Berka et al. (2018) then show that relative non-tradable productivity, relative tradable productivity, and ToT drive the overall real exchange rate. Therefore, we use ToT to control for the impact of movements in relative export to import prices on the real exchange rate. However, the inclusion of ToT does not change the significant negative relationship between the productivity of tradables and the real exchange rate. This result suggests that a productivity increase in the tradable sector can lead to a decrease in the relative price of non-traded goodsFootnote 9. Gubler and Sax (2014) provide a static general-equilibrium framework with skill-based technological change (SBTC), in which higher productivity in the tradable sector can lower wages, which in turn leads to lower prices of non-tradables and thus to a depreciation of the real exchange rate. Berka et al. (2018) show that ToT are closely related to the relative unit labor costs (ULC) and propose to replace ToT with unit labor costs because the use of the ToT raises conceptual and empirical difficulties. Therefore, we replace ToT with ULC in a robustness check. The negative relationship between tradable productivity and the real exchange rate remains in force. On the other hand, the connection between non-tradable productivity and the real exchange rate is not robust. Our robustness tests reveal that severe outlier dependency exists for the traditional Balassa-Samuelson finding regarding non-tradables. In particular, Japanese labor productivity in the non-tradable sector strongly weakens the estimated BS effect. For the time period from 1970 to 1992, the coefficient even significantly changes its sign once Japan is included. Finally, with the exception of the terms of trade, our estimation results indicate that the explanatory power of further control variables discussed in the literature is weak or not robust. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data. We outline the methodology in Section 3 and show the results in Section 4. Section 5 concludes.",11

With life expectancies rising, pension and social welfare systems are being strained. In many countries, employer-sponsored defined benefit (DB) pension plans are swiftly giving way to private defined contribution (DC) plans, shifting the responsibility for retirement saving and investing from employers to employees. Individuals have also experienced changes in labor markets. Skills are becoming more critical, leading to divergence in wages between those with a college education, or higher, and those with lower levels of education. Simultaneously, financial markets are rapidly changing, with developments in technology and new and more complex financial products. From student loans to mortgages, credit cards, mutual funds, and annuities, the range of financial products people have to choose from is very different from what it was in the past, and decisions relating to these financial products have implications for individual well-being. Moreover, the exponential growth in financial technology (fintech) is revolutionizing the way people make payments, decide about their financial investments, and seek financial advice. In this context, it is important to understand how financially knowledgeable people are and to what extent their knowledge of finance affects their financial decision-making. An essential indicator of people’s ability to make financial decisions is their level of financial literacy. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) aptly defines financial literacy as not only the knowledge and understanding of financial concepts and risks but also the skills, motivation, and confidence to apply such knowledge and understanding in order to make effective decisions across a range of financial contexts, to improve the financial well-being of individuals and society, and to enable participation in economic life. Thus, financial literacy refers to both knowledge and financial behavior, and this paper will analyze research on both topics. As I describe in more detail below, findings around the world are sobering. Financial literacy is low even in advanced economies with well-developed financial markets. On average, about one third of the global population has familiarity with the basic concepts that underlie everyday financial decisions (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2011c). The average hides gaping vulnerabilities of certain population subgroups and even lower knowledge of specific financial topics. Furthermore, there is evidence of a lack of confidence, particularly among women, and this has implications for how people approach and make financial decisions. In the following sections, I describe how we measure financial literacy, the levels of literacy we find around the world, the implications of those findings for financial decision-making, and how we can improve financial literacy.",185

Different surveys (e.g. the Household Finance and Consumption Surveys HFCS, the Survey on Aging and Living Conditions SHARE, or the Luxemburg Wealth Study) have started to collect microdata on wealth. However, most wealth estimates neglect pension wealth that—for most individuals—presents the largest asset. There are many reasons to consider pension entitlements in wealth analysis. First, the inclusion of pension wealth has profound consequences on the wealth distribution. Second, pension rights are important for the comparison of wealth between countries. According to the standard life-cycle hypothesis, expected pension benefits and private wealth are substitutes (Feldstein, 1974). If pension wealth crowds out private saving, countries with more generous pension schemes should have lower private savings than countries with more limited pension schemes. Third, the omission of pension wealth might result in misleading comparison of wealth between covered and non-covered groups within a country (e.g. wealth differences between employed and self-employed). Fourth, pension wealth has been shown to influence many behaviours and decisions, such as private savings, composition of wealth portfolios or retirement timing. When ignoring pension wealth, studies on these behaviours could yield biased results. Finally, a better knowledge on the inequality of pension wealth can be policy relevant. At the same time, pension entitlements differ from other assets in several respects: they cannot alleviate income poverty, be used to purchase consumer goods, or be passed on to others. Accordingly, pension entitlements do not confer political power, social influence, or social status. Furthermore, individuals have little control over how their pension assets are invested and restrictions often apply for bequests. Finally, the tax system and welfare state treat pension wealth differently from other assets. A further difference occurs for pay-as-you go systems, where entitlements are not funded. There is no agreement on how to deal with pension wealth in analysis on wealth inequality. Some scholars argue for ignoring pension wealth, as it does not give “direct personal control over resources” (Alvaredo, Atkinson and Morelli, 2018). The most widely used wealth definition based on microdata is net worth, which refers to the “value of all the assets owned by a household less the value of all its liabilities at a particular point in time” (OECD, 2013, p. 54). Net worth includes private pensions, but not occupational and statutory ones. The term “augmented wealth” refers to the broader definition of wealth that includes entitlements to future pension streams (Davies and Shorrocks, 2000). Organisations such as the OECD suggest using augmented wealth as a measure complementary to net worth (OECD, 2013, p. 67ff). While these definitions are standards in the micro-approach to wealth analyses (see e.g. Wolff, 2015; Cowell, Nolan, Olivera and Van Kerm, 2017, p. 177), they differ from the macro-economic definition of wealth in the core tables in the System of National Accounts (SNA), which includes only funded pension wealth. However, unfunded pension wealth is included in supplementary data of the SNA to facilitate country comparisons (System of National Accounts, 2008, p. 369ff.). Attempts at distributional national accounts, such as the World Inequality Database (WID), usually follow the wealth definition in the core tables of the SNA, which include only funded pension wealth. Apart from theoretical considerations, data availability and data comparability often dictate the wealth definition used in empirical studies. This study documents the relevance and the distribution of pension wealth in Switzerland and shows how it affects wealth inequality. The analysis is based on a new linkage of administrative and survey data with a matching rate of over 99% of the sample. Survey data come from the CH-SILC in 2015, which contains separate questions on various real and financial assets including private pension accounts. Administrative records are used to estimate entitlements for social security and occupational pensions for non-retired individuals at the basis of yearly incomes since 1981. While the linked data allows a rather precise estimation of statutory pension wealth, the simulation for occupational pension wealth relies on many assumptions. Following the OECD guidelines for Micro Statistics on Household Wealth (OECD, 2013), I apply the accrual method to estimate the present values of pension wealth under the current pension system. For social security pensions and ongoing second-pillar pensions, I estimate the future pension stream on cohort- and gender-specific survival rates assuming a real discount rate of 2%. For the occupational pension, I estimate the accumulated capital, which is influenced neither by life expectancy nor by retirement age. Several important findings come out of my analysis. In line with experiences from other countries, pension wealth is highly relevant and has an equalising effect on wealth inequality. Twenty-eight percent of augmented wealth consists of entitlements for social security pensions, and another 23% consists of entitlements for occupational pensions. Although the Gini coefficient of net worth amounts to 0.76, it decreases to 0.65 when adding occupational pensions and to 0.55 for augmented wealth. Moreover, there are important wealth differences between men and women and between age groups. In contrast to findings of other countries, wealth accumulation over the life span continues beyond retirement age. The methodological approach followed has the advantage of making results comparable to estimates for Germany and the USA by Bönke, Grabka, Schröder and Wolff (2019) but comes with some limitations. Firstly, it ignores the heterogeneity in life expectancy by socio-economic groups, which applies also in Switzerland (e.g. Mackenbach et al., 2019; Wanner and Lerch, 2012). As high-income groups live longer compared to low-income groups, they will receive benefits for a longer time and limit the equalising effect of pensions (Haan, Kemptner and Lüthen, 2019). Secondly, the accrual method does not take account of future pension reforms but assesses the situation in 2015. Due to both effects, the redistributive effect of pension wealth will be weaker in reality. The impact of increasing pension age on wealth inequality is simulated as a sensitivity analysis, which shows a small desequalising effect of such reforms. While analysis of augmented wealth is common in the USA and UK, there have been only a few attempts to measure the distribution of augmented wealth in Europe (Roine and Waldenström, 2009 for Sweden; Maunu, 2010 for Finland; Bönke, Grabka, Schröder, Wolff and Zyska, 2019 for Germany). All studies reveal a mitigating effect of pension assets on wealth inequality. To my knowledge, there have been no attempts so far to empirically measure augmented wealth in Switzerland. This country presents an interesting case, as it has a very high wealth concentration at the top but a rather average wealth inequality when measured with the Gini index. Moreover, the share of private occupational pensions is (with 31% of post-retirement disposable income) among the highest in OECD countries (OECD, 2019). A simulation for top wealth shares was conducted by Föllmi and Martínez (2017) based on two simplified scenarios for occupational and private pension wealth but not social security pensions. Assuming an equal distribution of pension assets, the simulation showed that the wealth share of the top 10% of the population would decrease by 27 percentage points. Assuming that shares in pension wealth would correspond to share in labour income, the top 10% wealth share was lowered by 20 percentage points. The individual data used in my study show a slightly weaker reduction in inequality because occupational pensions are more unequally distributed than labour income and because pension wealth and other assets are positively correlated. A related body of literature addresses the effect of pension entitlements on savings. According to the life cycle hypothesis, individuals save during their working lives and commence with dissaving after retirement (Modigliani, 1986). Accordingly, a change in the expected pension benefits should alter private wealth by the same amount (Feldstein, 1974). Although empirical studies find evidence for such crowding out, the rate is considerably lower than one (e.g. Attanasio and Brugiavini, 2003; Bottazzi, Jappelli and Padula, 2006; Chetty, Friedman, Leth-Petersen, Nielsen and Olsen, 2014; Feng, He and Sato, 2011). Explanations for the limited substitution include bequest motives, short-sightedness, liquidity constraints, risk associated with future reforms, individual information and non-marketable future benefits (Bottazzi et al., 2006, p. 2188). This paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, I briefly present the pension system in Switzerland and review literature on wealth inequality in Switzerland. Section 3 describes the data and methodological approaches used. Section 4 documents the estimation of pension wealth. Results are discussed in Section 5; Section 6 discusses pension reforms and provides sensitivity analysis for the impact of widowhood pensions, different discount rates and increasing retirement age; and Section 7 concludes.",10

Despite large advances in women’s educational attainment and labor market attachment, there is still a striking divergence in earnings’ paths of women and men following the birth of a child. Kleven et al. (2019) show that women’s earnings decrease by 30% (Denmark) to 80% (Germany) after the birth of the first child and remain 20% respectively 60% below their counterfactual income 10 years after the birth of their first child. Men’s incomes, on the other hand, remain largely unaffected by the birth of a childFootnote 1. Parental leave and public childcare decrease the costs for parents to remain attached to the labor market and have been seen as the most important instruments in allowing parents to reconcile work and family responsibilitiesFootnote 2. Recent evidence suggests that gender attitudes are an important factor in explaining the large differences in the decrease in female earnings across countries following the birth of a child (Kleven et al. 2019): Female earnings’ decreases following the birth of a first child are smaller in countries with more positive attitudes towards working mothers. Given these findings, it is crucial to understand the formation of gender attitudes and to disentangle the inherent endogeneity between gender attitudes and institutions facilitating maternal employment. This paper offers an empirical analysis of whether childcare institutions affect political attitudes towards policies facilitating the conciliation of work and family responsibilities. It benefits from a quasi-experimental setting in Switzerland, which creates discontinuity in regulations and in the actual provision of lunchtime and after-school care and thus allows for the application of a differences-in-differences strategy. It also benefits from federal ballots on family policy related topics revealing voters’ preferences. In 2010, the cantons of Bern and Zurich introduced a new regulation requiring municipalities to assess the demand for childcare for school children each year and to introduce lunchtime and after-school care in case of sufficient demand. Using municipalities in neighboring cantons as a control group allows me to apply a differences-in-differences design to estimate the effect of this new regulation on individuals’ attitudes. The regulation additionally creates interesting variation within cantons, which allows me to study the effect of the actual provision of lunchtime and after-school care on individuals’ attitudes towards working mothers: The regulation clearly states that if ten or more children are signed up for lunchtime and after-school care, the municipality is obligated to introduce these facilities. There are thus some municipalities which are required to introduce lunchtime and after-school care as a consequence of the new regulation, while others are not. I also exploit this feature for the analysis within the same differences-in-differences estimation. The variation within and across cantons allows me to isolate the effect of the introduction of lunchtime and after-school care from the effect of the public costs arising from the expansion of childcare facilities. The total public costs of lunchtime and after-school care are borne by all municipalities within the cantons with regulation, and not only municipalities which introduce lunchtime and after-school care. Estimating the two treatment margins, the provision margin and the regulation margin, isolates the two effects. The cost effect is estimated by comparing municipalities within the treated cantons but without provision to municipalities in the untreated cantons. The provision effect estimates the change in voter support in municipalities with and without provision but within the cantons with regulation. This empirical approach relies on parallel trends of all three types of municipalities: municipalities with no regulation and no provision, municipalities with regulation but no provision, and municipalities with regulation and provision. These identifying assumptions are discussed in more detail in Section 3 and challenged drawing upon vote results of bills voted upon on the same day as family policy related bills and individual level post-vote survey data on family policy related bills. Furthermore, drawing on a large number of ballots on healthcare-related topics voted upon in the same time period considered for the main analysis allows me to show that the three groups of municipalities, municipalities in cantons with no regulation, municipalities in cantons with regulation and no provision, and municipalities in cantons with regulation and provision, do not generally show diverging trends, thus affirming my identifying assumptions. I find that the introduction of lunchtime and after-school care increases support for policies promoting maternal employment by up to 3 percentage points compared to support in municipalities with no provision of lunchtime and after-school care but otherwise within the same institutional framework. Furthermore, I find a larger effect in municipalities where public costs of the new facilities are low. Controlling for the actual provision allows for an estimation of the pure cost effect, hereafter termed regulation effect. I find a negative effect of the regulation, with support of public policies promoting maternal employment decreasing by up to 10 percentage points. This is in line with the finding that the increase in support is larger when costs are lower. While I cannot fully reject the hypothesis that the positive shift in political attitudes is purely driven by parents directly benefitting from such policies, this seems unlikely to be the case. I put forward suggestive evidence showing that the change in approval rates of parents in the treated cantons does not differ from changes in approval rates of the remaining population, and that the change in approval rates is driven by a change in preferences for policies promoting gender equality. This paper contributes to the literature focusing on the impact of institutions on gender attitudes and expands on it by focusing on the very short-term effect of childcare institutions on vote outcomes reflecting gender attitudes. Slotwinski and Stutzer (2018) show that the introduction of female suffrage leads to substantial changes in individuals’ norms and outcomes even in the medium term. Exploiting the German separation and later reunification, Bauernschuster and Rainer (2012) show that individuals exposed to East German institutions promoting female employment hold more equal gender attitudes than West Germans after reunification. Unterhofer and Wrohlich (2017) study a parental leave reform in Germany in 2007, which introduced the option for fathers to take part of the parental leave, and its effect on grandparents’ attitudes. They find that mothers of exposed fathers have significantly more positive attitudes towards working mothers but find no effect for fathers. Their study shows that there is a short term effect of institutions on attitudes of individuals in the immediate environment and in the very short term. This study is further related to a paper by Felfe et al. (2016), who also exploit the introduction of the same regulation and its effect on parents’ employment. However, they only have cross sectional data on childcare provision and employ an IV strategy using the regulation I exploit as an instrument. They find that the introduction of lunchtime and after-school care increases maternal full-time employment, with no effect on fathers and no change in participation rates. I apply a different empirical design since I have to control for level differences between the treated and control groups, which they cannot do in their setting. The rest of the paper has the following structure. The next section provides information on the institutional background serving as a backdrop to this analysis and demonstrates how vote outcomes are an interesting approach to measuring attitudes. Section 3 contains the main theoretical considerations and the empirical identification strategy. Section 4 presents the data, some descriptive statistics, and graphical depiction of preliminary results. Section 5 presents the empirical results. Section 6 discusses the costs of public institutions as a potential mechanism driving the results and presents some robustness analyses. Section 7 concludes.",1

Non-essential shops, restaurants, entertainment venues, schools, nurseries and universities were closed, and non-essential workers were asked to stay at home and work from there if possible. The lockdown was gradually relaxed after 27 April, with most restrictions lifted by 8 June. For many businesses, the pandemic meant a dramatic or even complete loss of turnover. Recent research shows that overall spending would have been severely reduced even in the absence of a decreed lockdown, because of consumers’ fear of infection and because of a collapse in export demandFootnote 1. It is estimated that total demand fell by more than 30% during the Swiss lockdown, and GDP is projected to contract by more than 5% over the whole yearFootnote 2. Demand will likely remain subdued at least in certain sectors for as long as social distancing is warranted and foreign markets are depressed. This state of affairs could potentially take several years until a vaccine or an effective cure is found. The combination of a time-limited forced shutdown of large parts of the economy followed by a potentially long lasting drag on contact-intensive activities presents economic policy-makers with monumental challenges. The main goals in the initial lockdown period were to avoid excessive income losses by workers in affected sectors and to avoid damage to the productive structure of the economy through large-scale layoffs and bankruptcies. Switzerland has been widely credited for meeting these aims successfully, through three essential policy tools: wage compensation for furloughed employees (short-term work, “Kurzarbeit”), income support for independent workers and small-business owners, and state-backed loans to cover businesses’ liquidity needs (corona loans). Rapid and un-bureaucratic intervention was possible thanks to Switzerland’s exceptionally healthy public finances, the prior existence of some of the relevant policy tools, a functioning banking sector, and a consensual, inclusive system of government. In this paper, we shed light on the effectiveness of these tools in the early phase of the lockdown. To this end, we analyse data from a survey of 1011 independent workers and small- and medium-size firms conducted in mid-April 2020. From this experience, we derive some implications for how economic policy measures could be adapted if the virus were to continue to constrain contact-intensive economic activities or even necessitate further lockdowns.",18

COVID-19 and related lockdown measures contributed to a substantial drop in such “retail payments.” Even before major lockdown, measures were lifted, retail payments started to rebound quickly, and soon rose far above pre-lockdown levels. We further provide evidence that regional shifts occurred in retail card payments across areas with different levels of urbanization and across the 26 Swiss cantons. Regional shifts exceed aggregate effects and have remained elevated despite two rounds of lockdown easing and the subsequent general increase in retail card payments. While aggregate effects are noteworthy and in need of explanation, documented regional shifts hint at structural changes that were accelerated by the outbreak of COVID-19. If regional shifts are here to stay, the economy may face multifaceted effects long after COVID-19 restrictions have ended. To mention just one potential impact, regional shifts may affect the rent and real estate value of retail locations. This raises two questions. First, which sources have contributed to the documented effects, and in particular to the regional shifts? Secondly, are these sources likely to be associated with permanent shifts in retail payments, or will they instead be temporary? We find direct evidence of shifts being associated with a canton’s dependence on “tourism and business travel” (as measured by payments made with cards issued by foreign financial intermediaries) and with its economy’s “e-commerce” intensity (as measured by cantonal card-not-present payments, i.e., payments at terminals that are associated with e-commerce). Payments made with foreign-issued cards (foreign cards) relate positively to these shifts, i.e., lost card payments from foreign tourists and business travelers increase these shifts. Similarly, card-not-present payments increase such shifts, because the retail sectors of cantons diverge in their e-commerce intensity. We further provide evidence of sources that we cannot trace directly in the card payment data set, but indirectly through the correlation of proxies with card payments. These sources are the following. First, we consider infection fear, as proxied by a canton’s exposure to COVID-19 infections; second, the retail sector’s exposure to lockdown measures, as measured by the sectoral lockdown index; third, the intensity of “shopping tourism,” as proxied by two novel indices, namely annual shopping tourism frequency and shopping tourism accessibility; forth, the feasibility of working at home, as proxied by the home office index; and fifth, cash substitution as measured by a novel indicator for cash usage, namely the share of cash withdrawals in payments at the point of sale (POS). Shopping tourism’s effect on shifts is ambiguous. All other sources exacerbate shifts. Three sources might dissolve rather quickly, assuming a second COVID-19 wave is prevented in Switzerland and neighboring countries. Infection fear might ease and people will move back to normal shopping habits to the extent that is feasible. As lockdown measures are eased further, and as people adapt to the new social distancing and hygiene rules, the effects of lockdown measures will at least be substantially reduced. Similarly, shopping tourism has come almost to a complete halt but is expected to recover quickly once borders are open again. Other sources will continue to contribute partly or fully to these shifts. It remains open as to whether or not tourism and business travel will reach pre-COVID-19 levels, and if so, what the time horizon for this might be. The remaining sources tend to represent secular trends that have been on the radar of the retail sector for some time. We argue that the COVID-19 lockdown has allowed us a glimpse into the crystal ball, offering a natural experiment for what the effects of these trends might look like in the future. Moreover, COVID-19 might prove a catalyst for these trends, making the future arrive faster than anticipated. Shifts related to these sources might thus decrease as life goes back to normal, but are unlikely to be reversed completely. In particular, we expect e-commerce to keep some of the market share gained during the lockdown and to continue its pre-existing growth path from this elevated level (Christen, Fuhrer, Hotz, & Jucker, 2020). After the experiences gained during the lockdown, work from home is also expected to gain traction. COVID-19-related survey evidence is compatible with the perception that the share of hours spent working at home will increase substantially beyond pre-COVID-19 levels (gfs.bern, 2020). Both Swiss employees and employers perceive working from home as beneficial and are willing to increase its share (Rütti, 2020). Cash payments make it difficult to translate card payments directly into turnover or consumption. Changes in cash usage exacerbate this problem. While cash substitution in Switzerland was a comparatively slow process before COVID-19 (SNB, 2018), the outbreak of COVID-19 may prove a catalyst towards a more frequent use of non-cash payment instruments in the future. As statistics on cash usage are scarce, we build a new proxy for cash usage (the share of domestic cash withdrawals in payments at the POS). Our proxy indicates an aggregate decline in cash usage. This drop partially reflects growth in card payments. Cash usage also differs among cantons and exacerbates card payment shifts. The SNB’s upcoming Survey on Payment Methods in 2020 will be able to answer the question as to whether a substitution was a transitory effect, or whether COVID-19 has induced a more permanent switch to non-cash payment instruments. We provide aggregate and regional evidence from a new database on card transactions. We do so based on more than 1.3 billion debit and credit card transactions. Transaction level data are collected from the largest acquirer in Switzerland, which has an approximate share of two thirds in the acquiring business. Acquirer data implies that the perspective of Swiss merchants is taken. We focus on the retail sector, as card transactions in other sectors essentially came to a halt during the COVID-19-related lockdown period from mid-March to the end of April 2020. Other sectors further remained subdued during the two phases of lockdown easing, until the end of May 2020, which also forms the end of our sample. From a policy perspective, our paper provides an initial insight into the potential of card payment data. On the one hand, data allow us to track the economy in real time on the basis of effective transactions rather than indirect indicators such as Internet searches. On the other hand, these data can also be used to study structural forces that shape the economy. Our analysis thus underscores the usefulness of real-time payment data to inform policymakers. Section 2 describes the card payment data, the proxy indicators, and the descriptive methodologies applied. Section 3 illustrates the aggregate effects of the lockdown, further breaking down aggregate effects into sectoral effects. Section 4 provides evidence on regional shifts in card payments across different degrees of urbanization and across cantons. Section 5 discusses sources of retail payment shifts that can be traced in the data directly. Section 6 provides indirect evidence on sources of shifts that cannot be directly traced in the data. Section 7 discusses the results in light of the literature and briefly reflects on the potential of card payment data.",17

The measures implemented by the Swiss Federal Council—including lock-downs, mobility restrictions, and social-distancing rules—have greatly affected consumer expenditure patterns. Non-essential retail outlets and many service industries such as restaurants and bars as well as entertainment and leisure facilities were temporarily closed. Public transport services were reduced. Only grocery stores, pharmacies, banks, and post offices were allowed to remain open (Eichenauer and Sturm 2020). During the roughly 2-month1 lock-down period, the consumer spending was thus severely restricted. Sudden and profound changes like these can introduce significant bias in the consumer price index (CPI) used to measure inflation. The CPI is compiled on the basis of expenditure weights that are kept constant within a given year, reflecting the purpose of the index to measure changes in prices only without accounting for adjustments in consumption patterns. Most national statistical offices update their CPI expenditure weights once a year, often with lagged expenditure dataFootnote 1. While this practice is reasonable in normal times, it makes inflation indices much harder to interpret during the COVID-19 pandemic (Tenreyro 2020; Lane 2020), as the underlying weighting scheme is no longer representative of what is being consumed or what can be consumed at all in the lock-down period, thus introducing a weighting biasFootnote 2 in inflation. In this paper, I study the effect that biases induced by such changes in spending patterns have on the measurement of inflation in Switzerland during the COVID-19 crisis. For this purpose, I use high-frequency estimates of spending based on transactional data to update CPI basket weights and compute an alternative price index based on such “COVID weights.” I find that inflation was higher during the lock-down than suggested by CPI inflation. The annual inflation rate of the COVID price index was −0.4% by April 2020, compared to −1.1% of the equivalent CPI. This is a consequence of the relative increase in consumption of “food & non-alcoholic beverages,” which are more inflationary than other spending categories. Moreover, a persistent change in consumer behavior—driven by “low-touch” considerations due to new working habits, prolonged uncertainty, and the lifestyle adopted during the lock-down period—is likely to keep underestimating short- to medium-term inflation. The inflation forecast based on an alternative “low-touch” consumption basket is over a quarter of a percentage point higher than a comparable CPI forecast for the rest of 2020. This study is closely related to two current research trends. First, it contributes to the rapidly growing literature making use of alternative and high-frequency data sources to track consumer expenditure. In the rapidly evolving COVID-19 crisis, there is a great need for reliable data that is available in almost real-time. Official economic statistics, however, are usually published with a considerable lag. This has led many researchers to explore alternative and high-frequency data sources to track the pandemic and its effects. Transactions’ data from banks and other financial institutions have proved to be particularly fruitful sources and were used for the analysis of consumer spending, among others, by Baker et al. (2020) and Chetty et al. (2020) (for the USA), Chen et al. (2020) (for China), Andersen et al. (2020) (for Denmark), Bounie et al. (2020) (for France), Carvalho et al. (2020) (for Spain), and Hacioglu et al. (2020) (for the UK). Second and more specifically, it contributes to studies of inflation and potential biases of it during the COVID-19 crisis. My results are consistent with the analytical argument of (Diewert and Fox 2020) who show that a downward bias in consumer price indices may result from current calculation methodologies. Using scanner data of fast-moving consumer goods in the UK, (Jaravel and O’Connell 2020) empirically document a spike in inflation in the first month of lock-down. Using official price indices and updating CPI weights in a similar way to this study, (Cavallo 2020) finds comparable results for the USA but overall mixed international evidence. In light of the fact that the CPI is an essential tool for economic policy making, my results have important implications for the crisis period and beyond. They provide evidence that conventional price measures have underestimated inflation during the crisis. By unveiling this, I hope that my results contribute to the assessment of inflation in times of economic turmoil. Beyond, they raise conceptual issues concerning adequate price measurement. While most of the changes in prices and consumption expenditure can be expected to reverse once the crisis is over, some of them may be more persistent. Considering current calculation methodologies, this can make official CPI measures less informative, in particular during the transition period. In response to this challenge, the use of high-frequency and alternative data sources on both prices and consumer spending may become key to producing a more robust and informative consumer price index in the future. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, I describe how I measure changes in consumer spending, update CPI weights, and construct the alternative COVID price index. Section 3 estimates the effects of the COVID-induced weighting bias on Swiss consumer price index. Section 4 assesses how a lasting “low-touch” consumer behavior will affect inflation in the short to medium term. Section 5 concludes.",23

For individuals, the lockdown mandated by the Swiss Federal Government on March 13 turned out less restrictive than in neighboring countries like France, Italy, and Austria, where people had to stay home and needed a permit to move. Nevertheless, economically and socially the imposed restrictions had a huge impact. A large share of the service sector, all personal services with physical contact, tourism, and all recreational and cultural businesses were shut down. Without cash injections, the restrictions would have lead to business insolvencies and mass unemployment. To counteract the disruptive effects, the Federal Government in cooperation with Swiss banks installed a state-guaranteed loan scheme to provide enterprises with lifeline liquidity. Besides, a series of measures eased administrative procedures to apply for and obtain short-time work benefits and extended the group of workers eligibleFootnote 1. For example, the number of days in advance of the start of short-time work that employers have to apply (ten days) and the waiting period, i.e., the number of days in each settlement period that the employer has to cover short-time work benefits (two for the first six and three for following periods), were reduced to zero. The group of newly eligible workers included among others apprentices, persons employed on an hourly basis, and self-employed as well as employed managing staff. Particularly, no waiting time between the announcement, the start of short-time work, and the flow of benefits provided companies efficiently with emergency liquidityFootnote 2. The seismic effects of the lockdown and the unbureaucratic procedure lead to a record-high, unprecedented increase in pre-registered short-time workers. In February 2020, roughly 11,000 persons were pre-registered for short-time work, a number slightly above the historical average of around 9000 (taking into consideration the high volatility in the series). In March, the number increased to above 1.6 million and reached more than 1.9 million in April. This corresponds to nearly 37% of employees. The incredible evolution is plotted in Fig. 1 on a logarithmic scale. This increase dwarfs the increase observed after the outbreak of the financial crisis at the end of 2008.

In real-time, the number of pre-registered short-time workers is available more immediately and at a higher frequency than a first estimate of quarterly GDP. Therefore, we will evaluate the information content of the number of registered short-time workers for GDP growth and form a first expectation for GDP prospects over the next one and a half years. The approach is simple and in the spirit of Romer and Romer (1989, 2004). In a first step, we extract unexplained variation or shocks in the log number of short-time workers. These shocks are included in an equation modeling GDP growth, and conditional on shocks observed ahead of GDP releases, we produce a forecast of GDP growth. There is no horse race in the paper, as the model is not intended to outperform other, more sophisticated forecasting models. Rather, the approach intends to illustrate that unusual indicators are useful to explore during periods of crisis, also to inform models built and specified during normal periods. The approach is Bayesian. Sequential updating will allow us to evaluate whether the number of registered short-time workers will stay informative as imposed measures will be abolished gradually in the course of the year. The next section presents the data and introduces the econometric approach. Section 3 discusses the results. Section 4 concludes and provides an outlook.",3

The recovery since the end of April has progressed at a very high pace compared to normal recoveries. Most macroeconomic indicators, such as business tendency surveys or consumer sentiment indices, failed to keep track of the sudden down and up, since they are sampled at a monthly frequency and published with delay. As a consequence, there was a need to collect and publish new daily or weekly data series, such as credit card transactions or traffic volumes, with the aim to monitor economic and social activity closer to real time. However, a challenge is that these higher frequency series often cover only specific aspects of economic or social activity. In addition, most of the series fluctuate strongly, move partly idiosyncratically and often have (multiple) strong seasonal patterns. It is thus very difficult to infer the state of economic or social activity from the real-time inspection of the individual noisy series. To overcome these challenges, shortly after the start of the Corona crisis, we started collecting a diverse set of daily and weekly data series. We eliminated seasonal patterns, dealt with missing data and ragged edges, extracted common cyclical components via principal component analysis and applied different scaling methods. From this procedure, we obtained daily compound indicators on physical mobility, on sales activity, on economic activity inside Switzerland and on international travel activity of Swiss residents. Also, we constructed an encompassing activity indicator. Since March, we publish the indicators in the KOF High Frequency Economic Monitoring Dashboard (2020) for download and visual inspection. The compound indicators are easily interpretable and nicely track the sudden down and up of activity during the crisisFootnote 2. Our focus on mobility and spending activity of the Swiss population has two reasons. First, social distancing is a key factor to contain the spread of the virus. Physical mobility is a proxy for social distancing, since the latter is largely achieved by a reduction in the former. Thus, by providing an indicator on the degree of physical (im)mobility, we intended to help monitoring the degree of social distancing exerted by the Swiss population during the crisis. Second, there was an increasing tendency of the Swiss people to reduce their activities well before the strict imposition of physical distancing rules. This response to the spread of the virus was certain to induce a steep fall in economic activity in consumer-related services. We wanted to help tracking this development by providing a compound indicator on spending activity in Switzerland. Indeed, our compound indicators have been cited by Swiss sources in order to report on mobility, sales activity and economic activity in general during the Corona crisisFootnote 3. This paper documents the construction procedure of the daily compound indicators. In addition, the paper provides several insights on mobility and sales activity in Switzerland during the Corona crisis. These insights are summarized in the conclusion of the paper. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 documents the high-frequency time series underlying the compound indicators. It also describes how we deal with seasonality patterns, missing values and ragged edges. Section 3 describes the construction of the indicators and discusses the possible scaling methods that allow for a meaningful interpretation of the indicators. Section 4 briefly reviews the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland. Section 5 then presents several insights on mobility and sales activity in Switzerland during the crisis. Section 6 concludes.",11

Roughly 30,000 employed lost their jobs on average in March and April after the shutdown. In just those 2 months, the unemployment rate rose by almost as much as it increased in all of 2010 following the financial crisis. Accordingly, the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs currently expects the unemployment rate to average 4.1% in the coming year, eventually reaching 7% if the shutdown persists, and this despite the fact that over a quarter of the employed are presently working short time to avoid unemployment. Small wonder that some now fear that Switzerland will experience the deepest recession in its history in the coming months. Yet is the current labor market situation really as dire or unique as presently felt? After all, roughly 30,000 individuals report unemployed every January without any major repercussions. Hence, strong surges in unemployment are not unheard of in Switzerland. The following contribution aims to enlarge upon this cursory evidence with a more in-depth study by comparing the current situation with previous employment crises and offering a forecast of the future trajectory of unemployment on the basis of a set of leading indicators that have proven their worth in the past. Our results show that unemployment rates in excess of 4% are not unknown in Switzerland, the most recent occurrence arising in the 1990s. By decomposing the unemployment rates into its constituent flow components, unemployment incidence and duration, we further see that the lockdown has led to a new record with respect to incidence and almost equaled previous marks with regard to duration. In addition, forecasts of the future trajectory of the unemployment rate and the share of long-term unemployed based on the incidence and duration of unemployment prevailing in June 2020 imply that the unemployment rate will at least reach and perhaps even surpass the previous record set in the 1990s and that the share of unemployed will clearly exceed previous milestones.",8

On March 5, the first patient deceased. On March 16, the government closed down a significant part of the economy and public life. The first measure was already taken on February 28: the government issued an ordinance forbidding gatherings of more than 1000 peopleFootnote 1. On March 13, it issued an ordinance with more drastic measures. It restricted travel from Italy and ordered schools to close. Gatherings of more than 100 people were restricted. Restaurants were restricted to host at most 50 guests at the same time. Only 3 days later, on March 16, the ordinance was changed and a broad shutdown of parts of the economy was initiated: all shops and open markets, restaurants, entertainment and cultural enterprises (including alpine tourism), and services with physical contact (such as hairdressers, etc.) were ordered to close. Exceptions were granted to food shops, take-away restaurants, pharmacies, hospitals (with restrictions), postal services and banks, public transportation, gas stations, social emergency institutions, public administration, and a few othersFootnote 2. Several further tightenings were ordered in the following weeks (including restrictions on travels from France, Germany, Austria, Spain, and all non-Schengen states). Notably, on March 21, public gatherings of more than five people were forbidden. During these developments, it was obvious that the measures would have significant economic impact. But hard data on the quantitative effect was not available. GDP data are available at quarterly frequency and only with considerable delay. What the decision makers need is a rough proxy that is available with short delay and at high frequency, a proxy that can give guidance to the question: “How is the economy doing? Right now?” Several possible proxies come to mind. For instance, traffic data (movements of cars, usage of public transportation, and transported tons of goods) could contain valuable information. Air pollution data is probably also closely connected to economic activity and is continuously monitored. The number of payments per unity of time could also be of interest. If the situation is dire, the number of insolvencies also clearly contains information about economic distress. All of these data are available long before GDP is estimated and published, and a comprehensive high frequency GDP indicator will combine most of themFootnote 3. One interesting candidate as a proxy of economic activity—the one I focus on in this paper—is electricity consumption. Electricity is essentially not stored at the site of consumption. Instead, electricity is largely created just in time, and to the extent it is stored, this happens in facilities of the producers. Moreover, almost all economic activity requires electricity. As a result, the consumption of electricity should be a proxy for economic activity. A testament to that is the clearly visible 7-day seasonality of electricity consumption: there is significantly less consumption on weekends than during weekdays. The role of electricity as a means or as a measure of economic activity has long been recognized. In 1956, the Federal Reserve Board added electricity production as a component to the indicator for industrial production (Federal Reserve Board 2019). Kraft and Kraft (1978) explore the direction of causality between energy consumption and GDP, which initiated a substantial literature. In 2010, the Economist created a proxy for China’s GDP that is based on three indices, one of them being electricity (Economist 2010). Related to this is also Vernon et al. (2012), who use light emissions visible from outer space as a proxy. Electricity consumption cannot be used as a proxy without treatment, however, because it is influenced by non-economic, exogenous factors. The most important, it turns out, is weather. In the following, I control for fluctuations that are due to weather, day of the week, Easter (and its sister holidays), and the beginning and end of daylight savings time (DST) periods. Moreover, a time fixed effect captures seasonality throughout the year that is not weather-related. The result is a series that is adjusted for calendar and weather effects. Remaining fluctuations of this series should be due to fluctuations of economic activity.",4

Usually, policy makers and researchers rely on early information from surveys and financial markets to construct leading indicators and estimate forecasting models (see, e.g., Abberger et al., 2014; Galli, 2018; Kaufmann and Scheufele, 2017; OECD, 2010; Stuart, 2020; Wegmüller and Glocker, 2019, for Swiss applications). These indicators and forecasts are published with a delay of 1 to 2 months.Footnote 1 During the COVID-19 crisis, however, we need high-frequency information to assess how stricter or looser health restrictions and economic stimulus programs affect the economy. We propose a novel daily fever curve (f-curve) for the health of the Swiss economy based on publicly available financial market and news data. We construct risk premia on corporate bonds, term spreads, and stock market volatility indices starting in 2000. In addition, we collect short economic news from online newspaper archives. We then estimate a composite indicator which has the interpretation of a fever curve: As for monitoring the condition of a patient, an increase of the fever curve provides a reliable and timely warning signal if health takes a turn for the worse. Panel a of Fig. 1 shows the f-curve (on an inverted scale) jointly with real gross domestic product (GDP) growth: the indicator closely tracks economic crises. It presages the downturn during the Global Financial Crisis, responds to the removal of the minimum exchange rate and to the euro area debt crisis. The f-curve also responds strongly to the COVID-19 crisis (see panel b). The indicator starts to rise in late February. By then, it became evident that the COVID-19 crisis will hit most European countries; in Switzerland, the first large events were canceled. It reaches a peak shortly after the lockdown. Afterward, the fever curve gradually declines with news about economic stimulus packages and gradual loosening of the lockdown. The peak during the COVID-19 crisis is comparable with the Global Financial Crisis. But the speed of the downturn is considerably higher. In addition, so far, the crisis is less persistent. Up to June 4, 2020, the f-curve improved to 1/4 of its peak value during the lockdown.
 A fever curve for the Swiss economy. Panel a compares the fever curve (inverted and rescaled) to quarterly GDP growth. Panel b panel gives daily values of the fever curve along with important policy decisions The indicator has several advantages we hope will make it useful for policy makers and the public at large. The methodology of the f-curve is simple; the data selection process is based on economic theory and intuition; the data sources are publicly available, and we provide the program codes and daily updates on https://github.com/dankaufmann/f-curve/.Footnote 2 Moreover, additional daily indicators that track economic activity are easily integrated in the modeling framework. There are various initiatives in Switzerland and abroad to satisfy the demand for reliable high-frequency information during the COVID-19 crisis. Becerra et al. (2020) develop sentiment indicators using Internet search engine data. Brown and Fengler (2020) provide information on Swiss consumption behavior based on debit and credit card payment data. Eckert and Mikosch (2020) develops a daily mobility index using data on traffic, payments, and cash withdrawals. For the USA, economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York estimate a weekly index of economic activity based on retail sales, unemployment insurance claims, and other rapidly available data on production, prices, and employment (Lewis et al. 2020). Moreover, Buckman et al. (2020) create a daily news sentiment indicator that leads the US traditional consumer sentiment based on surveys. Our paper is the first, to the best of our knowledge, to combine daily information from newspapers and financial market data in a daily measure of economic activity for Switzerland. In what follows, we describe the data and methodology. Then, we provide an analysis of the in- and out-of-sample performance. The last section concludes.",8
156,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,01 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-020-00050-0,The impact of contactless payment on cash usage at an early stage of diffusion,December 2020,Tobias Trütsch,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Cash is still the most prominent payment method at the point-of-sale (POS) in numerous developed countries, especially at low transaction values (e.g., von Kalckreuth et al. (2014); Bouhdaoui and Bounie (2012); Arango et al. (2015); Bagnall et al. (2016)). However, the promotion of various technological innovations in retail payment markets such as credit, debit, and prepaid cards has led to a decline in cash usage in recent years (e.g., Lippi and Secchi (2009); Amromin and Chakravorti (2009); Stix (2003)). Recent innovative payment means (e.g., contactless payment) attempt to mimic the desirable features of cash. They promise efficient and convenient payment services that may reduce the transaction costs of payment for consumers. Contactless payment is therefore seen as a more competitive payment alternative to traditional cash payments compared to conventional payment cards. Thus, discussing the prospects of cash usage is high on the agenda of central banks, which are responsible for cash distribution. This paper explores the effect of contactless credit and debit cards on cash usage in the early stage of diffusion. The contactless antenna is usually embedded in conventional payment cards such as debit and credit cards. Contactless cards include a chip and a simple wireless sign. The sign is the only distinction to traditional chip cards. Contactless payment is based on near-field communication (NFC) technology. This standard radio communication technology allows paying within a 4-cm range by waving or tapping the payment card. A signature or PIN verification is not necessary below a certain transaction value. Contactless payment therefore offers instantaneous payment, speed, and convenience compared to traditional cards. Polasik et al. (2013) found that contactless payment cards compete with cash payments with respect to speed and under certain conditions even outperform cash. The speed of a transaction is key to determining the choice of payment instruments (e.g., Klee (2006); Jonker (2007)). Thus, I hypothesize that contactless payment adopters are more likely to exhibit lower cash usage. The effect on the number of cash transactions is expected to be larger compared to cash expenses. This is because contactless cards—due to their improved speed and convenience—are likely to substitute low cash value payments, which are high in frequency but have low budget impact. Analyzing the effect of contactless payment on cash usage is relevant for three reasons. First, one of the main responsibilities of central banks is to provide efficient payment services to ensure financial system stability. The number and transaction size of cash payments affect the efficiency of payment systems, as expressed in social welfare costs. van Hove (2008) measured the costs of cash usage in the Netherlands as being 0.48% of GDP. Schmiedel et al. (2013) estimated the substantial costs of cash, which amount to one half percent of GDP for the EU-27 member states. Thus, understanding the demand for cash is crucial to evaluating the costs of payment systems. Second, central banks are the sole institutions that are entitled to issue legal tender money. The assessment of future trends in cash demand is a relevant monetary policy issue. More contactless payment cards could imply lower cash in circulation and hence lower seignorage income. Third, the literature has shown that money demand might react less sensitively to interest rates due to technological improvements in payment processing. This might result in lower welfare costs of inflation (Alvarez and Lippi (2009))Footnote 1. Three papers have so far examined how contactless payment impacts cash demand. Fujiki and Tanaka (2014) found that average cash balances do not decrease with the adoption of contactless payment and under some specifications even increase. They used household-level survey data from Japan. Fung et al. (2014) showed that contactless credit and stored-value cards reduce average cash usage for transactions in terms of both value and volumeFootnote 2. They analyzed consumer-level survey data from Canada. However, both studies failed to purge unobserved heterogeneity due to data restrictions. Chen et al. (2017) used household panel data from Canada to account for endogeneity. They encountered a high attrition rate of about 50%. However, they applied refreshment samples to account for this high attrition rate. They found no statistically significant impact of contactless credit cards on cash usage, neither in terms of value nor of volume after controlling for non-ignorable attrition and unobserved heterogeneity. This paper contributes to existing literature in three respects. First, it is essential to control for unobserved heterogeneity when examining the effect of contactless payment on cash usage Chen et al. (2017). I draw on a unique balanced panel dataset from 2009 to 2013. Using such rich datasets represents a novel approach, which does not suffer from non-ignorable attrition. Second, I investigate the effect of contactless debit cards on cash demand and thereby fill an important gap in the literature. This is because debit cards are the most popular cashless payment method. Third, I analyze the impact of contactless payment on cash usage in the USA, one of the biggest payment markets. This is important as there is still missing empirical evidence of contactless payment in the USA payment landscape. I find evidence that contactless credit and debit cards exert no statistically significant effect on cash usage in the early stage of diffusion. I account for unobserved heterogeneity in cash usage by using the fixed-effects model. Consumers’ decision to adopt contactless payment is an endogenous choice. Card-affined individuals replace conventional card payments with contactless card payments. The overall effect on cash usage therefore remains unaffected. I proceed as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 provides background information on the theoretical framework of the estimation strategy as well as the institutional background of contactless payment in the USA. The data are described in Section 4, followed by empirical specification in Section 5. Section 6 discusses the results while Section 7 draws conclusions and provides a research outlook.",6
156,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,03 March 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-019-0048-0,Does a ban on trans fats improve public health: synthetic control evidence from Denmark,December 2020,Rok Spruk,Mitja Kovac,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The consumption of trans-saturated fats is long recognized as a great public health concern. In particular, cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death in most OECD countries. The consumption of trans fat acids (TFAs), chiefly present in partially hydrogenated oils, is clearly associated with elevated LDL (“bad”) cholesterol levels and a drop in HDL (“good”) cholesterol levels, which negatively impacts the heart and metabolism in general and is also associated with rising obesity rates. Many studies over the years point to the adverse impact of trans fats (Baer et al. 2004, Mozaffarian et al. 2006, Teegala et al. 2009, Brouwer et al. 2013). Yet, the question remains: to what extent can a policy intervention aimed at limiting/removing trans fats from the food supply improve public health outcomes? Ever since Proctor and Gamble introduced Crisco in 1911, TFAs have seen widespread use due to their commercially favorable properties like long shelf life and stability while deep frying. TFAs were incorporated into various processed foods such as snacks, biscuits, deep-fried foods, prepackaged foods, margarines, and crackers. Created by adding hydrogens to vegetable oils, partially hydrogenated oils serve as a primary dietary source of TFAs. In the early 1990s, epidemiological studies (Koletzko 1992, Ascherio et al. 1994) found that higher plasma concentration of LDL cholesterol and low concentration of HDL cholesterol are reliable markers of cardiovascular risk. The general thrust of these studies is that even small rises in TFA consumption can increase LDL cholesterol substantially by about +0.04 mmol/L. Beyond doubt, trans fats increase the risk of cardiovascular disease mainly by disturbing the balance between high-density (HDL) and low-density (LDL) cholesterol. Hence, trans fat consumption poses a key public health risk by way of obesity rates and cardiovascular diseases (Stender et al. 2006, Oh et al. 2005, Uauy et al. 2009, Missmer et al. 2010). The economic benefits of lowering the prevalence of TFAs are substantial. Allen et al. (2015) estimate that a 1% reduction in TFA energy intake in England and Wales would generate some 3900 fewer deaths, 10,000 fewer hospital admissions, and see 37,000 life years being gained by 2030 while substantially shrinking health inequalities between the most affluent and most deprived income quantiles, whereas no such effects were found for policies relying on industry to voluntarily reformulate its products. The economic effects of growing obesity rates and prevalence of overweight in response to trans fats consumption are both persistent and significant (Astrup et al. 2008). Cawley (2004) suggests that a 2-standard deviation increase in body weight is associated with a 9% drop in wages, namely, the equivalent of 1.5 years’ lost education and 3 years’ foregone work experience. Using restricted data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey in the USA and considering genetic weight variation, Cawley and Meyerhoefer (2012) estimate that obesity raises annual medical inflation-adjusted costs by US$2471 and brings several negative externalities (Kortt et al. 1998, Finkelstein et al. 2009, Trasande et al. 2009, Thorpe et al. 2004). The widespread use of trans fats particularly harms the physical health of children and adolescents. Several channels that explain the adverse effects of TFAs on children and adolescent health have been identified. First, food prices exhibit a clear downward between 1990 and 2017, which is associated with greater demand for food and higher intake of high-calorie food. For instance, the price of a bottle of Coca-Cola in the said period dropped 35%, and the price of a McDonalds’ “quarter-pounder” dropped by 5.5%. The evidence suggests that food-price reductions account for 41 to 43% of the increase in young adults’ body mass index (BMI) between 1981 and 1984, where children from low-income families appear to be the most affected (Cawley 2010). On the other hand, vegetable prices rose by 17% in the 1997–2003 period, further explaining the increasing trend of obesity rates and prevalence of overweight (Powell 2009, Powell and Chaloupka 2009, Sturm and Datar 2005, Gelbach et al. 2007, Zheng and Zhen 2008, Auld and Powell 2009). Second, rising incomes are generally recognized as a factor in the growing obesity rates. The impact of income on obesity rates can operate in two directions. Higher income can induce a substitution effect and encourage consumers to substitute healthier but costlier options with cheaper energy-dense foods, mainly by growing demand for good health and an attractive appearance (Philipson 2001). Yet, rising income can encourage people to consume more calories and indulge in a sedentary lifestyle. The direction of the income effect is not empirically clear and varies substantially with age, year, sex, and race (Sobal and Stunkard 1989, Schmeiser 2009, Cawley et al. 2010).Footnote 1 Several studies establish a link between maternal employment and childhood obesity (Anderson et al. 2003, Von Hinke Kessler Scholder 2008, Fertig et al. 2009). These studies suggest an increase in the mother’s weekly work hours explains 11 to 34% of the rise in childhood obesity in families with a high socioeconomic status between 1975 and 1994. The positive impact of the mother’s weekly work hours on childhood obesity is not uniform, and holds for children whose mothers work full time and when the child is at least 7 years of age, but not when the child is either preschool age or aged 11, and not when mothers work part-time regardless of the child’s age. The mechanism underlying maternal employment and childhood obesity appears to be straightforward. Full-time maternal employment is associated with less time spent cooking and more time spent watching TV and playing video games. This increases the probability the family will consume prepared foods, which are calorie-dense and contain high levels of TFAs (Cawley and Fiu 2012). Another potential mechanism explaining maternal employment’s effect on childhood obesity is the choice of childcare arrangements since children in center-based care are more likely to be obese than children cared for by non-paternal relatives or even a nanny (Herbst and Tekin 2011). In addition, Philipson and Posner (2008) claim that technological advances in the mass preparation of food explain the rising obesity rates, while Cutler et al. (2003), Komlos et al. (2004), and Komlos and Baur (2004) highlight the importance of patience given that people seem willing to exchange their future health for the immediate gratification of their instant needs. Obesity imposes considerable economic costs that tend to persist. Trasande et al. (2009) and Trasander and Chatterjee (2009) estimate the direct cost of childhood obesity in the USA at US$14.1 billion. The effects of childhood obesity persist into adulthood. One third of preschool obese children and one-half of school-aged children become obese adults (Serdula et al. 1993). Finkelstein et al. (2009) believe the annual cost of treating obese adults in the USA is about US$147 billion, whereas Thorpe et al. (2004) show that in the period 1987–2001 the rise in obesity accounts for 27% of the rise in healthcare spending. The indirect economic costs of obesity are high. Apart from the employer-related cost, Cawley and Spiess (2008) show that childhood obesity in the age range 2 to 3 years results in delayed skill acquisition, holding important implications for human capital formation. Controlling for cognitive skills and education, childhood obesity predicts significantly lower wages in adulthood (Cawley 2004). Moreover, adult obesity in the USA leads to job market absenteeism, annually adding US$14.3 billion to employer costs (Cawley et al. 2007). This paper complements our earlier work (Kovac and Spruk 2019) on the impact of trans fat bans on public health in three noteworthy respects. First, we construct a counterfactual scenario by exploiting the parallel public health trends between affected and unaffected countries and build a trajectory of obesity rates and cardiovascular disease-related death rates in the hypothetical absence of the ban. Second, we add an extensive battery of covariates related to food demand structure, public health expenditure, consumer prices, physical geography, and intellectual aptitude to undertake a synthetic matching between Denmark and the rest of the world in the period before the implementation of the ban. By constructing a counterfactual scenario, we allow for the possibility of pre-ban trends in public health outcomes to the shape the trajectory of the public health outcomes over time had the ban never came into force which provides for an improved understanding of the effect size and significance associated with the ban. And third, this paper evaluates the impact of the ban on cardiovascular mortality and obesity rates and does not discuss the impact of non-ban trans fat policies compared to our earlier paper. Several other papers are related to ours. First, Restrepo and Rieger (2016a) use annual mortality rates in a sample of OECD countries for the period 1990–2012 to estimate the effect of Denmark’s trans fat ban on the cardiovascular (CVD) mortality rate. More specifically, they simulate the CVD mortality trajectory Denmark would have taken in the absence of passing a trans fat ban. Their results show that, 3 years after introducing the ban, the annual CVD-related mortality rate had fallen by 14.2 deaths per 100,000 people relative to the synthetic control group. Second, Restrepo and Rieger (2016b) examine the impact of the trans fats ban on CVD by considering the 2005 policy change made by the state of New York that prohibited artificial trans fats ingredients in food-service establishments. Their findings suggest the policy led to a 4.5% drop in CVD-related mortality, or roughly 13 fewer deaths per 100,000 inhabitants per year, which can be economically valued at some US$3.9 million per 100,000 inhabitants annually. Using a panel containing more countries with a substantially larger set of covariates, we reevaluate the effects of Denmark’s trans fat ban on the CVD mortality rate and estimate its impact on obesity rates and body weight. Our results confirm Restrepo and Rieger’s (2016a) findings and suggest the trans fat ban is associated with a considerable slowdown in obesity trends, particularly for children and adolescents. By examining similar policy changes in countries other than Denmark, we do not find similar effects of such a ban on CVD-related mortality and obesity. Our results imply that the ban on trans fats is associated with a reduced cardiovascular mortality rate of about 53 age-standardized deaths from 2001 to 2015 compared to the countries without such legislation in place. The reduction in the mortality rate is not immediate but tends to amplify in the long run. The effects of the ban on obesity rates are somewhat mixed. In particular, we find a relatively large reduction in adolescent obesity whereas the effects on child obesity rates are somewhat weaker. On the other hand, the effect on adult obesity rate cannot be plausibly distinguished from zero. The effect of the trans fats on cardiovascular mortality and obesity appears to be specific to Denmark since we do not find similar effects in other countries that subsequently passed a trans fat ban. A battery of placebo checks confirms our baseline results. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the policy context of Denmark’s trans fat ban in a comparative perspective. Section 3 discusses the identification strategy, while section 4 presents the data. Section 5 presents the results and robustness checks and section 6 concludes.",5

Wolter,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the aftermath of the 2008 financial and economic crisis, many governments and international agencies have been advocating for apprenticeship training, which could be a promising answer to soaring youth unemployment (cf. 2013, 2013; 2010, 2010; Quintini & Manfredi, 2009; 2014, 2014). Some even argue that, during a recession, apprenticeships ‘could pay a “double dividend”: securing the transition towards employment and lowering labour costs’ (Scarpetta, Manfredi, & Sonnet, 2010, p.4). However, as a market-driven type of education, apprenticeships are not uncontroversial in the context of economic crises. Since firms are free to decide whether to train or not, policymakers fear that many firms, while struggling to survive in times of recessions, might either cut training expenditures or even close businesses. As a consequence, the number of apprenticeships might respond to business cycles in a pro-cyclical fashion (Brunello, 2009). While general education provided by schools does not react to economic cycles (Muehlemann, Wolter, & Wueest, 2009), a large proportion of apprenticeship training in the educational system might therefore rather aggravate than alleviate an economic crisis for youth. The objective of this paper is to empirically examine the relationship between the number of apprenticeships and the business cycle. For this purpose, we use panel data from Swiss cantons between 1987 and 2016 to regress the number of new apprenticeships on economic changes (i.e. the GDP growth rate and the unemployment rate) as well as demographic trends (the population aged 16). We extend the time frame of an earlier study by Muehlemann et al. (2009) by 13 years to the period 1987–2016 (T = 30) and thereby include the most recent economic fluctuations. Following the ‘Great Recession’ of 2008/2009, the Swiss economy, which heavily relies on exports, was affected by several negative effects simultaneously: the worldwide recession, the European debt crisis and the overvaluation of the Swiss Franc—all effects potentially reducing the incentive of firms to invest in training and provide apprenticeships. Figure 1 shows the development of the number of apprenticeships, the population aged 16 and the business cycle in Switzerland. Indeed, during most of the (highlighted) recession periods, the number of apprenticeships decreased, suggesting that the business cycle might affect the number of new apprenticeships. Then again, during the severe crisis in 2008, the number of school graduates (typically aged 16) decreased as well. In turn, fewer students were seeking apprenticeship positions. These dynamics thus raise the question of whether the business cycle affects the number of apprenticeships and which factors—economic or demographic—mainly explain the fluctuations.
 Time series of apprenticeships, the population aged 16, real GDP per capita (all normalised, 1991 = 100) and unemployment (rhs) Our contribution to the existing literature is as follows. We are the first in this context to estimate the dynamic models and thereby allow for short- and long-term effects. While apprentices usually start in autumn (after compulsory school finishes), the recruitment by firms takes place earlier and throughout the year. Therefore, the economic situation during both the same and previous year might affect the firm’s hiring decisions, and the timing of a potential response to economic cycles is unclear. Furthermore, in case of economic uncertainty, firms might only postpone initial training plans rather than cut expenditures permanently. The mere looking at immediate reactions would therefore not capture such a behaviour. As a consequence, static models, as found in previous literature, might only reflect part of the firm’s response. Moreover, we analyse whether the behaviour of firms differs during booming periods and recessions. For several reasons, larger firms usually prefer having apprentices simultaneously at different stages of their training period (3 to 4 years). If the economy is growing, such firms thus tend to hire a stable number of apprentices every year, independently of the growth rates, unless the firms expect an exceptional increase in employment. In contrast, if an unexpected recession forces firms to cut expenses or reduce over-capacities and deviate from the business-as-usual strategy regarding training efforts, the same firms may temporarily stop hiring new apprentices. Hence, the number of apprenticeships might respond stronger to business cycles during recessions than in periods of economic growth. Our results show that apprenticeship numbers do respond to business cycles. In the short run, a 1% point increase of unemployment relates to roughly 1.5% less apprenticeships, while there is no immediate effect of the GDP growth rate observable. The response to previous year’s GDP growth, however, appears pro-cyclical, but the statistical significance is not clear. In the subsequent period, the effect of a changing unemployment rate reverses, suggesting that a number of firms only postpone (or advance) their recruitment, but do not change the number of apprenticeships over a longer time horizon. At the same time, the effect of GDP growth rate changes increases during subsequent years. Overall, we observe both, the demographic changes as well as the economic fluctuations, to have a significant long-term effect on apprenticeship numbers. The magnitude of both effects, however, is moderate, as the vast majority of filled apprenticeship positions are affected by neither economic nor demographic changes. Although there is abundant literature on training decisions of firms (see Wolter & Ryan, 2011, with a particular focus on apprenticeship training), the number of studies analysing these decisions in the context of economic fluctuations is rather small. On the theoretical side, there are essentially two training motivations (which could be affected by business cycles) discussed in the literature: the investment- and production-oriented approach (Brunello, 2009; Lindley, 1975; Merrilees, 1983; Wolter & Ryan, 2011). The former, based on the human capital theory formalised by Becker (1962), sees apprentices as investment, where training costs are mainly motivated through future production gains. Hence, the training strategy depends on expectations regarding future production, and a structural output shock might alter the firm’s demand for labour, including apprentices. However, since apprenticeships last between 2 and 4 years, temporary business cycles are less likely to affect the long-term expectations and thus the demand for apprentices. Firms following a production-oriented training strategy, on the other hand, do not hire apprentices due to future expectation but as substitutes for unskilled or skilled workers for the current production. Training costs are thereby compensated by productive work for a comparatively low salary, and for certain apprenticeships, the benefits exceed costs (Muehlemann & Wolter, 2014). Contrary to the investment approach, the production-oriented theory can thus explain why apprentices are hired even if they leave the firm directly upon completing the training, what is usually the case in Switzerland. Economic downturns, however, decrease the current workload and therefore might affect the immediate demand for apprentices. In addition, rising unemployment rates decrease hiring costs of skilled workers (Muehlemann & Strupler Leiser, 2018), and hence, a loosening labour market might make hiring skilled workers comparatively more attractive than offering apprenticeships. If unemployment is low, in contrast, it is more difficult to hire skilled workers, and firms turn to hiring more apprentices (Askilden & Nilsen, 2005). Based on such theoretical considerations, it might be that firms react differently to changes in GDP and unemployment rates. Dynamic models including the GDP appear to be a promising way to capture the firm’s expectations of both, the current but also the future development of their workload, whereas the unemployment rate might reflect hiring costs on the external labour market. Therefore, we include both measures individually and simultaneously, what seems feasible considering that the two indicators for a business cycle are only loosely correlated. Besides discussing theoretical models, Brunello (2009) also provides a review of the empirical literature on the topic. The general finding is that the number of apprentices responds in a pro-cyclical manner to economic fluctuations. However, the magnitude of the impact is unclear, as only few studies discuss the effect size. Westergaard-Nielsen and Rue Rasmussen (1999) and Müller and Schweri (2012), for instance, report only a relatively small impact of business cycles. Askilden and Nilsen (2005) find a pro-cyclical effect of the business cycle on apprentices in Norway, using the unemployment rate as proxy. Furthermore, they test explicitly whether firms with investment- or production-oriented strategies are affected by fluctuations and find evidence for the latter. Muehlemann et al. (2009) confirm a significant, but small pro-cyclical relationship using panel data of Swiss cantons from 1988 to 2004. They estimate that a 1% point decrease of unemployment relates to 0.6% more apprenticeships. A much stronger reaction appears in relation to demographic fluctuations: a standard deviation change of school graduates is associated with 32% of new apprenticeships. In a more recent study, Baldi, Brüggemann-Borck, and Schlaak (2014) examine the short-run relationship between business cycles and the number of apprentices in Germany between 1999 and 2012 and find no robust relationship for both the unemployment rate and (lagged) GDP, except for small effects in West Germany, and only for the period after 2007. Hence, they conclude that ‘the apprenticeship system seems to have dampened the volatility of youth unemployment in Germany’. In addition to analysing panel data, a number of studies also use cross-sectional or survey data of individuals or firms. Weßling, Hartung, and Hillmert (2015) use a German household survey and find that a 1% point increase of the unemployment rate in the district of residence and in neighbouring districts reduces the trainee’s probability of entering an apprenticeship by roughly 1%. Using the IAB firm-level survey, Bellmann, Gerner, and Leber (2016) report that in 2009, German firms decreased the incidence of apprenticeship training by 1.5% (those affected by the crisis) or 0.21% (unaffected firms), compared to 2008. In sum, the empirical literature points to a pro-cyclical reaction in the number of apprenticeships to economic cycles, but most studies report rather small effect sizes.",6

It is particularly interesting to study this relationship because Switzerland has experienced a number of external shocks since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1974.Footnote 1 Nonetheless, the power of the term structure in predicting Swiss recessions has apparently not previously been studied in the literature.Footnote 2 In contrast, the literature for the United States of America (US) is extensive. An early study of the predictive power of the US term structure for economic activity was provided by Harvey (1989). In terms of its forecasting capacity for recessions, Estrella and Hardouvelis (1991) first demonstrated this using probit models. Since then, a wider literature has built up studying various aspects of this relationship.Footnote 3 However, the predictive power of the slope of the term structure for recessions in other economies is less studied. Estrella and Mishkin (1995) find that the term structure predicts recessions reasonably well in the US and Germany, to a lesser extent in the UK and Italy, and hardly at all in France. Bernard and Gerlach (1996) show that the slope of the term structure of interest rates has, to varying extents, predictive power for recessions in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US over the period 1972 to 1993. They also show that, although foreign spreads may be statistically significant in explaining recessions, their economic importance is limited.Footnote 4 There are two reasons why the slope of the term structure may be less informative in small and highly open economies than in larger and more closed economies. First, central banks in small open economies tend to fix, or manage heavily, their exchange rates. With interest rates consequently determined, or strongly influenced, by those abroad, the domestic term structure may reflect only to a limited extent domestic economic conditions. Furthermore, even if the exchange rate floats, economic and financial developments in large neighbors and important trading partners can impact on the domestic term structure, potentially swamping the information it contains about the national economy. Second, economic conditions in many small open economies are often disproportionally dependent on the fortunes of a small number of large companies that are heavily engaged in international trade. Sudden developments impacting on these companies can have an outsize impact which can lead to particularly large revisions in macroeconomic data.Footnote 5 Overall, therefore, it is an open question whether the slope of the term structure is useful in predicting recessions in small open economies. In this paper, I address this question using dynamic probit models to forecast recessions in Switzerland over the period 1974–2017. The monthly data set comprises the 3-month interbank rate, 10-year Government bond yields, and the recession dating of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Footnote 6 Using the latter rather than gross domestic product (GDP) growth has two main advantages. First, the data are available monthly, whereas the highest frequency that GDP is available is quarterly. While monthly data are likely to be noisier than quarterly data, the number of observations triples. This is likely to lead to better (and, in any case, timelier) estimates. Second, consistent official quarterly GDP data for Switzerland begin only in 1980.Footnote 7 Dropping the 1970s seems unfortunate, since it is a period that is likely to be highly informative about the ability of the term structure to predict recessions. The main findings are as follows. First, there is considerable evidence that the slope of the Swiss term structure contains information useful for forecasting recessions for horizons up to 19 months ahead in the sample period studied. This result compares well with those in the literature for small open economies. Indeed, a comparison with a similar specification for the US—a large, relatively closed economy—suggests that the in-sample fit of the models is surprisingly similar, although the US model has a better out-of-sample fit. Second, whether the economy is currently in recession or not is also useful information. For short forecast horizons, the results indicate that the economy is expected to stay in its current state; for longer forecast horizons, the results show that the economy is likely to change state. Third, these relationships appear stable over time. Fourth, robustness tests indicate that the KOF Swiss Economic Institute (KOF) business course indicator and M1 and M2 growth contain information not already embedded in the term structure. Combining the term structure and these additional variables improves the overall in-sample fit of the model. Out-of-sample testing suggests that the KOF indicator, in combination with M1 or M2 growth, improves the overall fit of the model at most horizons. The paper is structured as follows. The data and some historical background are discussed in the next section. Section 3 presents the results of the model, including analysis of parameter stability and fit. In Section 4, a number of robustness tests are carried out to consider the information content of alternative measures of the spread, and additional variables. Section 5 compares the relationship between recessions and the term spread in Switzerland with that in the US, on which much of the literature has focused. Section 6 concludes.",3
156,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,03 January 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-019-0049-z,Real-financial connectedness in the Swiss economy,December 2020,Erhan Uluceviz,Kamil Yilmaz,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"As manifested over the recent history, interactions between the real and financial sides of the economy have important repercussions with significant costs of all sorts which cannot be avoided once risks that seemed as tail events are realized. This is a lesson that has only recently been learned on a global scale after the 2008–2009 global financial crisis. In the wake of the global financial crisis, and the global recession, central banks have designed and implemented quantitative easing (QE) policies, not only to contain side effects of the crisis but also to put national economies back on track. These policies were, mostly, executed in the form of bond purchases. As a result, from a policy perspective not only understanding but also tracking the interaction between the real and financial sides of the economy have never been more important. Regardless of this fact, this territory is largely unexplored in the academic literature. Using the Diebold-Yilmaz Connectedness Index (DYCI) methodology (see Diebold and Yilmaz (2009); Diebold and Yilmaz (2012); Diebold and Yilmaz (2014)), in Uluceviz and Yilmaz (2018), we recently investigated the joint structure of connnectedness between the real and financial sides of the U.S. economy on a weekly frequency basis. In this paper, we apply the same analytical framework to Swiss economy on a monthly frequency basis while extending it by quantifying the relative importance of each node as a shock propagator. In this paper, we shift the focus of Uluceviz and Yilmaz (2018). Rather than merely investigating the interaction between the real and financial sides of the Swiss economy, we try to answer the following two interwoven questions in a network-theoretic approach:
 How do the real and the financial sides of the Swiss economy interact; do any of the sides predominantly influence the other? Hypothesizing that they influence each other significantly; once hit by a shock, which market has the highest potential to disseminate shocks in the real-financial network? To elaborate on Q1, we follow a two-step approach. In the first step, we use the KOF economic barometer, a leading composite indicator for the Swiss economy published by KOF Swiss Economic Institute, to represent the real side of the Swiss economy. In addition, we employ return volatilities for the stock, bond, and FX markets to represent the financial side of the Swiss economy. To capture the effects of global shocks on the Swiss economy, we use the U.S. bond market volatility as an exogenous variable. Within the real-financial network setup, we find that real and financial sides do, significantly but not predominantly, influence each other. We question whether this result could be attributed to the use of financial variables in the estimation of the KOF barometer. To examine this, we estimate the real activity index (RAI) solely from real variables with a factor model similar to the one employed to extract KOF barometer. And we find that KOF barometer and RAI move in tandem over the period of our analysis. Interestingly, when we replace the KOF barometer with RAI, the results of the analysis change significantly: the real side of the economy becomes a net connectedness receiver from the financial side. Our analysis summarized up to now dealt with tracing one-time shocks until they settle in the network and provides a sound answer to Q1 we asked above. However, investigation of the ripple effects of one-time shocks within the network and quantifying the relative importance of nodes as shock propagators takes us to Q2. To enhance our understanding of Q2, using connectedness tables obtained from the real-financial networks we set up to answer Q1, we compute propagation values as in Schmidbauer et al. (2013); Schmidbauer et al. (2016); Schmidbauer et al. (2017). The approach we follow is simply to compute a certain network centrality measure, a normed left eigenvector, of the network matrices we estimated to answer Q1. It is, in a sense, similar to the approach Google follows to rank its search results based on the importance of the websites it finds. We find that important turning points, such as recessions and SNB’s policies regarding CHF in 2011 and 2015, have important implications over the course of our analysis period. That is to say, the way the real and financial sides of the Swiss economy interact, and the strength of the financial markets as shock propagators, have changed over the periods determined by these dates. Specifically, on average, stock market was the most important financial market as shock propagator followed by the bond and the FX markets over the period defined by the end of 2008–2009 recession in Switzerland and shortly before SNB’s minimum EUR/CHF exchange rate policy implemented in September 2011. Following SNB’s 2015 policy implementation, i.e., discontinuation of the minimum EUR/CHF exhange rate policy set forth in 2011, both the stock and the FX markets, on average, became the most important nodes as shock propagators followed by the bond market. Supported by empirical evidence, we argue that if a shock hits the USD/CHF exchange rate, some time before SNB’s 2011 policy implemented, it would barely have an influence on the real-financial network we investigate. But following SNB’s 2015 decision, FX and stock market shocks were, on average, the most important ones followed by the bond market in terms of creating volatility in the real-financial connectedness network we investigated. Section 2 provides technical details of DYCI methodology insofar as to explain how shocks spread across a system of variables along with quantification of the relative importance of each variable as a shock propagator as well as the details of the data used in the paper. Section 3 provides connectedness results when KOF barometer is used to represent the real side of the Swiss economy. Section 4 takes a glimpse at the similarities and the differences between the KOF barometer and RAI as alternatives to represent the real side of the Swiss economy. In Section 5, we obtain connectedness results with RAI being used to represent the real side. Section 6 is a look at the net connectedness between the real side of the economy and each financial market, respectively. Section 7 discusses relative importance of nodes as shock propagators, while Section 8 concludes the paper.",6

Although the debate on whether banks should be allowed to issue their own banknotes took mainly place during the nineteenth century, the corresponding questions resonate until today, as competition between privately created money occurs nowadays simply with e.g. demand deposits. Furthermore, the development of cryptocurrencies has recently renewed the attention to the possibilities and limitations of a competitive money supply (see e.g. Fernandez-Villaverde & Sanches, 2019). Switzerland’s free-banking history is particularly important, because it can be subdivided into a period with more or less unfettered competition between 1826 and 1881, and a period with strictly regulated competition between 1881 and 1907 (Baltensperger & Kugler, 2017, ch.8; Paillard, 1909, pp.189ff.). Herger (2021) provides a theoretical account of the differences between a regulated and an unregulated free-banking regime.
According to the current assessment of Switzerland's free-banking history, the corresponding economic experiences differed markedly. In particular, Weber (1988; 1992) suggests that the more or less unregulated regime was a success story, as it gave rise to a stable paper-money system. Conversely, according to Neldner (2003), the regime after 1881 was doomed to failure, because banknote regulation undermined the self-discipline against overissuing, which led to a depreciation of the Swiss franc and, in turn, paved the way for the establishment of a banknote monopoly under the auspices of the Swiss National Bank (SNB). This paper provides a historical reinterpretation of the Swiss experiences with regulated free banking. In particular, to understand why banknote regulation was introduced, it should not be overlooked that unfettered competition can keep the monetary system fragmented, or disintegrated (Friedman & Schwarz, 1986). As long as multiple banknotes of different quality circulated alongside each other, transaction and inspection costs were relatively high, which undermined the functions of paper money as broadly accepted means of payment and commonly recognised unit of account (see also Baltensperger, 2012, p. 279). Against this background, it is not surprising that Switzerland lagged behind in the development of paper money, when compared with other industrialised countries (see e.g. Ritzmann, 1973, pp.37ff.). The lack of an integrated market for paper money could only be overcome through government intervention turning banknotes into a homogenous product and a commonly accepted means of payment. To avoid the political controversies that arose as regards the foundation of a central note-issuing bank, government intervention into Switzerland’s banknote market occurred initially in the form of the Federal Banknote Act of 1881. This piece of legislation turned paper money into a qualitatively more or less homogenous product, by obliging Swiss note issuers to convert, on demand, all banknotes at par value, and by imposing minimum-reserve requirements. It soon turned out that this type of regulation is no panacea. Rather, the decades after 1881 were characterised by an ongoing struggle to maintain an adequate supply of paper money within the constraints of the Federal Banknote Act. In this regard, Neldner (2003) has emphasised the risk of overissuing. Yet, when inspecting the amount of banknotes in circulation and consulting indirect empirical measures, such as the development of inflation, interest rates, and exchange rates, there are reasons to doubt that Switzerland’s regulated free-banking system necessarily suffered from endemic and irreparable overissuing. However, even if adequate rules against overissuing were imposed, the Federal Banknote Act still created another quantitative problem; namely the lack of a sufficiently flexible—or what was then called “elastic”—banknote supply. This issue was emphasised by numerous observers at the time, including Kalkmann (1900), Gygax (1901), Paillard (1909), and Jöhr (1915). After 1881, this meant that e.g. seasonal money-demand fluctuations were, arguably, only partially accommodated by changes in supply. Historically, it was impossible to solve the problem of supplying an adequate quantity of paper money while retaining the regulated free-banking system. Therefore, the SNB was established in 1907 to provide, among other things, homogenous Swiss banknotes in a flexible manner. The paper is organised as follows. As a “prologue”, Sect. 2 briefly discusses the unfettered regime between 1826 and 1881. Section 3 turns to the historical and empirical aspects of the regulated regime between 1881 and 1907. As an “epilogue”, Sect. 4 sketches the role of central note issuing and the historical path towards the foundation of the SNB in 1907. Finally, Sect. 5 draws some general conclusions from Switzerland’s experiences with a free-banking system.",
157,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,30 October 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-021-00076-y,The green potential of occupations in Switzerland,December 2021,Michael Lobsiger,Christian Rutzer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Environmental awareness has increased in the population in recent years, especially against the background of climate change. These developments have also led to regulatory activities at the political level.Footnote 1 Strategies and action plans are aimed, among other things, at increasing the resource efficiency of production and achieving a more sustainable economy.Footnote 2 As recognized by research and practice alike, such a transformation towards a more sustainable economy may also have strong effects on the labour market (e.g. Vona et al., 2018). Specifically, the labour market asks for employees with specific skills (knowledge, abilities, skills in the narrower sense and attitudes) that are necessary to perform green tasks—that is work activities that make a positive contribution to the green economy. These tasks will be increasingly demanded on the path to a more sustainable economy (Rutzer et al., 2020; Janser, 2018). Against this background, it is important to know which Swiss occupations have a high potential to perform green tasks. By this we mean the potential of an occupation to be able to perform green tasks on the basis of the skills attributed to it, whereby it is irrelevant whether the occupation already bundles green tasks or not (Rutzer et al., 2020). An electrical engineer, for example, can put her skills to work both overseeing a nuclear reactor at a nuclear power plant or researching renewable energy. Only in the second case does she perform a green task, but in any case she brings the potential to perform green tasks. Therefore, information about the green potential of occupations seems central to us, e.g. for education and training policy: The need to align education and training with green transformation will be less urgent if many workers are employed in occupations with high green potential. This is because one can assume that, to a certain extent, they have the necessary skills to carry out green tasks and are thus well prepared for a green transformation. In order to quantify the green potential of occupations in Switzerland, we follow a novel approach developed by Rutzer et al. (2020). The approach relies on machine-learning algorithms to quantify the importance of different skills in performing green tasks. The results show that occupations with a high green potential are predominantly those with an engineering and technical background. Once the green potential of different Swiss occupations is determined, we aim at finding empirical support for our measure of the green potential of occupations. In particular, we follow a recent strand of the literature examining heterogeneous demand responses in labour markets (measured at the occupational level) with respect to changes in environmental policy stringency (Niggli & Rutzer, 2020; Vona et al., 2018). In particular, we investigate whether occupations with high green potential are in higher demand relative to other occupations when environmental policy stringency proxied by green emission taxes increases. The results provide evidence of a positive association between demand of occupations with high green potential and an increase in the implicit emission tax. Although we do not claim a causal relationship, we interpret this result as empirical support for the estimated green potential of occupations in Switzerland. Next, we use our green potential estimates at the occupational level to determine the proportion of employees in Switzerland working in occupations considered to have a high green potential. Furthermore, we describe their socio-economic background. In particular, we characterize employment in occupations with high green potential along different dimensions such as age, sex, migration status and level of education as well as a set of labour market indicators (rate of job vacancies, rate of unemployment). For that, we divide the occupations into two groups based on a particular threshold for the green potential (which we will justify later). According to our estimates, in Switzerland in the year 2017, 739,000 persons and 670,000 full-time equivalents (FTE) have been employed in occupations with high green potential. Measured relative to the total number of persons employed and FTE, this is around 16.7% and 18.8%, respectively. Employed persons in occupations with high green potential are, on average, younger, more often men, have a higher level of educational attainment and a higher probability of having immigrated than employed persons in other occupations. Moreover, the group of occupations with high green potential has a lower unemployment rate and a higher job vacancy rate. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Next, we review the literature (1) assessing the extent of greenness of occupations based on task level information, (2) relating the extent of greenness of occupations to skills and (3) analysing heterogeneous demand responses of the labour market due to green economy measures. Afterwards, we describe our methodology to estimate the green potential of occupations and the estimates thereof. We then outline our empirical strategy to analyse possible heterogeneous labour market effects in response to changes in environmental policy stringency and provide the respective estimation results. Consequently, we characterize employment in occupations with high green potential along different dimensions. Finally, we summarize our main findings and conclude.",1

Wolter,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Switzerland is proud of its well-functioning vocational education and training system (VET). Training young people specifically for the demands of a profession, as well as the needs of a company, has proven to be a good remedy against youth unemployment and counteracts the shortage of skilled workers (e.g., Bolli et al., 2021). Furthermore, apprentices benefit from the system as well, as they earn theoretical knowledge and working experience while they are trained to become professionals in the respective job. However, all these advantages are also counterbalanced by the potential disadvantage that the demand for apprentices depends on the economic situation and does not simply follow the demographic trend of young people looking for post-compulsory education, as is the case with school-based types of education (for an overview on the effects of business cycles on apprenticeships see e.g., Brunello, 2009 or Muehlemann & Wolter, 2021 and for a general overview on the economics of apprenticeship see e.g., Wolter & Ryan, 2011 or Muehlemann & Wolter, 2020). Basically, the apprenticeship market consists of two sides, firms on the one side, demanding apprentices and on the other side the supply of young people willing to learn an occupation. The total number of training contracts therefore reflects the equilibrium of the number of training positions offered by firms willing to train, as well as the number of individuals willing to learn a job. This work investigates the supply of apprentices during the COVID-19 pandemic as the potential reason for a temporal decrease in signed training contracts in the first months of the pandemic. Using an innovative data source, we are able to track the supply side in form of revealed preferences on a daily basis by the number of search queries on the national Swiss platform for apprenticeship vacancies. Although this does not show the supply of apprenticeship seekers as such, it does show the search intensity, which could not automatically be derived from the number of registered apprenticeship seekers. In the past it was only possible to make assumptions as to whether it was supply or demand that primarily determined the number of apprenticeship contracts concluded, due to the very limited availability of data on supply and demand or even the complete absence of such data, as is the situation in Switzerland. In the case of large demographic fluctuations, it was assumed, ceteris paribus, that changes in contracts were due to the influence of supply and, conversely, in the case of economic fluctuations, that the influence was due to changes in the demand for apprentices. Thus, this study contributes to a better understanding of the functioning of the apprenticeship market in Switzerland, as for the first time the supply of apprenticeship seekers can be tracked over time. After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were fears, based on experiences in previous crises (Luethi & Wolter, 2020), that the apprenticeship market in Switzerland would primarily suffer as a result of the expected economic recession and its impact on the demand for apprentices. In April and May, the number of signed apprenticeship contracts fell significantly compared to the previous year's values. However, this number returned to the previous year's values later in the summer, so that when the apprenticeships of the 2020 cohort began, the same number of apprentices started an apprenticeship as before the pandemic. As there was no indication that the demand for apprentices changed significantly in the aftermath of the March 2020 shutdown and it is unlikely that apprenticeship vacancies fluctuate largely from month to month,Footnote 1 we direct the focus in this paper to the supply of potential apprentices as an explanation for the observed temporal pattern of signed contracts. Analysing over 10 million search queries for apprenticeship positions from end of February 2020 until April 2021, we find a sharp decrease of up to 40% in search queries during the first shutdown followed by a catch-up effect afterwards. Further, we find that the effect of politically imposed restrictions on the search intensity decreases over time. Consequently, we find a lower impact of the second shutdown starting in December 2020 until February 2021 on the intensity of searching for an apprenticeship. The empirical results show that the temporal pattern of the progression of the cumulative number of signed apprenticeship contracts is very similar to the pattern of the search intensity for apprenticeship positions. Even though it is not possible to postulate causal relationships based on the available data, the analyses show that the development of the apprenticeship market in Switzerland in the short run and in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic was probably determined by a reaction of supply. The rest of this work is structured as follows. We provide a short review of emerging literature on COVID-19 effects in general and the effects on the labour market and job search behaviour, in Sect. 2. Section 3 provides a short overview of the apprenticeship market in Switzerland in 2020. Section 4 introduces the methodology, data base and some descriptive statistics. Section 5 presents the results of the analysis, followed by concluding remarks in Sect. 6.",1

The government’s target is to satisfy the growing demand for skilled workers by a better exploitation of the domestic labor force potential. This implies, for example, a reintegration of economically inactive people into the labor market (Swiss Federal Council, 2018). But back at work, what are the individual economic consequences of a non-employment spell? Or in other words, what is the price we have to pay for a time off? To answer these questions, previous research has either analyzed the consequences of a non-employment spell as such or focused on a specific type of career interruption. This paper belongs to the former strand. However, since the group of non-employed people naturally consists of individuals who are not working for different reasons, the results of this paper are also linked to studies investigating earnings after a specific form of interruption. One reason for not working is unemployment. This often implies not only a temporary burden but also negative impacts on future income. The wage penalty for the long-term unemployed is thereby considerably larger than for people who are unemployed for only a short period. As people keep working, however, there seems to be a partial recuperation of wages (e.g., Gregory & Jukes, 2001; Nickell, Jones, & Quintini, 2002). Yet, long-term unemployment is not the only type of a career interruption which has been found to cause considerable wage decreases. Motherhood-related breaks can be similarly followed by wage drops that tend to grow with the length of the interruption. However, these negative earnings effects typically recover over time (e.g., Lalive & Zweimüller, 2009; Napari, 2010). A somewhat different conclusion is drawn by previous research on sick leaves. An interruption due to bad health can imply deep long-term scarsFootnote 1 for future wages (e.g., Andersen, 2010; Boden, 2006). These insights are also reflected by the literature on the topic which does not distinguish between different reasons for career interruptions (e.g., Mincer & Ofek, 1982; Mortelmans & Frans, 2017; Spivey, 2005). Overall, it has been found that a longer period of non-employment is associated with a larger wage penalty, which is particularly pronounced among men. One explanation for this heterogeneity is that career breaks, especially due to caring responsibilities, tend to be more socially accepted for women, whereas men are more strongly stigmatized for a time off work (e.g., Albrecht, Edin, Sundström, & Vroman, 1999; Mortelmans & Frans, 2017; Theunissen, Verbruggen, Forrier, & Sels, 2011). In the general discussion about wage consequences of long-term non-employment spells, there are, however, various arguments involved. Besides negative signaling effects, previous research has identified human capital depreciation as a major driver for wage penalties after re-engagement (Mincer & Ofek, 1982). Furthermore, decreasing reservation wages are considered to be an important cause for lowering actual earnings (Addison & Portugal, 1989). Concerning Switzerland, evidence on wage effects of long-term non-employment is scarce. In that respect, this paper mostly relates to previous research investigating wage consequences of long-term unemployment (Djurdjevic, 2005; Ecoplan, 2013; Liechti, Morlok, & Siegenthaler, 2020; Sheldon, 1999). In line with major findings for other countries, these studies indicate a significantly negative effect which can persist for several years. This paper contributes to the literature as it investigates the effect of a long-term non-employment spell on future wages in a short- and long-term perspective for Switzerland. Furthermore, it takes up the heterogeneous findings for men and women by conducting gender-specific analyses. Using data from the Swiss Household Panel (SHP) allows us to measure the effect of long-term non-employment spells on hourly wages. In contrast to the above-mentioned studies for Switzerland, this enables us to control for part-time work. In line with theoretical expectations, our results indicate a large wage penalty in the first year following re-employment if a worker finds a job with the same characteristics as the one previously performed. This wage penalty vanishes after about 5 to 6 years. Performing subsample analyses, we detect a relatively larger negative effect on men’s wages which is quite persistent whereas we find women’s wages to soon catch up with the earnings of their counterparts who have not just left a long-term non-employment spell. Our results therefore highlight the importance of other effects besides human capital dynamics. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section provides a comprehensive review of relevant literature to date. Section 3 deals with economic theory on the topic. Section 4 presents the identification strategy and the econometric model. Afterwards, in Section 5, we introduce the data, the working sample and discuss the construction of the main variables used in the empirical analysis. The results are presented in Section 6. The last section concludes.",1

In particular, digital technologies have heterogeneous effects on workers’ labor market opportunities depending on their skill level and the importance of routine tasks in their occupations (Autor et al., 2003; Katz & Murphy, 1992). In turn, these heterogeneous labor market effects have been identified as main drivers of job polarization in the USA and other developed countries, characterized by a declining employment share of middle-wage occupations and increased shares at the lower and upper end of the wage distributions (Acemoglu & Autor, 2011; Goos et al., 2009). While recent studies found a decline in routine employment in Switzerland on an aggregate level (Kurer, 2019; Kurer & Palier, 2019), little is known about individual-level dynamics on how the Swiss labor force has adapted to digitalization. In regard to labor market effects of digital technology, two main mechanisms have been at the center of scientific debate: The first mechanism, skill-biased technological change, states that the benefits of digital technology for workers in terms of employment prospects and wages increase with their skill level (Katz & Murphy, 1992). The second mechanism, routine-biased technological change, argues that digital technology tends to substitute workers in routine-intensive jobs while complementing those in non-routine occupations (Autor et al., 2003). Whereas the first narrative projects a general labor market “upgrading” due to digitalization, the second predicts a “de-routinization” accompanied by a “job polarization” of the labor market, as routine jobs tend to be located in the middle of the wage distribution and non-routine occupations at the upper and lower tails. While the literature focusing on the US labor market found convincing evidence supporting recent job polarization trends (e.g., Acemoglu & Restrepo, 2022; Autor et al., 2008; Goos & Manning, 2007; Goos et al., 2009), studies for Europe show considerable cross-country variation between general upgrading and polarization (see, e.g., Fernández-Macías, 2012; Kurer & Palier, 2019; Oesch & Piccitto, 2019; Oesch & Rodríguez Menés, 2011). Only few studies investigate individual-level dynamics driving these observed aggregate trends. Using German administrative panel data, Bachmann et al. (2019) show that employment prospects of individuals in jobs with higher routine task content are generally worse and have worsened in the past four decades. For the USA, Cortes et al. (2020) analyze changes in individual-level transitions into and out of routine employment over time and find that individuals decreasingly (re-)enter routine employment from unemployment and non-participation driven by declined propensities to do so, rather than by changes in demographic composition of the labor force. For Switzerland, Kurer (2019) finds that a substantial share of routine workers transitioned into retirement in recent decades. While he suspects young labor market entrants are insufficiently replacing them and thus “natural turnover” at play, individual-level dynamics and how they are driving the changes in Swiss routine employment have remained unexplored: Are changes in inflows or outflows, e.g., into unemployment, responsible for its recent decline? Can it be accounted for by changes in the demographic composition of the labor force? Have typical routine workers increasingly renounced routine occupations because they prefer alternative employment options, or do they have an increasingly difficult time finding such a job? And are specific demographic groups particularly affected by this occupational change? This paper investigates these questions and provides three main contributions. First, drawing from a representative Swiss panel data set, I analyze transition rates into and out of employment in routine occupations between 1992 and 2018. I classify survey respondents in accordance with their labor market status (employed, unemployed, non-participation), and following recent literature (e.g., Acemoglu & Autor, 2011; Cortes et al., 2017; Jaimovich & Siu, 2020), I split the group of employed workers into four occupational groups (routine manual, routine cognitive, non-routine manual, non-routine cognitive) in order to track their transitions over time. I show that decreasing inflow rates from non-routine employment and non-participation into routine jobs are accounting for their decline, and not increasing job loss or retirement rates of routine workers. Accordingly, Swiss de-routinization is not happening by natural turnover. Second, closely following the approach of Cortes et al. (2020), I perform Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions (Blinder, 1973; Oaxaca, 1973) of the changes in these key inflow rates and show that they are mostly driven by declined transition propensities conditional on demographic characteristics, rather than changes in the demographic composition of the Swiss labor force. This indicates that individuals who—given their sex, education level, age, etc., previously tended to take on routine jobs have less and less done so, e.g., because of worsened job opportunities in these occupations. Third, I demonstrate that propensities to transition from non-routine into routine employment decreased independently of workers’ demographic characteristics, but most for individuals with lower education. The decline in propensities to enter the labor market into routine cognitive jobs is mainly driven by individuals with low or medium education and middle-aged persons. Contrary to the assumption of Kurer (2019), young labor market entrants do not play a prominent role in the decline of Swiss routine employment. Understanding these individual-level dynamics is important for three reasons. First, characterizing the process of declining routine employment on an individual-level helps to formalize and evaluate theories on how digitalization is affecting different labor markets, with Switzerland representing a coordinated but still rather flexible and high-skilled variant that builds on a employment-centered dual education system. If the declining share of routine employment were mainly due to demographic changes, such as the aging of the Swiss population or the increasing participation of women, one could argue that it is a natural consequence of demographic or societal change. If, on the other hand, the changes are mainly due to changes in propensities to work in routine jobs, this would suggest that it might be attributable to occupational change driven by digitalization. Second, and particularly relevant for policy makers, the understanding of these individual-level dynamics facilitates to identify and comprehend economic, societal and political implications of de-routinization in Switzerland. Whether de-routinization is happening rather gradually by declining inflows into routine employment or through large-scale layoffs of routine workers will likely impact the economic and social status as well as political preferences of affected individuals.Footnote 1 Third, and related to the previous point, it reveals occupational and demographic groups that may not benefit or even experience disadvantages from occupational change induced by digitalization and might therefore be suitable targets of policy aiming at diminishing adverse labor market effects of digital transformation. The remainder if this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a short review of the literature on labor market effects of digital technology and how it might affect supply and demand for routine employment in Switzerland. In Sect. 3, I introduce the panel data set used, the Swiss Labour Force Survey, in more detail and elaborate how it allows the observation of flows between different labor market states in Switzerland from 1992 to 2018. Section 4 follows with the identification of changes in transition rates that are driving the decline in routine employment. In Sect. 5, I perform Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions of the changes in these key transition rates. In Sect. 6, I discuss my findings and compare them with the results of Cortes et al. (2020) for the USA. Section 7 concludes.",

This relationship between exchange rates and prices is often referred to as the exchange rate pass-through, and identifying the determinants of its cross-country and cross-industry differences has been a major research topic in international economics. This paper estimates the exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices using data from the 2015 Swiss franc appreciation. While the literature on the exchange rate pass-through is extensive, this study contributes to the existing research by (i) taking an alternative and more causal approach based on the difference-in-differences methodology, and (ii) providing pass-through estimates for a broad range of categories of goods and services, which allows to study the heterogeneity between product categories. The Swiss National Bank (SNB) introduced an exchange rate floor on the Swiss franc on September 6, 2011. This change of policy results from considerable pressure for the Swiss franc to appreciate following the European debt crisis. The safe haven position of Switzerland plays a significant role in the appreciation pressure on the Swiss franc (Baltensperger and Kugler, 2016), attracting foreign capital during external crises and global uncertainty (Ranaldo and Söderlind, 2010). Consequently, the sovereign debt crisis that started in Greece undermined the stability of the whole euro area, leading to a Swiss franc appreciation. As such, the EUR/CHF rate decreased from 1.28 in January 2010 to 1.12 in August 2010, namely an appreciation of 12.5% in only 8 months that was detrimental to Swiss exports. With interest rates already close to zero, the SNB decided to respond with foreign exchange interventions and to introduce an explicit minimum rate on the EUR/CHF at 1.20 Swiss franc per Euro to prevent a domestic appreciation (Hui et al., 2016). This floor was maintained until January 15, 2015, when the SNB surprised financial markets by renouncing its exchange rate commitments. The underlying reason can be traced back to the European Central Bank (ECB) quantitative easing program, which made the minimum rate too expensive to maintain as it required ever-increasing purchases of foreign exchange (Lleo and Ziemba, 2015). This decision came together with the implementation of negative interest rates by the SNB. Financial markets reacted with a sudden appreciation of the Swiss franc, with the EUR/CHF rate decreasing as low as 0.975 on the day of the announcement. The Swiss franc then depreciated and stabilized in the 1.04 to 1.09 range for the rest of the year, so that the Swiss franc appreciated by approximately 10% overall. All the available evidence suggests that the SNB’s decision surprised the market (Mirkov et al., 2019). Swiss consumer prices subsequently dropped following the announcement (Fig. 1), reflecting how the cheaper import costs were passed on to consumer prices. The decline in Swiss prices is exceptional considering it happened in a period of rising prices in Europe. The discrepancy between the inflation that should have happened in Switzerland and the decline of prices that was observed instead shows how large and impactful the exchange rate shock was. Aggregate consumer prices before and after the currency appreciation. Notes Monthly HICP all-items index with January 2014 prices normalized to 100. Europe is a GDP-weighted price average of 33 European countries excluding Switzerland. Data source: Eurostat (2022) The theoretical literature on the exchange rate pass-through is summarized in Menon (1995) and Burstein & Gopinath (2014). The pass-through to consumer prices is often incomplete due to imperfect competition, product heterogeneity, tariffs, trade structure, and non-tariff barriers. That is, exchange rate shocks are not transmitted one-to-one to consumer prices. Empirical estimates of the pass-through can thus differ across product categories because these forces apply differently to different types of goods and services. A large empirical literature study investigated the exchange rate pass-through. The most common estimates of the pass-through to consumer prices make use of VAR methods over long periods of time. This methodology has been used extensively to compute estimates for most countries across the worldFootnote 1. Using the VAR methodology, Stulz (2007) estimates an average 1-year pass-through to consumer prices of 0.17 in Switzerland during the 1967–2004 period. A more recent approach to the pass-through identification is to exploit large exchange rate shocks. In particular, the Swiss franc appreciation of 2015 has been used by Auer et al. (2019), Bonadio et al. (2020), Kaufmann & Renkin (2019), and Freitag % Lein (2022) to analyze various aspects of the exchange rate pass-through to border prices. Auer et al. (2021) also use this episode to compute the pass-through to retail consumer prices, estimating a 1-year pass-through of 0.075 for retail domestic products and 0.366 for retail imported products.Footnote 2 Lastly, differences in pass-through estimates have been explained by the degree of international tradability (Edwards & Cabezas, 2022), the import share of goods (Breinlich et al., 2022; Fleer et al., 2016), and the invoice currency for border prices (Auer et al., 2021). This paper proposes a difference-in-differences (DID) approach to estimate the exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices. Contrary to the common VAR approach, this methodology leverages specific and large shocks instead of long time series to compute the pass-through. Given a large enough one-sided shock, parallel pre-trends, and a comparable counterfactual, the DID approach can more closely identify the pass-through than simple VAR methods. In the Swiss appreciation case using Europe as a control group, these conditions would be met if the EUR/CHF franc shock largely affected Swiss consumer prices but not European consumer prices. This is the case to a large degree since Switzerland is a small open economy relying heavily on trade with European countries, but its small relative size makes Swiss shocks negligible for the European economy. Two versions of the DID are proposed: a standard DID using a GDP-weighted average of European countries as the control group, and a synthetic DID based on Arkhangelsky et al. (2021) which selects the European countries weights to make its pre-shock consumer prices as parallel to Swiss consumer prices as possible. These estimates are computed for 85 product categories using the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP) data from Eurostat (2022). The results outline an important pass-through heterogeneity across categories of goods and services. The 1-year exchange rate pass-through to the all-items consumer price index is 0.12. However, the pass-through of the individual product categories ranges from − 0.31 to 0.80, which shows the large difference that exist between products. Aggregating the results by groups, the average pass-through is 0.18 for Food & Beverages, 0.14 for Household Products, 0.15 for Services, 0.09 for Services excluding holiday and air transport, and 0.29 for Industrial and Other goods. The pass-through heterogeneity of the products can be linked to the degree of international tradability, with services and nontradables having close to no pass-through. Notable exceptions to this are tourism-related services, who faced a large price drop due to a decline of foreign demand following the currency appreciation. Moreover, the fraction of imported goods in consumer expenditures (import share) can also be linked to the differences in pass-through between product categories. Lastly, the invoice currency of the goods could not be tied to the heterogeneity, most likely due to the lack of data for non-retails goods. These estimates contribute to the pass-through literature in two ways. First, they show that a DID approach provides results that are quantitatively similar to the common VAR approach but with a higher degree of identification. Moreover, this alternative approach requires less data, does not rely on a sophisticated model, and can be easily computed for many categories of products. Second, they provide a deeper understanding of the pass-through mechanism by analyzing the heterogeneity between product categories. Indeed, they further develop the recent results of Edwards & Cabezas (2022), Breinlich et al. (2022), and Auer et al. (2021) regarding the role of the degree of tradability, the import share, and the invoice currency in the exchange rate pass-through by extending their analyses to services and non-retail goods. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the data. Section 3 analyzes
pre-trends of consumer prices in Switzerland and in Europe. Section 4 presents the
estimates of the exchange rate pass-through to consumer prices for all categories
of goods and services. Section 5 explores how tradability, the import share, and
the invoice currency could explain the pass-through heterogeneity across product
categories. Section 6 concludes.",
158,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,05 December 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-022-00100-9,The limits of internal devaluation: Switzerland during the great depression,December 2022,Peter Rosenkranz,Tobias Straumann,Ulrich Woitek,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The basic relationship between the interwar gold standard and the duration of the Great Depression is well known. Most economic historians agree that countries staying on gold until the mid-1930s—the so-called gold bloc consisting of Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Italy, and Poland—experienced a longer economic crisis in the 1930s than the UK and the Scandinavian countries which left the gold standard as early as 1931 (Choudhri & Kochin, 1980; Eichengreen & Sachs, 1985; Campa, 1990; Bernanke & James, 1991; Eichengreen, 1992; Feinstein et al., 1997). Empirical studies have also demonstrated that the main determinants of the timing of abandoning the gold parity were deflationary pressure, the existence of banking crises, the gold cover ratio, and the extent of trade integration (Wolf, 2007; 2008). Yet, we still lack a deeper quantitative understanding of why the gold bloc countries were not able to induce a sufficient depreciation of the real exchange rate by internal devaluation, i.e., by lowering nominal wages and prices. If they had succeeded, they would have been able to restore the price competitiveness of their tradable sectors which would have mitigated the severity of the economic crisis. To contribute to a better understanding of the limits of internal devaluation during the Great Depression, we investigate the policies of the Swiss authorities. Switzerland is a particularly interesting case because the Swiss National Bank (SNB) disposed of such large amounts of gold reserves that it managed to withstand any period of capital outflows without raising the official discount rate in a dramatic way. All other countries were forced to tighten their monetary policies when faced with speculative attacks on their currencies. The Swiss case thus enables us to study the mechanism of internal devaluation without the inference of monetary policy shocks. We approach the problem in two steps. First, we provide the historical background and discuss the dynamics of wages and prices. Our descriptive approach shows a high degree of asynchrony of wage and price movements due to different business cycles of the external sectors and the domestic economy. From 1929 to 1932, wholesale prices fell by a third and consumer prices by a fifth, then leveled out, whereas nominal wages did not start to move downwards until 1932 and declined by only 10 percent until 1936 when the Swiss franc was devalued which marked the end of the Great Depression in Switzerland. The reason for the late decline of nominal wages was the boom of the domestic economy, in particular of the building sector, that lasted until 1931. Thus, in the first phase of the depression, wages failed to adjust because of institutional constraints, but due to the persistence of domestic demand, and as prices rapidly declined, real wages rose from 1929 until 1931 which put the exporting sectors in a particular difficult situation after the nominal exchange rate strongly appreciated in the wake of the devaluation of the British pound, the US dollar and many other currencies. By 1936 when the Swiss franc was devalued real wages were still higher than in 1929, although nominal wages had drifted downwards for several years. By contrast, consumer prices became very sticky in the second phase of the depression. The reason was that the long duration of the crisis led to all sorts of protectionist and regulatory measures aimed at stabilizing economic activity and securing political peace. Of course, the increasing rigidity of prices led to the exact opposite. The lesson to be drawn from the Swiss experience is that even in a liberal market economy the extent to which wages and prices could be lowered was limited. Wage movements depended on the domestic business cycle, whereas price movements increasingly became a function of corporatist compromises. The second part of the paper is devoted to the econometric analysis of the costs and limits of the policies pursued by the Swiss authorities. We estimate the structural parameters of a New Keynesian small open economy model for Switzerland in the spirit of Clarida  (2000, 2001) and Galí Monacelli (2005), going beyond the calibration exercise in Bordo  (2007). We explicitly take into account the fact that Switzerland was not forced to increase nominal interest rates during the Gold Bloc period due to the massive gold inflow starting with the German crisis in June 1931 and intensifying after Britain went off gold. Following Ireland (2004), the model incorporates a vector autoregressive measurement error component capturing the dynamics in the data which are not represented by the economic part. This feature allows to assess the model’s suitability for the data under analysis. Moreover, it is possible to compare the relative importance of the structural shocks (foreign demand shock and terms of trade shock) with the contribution of the measurement error block by looking at the decomposition of the forecast error variance. The results show that the economic part of the model contributes a significant variance share. The structural approach enables us to embark on a counterfactual experiment by simulating the Swiss economy in the case of a devaluation of the Swiss franc in September 1931, the month at which the UK left gold. Our results show that the terms of trade shock played an important role for the Swiss economy during the Interwar Period. While foreign demand was recovering after 1932, the terms of trade further deteriorated. Consequently, the latter effect dominated the foreign demand impulse and led to a long-lasting recession, which only ended when Switzerland left gold in September 1936. As a result, our counterfactual analysis implies that in case of an earlier devaluation of the Swiss franc, the economy would have recovered a lot faster and reached its steady state level shortly after leaving gold: the decision to defend the parity turned out to be extremely costly. This finding is in line with the successful recovery of Sweden after leaving gold together with the UK (Rathke et al., 2017).",

By allowing for the timely settlement of transactions, such as securities or funding transactions, FMIs assure that a bank can cover its refinancing needs and meet its payment obligations at all times. Particularly at the height of the global financial crisis, i.e. after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in mid-September 2008, a timely settlement was important in order to prevent the emergence of rumours that a bank is in arrears with its payment obligations and potentially illiquid. In this paper, we assess the efficiency of the existing FMI in Switzerland and try to identify the factors that slow the settlement of financial transactions. To identify these so-called settlement impediments, we use individual bank-to-bank transaction data from the secured money market, so-called repo transactions. Our data set spans from 2008 to 2020 and hence covers phases with both scarce and excess liquidity, heightened market stress, and positive and negative money market interest rates. The settlement of repo transactions is complex as it involves, in addition to the transfer of cash, the selection of securities and the simultaneous exchange of these securities against cash (i.e. delivery versus payment, or DvP). An essential element for the efficient functioning of secured money markets is thus the interoperability between the various FMI elements, i.e. the interlinkages between the trading venue and the payment and collateral settlement systems. The Swiss case is interesting for the following reasons. First, the so-called Money Market Value Chain (MMVC) is a fully integrated and highly automated infrastructure which covers both trading as well as the settlement of the securities on the books of the Swiss central securities depository (CSD) and the transfer of cash in the central bank’s real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system. Second, the secured Swiss franc money market is an international market, with one-third of its active financial institutions domiciled outside of Switzerland and hence, directly participating from abroad [see Auer and Kraenzlin (2011) and Kraenzlin and Nellen (2015)]. Third, more than 70% of the securities delivered are so-called cross-border collateral, i.e. securities issued outside Switzerland and denominated in currencies other than the Swiss franc. This cross-border dimension increases the complexity of the settlement process, as non-domestic financial institutions have to transfer the securities from their local CSD to SIX SIS Ltd. (SIS), the Swiss CSD, to settle Swiss franc repo transactions. We find that no transaction settles faster that 12 s and take this as evidence that 12 s is the fastest settlement time that the existing MMVC can attain. We also find that 20% of all transactions settle at this minimum. However, we also find that there are various non-technical factors, such as the counterparty’s domicile or the size of the transaction, which can delay the settlement. Our analysis indicates that the bottleneck in settlement is not the cash side but is rather related to the management and availability of eligible collateral, i.e. high-quality liquid assets (HQLA). HQLA is the collateral standard in the Swiss repo market. During the global financial crisis, the HQLA universe was reduced due to issuer downgrades. Furthermore, the demand for HQLA increased due to the introduction of the LCR in 2015. As a consequence, the stock of freely available HQLA became scarce and hence led to settlement times which were higher than the 12 s that would technologically be possible. For a well-functioning and efficient repo market, it will thus be important that participants hold sufficient HQLA and that the assets are available at the right time and place. Banks domiciled outside Switzerland are very active cash takers and typically pool their securities at their local CSD, e.g. at Euroclear or Clearstream. Consequently, these participants need to transfer the securities to SIS for the repo transactions to settle. Cross-border availability of securities thus needs to be addressed and improved. In the final section of the paper, we discuss to what extent this could be done by improving the interoperability of existing infrastructures or by using new technologies. The paper contributes to the existing literature by providing in-depth empirical evidence on the efficiency of an FMI for the settlement of repo transactions. The efficiency of financial market segments, such as the secured money market, has not been empirically analysed until now. By providing evidence on the current efficiency standard, and also current inefficiencies, we and others provide a benchmark for future FMI, which can rely either on a centralized or decentralized architecture. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. “Literature” section embeds our research into the broader literature. “Data set, institutional set-up, and descriptive statistics” section describes the data set and the institutional set-up of the Money Market Value Chain. We describe the methodology in “Methodology” section. Subsequently, we discuss the regression results and conclude in “Regression results” section and “Discussion and conclusion” section, respectively.",

It is my own unbalanced assessment of economics as an academic discipline and the work of economists during the pandemic’s first two years with a clear focus on Switzerland. Why personal? A fascinating research strand, nicely summarized by one of its founders, Ulrike Malmendier (2021), shows that personal experiences of economic events and outcomes, from global crises such as a pandemic to individual experiences such as a job loss, can shape individual expectations and attitudes. These changes in perception, and perhaps even preferences, can impact choices for years to come. It would thus be naive and logically inconsistent to believe that academic economists were untouched by their environment or by their personal experience.
 It is thus only fair to disclose my own predisposition: I have always been interested in policy, be it social or economic. When I traded math/physics for economics, the proximity of social aspects was key. Individuals and countries are not machines that can be understood without a context, let alone be programmed. The same is true for medical science, my second lay passion. I wrote my diploma thesis on the progression of AIDS in the late 80 s, with the first available individual-level data on the disease. Last, but not least, I have always kept one foot outside academia. Considering issues from another angle helps to come up with more nuanced views. But even after leaving university, I am still a scientist at heart, an empiricist to be more precise.
 In fact, academic research has provided an important backbone for those of us working on public policy during the crisis. Literally, thousands of papers by economists on issues around COVID-19 have mushroomed since the onset of the crisis. The two most important research networks in economics alone, CEPR and NBER, published more than 1000 high-quality COVID-19-related research papers in the first 15 months of the pandemic. While the frequency of new contributions is somewhat petering off with the research on the pandemic maturing, there will be many more to come. This journal—with its Special Focus on COVID-19—has done an excellent job in publishing papers that are based on sound economic research but cover topics that are relevant to (Swiss) economic policy (Tille et al., 2022).
 In this paper, I look at the role of economics as an academic discipline and academic economists during the pandemic. Starting from the efforts to shed light on the economic aspects of the crisis in research, I will comment on the challenges economists faced when directly involved in policy advice and working in interdisciplinary groups of academics and under time pressure. Two important qualifications: To summarize academic economists’ contribution during the pandemic would break the mould of such an essay. The paper thus has a clear focus, or call it bias, first, on Switzerland and, second, on public work done by economists in the Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force (ncs-tf).
 The first part of the paper focuses on the “how”. After a short overview of the research efforts related to COVID-19, I describe the role of academic economists in firefighting teams such as the Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Force, and in informing decision-makers and the public during the pandemic. This was no easy task as interests among the public and within the private sector often conflicted and acceptable trade-offs in terms of measures to fight the pandemic were difficult to be found. In contrast to other academic disciplines involved during the pandemic, however, academic economists had ample experience in working with politics and the administration due to prior exposure to global crises, notably the financial crisis. The paper’s second part deals with the “what”: It describes, among other things, the importance of data and the sound application of economic principles to answer new questions emerging during the pandemic. Two findings stand out. First, simple economic ideas and tools were extremely useful in understanding the crisis and come up with good ideas for policy. Second, academic economists were very creative in finding new data or new ways to display them and thus contributed in important ways to better policy options. An essay covering an important and severe, yet ultimately limited, crisis would not be very insightful if it did not lend itself to learnings that survive the pandemic. I will try to comment on potential improvements for (policy) work by economists throughout the paper and summarize these lessons in my conclusions. One important lesson is that academic scholars—be it in economics or other fields—should not be punished for providing public goods such as communicating to the public, or analysis not directly publishable in reputable journals. On the contrary: we need ways to support internationally respected scholars in venturing out of the ivory tower for certain periods in their career.",
158,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,18 October 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-022-00096-2,160 Years of aggregate supply and demand in Switzerland,December 2022,Rebecca Stuart,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"This paper studies economic fluctuations in Switzerland over the last 160 years. A complete analysis would require an assessment of a wide range of economic phenomena such as changes in technology, demographic changes including in the size and composition of the labour force, and the availability and cost of capital, to mention just a few. The level of ambition here is more modest. The paper takes a small but important forward step by providing an econometric study of Swiss business cycles over the period 1855 to 2015. The analysis focuses on the relative importance of disturbances to the economy’s supply capacity versus shifts in the demand for goods and services in accounting for cyclical swings in output and inflation. Previous studies have discussed the development of the Swiss economy in this period, while others have considered econometrically those forces acting on the economy over shorter samples. However, I am not aware of a study that provides econometric estimates of supply and demand shocks impacting the Swiss economy over such a long period. Since few data series are available for such an extended sample, I focus on annual data on real GDP and consumer prices. To estimate the aggregate supply and demand shocks and study their economic effects, a structural VAR framework is employed. Using only these time series, it is difficult to think of how to identify supply and demand shocks. I make use of an intuitive identification strategy, suggested by Ball, Mankiw and Romer (1988) and employed in Stuart (2019), that assumes that the price elasticity of aggregate demand is (minus) unity. The estimated shocks are discussed in detail and variance and historical decompositions of their effects on GDP growth and inflation are provided. The long sample period, which begins in 1855 and ends in 2015, covers several important episodes in Swiss economic history, including the establishment of a Swiss monetary system in the nineteenth century, the First World War, the deflation in the 1920s and the Great Depression. The Second World War is followed by the so-called golden age of economic growth in Europe and the Bretton Woods period. The break-up of Bretton Woods and the oil crises of the 1970s are followed by the Great Moderation, and subsequently the global financial crisis of the late 2000s. As a result, within the structural VAR framework, I can answer a number of questions which have not previously been addressed in the literature. First, I show that plausible aggregate demand and supply shocks can be estimated for the entire sample period. Specifically, the shocks that I estimate clearly capture the key episodes in the sample period. These shocks indicate that aggregate supply shocks have overall had a larger impact on economic activity than aggregate demand shocks. Second, the paper discusses how the size and variance of shocks that have hit the economy have changed over the course of the sample period. The first two to three decades of the sample are characterized by numerous sizeable aggregate supply shocks. Although this is followed by a period of stability, the First World War and the interwar period are marked by large aggregate supply and demand shocks. In contrast, the more recent period, including the period of the global financial crisis, is characterized by much smaller shocks. Indeed, the analysis shows that the effects of the global financial crisis on the Swiss economy were much smaller than the First and Second World Wars, the deflation of the 1920s and the Great Depression. Third, the historical decomposition indicates which shocks were important drivers of GDP growth and inflation at different points in the cycle. While aggregate supply shocks drove much of the movements in GDP growth and inflation in the early part of the sample, aggregate demand shocks depressed prices during the Great Depression. The period of the 1960s and early 1970s is characterized by rising prices due to aggregate demand shocks, whereas the recent low inflation environment is largely due to negative demand shocks. GDP growth was similarly strongly influenced by aggregate demand shocks in the early part of the sample. Negative aggregate supply shocks play an important role in holding back GDP growth during the two World Wars, although they are offset by strong demand shocks. Much of the 1950s and 1960s are characterized by positive aggregate supply shocks. The opposite is true after the first oil crisis and the adoption of monetary targeting in the early 1970s. The growth in GDP after the global financial crisis has been affected by contractionary supply and demand shocks. The paper is structured as follows. The next section describes the historical background, while the data are described in Sect. 3. The model specification, including the identification scheme, is discussed in Sect. 4. Section 5 discusses the results of the SVAR analysis, and a historical decomposition of the impact of the supply and demand shocks on inflation and output in Switzerland over the sample period. Section 6 provides a number of robustness checks and Sect. 7 concludes.",

Important applications of peer effects models have been developed for education (Sacerdote, 2001, Cipollone & Rosolia, 2007, Lalive & Cattaneo, 2009, Sojourner, 2013, Ammermueller & Pischke, 2009, Madeira, 2018), health behaviors (Bruhin et al., 2020, Bailey et al., 2021), employment (Roth, 2020) or migration (Slotwinski et al., 2019). This work analyzes inference on nonlinear peer effects models in the presence of missing data. There are many situations (for example, drug use, teenage risk profiles, sexual behavior) where respondents might not be willing to reveal their personal experience, creating problems of missing data in the study of social interactions in these settings. Most social interaction studies use the average outcome of each group as an explanatory variable; therefore, missing outcome data imply that we face both a problem of missing outcome values and an undetermined regressor, aggravating the identification problem. It is, therefore, important to extend the robustness of the social interaction estimators to scenarios of missing data. In the linear case, Manski (1993, 2000) showed that it is difficult to distinguish between the effects of endogenous social interactions and the impact of measures of exogenous group quality. Several works analyze identification of peer effects in the linear case (Advani & Malde, 2018, Sojourner, 2013, Ammermueller & Pischke, 2009). These works analyze partial and point identification of the linear peer effects model with missing data on outcomes. Sojourner (2013) shows that if individuals are randomly assigned to each group; then, it is possible to point-identify the true coefficient for the peer effects variable. Ammermueller and Pischke (2009) show that missing data on peers create measurement error for the group variables and using an analysis similar to Hausman (2001) find upper and lower bounds for the true peer effect coefficient of the linear model. The authors then apply an instrument for the peer effects variable to obtain point identification. However, several economic decisions such as discrete choices require nonlinear models (Blume et al., 2010). Nonlinear settings for peer effects include smoking behavior (Krauth, 2006), high school truancy, cell phone ownership (Kooreman & Soetevent, 2007) or college life (Sacerdote, 2001). Brock and Durlauf (2007) present a very general model of peer effects in a discrete choice setting, showing that it is possible to identify asymptotically both exogenous and endogenous peer effects under the assumption of random group assignment and no missing data. I extend the identification results of Brock and Durlauf (2002, 2007) to the case of missing outcomes. Using an incomplete data approach proposed by Horowitz and Manski (2006), it is possible to get sharp bounds for the coefficients of this model with missing data, but this method can be time-consuming for larger peer groups. Therefore, I propose an estimator to obtain non-sharp bounds for this model based on Manski and Tamer (2002) interval regressors’ approach. My suggested approach extends the interval regressors approach of Manski and Tamer (2002) by showing that it can easily be extended for a case with both interval regressors and missing outcomes. If a discrete choice model verifies three important properties—interval values (I), mean independence (MI), monotonicity (M)—then it is possible to obtain non-sharp bounds for the true coefficients of the model. The interval values (I) regressor assumption is trivially satisfied by discrete choice models with peer effects, since the average of the discrete choices in a peer group is bounded between 0 and 1. The mean independence (MI) is also quite natural in the peer effects model, since it implies that the width of the identification interval does not matter if one conditions on the true value of the average outcome. This assumption appears natural if the agents know the true values of the average choices in their peer groups even if the econometrician only observes the group with some missing data. The third assumption, monotonicity (M), implies that the average outcome of each agent is increasing with the average group outcome. This assumption is trivially satisfied in the parametric discrete choice models, and it can also be consistent with many semi-parametric or nonparametric models. A minimum distance estimator is proposed. I also propose a bootstrap method to estimate confidence intervals for the true coefficients. A similar estimator can be easily applied to any parametric model with missing outcomes and interval regressors. I then show a set of Monte Carlo exercises with fully observed information to characterize the accuracy of the peer effects estimators even if the identification assumptions are satisfied. The Monte Carlo exercises include a wide range of different group sizes and different sample sizes for both the logit and the linear case. The Monte Carlo simulations include estimators for the cases of closed peer groups (groups in which all members are peers of each other) and non-closed groups (with each individual having peers from outside the group). Furthermore, I consider the case in which the individual is part of his own peer group and the case in which the individual is not part of its own peer group. The linear case is only shown for non-closed groups (which is required for identification, as shown in Bramoullé, Djebbari and Fortin 2009). I then apply the Manski–Tamer and Horowitz–Manski estimators to the logit peer effects models in the presence of missing outcomes. The results show that the Manski–Tamer estimator can be hundreds of times faster than the Horowitz–Manski estimator even with just a few missing values such as 10 missing outcomes. The computation time of the Horowitz–Manski estimator could be much larger with a few additional missing observations. This work focuses on the case in which missing information on missing outcomes also implies missing information or an interval regressor for the peer effect in order to be clear about this effect. This approach could also be easily generalized to other cases that also include missing control variables for the peer group members and which would also imply missing regressors or interval regressors. The case for other missing regressors would merely imply more combinations of possible datasets for the missing values for the Horowitz and Manski (2006) and additional interval regressors for the Manski and Tamer (2002) approaches suggested in this article. This article is organized as follows: Section 2 shows how the interval regressors approach of Manski and Tamer (2002) can be easily extended for a case that also has missing outcomes. Section 3 explains the calibration of the Monte Carlo exercises. Section 4 then summarizes the Monte Carlo results in the absence of missing data. The section starts by showing that the exogenous coefficients (given by the constant, exogenous variable affecting individual behavior, contextual effects group variable) have a fast convergence to the true parameter values, whether the model has endogenous peer effects or not. The same simulations show that the endogenous peer effect coefficient has a much slower convergence to its true value, presenting a high bias and standard deviation, even without any missing data. Section 5 shows the Monte Carlo exercises with missing data, analyzing the performance of the Horowitz–Manski and Manski–Tamer approaches. The results show that the Horowitz and Manski (2006) approach presents a considerable computational time. The section also summarizes the estimated interval results for all the coefficients, including both the endogenous peer effects parameter and the exogenous coefficients parameters. Finally, Sect. 6 summarizes the main results and an appendix shows the proofs of the main propositions.",

Schäublin,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Over the past few decades, the pension systems of most developed countries have been faced with a constant decline in interest rates and a constant increase in life expectancy. In Switzerland, the nominal 10-year yield on Swiss government bonds was 4% at the end of the 1980s. Since then, it constantly declined, eventually reaching \(-0.5\)% in 2020 (SNB, 2020). At the same time, between 1980 and 2018, the average life expectancy of a Swiss female at 65 increased from around 18 to 23 years, and the average life expectancy of a Swiss male at 65 increased from around 14 to 20 years; other OECD countries show similar increases (OECD, 2020). Low interest rates together with an ageing population are a challenging environment for pension funds. With higher life expectancy, pension funds’ pension liability increases, while the low interest rates make it more difficult for funds to finance these higher debt burdens with returns from low-risk assets. In many economies—including Switzerland—this challenge has stimulated discussions about the financial viability of pension systems. It also raised awareness about financing gaps that potentially must be financed by the younger generations. Further, it stimulated discussions about the need for reforms, and the need for transparent and comparable measures to assess a fund’s viability.Footnote 1 The viability of Swiss occupational pension funds is measured by the funding ratio (Deckungsgrad). This ratio is defined as the market value of a fund’s assets divided by the expected net present value of pension liabilities. By regulation, funds must maintain full funding and meet the regulatory minimum requirement of a funding ratio of 100%. That is, pension liabilities should not exceed assets. Otherwise, funds have a funding shortfall (funding ratio below 100%). Such underfunded funds are required to take recovering actions to achieve full coverage of liabilities. Distribution of Funding Ratios. Distributions of the funding ratios of pension funds pooled across all years 2006–2017, in 2007 , and in 2017. The solid line shows the smoothed fit using a local 4th-order polynomial kernel regression to the left and to the right of 100%. Binwidth of histogram and bandwidth of triangular kernel are based on the procedure by McCrary (2008). Bin at 100% omitted for polynomial fit. Figure shows spike exactly at the regulatory minimum (100%). The corresponding McCrary test for discontinuity between left and right of 100% (omitting the 100% bin) is positive and significant. The sample includes only private and public funds without state guarantees and only includes funds with a funding ratio between 81.5 and 152.3% (0.5th–95th percentile range) This paper is a descriptive analysis of the comprehensive data set of the Swiss Occupational Pension Funds Statistics collected by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (Bundesamt für Statistik, BFS). As shown in Fig. 1, the distribution of funding ratios is heavily discontinuous at the 100% threshold, with more mass to the right. This indicates that most pension funds can manage adequate funding—at least in terms of the reported funding ratio—and avoid falling below the regulatory minimum. Pension funds have little influence on exogenous factors that affect their funding stability, such as the demographics of its insurants or the returns of financial markets. However, the Swiss regulatory environment enables some flexibility on some parameters that can fundamentally affect their funding stability, such as future pension promises or the asset allocation affecting profits. Further, a fund can decide how much of their earnings to retain and how much to pay out as interest on insurants’ savings. But regulatory environment also allows some discretion concerning parameters that only influence the calculation of the funding ratio, such as the conservatism of the assumptions about future demographic developments or of the discount rate. This paper analyzes how far a fund’s choices of these parameters of discretion are statistically related to a fund’s funding ratio (or vice versa). The paper focuses on the technical discount rate and the share of assets pension funds invest in equities. For this analysis, I estimate the local averages of the technical discount rate, and the share of equity assets conditional on the funding ratio using local linear regressions and global polynomial fits. The application of higher technical discount rates allows funds to under-report the value of pension liabilities and report euphemistic funding ratios. The paper compares the average discount rates of funds grouped by similar funding ratios using local linear regressions. The results indicate that funds with lower funding ratios apply higher technical discount rates. In 2017, only 1.8% of funds had a funding ratio below 100% when evaluated with the funds’ own choice of technical discount rates. In contrast, in the same year, a counterfactual share of 28.2% of funds was insufficiently funded when approximating the value of pension liabilities at risk-free market interest rates. The resulting approximated valuation difference aggregated across all funds amounted to 15% of total reported pension liabilities, in 2017. Euphemistic reporting of pension liabilities enables funds to hide their true funding gap and thereby helps to postpone necessary structural reforms that would fundamentally improve funding. Given the low (and negative) yields on risk-free assets and the parallel increase in life expectancy, such reforms would include the reduction in pension benefits by reducing conversion rates see, e.g., (Kupper Staub and Eggenberger, 2017), or a portfolio re-allocation investing more into riskier assets [see e.g., (Seiler Zimmermann and Zimmermann, 2017)]. Given the suggestion to allow pension funds to invest more into riskier assets, the paper further analyzes pension funds asset allocation. I look at funds share of assets invested in equities, which is an approximation for the risk choice of funds asset allocation. The results show that weaker funded funds invest a lower share of equities than funds with better funding ratios. Interestingly, this relationship is only valid for funds that satisfy the regulatory minimum requirement. At the threshold of a funding ratio of 100%, the relationship is discontinuous and non-monotonous. Funds below 100% invest 3–5% more than funds above 100%. It is not possible to certainly conclude from the analysis whether better funded funds have a higher risk capacity and thus dare more to invest a higher amount into equities or whether it is the success of their higher equity allocation that allows them to accumulate earnings and build-up capital. Under the assumption that the first was true, one needs to be aware that the requirement to satisfy full funding may constrain funds in increasing their risk appetite, too much. This paper contributes to the discussion about the future viability of pensions, e.g., (Rajan, 2006; Reinhart et al., 2012; 2006), especially with its focus on Switzerland, and related calls for reforms of the current system (e.g., Amman and Bühler 2017; Greber and Moor, 2017 ; Kupper Staub and Eggenberger, 2017; Seiler Zimmermann and Zimmermann, 2017; Spuhler 2017 ,and many more). The paper is, to the best of my knowledge, one of the first of its kind analyzing the distribution of Swiss pension funds’ funding ratio, using a comprehensive data set of the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (Bundesamt für Statistik, BFS). Concerning pension funds applying favorable discount rates, the paper relates to Stalebrink and Donatella (2020) who find evidence for an increased likelihood of opportunistic accounting choices for US public pension funds in shortfall. Our paper contributes to the literature suggesting similar evidence for Switzerland. The paper further contributes to evidence on how pension funds’ (and firms’) asset allocation is related to their viability. In this respect, the results are partly in contrast with the empirical analysis by Rauh (2009), who finds that weakly funded defined benefit pension plans allocate a larger share of their investment to safer securities. A related aspect is investigated by An et al. (2013). The authors investigate the risk-taking of corporate pension funds depending on the viability of the sponsor (employer), finding that sponsors with low-funded pension promises and with high default risks avoid risk, and only funds on the verge of bankruptcy take higher risks in their pension funds. More generally, the paper is related to the issue of risk-shifting, gambling for resurrection, or search for yield, as mentioned, for example, in Jensen and Meckling (1979), or Rajan 2006. Dewatripont and Tirole 2012 provide a theoretical framework exploring the possible incentives for banks to gamble for resurrection. Further, the paper is also related to the general literature on investment policies, especially pension fund payouts and dividend policies, the quality and credibility of accounting variables (e.g., Dechow et al., 2010; Healy and Wahlen, 1999), regulatory arbitrage and favorable reporting (e.g., Behn et al., 2016), or cross-subsidization between generations. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 provides background on the Swiss occupational pension system. Section 2.1 discusses how pension funds can affect the funding ratio fundamentally by cutting pension promises or re-allocating assets to increase returns form investment, and how they can affect the ratio with accounting tricks by applying favorable technical discount rates. Section 3 describes the empirical methodology of the analysis. The results are presented and discussed in Section 4. Section 5 presents final remarks.",
158,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,09 May 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-022-00091-7,Scale effects on efficiency and profitability in the Swiss banking sector,December 2022,Marc Blatter,Andreas Fuster,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In recent years, the banking sector has faced important challenges. For instance, the globally low interest rates have gone hand in hand with reduced profitability, especially for banks that are more reliant on maturity transformation and net interest income (Claessens et al. 2018; Chaudron 2018; Molyneux et al. 2019). Furthermore, the digital transformation has already enhanced competition in the area of financial services, as FinTech and BigTech firms have entered the market, and this trend is expected to continue. The COVID-19 crisis comes on top of these pre-existing challenges to banks’ traditional business model, thereby putting additional pressure on the banking sector (Carletti et al. 2020). Aside from increasing the risk from nonperforming loans, the crisis has also accelerated digitalization tendencies, with increased popularity of contactless payments and FinTech apps used, for instance, for online trading.Footnote 1 In such an environment, the efficiency of banking services is of particular relevance. Although an increase in competition due to digitalization and new entrants is likely beneficial from the perspective of consumers, the additional pressure on already historically low margins may have detrimental effects on the stability of the financial system (Swiss National Bank , 2019, p. 6). More efficient banks are more resilient against adverse market developments and in a better position to deal with increased competition. To anticipate the effects of the ongoing developments on the banking sector it is important to understand why some banks perform better than others. This naturally raises the question of whether bank size matters for efficiency. Economies of scale in banking exist if the cost of producing an additional unit of a banking service (e.g., opening a bank account or providing a loan) decreases as the quantity of the service increases. The idea is that large banks can spread their overhead costs, such as information technology, accounting, advertising and personnel expenses, over a larger asset base. This would then increase profitability and make banks more economically viable and resilient against competition from new entrants, also providing them with the necessary room to make investments in new technologies. At the same time, an increase in bank size may also itself generate an increase in costs, for instance by enhancing organizational complexity. Using data from 1997 to 2019, we analyze how efficiency and profitability metrics of Swiss banks depend on bank size. We report five main findings. First, looking simply at the time-series evolution of the efficiency and profitability measures, it is indeed the case that Swiss banks as a group have become less efficient and profitable over time, especially in the wake of the global financial crisis (GFC) a decade ago. Second, there is strong evidence for scale economies in a sample that excludes the largest, systemically important banks (SIBs): the cost-to-income ratio (CIR) decreases with bank size while the return on assets (ROA) increases with bank size. Over the sample period as a whole, the magnitude of the effect is economically modest: a one-standard-deviation increase in bank size is associated with a 2.1 percentage point lower CIR and a 0.06 percentage point higher ROA. However, our third finding is that scale efficiencies are more pronounced in the decade after the GFC than was the case over 1997–2006; for instance, a one-standard-deviation increase in bank size is associated with a 4 percentage point lower CIR in the more recent period. Adding various bank characteristics as control variables tends to further strengthen the estimated scale effects, at least for the CIR. Fourth, there is little evidence that the scale efficiencies extend to larger banks. The three domestic and two global Swiss SIBs in fact have significantly higher CIRs and lower ROAs than the largest non-SIBs. This may be due to the differences in the business model and balance sheet composition between the largest banks and their smaller counterparts—the globally active banks’ international scope and the relatively high share of trading assets seem to make it difficult for them to realize scale economies. Our fifth main finding is that good capitalization and high efficiency and profitability are compatible. A thorny question for studies of scale economies is whether the relationship between size and efficiency is causal: are banks more efficient because they are larger, or are they larger because they are more efficient (and therefore able to grow)? We attempt to shed some light on this issue by relying on a subset of “cantonal banks” that historically operated almost exclusively within the boundaries of their home canton (and to this day do most of their business in that canton).Footnote 2 As a consequence, the size of these banks is strongly correlated with the population of their home canton. We therefore use the population of cantons in 1995 as an instrumental variable (IV) for bank size. OLS and IV estimates turn out to be similar within this sample, and confirm the presence of scale economies, especially in the post-GFC period. This exercise thus suggests that there is likely a causal effect of bank size on efficiency/profitability. Our evidence for economies of scale in the banking sector suggests that small- and medium-sized banks will face particular challenges in an environment characterized by reduced profitability and increased competition. Consolidation via mergers could be a natural way to increase efficiency. A merger may lead to cost savings, for instance, by reducing overlaps in the branch network and by consolidating back-office work. A recent example for a big domestic merger is that between the Spanish banks CaixaBank and state-owned Bankia announced in September 2020. It is to be expected that similar deals will follow elsewhere in the banking union. In fact, the European regulator is encouraging new alliances. The European Central Bank (ECB) recently published a guideline outlining its supervisory approach to consolidation in the banking sector and announced that it will make use of its supervisory tools to facilitate sustainable consolidation projects.Footnote 3 Our paper relates to an extensive empirical literature on efficiency and scale economies in banking. Overall, the evidence on scale economies is not fully conclusive. Early studies using data on US banks found economies of scale limited to relatively small banks with deposits from $10–25 million (Benston et al. 1982) or assets less than $10 billion (Berger and Mester 1997).Footnote 4 More recent studies instead find evidence for economies of scale for larger banks (Wheelock and Wilson 2012; Kovner et al. 2014; Hughes et al. 2019). A possible explanation for why optimal bank size may have increased is the dissemination of information technologies and the proliferation of scalable market-based operations (Laeven et al. 2014). Wheelock and Wilson (2018) analyze the evolution of scale economies in the US banking sector and find that most of the largest US banks had increasing returns to scale both before and after the financial crisis. For European banks, the evidence is mixed. Beccalli et al. (2015) find evidence for economies of scale across different size classes of banks, including the biggest banks. In contrast, for banks in postwar Germany, Huber (2020) finds that banks did not become more efficient or more profitable after increasing in size. Like most studies on economies of scale, we focus on cost economies, i.e., the ability of banks to efficiently use overhead in administrative and back-office operations. To estimate scale economies, we follow the methodology used by Bertay et al. (2013) and Kovner et al. (2014). Basically, this consists of regressing common measures for efficiency and profitability on bank size, controlling for various bank characteristics. Like Hughes et al. (2019), we also form different bank size categories and examine cost and revenue differences across those categories. The advantage of a methodology relying on common efficiency measures is that it is transparent and easy to replicate, therefore allowing for a comparison of results from different countries. Many other studies, e.g., Berger and Mester (1997) and Wheelock and Wilson (2018), use alternative (and more complicated) methodologies based on the parametric or nonparametric estimation of bank cost (and also revenue and profit) functions. From those, they derive estimates of returns to scale. There are a few previous studies on efficiency in the Swiss banking sector. Using estimated cost and profit functions, Rime and Stiroh (2003) examined the performance of Swiss banks in the 1996–1999 period. They found evidence of economies of scale for small and mid-size banks, but not for the largest banks. Our sample includes fewer banks (since we restrict the sample to domestically focused banks), but for a much longer period, 1997–2019. In the middle of our sample period, the Swiss banking sector was hit by the 2007–2009 financial crisis, making necessary a public intervention to stabilize the largest Swiss bank. After a period of sustained growth since the late 1990s, the large, universal banks have substantially reduced their total assets in recent years. Overall, our results confirm the evidence for scale economies in Rime and Stiroh (2003), but only for the later years. In the early part of our sample period, we do not find much evidence that our efficiency and profitability metrics improve with bank size, even for small to mid-size banks. Dietrich and Wanzenried (2011) use a dynamic panel approach to analyze the determinants of bank profitability for Swiss banks in the 1999–2009 period. Using the Fitch-IBCA Bankscope database, they find that bank profitability is mainly explained by operational efficiency, the growth of total loans, funding costs and the business model. They use the CIR as a measure of operational efficiency and the ROA as a measure of profitability, but do not focus on bank size as a determinant of these outcomes. They find that more efficient banks are more profitable than less efficient banks.Footnote 5 We contribute to the literature on efficiency in banking by using a sample with a long time-series dimension, covering more than 20 years and allowing us to differentiate between the period before and after the GFC. The sample includes banks which differ substantially with regard to their size and business model (in particular, the non-SIBs versus the two globally active banks, UBS and Credit Suisse). While it is difficult to fully disentangle the importance of size versus other bank characteristics in explaining efficiency and profitability differences across these bank types, we propose an intuitive methodology for doing so. Furthermore, to our knowledge, we are the first to instrument for bank size based on the (historical) population of the local area where banks conduct most of their business. From a social welfare perspective, besides scale economies, the efficient scale of banks also depends on other factors that we do not consider in this paper. In particular, we do not directly consider economies of diversification or scope, i.e., the returns when banks can use information from one activity to offer other activities at lower costs (e.g., Drucker and Puri 2005). Neither do we consider potential costs of banks being too-big-to-fail (TBTF). Hughes and Mester (2013) note that a larger bank size may generate scale economies due to diversification, but also due to incentives to take more risk. In a model accounting for risk-taking, they find large-scale economies for US banks, which are not driven by TBTF subsidies. In contrast, Davies and Tracey (2014) no longer find evidence of scale economies for a sample of large banks after controlling for TBTF factors. To determine policy implications, it is necessary to balance the efficiency gains from larger banks against the potential reduction in bank competition and a potential increase in financial stability risks. Boyd and Heitz (2016) try to balance the social cost and benefits of TBTF banks. They conclude that the potential benefits due to economies of scale are unlikely to exceed the potential costs due to increased systemic risk.Footnote 6 Assessing the benefits of scale efficiencies arising from larger banks against reduced bank competition is particularly challenging. The social welfare effects of bank competition itself are ambiguous. Competition is a driver of efficiency, but it may also be detrimental for financial stability due to excessive risk-taking or credit expansion (see Vives , 2019). Due to the complicated relationship between competition and financial stability in banking, we do not attempt to draw policy recommendations concerning the socially optimal bank size. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the Swiss banking sector. Section 3 describes the dataset, defines the efficiency measures used to test for economies of scale and provides descriptive statistics. Sections 4 and 5 present and discuss the results. Section 6 concludes.",2

Whether or not such decentralization is beneficial or what degree of decentralization would be efficient, however, is the subject of a long-standing debate. In this paper, I contribute to the discussion by offering two extensions that are central in the context of decentrally determined income taxation: First, I allow for a progressive income tax scheme, for which the residents of each local jurisdiction vote on a tax rate multiplier to determine the size of the municipal budget; and, second, I allow for a fiscal equalization scheme that redistributes money from the rich to the poor local jurisdictions. This setup reflects the implementation of fiscal decentralization in many federal countries. For example, it corresponds to the situation in Switzerland, where the high degree of decentralized government autonomy down to the municipal level is widely believed to be one of the cornerstones for the well-functioning of the country.Footnote 1 The empirical literature shows that the municipalities engage in income tax competition, which induces rich households to sort into the municipalities with lower tax rates (see, e.g., Feld and Kirchgaessner 2001; Schmidheiny 2006a). Roller and Schmidheiny (2016) look at the effective average and marginal tax rates of Swiss households. They find that the redistributive character of using progressive taxes is weakened—if not reversed—when tax rates are set at the municipal level, simply because the rich can avoid taxes by residing in municipalities with low tax rates.Footnote 2 These observations are in line with theoretical models with decentrally determined residence-based taxation, that also predict a segregation of the population according to income across municipalities. The claim is that this Tiebout sorting may cause significant disparities in municipality characteristics, which include tax rates, public good provision, and housing prices.Footnote 3 For the case of decentrally determined property taxation, see, e.g., Epple and Platt (1998), Epple et al. (2001), and Calabrese et al. (2006). For the case of decentrally determined income taxation, see, e.g., Calabrese (2001), who investigates the (limited) ability of linear income taxation for within-jurisdictional redistribution in the presence of tax competition, and Schmidheiny (2006b), who calibrates a model to the metropolitan area around the city of Zurich. Schmidheiny assumes that the publicly provided good does not create inter-jurisdictional spillovers and is perfectly rival in consumption, he considers a linear tax rate scheme, and he ignores the existence of transfers between jurisdictions. The present paper can be interpreted as an extension to Schmidheiny’s model in that it relaxes all of these restrictions. On normative grounds and for the case of a linear income tax rate with a spillover-generating publicly provided good with imperfect rivalry in consumption, Kuhlmey and Hintermann (2019) identify two inefficiencies in the presence of Tiebout-like sorting: (i) some households free-ride on the other household’s tax payments within a given municipality, which leads to an inefficient allocation of households (i.e., intra-municipal free-riding) and (ii) municipalities free-ride on the provision of the publicly provided good in the other municipalities (i.e., inter-municipal free-riding). The former has also been labeled the “Jurisdictional Choice Externality” (JCE) by Calabrese et al. (2012), the latter is the classical free-riding. For a good with intermediate levels of spillovers and rivalry, they quantify each inefficiency to account for about one-third of the total welfare loss from Tiebout sorting with decentrally determined income taxation when compared to the decisions of a utilitarian social planner with access to individualized lump-sum taxes.Footnote 4 (The last third of the welfare loss is due to imperfect redistribution.) Without further restrictions such as asymmetric information, therefore, decentrally determined income taxation is clearly welfare-diminishing.Footnote 5 In this setting, central governments aim for policies that limit these negative consequences from decentralization. They have different options at their disposal that can be employed to restrict the degree of strategic behavior among households and local governments: command and control strategies (of, e.g., tax rates or the definition of the tax scheme), subsidies for publicly provided goods and services, or matching grants from a higher-level government. A combination of these instruments can be used to design a fiscal equalization scheme (FES). In such a scheme, the central government forces rich municipalities to pay, while offering subsidies to the poor municipalities (such that the rich municipalities become less rich and the poor, less poor). As a consequence, employing FESs should align the distinctive characteristics of the included municipalities, in the sense that the heterogeneity of municipality characteristics will be reduced in their presence. Previous approaches and methods for assessing FESs were mostly limited to the presence of capital tax schemes.Footnote 6 In the context of decentrally determined income taxation, the previous approaches inherently ignored adjustments in prices and quantities, and—most importantly—migration.Footnote 7 This is why I will use a calibrated general equilibrium model to assess the effect of progressive local income taxation and the effect of a local FES on the size of the two inefficiencies. The JCE translates to an inefficient segregation of households and the inter-municipal free-riding implies too low production and consumption levels of the publicly provided good, whenever the publicly provided goods exhibits spillovers. I will first gradually remove the fiscal equalization scheme to see to what extent the FES effectively reduces the JCE and contributes towards increasing public good levels. As a second policy evaluation, I will change the tax scheme, which is exogenous to the municipalities (which only set a tax rate multiplier) to quantify the effect of progression on the two inefficiencies. Both instruments are set by the central government and therefore taken as being exogenous to the local governments. To perform the policy evaluations sketched above, I build on the model of Kuhlmey and Hintermann (2019). I allow for spillover-generating and imperfectly rival public goods, but also extend it in three dimensions: I add taste heterogeneity with respect to the publicly provided good, I model the local fiscal equalization scheme (as it is implemented in the canton of Zurich), and I allow for a progressive (cantonal) tax code. I then calibrate this model to the metropolitan area of Zurich. Municipalities in the canton of Zurich are (1) restricted to set a linear multiplier on the cantonal progressive income tax scheme, and (2), depending on their relative fiscal capacity, they also receive money from or pay money to a FES, which aims at aligning the fiscal capacity.Footnote 8 I can show that compared to a revenue-neutral linear tax scheme, the implemented progressive tax scheme in Zurich indeed increases the segregation of rich and poor households: Whereas the average income in the ‘rich’ municipality is on average only \(30\%\) higher than in the ‘poor’ municipality, this difference increases to \(60\%\) for the progressive tax scheme. The second policy that I evaluate is the FES. Here I can show that it effectively limits the degree of segregation: As I decrease its redistributional effects, I predict a considerable increase in the segregation of rich and poor households between municipalities. With regard to the underprovision of the publicly provided good, neither of the two policy instruments effectively curb this prevailing underprovision. The structure of the paper is as follows: In the next section, I present and describe the model, which is calibrated to the metropolitan area of Zurich in Sect. 3. In Section 4, I gradually remove the fiscal equalization scheme to assess its impact and also discuss changes in the cantonal progressive tax code. Section 5 concludes.",

The increasing construction activity resulted in the rapid consumption of construction grounds since hardly any restrictions and regulations for land use were applied. To address this increasingly important issue, several regional and local regulations were enacted, and spatial planning was undertaken. The last Federal Act on Spatial Planning (Spatial Planning Act, SPA) in 2011 requested cantons to identify possible ways to limit and guide the excessive construction of leisure homes in highly affected municipalities. Many of the measures enacted at the local level were financial disincentives, taxes and cross subsidies for primary homeowners and managed accommodations. Finally, on 11 March 2012, a federal popular initiative (Lex Weber) to limit second home construction in highly affected municipalities was approved by the majority of Swiss people and cantons. This was not expected to happen, since the most affected regions voted against the law, but people in the rather urban areas were favourable to this legal change. On this date, permits for new constructions were restricted to primary home purposes, and immediate transitory measures were applied. The federal council developed a regulation on new constructions, which was enacted by the end of 2012. Following its enactment, the parliament decreed the final second home law, which replaced the transitory measures starting in 2016, this as a formal change without any important change in the legal practice (Vinzens & Hefti, 2014). A question that requires further analysis is what impact the number of second homes has on managed accommodations. One hypothesis is that among new second homeowners, overnight stays would be shifted away from hotels to their new flats and houses. The alternative to this hypothesis is that the second homeowners would be helpful in accessing additional markets for touristic areas; since these new homeowners would have high cohesion and identification with the region, they would bring new guests with them. This connected to a lower supply of second homes would incentive the construction of new managed accommodations and in this sense have an effect on the number of available hotel beds in the regions. Considering the effects of the new law on the housing prices, theory suggest an ambiguous effect. On the one hand, the prices of second homes would rise, due to the artificially capped supply on the market. On the other hand, a lower demand for new first homes would imply lower prices for first homeowners in that part of the segmented market. If the inter- and intra-cantonal migration is studied, then in consequence to the new law, more persons would choose the touristic areas as their main residence, since prices become more affordable for a larger group of potential inhabitants. Consequently this would cause a population growth in the studied municipalities. The supporting parties for this law additionally discussed that an intact landscape is the most important asset for the sustainable development of touristic activities; on the other hand, the main political debate argued that a strong reduction in construction activity would directly and indirectly impact the economic value chain, economically damaging the peripheral, touristic regions of the country. Hilber (2018), for instance, discusses the political opposition for this law in the most affected regions, where the initiative was in some cases perceived to be the result of the willingness to restrict second home construction among the residents of the Swiss Plateau being imposed on mountain dwellers. Figure 1 shows a map with the actual (2017 data) second home shares in the Swiss municipalities, with the red areas having restrictions on building new second homes. Furthermore, in their report, the Federal Office for Spatial Development ARE (2017) defines the spatial specialization and availability of construction grounds as well as land use in the various regions of Switzerland. Source: Author’s illustration of the FSO Second Home Data of 2017 Second home shares by municipality (vegetation area) in Switzerland. This research aims to contribute to this political debate, suggesting that the reduction in new building construction activity has been focused on the construction of new dwellings and has not been as strong as initially claimed by the opponents of the law. In this sense, the main research questions is on how large the effects of the second home restriction law was on the investments in new housing construction business. Furthermore, based on the descriptive results, touristic overnight stays in Swiss municipalities did not change dramatically—only a slight shift in overnight stays from touristic central municipalities to the surroundings was identified in some important touristic regions.

Sections 4 and 5 explain the data and the empirical structure. In Sects. 6 and 7, the results on the impacts on new buildings are explained, and concluding remarks with a wider view of the law’s impact, as well as the variations in the tourism industry, are presented.",1

For example, in survey methodology, determining a proper approach for some problems, such as appropriate strategies for following up nonresponse units in the phase of data collection, assessment of measurement errors of main variables among individuals that responded and imputation of nonresponse, is usually based on the modeling. Another example in economics is to model productivity or efficiency in a sector in the form of secondary analysis of survey data or to examine the relationship between turnover and value added of an establishment with some factors related to production such as the number of employees based on microdata of an establishment survey. Most surveys suffer from nonresponse and their microdata are often incomplete. Nonresponse can increase errors of estimates or lead to model misspecification and biased results, especially in the case of nonignorable nonresponse. Heckman  (1976, 1979) presented a method to adjust bias due to the nonresponse in modeling of a dependent variable. He considered a model for nonresponse called sample selection model and presented the estimates of the parameters and the variances of the estimators by assuming nonresponse variable as binary and normal distribution for the errors components of two models  (nonresponse and variable of interest models). Hanoch  (1976) extended the Heckman approach for multivariate dependent variables with one equation for nonresponse mechanism and investigated main factors on labor force. Catsiapis and Robinson  (1978, 1982) developed the Heckman model by two and then multi-equations for nonresponse mechanisms and obtained estimators for model parameters with independent assumptions between the random effects in the equations of selection mechanism. Since then, in recent years, some developments have been performed on Heckman model. Jolani  (2014) worked on longitudinal data in the presence of nonresponse by presenting an extension of Heckman model. He modeled dependent variable with some explanatory variables at time t, and for each time before t, considered a model as selection model. He obtained the estimates of the parameters by assuming nonresponse variable as binary and multivariate normal distribution for error components in the models. Kim and Kim  (2016) presented a method to analyze data with multivariate sample selection model. They assumed elliptically contoured  (EC) distribution for the errors in the models to obtain robustness against departures from normality. However, nonresponse can be caused by different reasons, and therefore it is in fact a multilevel variable. Merging of the levels may lead to model misspecifications and biased results, especially in cases where the mechanism of nonresponse is not the same at different levels of nonresponse. In other words, different covariates may be related to different reasons of nonresponse or the effects of covariates are of different strengths, or go in opposite directions. So, it makes sense to consider a different selection model for each level of nonresponse in such cases. Most of the researches about analysis of survey data are based on using only one binary variable for nonresponse. Also, there are a few works on nonresponse in establishment surveys in recent years. Earp et al.  (2014, 2018), Kirchner and Signorino  (2018), Phipps and Toth  (2012), Seiler  (2010)  and Rezaee et al.  (2021) used logistic regression, classification tree and support vector machine methods to investigate nonresponse in establishment surveys. Paiva and Reiter  (2017) provided a way to follow nonresponse samples in an establishment survey using a mixture pattern model and the assumption of a nonrandom nonresponse mechanism. Refusal and noncontact are two levels of nonresponse variable and were studied in some of the researches about household surveys. Heerwegh et al.  (2007) examined the effect of nonresponse error due to refusal and noncontact in a household survey and concluded that the error due to noncontact nonresponse is 2.56 times greater than the error due to refusal. Durrant and Steele  (2009) examined the factors influencing the nonresponse by distinguishing refusal from noncontact for a set of UK household surveys using a multivariate logistic regression model. Steele and Durrant  (2011) examined alternative approaches to multilevel modeling of survey noncontact and refusal. They reviewed multinomial and sequential models and compare them with a sample selection model that allows for residual correlation between a sample unit’s noncontact and refusal propensities. Vassallo et al.  (2015) also examined interviewer’s experience effects on nonresponse in a panel survey in the case of multilevel nonresponse. In this paper, we provided a method for analyzing incomplete survey data with considering nonresponse as a dependent multilevel variable. We extended the classical Heckman model via increasing the number of selection models, caused by the number of nonresponse reasons, considering the dependency between nonresponse levels, then we evaluated the performance of the proposed method using a simulation study and implemented it on an establishment survey with two reasons, refusal and noncontact for nonresponse. We compared the results of the proposed method with those of the univariate selection model and investigated the influence of nonrandom nonresponse by a sensitivity study. This paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, Heckman model is reviewed, then in Sect. 3, sample selection model with multiple selection rules is presented and discussed. In Sect. 4, simulation studies are given, and in Sect. 5, the proposed method is implemented on an establishment survey microdata and the results are compared with those of using univariate selection model. Also, the influence of nonrandom nonresponse is investigated using likelihood displacement. In Sect. 6, conclusion and discussion are given.",1

Lichtenberg,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A previous study (Lichtenberg, 2016) analyzed the association that pharmaceutical innovation had with premature mortality from cancer in Switzerland during the period 1995–2012, by investigating whether the cancer sites that experienced more pharmaceutical innovation had larger declines in premature mortality, controlling for the number of people diagnosed and mean age at diagnosis. That study found that premature cancer mortality before ages 75 and 65 was significantly inversely related to the cumulative number of drugs registered 5, 10, and 15 years earlier. Cancer accounts for only about one-third of the years of potential life lost (YPLL) before age 75 in Switzerland.Footnote 1 In the present study, we will use similar methods to analyze the association that pharmaceutical innovation had with premature mortality from all diseases in Switzerland during a period that includes more recent years: 1996–2018. There was considerable variation across diseases in the growth in the number of drugs used to treat the diseases ever registered in Switzerland. This is illustrated by Fig. 1, which shows data for 5 diseases, for which fairly similar (between 27 and 31) numbers of drugs had been registered by 1993. During the next 25 years, 16 or fewer drugs were registered for 3 diseases, 21 drugs were registered for “other lower respiratory diseases,” and 47 drugs were registered for “other malignant neoplasms.” Number of drugs used to treat 5 diseases ever registered in Switzerland, 1993–2018.

We will analyze an additional measure of premature mortality: the number of years of potential life lost before age 85 (as well as before 75 and 65).Footnote 2 And, we will analyze the association that pharmaceutical innovation had with hospital utilization for all diseases in Switzerland during the period 2002–2019. In 2018, expenditure on inpatient curative and rehabilitative care was almost three times as great as expenditure on prescribed medicines: €18.0 billion vs. €6.3 billion. In the next section, we will describe the econometric model that we will use to analyze the association that pharmaceutical innovation had with premature mortality and hospitalization due to all diseases in Switzerland during the period 1996–2019.

Private households reduced their consumption activity due to lockdown restrictions, supply shortages and precautionary behavior. As a consequence, firms’ profits and demand expectations fell dramatically and business uncertainty increased (e.g., KOF, 2020). This led to public worries about a wave of firm bankruptcies in the near future. Media outlets and political players have been speculating whether or not a wave of bankruptcies will emerge.Footnote 1 Against this background, we started in June 2020 to conduct a monthly monitoring of firm bankruptcies and start-up activity in Switzerland.Footnote 2 In this paper, we describe our data and methods in detail and present an assessment of the bankruptcy and start-up dynamics during the COVID-19 crisis. A major challenge for the near real-time assessment of business failures and start-ups is that the frequency of bankruptcies fluctuates strongly, even in normal times. Seasonal and cyclical patterns as well idiosyncrasies additionally complicate the near real-time evaluation. Hence, it is often hard to tell whether a strong increase at the current edge should be considered as worrisome or not. To overcome this challenge, we propose to apply the concept of excess mortality from the literature on human mortality, which received wide attention at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., EuroMOMO, 2020). In accordance with this literature, we define exceptional excess mortality (undermortality) as a situation when the frequency of firm bankruptcies exceeds (falls below) the upper (lower) bound of a normality range around the trend. To our best knowledge, we are the first ones who propose to apply the excess mortality concept to the bankruptcy and start-up activity of the firm sector.Footnote 3 A serious calculation of normality ranges is only possible based on a long data history. For this purpose, we collected the monthly number of firm bankruptcies and firm formations recorded in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce (Schweizerisches Handelsamtsblatt, Feuille officielle suisse du commerce, Foglio ufficiale svizzero di commercio) since the year 2000. We then constructed monthly time series on the frequency of bankruptcies and start-ups in the 8 Swiss greater regions, in the 26 Swiss cantons, and in the different industries of the Swiss economy. We also differentiate by age category and legal form. Using monthly data on the stock of firms, we further construct time series on bankruptcy and start-up rates. Since all legal bankruptcies and formations in Switzerland enter the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce, our dataset covers basically the total population of bankruptcies and new formations. We are not aware of any other project internationally that monitors the frequency of bankruptcies and start-ups based on comparable data in terms of sample coverage, length of time series, and degree of disaggregation. An extensive résumé of our empirical findings is provided in the conclusion of the paper. Here, we give a very brief summary: Bankruptcy rates in Switzerland were remarkably lower in 2020 and the first half of 2021 as compared to pre-crisis levels or long-term averages. This holds across all industry groups and greater regions of the Swiss economy. The finding stands in contrast to heightened (or at least not lowered) bankruptcy rates during and after previous crises. Three factors play a role for the different development during the current crisis. First, legal suspension measures delay at least some bankruptcies until today. Second, the COVID-19 loan programs gave firms at risk the opportunity to access fresh liquidity and prevent an insolvency. Bankruptcies dropped more strongly in industries where the share of firms with COVID-19 loans is high. The same association holds for a cross-canton comparison. Third, the broad use of the short-term work program resulted in a partial hibernation of the firm sector. The low bankruptcy rates reflect this hibernation. In winter 2021, bankruptcies increased strongly. It remains to be seen whether a prolonged period of increased insolvencies will follow. Furthermore, apart from an initial drop in April 2020 the number of new formations has been substantially higher during the years 2020 and 2021 than during the pre-crisis time. This is in sharp contrast to the subdued start-up activity during and after previous crises. Our findings suggest that the strong start-up activity is driven by industries who experience structural adjustments due to the pandemic. Notably, our findings on start-up activity are in line with recent evidence for the United States (Haltiwanger, 2021). Our paper relates to a vivid international debate on the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis for bankruptcies and start-up activity (see, e.g., Gourinchas et al., 2020 for international evidence as well as Guerini et al., 2020 and Carletti et al., 2020 for evidence with French or Italian data, respectively). Some contributions recommend quick and bold interventions to prevent a surge in bankruptcies (e.g., Hanson et al., 2020; Demmou et al., 2020; Schivardi & Romano, 2020). Others advocate more cautious interventions (e.g., Bircan et al., 2020; Goodhart et al., 2020; Bailey et al., 2021). In view of the recently low levels of bankruptcies in many countries, the potential issue of “zombification” is fiercely discussed (e.g., Gobbi et al., 2020; Laeven et al., 2020; Cros et al., 2021).Footnote 4 Another discussion concerns the adaption of bankruptcy laws and insolvency procedures given expectations of a resurgence of insolvencies (e.g., Greenwood et al., 2020; Demmou et al., 2021; Djankov & Zhang, 2021).Footnote 5 In this paper, we are cautious regarding policy conclusions. Instead, our intention is to provide the reader with a detailed description of the bankruptcy and start-up dynamics in Switzerland during the COVID-19 crisis. We consider our monitoring as a necessary pre-condition, next to other data work, for well-informed policy recommendations. Further, our paper relates to a (pre-COVID-19 crisis) literature on firm entries and exits over the business cycle (e.g., Caballero & Hammour, 1991, 2005; Caballero et al., 2008; Bilbiie et al., 2012; Varum & Rocha, 2012; Lee & Mukoyama, 2015; Daepp et al., 2015; Foster et al., 2016; Clementi & Palazzo, 2016). In line with this literature, we find that periods of economic expansion are usually associated with lower exit rates and higher entry rates than economic crisis periods. Our finding of a reversed pattern after February 2020 adds to the perception that the COVID-19 years 2020 and 2021 are a rather unusual period of time.Footnote 6 The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the data on firm bankruptcies and firm formations used in this study. Section 3 discusses how we construct time-series based measures for excess mortality, undermortality, excess formation and underformation of firms. Section 4 provides a chronology of events and policy measures during the COVID-19 crisis. Section 5 presents the results. Section 6 summarizes the findings and provides conclusions.",5

Evidence from Switzerland,December 2022,Regina Pleninger,Sina Streicher,Jan-Egbert Sturm,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The number of COVID-19 cases worldwide passed the 100 million mark at the end of January 2021. The number of deaths associated with the virus reached 4 million at the end of June 2021. The emergence of additional infection waves suggests that early removal of non-pharmaceutical containment measures may have had a huge impact on the number of cases and deaths. However, many governments are reluctant to take stronger measures due to economic concerns and public disapproval. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between non-pharmaceutical containment measures, the spread of COVID-19, and public behavior in Switzerland. Compared to other European countries, Switzerland imposed, on average, less stringent measures despite being just as affected. In addition, Switzerland consists of 26 cantons, each of which enjoys extensive political autonomy. Especially the cantonal heterogeneity in the implementation of COVID-19-related containment measures provides an interesting environment to study the impact of mitigation measures. We exploit this cantonal variation to estimate the effects of containment measures on the spread of COVID-19. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we collect cantonal data on non-pharmaceutical containment measures and construct an index capturing the stringency of these interventions. In particular, we closely follow the classifications used for the Oxford Stringency Index (Hale et al., 2020), but deviate in a number of dimensions to account for the Swiss setting.Footnote 1 Second, we use the constructed indices to analyze the interplay between containment measures, public behavior, and the spread of COVID-19 in Switzerland using a vector autoregressive model (VAR) that accounts for the relationship of current and past observations of all variables in the system. In particular, our VAR model allows for feedback effects between containment measures, public behavior and the spread of COVID-19. The results indicate that an increase in the stringency of non-pharmaceutical measures induces significant and sizable reductions in COVID-19 infection growth. A 10-unit increase in policy stringency results in a 34% reduction in weekly infections after six weeks. When considering different measures individually, we find that workplace and business closings as well as restrictions on gatherings are particularly effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. Further, stricter measures lead to a decrease in debit card transactions, which proxies behavioral changes in our model. A rise in infection growth leads to a policy reaction in the form of stricter containment measures by federal and cantonal governments. Similarly, the public reacts and decreases consumer spending. Our findings indicate that up to half of the reaction is voluntary. In our analysis, we divide the evolution of the pandemic in Switzerland into four phases. Phase 1 denotes the ‘extraordinary situation’ and spans from March 16, 2020, to June 19, 2020.Footnote 2 During this first wave, the federal government mandated all COVID-19-related restrictions. Phase 2 begins after the extraordinary situation and ends with the termination of the federal ban on large-scale events on September 30, 2020. During this phase, case numbers were relatively low and many of the federal measures were relaxed, if not lifted. The third phase ranges from October 1, 2020, to January 17, 2021, and describes the second wave of the pandemic. Most cantonal variability is situated in this phase. Since June 20, 2020, the federal level effectively defined minimum non-pharmaceutical intervention measures and each canton decided for itself, depending on the local situation and its interpretation, to what extent it would go beyond these. This effectively ended on January 17, 2021, when the Federal Council implemented much more restrictive measures, thereby eliminating cantonal differences. Hence, the subsequent Phase 4 spans from January 18, 2021, to April 18, 2021, and is not only characterized by comprehensive federal restrictions, but also by the national vaccination campaign and the spread of the virus mutant B.1.1.7, nowadays called Alpha, first detected in the UK. On April 19, 2021, several policy relaxations became effective, such as the opening of restaurant terraces and indoor sport and cultural venues, marking the start of gradual easing. The evolution of the weekly infection incidence over the course of the four phases is shown in Fig. 1. Weekly infection incidence. The weekly infection incidence reflects the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 residents during the respective week. The number of confirmed cases is provided by OpenZH (https://github.com/openZH/covid_19) We limit our analysis to Phases 3 and 4 for multiple reasons. First, the effective reproductive number \(R_e\), which we use to measure infection growth, only became available for all cantons by the end of March, thereby excluding the most important part of Phase 1. Additionally, the first wave constitutes an unexpected shock. The following phases are potentially quite different and more relevant for the future from a policy perspective. Moreover, the low level of infection incidence during Phase 2 entails high estimation uncertainty of \(R_e\). More importantly though, such low levels of incidence likely suppress the reaction of policy and behavior to changes in infection growth. In contrast, for the remaining Phases 3 and 4, most of the time the 14-day incidence was far above a critical value of 60 and thus, the public and political awareness of the epidemiological situation was enhanced. The analysis is relevant from a policy perspective. First, the effectiveness of containment measures has potential economic, social and political effects. This argument is particularly apparent as governments are often hesitant to impose stringent measures early on. Secondly, the results are important for potential future virus outbreaks. Even though the origin of COVID-19 is still under investigation, many former and current epidemics are zoonotic, that is, the disease spreads between animals and humans. The reduction in natural habitat and the increase in deforestation, urbanization, travel and mass food production is expected to increase the occurrence of viral outbreaks (Altizer et al., 2013). Last, once a viral disease emerges, additional mutations in response to natural or vaccine-elicited immunity pose a continued challenge to its containment. Hence, studying effective policy tools to circumvent future spreads early on is highly relevant from an economic, social, political and health perspective. The next section presents some closely related literature on COVID-19 and other epidemics. We describe the empirical methodology in Sect. 3. Our KOF Stringency Indices and all other data are presented in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5, we present our findings. Section 6 concludes.",7

158,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,01 January 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-021-00081-1,Money and inflation in Switzerland,December 2022,Peter Kugler,Samuel Reynard,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the 1990s, with the emergence of the Taylor rule and issues related to monetary targeting implementation and communication, the monetary policy research focus drifted away from monetary aggregates towards interest rates which have since then been used to summarize the monetary policy stance.Footnote 1 Since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) however, monetary policy interest rates have mostly been at their effective lower bound and central banks have turned to quantitative policies with direct effects on broad monetary aggregates. The need to assess monetary policy stance in terms of quantities has thus come back on the economics research agenda. This paper presents a clear relationship between a measure of monetary policy stance based on broad monetary aggregates and subsequent developments in economic activity and inflation in Switzerland, a small open economy, during the past four decades. Traditional forms of money demand and quantity theory relationships have remained stable over the whole period, despite the recent low interest rate environment. Accounting for the secular decline in interest rates and thus in trend velocity, which started in the first part of the 1990s and continued after the GFC, broad money excesses over trend values have been followed by persistently higher inflation and output with the usual monetary policy transmission lags. Money and exchange rate fluctuations can explain the major inflation developments in Switzerland over the past four decades. The relationship between money and inflation before the 1960s has of course been well documented by Friedman and Schwartz (1963). Nelson (2003) reviews the monetarist literature, relates it to the modern New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models used for monetary policy analysis, and concludes that the information content of money found in empirical studies comes from its ability to proxy for various asset yields and their effects on aggregate demand.Footnote 2 The analysis of this paper is based on the P* approach developed by Hallman et al. (1991), which relates inflation to observed money deviations from a long-term money demand equation. The basic idea of this approach is that when the money level is higher than the level that is required for the economy to sustain long-term values of output and velocity, this should lead to upward pressures on inflation. The historical roots of P* analyses can be found in Humphrey (1989), with the statistical tests dating back to the study of Working (1923). More recent applications of this framework from different perspectives can be found in Orphanides and Porter (2000) and Belongia and Ireland (2015). The econometric relationship between monetary aggregates and inflation has also been well documented in the cases of the euro area and Switzerland by various studies. For example, Gerlach and Svensson (2003) find support for a P* model in the context of the euro area, and related concepts are used to analyze monetary developments in Masuch et al. (2001) and Dreger and Wolters (2014). The usefulness of money in explaining Swiss inflation is analyzed, for example, in Jordan et al. (2001) and in Gerlach-Kristen (2007), who assesses the effects of trend money growth and output gaps on inflation, and includes an extended literature review on the impact of money and real economic activity on inflation in Switzerland. This paper extends the analysis of Reynard (2007), who derives a monetary policy stance measure based on monetary aggregates that can be used as an indicator enabling avoidance of a persistent increase in inflation above the monetary policy objective. We show that the relationship between broad money and inflation that Reynard found in the cases of United States (U.S.), euro area and Switzerland between the 1960s or 1970s and 2006 has not been affected by the GFC. Moreover, we assess the stability of money demand, characterize the macroeconomic dynamic effects of that monetary policy stance measure, and quantify its relative influence on inflation and economic activity in Switzerland since the mid-1970s. Our econometric results on the effects of monetary shocks on economic activity are consistent with the narrative account of Friedman (1968) and the benchmark estimated effects of monetary policy shocks documented in Christiano et al. (2005). We follow the latter paper’s approach of characterizing the effects of monetary policy shocks in terms of vector autoregression (VAR) impulse responses and variance decompositions. Shocks to a monetary policy stance measure based on broad monetary aggregates lead to output gap and inflation exhibiting hump-shaped responses, which are delayed and longer-lasting for inflation. Section 2 analyzes money demand and the effect of the substantial decline in nominal interest rates since the 1990s. Then, Sect. 3 presents a monetary policy stance measure, the real money gap (RMG). The econometric properties of the RMG are analyzed in details in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5, using a historical decomposition, we characterize the effects of the three most important shocks in Switzerland, namely, the RMG, cost-push and real exchange rate shocks, on inflation developments. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",1

By February 17, 2022, worldwide cumulative COVID-19 cases totaled 416.6 million, resulting in 5.8 million deaths (WHO, 2022). In the Philippines, the first few confirmed COVID-19 cases with one death were reported in the first week of March 2020. Confirmed daily cases fluctuated widely, peaking in August 2020 (30,000 daily cases), April 2021 (70,000), September 2021 (100,000), and January 2022 (200,000) while bottoming in November 2020 (10,000), May 2021 (40,000), and December 2021 (less than 1,000). As of February 17, 2022, there were more than 3.6 million cumulative cases and 55,223 deaths in the Philippines (DOH, 2022a). As a global health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused unprecedented socioeconomic devastation. Health system disruptions—disrupted vaccination schedules for other infectious diseases and excessive demand for health services vis-a-vis supply—have led to recurrence of diseases and lost lives beyond those caused by the COVID-19 virus (Ioannidis, 2020). Nation-wide and city lockdowns caused massive unemployment and income losses (Pley et al., 2021). In the case of the Philippines, it has been reported that during the first year of the pandemic in 2020, the economy contracted by 9.6%, 10.1% of firms reported temporary closure while 0.4% permanently closed, and unemployment rate reached 17.6% (Chua, 2021). It is estimated that it will take about ten years for the Philippine economy to converge to its pre-pandemic growth path (Chua, 2021). With vaccination considered to be the most favorable and viable option to deal with the health and economic difficulties brought about by the COVID-19 virus (Fadda et al., 2020), numerous efforts to develop COVID-19 vaccines immediately ensued. By November 2020, 49 candidate vaccines were undergoing clinical trials and 164 others were in preclinical evaluation (WHO, 2020). The first mass vaccination program started in early December 2020 with the United States government issuing Emergency Use Authorizations for both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines (CDC, 2022). In the Philippines, vaccination commenced in March 2021, and by mid-February 2022, about 130 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered, 61 million people were fully vaccinated (56% coverage), and about 8 million booster shots had been administered (DOH, 2022b). Most infectious diseases specialists think that the COVID-19 virus will become endemic and will continue to circulate in different areas around the world. For societies to be able to tolerate the seasonal deaths and illnesses without the restrictive and economically devastating lockdowns and social distancing, regular vaccination may be necessary. Just like the flu vaccine, the COVID-19 vaccine may have to be updated every year as new variants of the virus emerge and are able to escape immunity from previous vaccination (Phillips, 2021). In December 2021, the Director of the Socioeconomic Planning Department of the Philippine government unraveled plans for yearly COVID-19 vaccine boosters to “prevent any more major disruptions to economic activity, with the government shouldering the cost in 2022 and then sharing the expense with the private sector starting 2023” (Philippine Daily Inquirer Editorial, 2021). This plan raises a host of policy questions. Should the vaccine be provided privately or publicly? If the annual COVID-19 booster vaccine is sold privately, will there be sufficient demand? Up to what extent can the costs be assumed privately? Is there scope for cross-subsidization to ensure vaccine coverage that can prevent major outbreaks? Alternatively, if there should be a need for a full or partial annual COVID-19 public vaccination program, estimates of the benefits from preventing the infection would be required in evaluating the program. Using the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM), this study estimated willingness to pay (WTP) for annual COVID-19 vaccine boosters in Metro Manila (MM) as a measure of the benefits that could be derived from preventing the disease. A few estimates of CVM-based WTP for the initial COVID-19 vaccine uptake exist. Catma and Varol (2021) arrived at a mean WTP of US$236.85 for a one-year COVID-19 vaccine with 50% efficacy in the USA and found that WTP increased with income and perceived threat of the virus. Sarasty et al. (2020) estimated the mean WTP for a one-year COVID-19 vaccine in Ecuador to be USD147.61 and found that income, employment status and the probability of being hospitalized were positively related with WTP. For Chile, Garcia and Cerda (2020) came up with a mean WTP of USD184.72, noting that WTP depended not only on economic factors (employment status and income) but also on health-related factors such as preexistence of chronic disease, exposure and knowledge about COVID-19, and other factors such as perception of government performance. WTP estimates for less developed countries were lower. Harapan et al. (2020) estimated mean WTP of US$ 57.20 for Indonesia and found that high income and high perceived risk of infection were associated with higher WTP. Wong et al. (2020) found that WTP in Malaysia averaged US$30.66 and that WTP was influenced by affordability barriers and socioeconomic factors, namely higher education levels, professional and managerial occupations, and higher incomes. For Vietnam, Vo et al. (2021) estimated mean WTP to be US$85.92 (one-year, 95% efficacy) and found sex, living area, monthly income, and the level of self-rated risk of COVID-19 as significant determinants of WTP. Karam et al. (2022) concluded that Lebanese’ mean WTP for the COVID-19 vaccine was approximately $60 (one year, 99% efficacy) and that their WTP was associated with the severity of COVID-19, the education level, and family income.Footnote 1 Unlike these existing WTP for COVID-19 vaccines studies, this paper looked at vaccine demand during the endemic phase of the COVID-19 infection, rather than the demand for initial vaccine uptake during the pandemic phase. At the time of this study, public vaccination (one or two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine provided free for everyone eligible following priority rules set by the government) was on-going in the Philippines. There could be substantial differences between the initial uptake vaccine scenario and the annual COVID-19 vaccine scenario of this study. While the risks of infection and of severe complications including death might have decreased and the value and composition of the costs of illness might have changed, there could also be some evolution in people’s understanding of the COVID-19 virus and of vaccine safety, efficacy and their role in avoiding the huge socioeconomic costs of the disease. Apart from estimating the mean WTP for a COVID-19 vaccine in Metro Manila during the endemic phase, this study also looked at factors that affect demand for the vaccine, such as income, demographic and other socioeconomic variables (age, sex, education, work and marital status of respondent, household composition), health condition, COVID-19 exposure and knowledge, and vaccine awareness and acceptance measured in terms of the Health Benefit Model. A limitation of this study is that it only presented and estimated WTP for a vaccine with 90% efficacy, a plausible scenario at the time of survey.Footnote 2",
159,1,Swiss Journal of Economics and Statistics,11 July 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41937-023-00115-w,A monthly leading indicator of Swiss GDP growth based on Okun’s law,December 2023,Peter Kugler,George Sheldon,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Two indexes stand out in a list of leading indicators of the business cycle in Switzerland: the Business Cycle Index (BCI) of the Swiss National Bank (SNB) and the KOF Barometer of the KOF Swiss Economic Institute at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zürich.Footnote 1 Both indicators have much in common. Both focus on quarterly GDP growth. Both employ state of the art methodologies, utilizing factor models that treat business conditions as a latent variable linked to observable economic quantities. Both draw from a very broad set of data, the KOF Barometer incorporating over 200 data series and the BCI encompassing some 650. And both are released at monthly intervals, providing timelier information on the course of the economy than the quarterly GDP reports that first appear some two months after a quarter’s end and then only as preliminary estimates. The strengths of both indicators are offset by certain weaknesses, however. For one, constructing and updating the business cycle indicators are quite cumbersome due to the complexity of the underlying models. For another, the results rest on a myriad of cross-correlations whose intertemporal stability is uncertain. And finally, data underlying the indicators are subject to revisions and are “noisy” necessitating filtering. Consequently, the values of the indicators at the near end of the series often fluctuate from one release to the next, creating uncertainties that detract from the indicators’ gains in timeliness. In the following study, we propose and develop a novel business cycle indicator without these drawbacks. Its computation is straightforward, requiring no more than spreadsheet calculations. It draws from a single data source that is not subject to revisions. And its construction does not rest on historic correlations of uncertain temporal stability, depending instead on a mathematical law that always applies, be it appropriate for forecasting purposes or not. The approach consists in combining a forward-looking unemployment rate (FLUR) based on the mathematical theory of absorbing Markov chains with Okun’s law to produce a monthly leading indicator of current and future GDP growth.Footnote 2 We test the predictive capabilities of our approach over the sample period from 1991/Q1 to 2021/Q4Footnote 3 by comparing the capacity of our indicator to outperform an AR(1) model of GDP growth with the ability of SNB’s BCI and the KOF Barometer to do likewise. This is a commonly employed approach to test the forecasting capabilities of competing leading indicators. Our results indicate that all three indicators outperform the AR(1) model equally well in nowcasting and forecasting year-to-year GDP growth, but that our approach falls somewhat short in regard to quarter-to-quarter changes. Our paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 explains the construction of FLUR and examines its forecasting ability with regard to observed unemployment. Section 3 develops the Okun relationship linking FLUR with GDP growth. Section 4 investigates to what extent our indicator contains statistically significant predictive information with regard to GDP growth not captured by the BCI or the KOF Barometer and presents our nowcasting and forecasting test results. Section 5 summarizes our findings and suggests avenues for future research.",

However, a quarter of a century of low and stable inflation, continuous growth and moderate unemployment has apparently been sufficient to lull economists and the public alike into believing that inflation, as we have seen it in the past, would never come back. This time would really be different. Globalization and the beneficial effects of technology would see to it that inflation was a thing of the past. And if it should ever reappear, central banks would have the expertise and the instruments to swiftly put it under control again. Unfortunately, as we have painfully learned over the last two years, reality did not stick to this script. Inflation has come back with a vengeance. This article offers a personal view of what happened and presents an attempt to evaluate the monetary policies of recent and current times. Why the sudden burst of inflation, after inflation had stayed low for 25 years? What were the driving factors? What errors, if any, have central banks made? What can we learn from this experience?",

The quote from his paper ‘hardly anyone takes anyone else’s data analyses seriously’ (p. 37) described rather accurately the state of (applied) econometrics in those times. Obviously, once empirical results lose their credibility by the standards of our own discipline, they are worthless as a tool for evaluating and improving public policy. After this near death experience in the 1980s, the field changed dramatically. Researchers became much more aware of the limits of econometric empirical analyses and of their dependence on crucial (identifying) assumptions. Since such assumptions can dramatically impact the conclusions to be drawn from the empirical studies, they must be credible. Credibility means that these assumptions are reasonable approximations of the empirical reality analysed. Angrist and Pischke (2010) coined the term ‘credibility revolution’ for this period. Novel methods and a better understanding of old methods, like Instrumental Variables (Heckman, 1997; Imbens & Angrist, 1994) and regression, as well as a focus on parameters that could be ‘credibly identified’ changed the way empirical analyses were performed. Although this change was certainly most pronounced in microeconometrics, it proliferated and still proliferates across all fields of applied econometrics, although at different speeds. This progress was honoured by the Nobel committee in Stockholm by giving the ‘The Sveriges Riskbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel’ to Jim Heckman in 2000 and to Joshua Angrist, David Card, and Guido Imbens in 2021.Footnote 1 It is now best practice in empirical work to clearly state the assumptions needed for estimating (causal) effects, discuss their credibility, and, finally, acknowledge that these causal effects may be heterogeneous across the units analysed. Other fields also saw massive improvements in conducting credible empirical analyses. For example, in statistics Donald Rubin (Imbens & Rubin, 2015; Rubin, 1974) formalized the potential outcome approach, in epidemiology Robins (1986) proposed a dynamic approach based on potential outcomes, and in computer science Judea Pearl (Pearl, 2000; Pearl & Mackenzie, 2018) introduced a graph-based approach to causality, i.e. the directed acyclic graphs (DAG). In summary, around 2010 we had new best practices on how to estimate average effects of what was now called ‘treatments’ (policies, actions, decisions, etc.). By using the term ‘quasi-experiments’ or ‘natural experiments’ for such methods, we rather explicitly claim that such observational studies are almost as credible as if the data came from an experiment. Major shortcomings were still the difficulty of estimating effect heterogeneity at a fine-grained level as well as the frequent use of parametric statistical models that impose additional restrictions like specific functional form assumptions that cannot be justified other than by computational (and intellectual) convenience. Nevertheless, the value of empirical economic studies for public policy had increased substantially.Footnote 2 In addition to improvements in the methodology and application of econometrics mentioned before, we saw major technological advances that also affected econometrics. Computing power increased and is still increasing exponentially at constant or even decreasing costs.Footnote 3 At the same time, costs of data storage fell, and data collection became much easier and socially more acceptable. Although the latter trend was mainly driven by private companies (just think about the data our smartphones are continuously collecting and transferring to various tech companies), the digitalization of the state also increased the volume of the data collected by public offices and eased the technical access and use for research and policy consulting. Simultaneously, computer scientists developed new and powerful, but computationally demanding, algorithms that turned out to be very successful at prediction tasks. These Machine Learning algorithms tend to be highly nonlinear, very flexible, and easily beat common econometric algorithms at most prediction tasks. Causal Machine Learning unites these trends: it adapts Machine Learning methods to answer well identified causal questions using large and informative data (e.g. Athey, 2017; Athey & Imbens, 2019). Credible answers to causal questions are of course not only of interest to economists, but also to researchers in other fields as well as to the private sector. Therefore, it is not surprising that methods development and applications appear almost simultaneously in many research fields, such as computer science, econometrics, epidemiology, marketing, and statistics, as well as in the private sector. In the remainder of this non-technical paper, I will describe the main methods of Causal Machine Learning that became popular in econometrics as well as showcasing their use with a particular empirical example. In the next section, I compare a special type of Machine Learning, namely Supervised Statistical Learning, to classical econometrics. In Sect. 3, I zoom in on a special case, namely a static binary treatment model identified by so-called selection-on-observables assumptions. In this context, I discuss some important estimation approaches for various aggregated and disaggregated causal effects. Subsequently, in Sect. 4, an evaluation study of training programmes for unemployed in Flanders is used to show some of the potential of these methods in practice. This application is followed in Sect. 5 by more general considerations about the usefulness and limits of Causal Machine Learning and how its usefulness depends on various features of the study and the chosen research design, i.e. the specific set of identifying assumptions entertained by the researcher. The last section concludes and points to some of the many issues that are still unresolved and can hopefully be resolved in future research. Many topics are omitted from this brief overview. For example, I will not discuss the use of Causal Machine Learning (CML henceforth) in the private sector, although many firms, particular in the tech industry, currently build up substantial capacity for development and application of these methods (e.g. Athey & Luca, 2019). Furthermore, I will discuss a generic but simple causal set-up, namely the static binary treatment models, thus excluding for example the important field of continuous treatments (e.g. Klosin, 2021). Furthermore, I will ignore more complicated causal designs and mechanism, such as mediation (e.g. Farbmacher et al., 2022), moderation (e.g. Bansak, 2021), networks (e.g. Graham, 2020), dynamic sequences of treatments (Bodory et al., 2022b; Lewis & Syrgkanis, 2020), as well as dynamic learning (bandits, reinforcement learning, e.g. Kasy & Sautmann, 2021; Kock et al., 2022). Furthermore, I will not discuss the discovery of causal structures (e.g. Soleymani et al., 2022). I will also not discuss the use of Machine Learning either to generate variables (e.g. from text, pictures, or natural language) that can subsequently be used in causal analysis or for prediction purposes, or both. Some of these topics are already discussed in the recent excellent surveys by Athey and Imbens (2019) and Mullainathan and Spiess (2017), among others.Footnote 4",

In the disaggregated approach, we nowcast each GDP component separately and aggregate them to obtain a GDP nowcast. This is the first paper to introduce the idea to combine a model for mixed-frequency data with a multilayer strategy. In the first layer, we estimate a MIDAS regression for each GDP component, in which the dependent variable (e.g., growth in private consumption) is observed on a quarterly basis while the explanatory variables are observed on a monthly frequency. However, some of the explanatory monthly variables are published with a lag of several months, resulting in the unavailability of their most recent values. So, in the second layer of the model, we estimate the unavailable values of the monthly variables based on the information that is available at a higher frequency (i.e., daily frequency). For example, asset prices (e.g., stock prices) which are observed on a daily basis could provide information that is not incorporated in a monthly economic index (i.e., consumer confidence). Overall, we apply the proposed novel framework on a variety of economic and financial data (hard and soft data, mostly domestic) to nowcast Greek GDP and evaluate its nowcasting performance over the period 2005Q1–2020Q3. Moreover, we provide empirical and simulated evidence that more accurate nowcasting estimations require the use of a disaggregated multilayer mixed-frequency framework. First, we show that the nowcasting ability of the AR(1) used as naive model is not better, if and only if a sophisticated model framework is defined. Second, the disaggregation into components reduces the nowcasting error despite the inclusion of multiple sources of nowcasting errors. The proposed model framework, named D-model,Footnote 1 is very relevant for practitioners and policymakers who need to get informed accurately and in real time of the current state of the economy under investigation. The rest of the paper is structured in a wise manner: Sect. 2 provides a literature review on GDP nowcasting, Sect. 3 presents the D-model’s construction, and Sect. 4 describes the dataset. Section 5 presents in detail the model specifications for the Greek GDP nowcasting. In Sect. 6, we proceed to a number of additional model extensions for robustness purposes, and in Sect. 7 we estimate nowcasts from naïve models in order to have a reference point in the evaluation of the nowcasting performance, which is illustrated in Sect. 8. Section 9 presents Monte Carlo simulations which provide evidence in favor of the disaggregation into components and, finally, Sect. 10 presents the conclusions.",

Next to object-specific characteristics, the quality of local public goods, the proximity to transport opportunities or even local building restrictions may explain real estate prices on a local level. Apart from local determinants, developments in real estate prices can also be attributed to macroeconomic phenomena affecting the overall economy. Prominent examples are the development of gross domestic product (GDP), population growth or changes in monetary policy. The latter is the focus of this study, in particular the relationship between interest rates and real estate prices. Among the numerous instruments available to central banks for conducting monetary policy, interest rates play a key role in real estate markets. For instance, the level of interest rates affects the time value of money, which in turn is reflected in discount rates that are applied computationally to determine real estate prices of income properties. Beside this rather valuation-based argumentation to explain developments in real estate prices, interest rates affect real estate prices through a financing perspective by means of mortgage interest rates. Additionally, potential interest rate effects on real estate prices may also arise through the investment behavior of commercial real estate investors. In particular, a rational investor compares risk-free yields on governmental bonds with potential returns that can be achieved in real estate markets. The resulting spread is directly linked to the level of interest rates and captures the investment perspective through which interest rates affect real estate prices. All these potential influencing channels increase in importance with regard to recent developments in Swiss real estate markets. Between 2005 and 2018, median square meter prices of owner-occupied flats (+ 48.9%) and houses (+ 37.0%), median rental prices per square meter and year for rental apartments (+ 13.6%), office space (+ 7.1%), industrial real estate (+ 31.5%) and sales area (+ 7.2%) have reached all-time highs. During the same time frame, the interest rate environment has changed massively. For instance, yields on governmental bonds with 10-year maturity decreased by 2.3%. The goal of this study is to empirically measure the impact of interest rates on real estate prices in Switzerland. We consider six different real estate groups consisting of rental apartments, owner-occupied flats, houses, office space, industrial real estate and sales area. Whereas much research exists concerning the residential housing segment, the commercial real estate segment has rarely been analyzed empirically, especially within Switzerland. Since interest rates are a broad term, we apply multifaceted representations of the latter using four different proxies: yields on governmental bonds with 10-year maturity, fixed mortgage rates with 10-year maturity, variable mortgage rates and a certain measure for the spread between net initial returns on real estate objects and governmental bonds. All four representations of interest rates pursue the goal of capturing specific characteristics of Swiss real estate markets and potential channels through which interest rates affect real estate prices. The relationship between price developments of numerous real estate segments and multifaceted representations of interest rates was analyzed by means of a fixed-effect panel regression model, capturing quarterly data between 2005 and 2018 for 106 regions in Switzerland. Our contribution to the relevant literature is summarized as follows: First, we provide an in-depth analysis about how different types of interest rates affect segment-specific real estate prices. Second, using a unique dataset in combination with a largely unexplored regionalization type, we contribute to the identification of fundamental drivers of real estate prices. Third, whereas the widespread approach to assessing the impact of local or macroeconomic determinants on real estate prices relies on vector autoregression models, we contribute to the empirical literature by demonstrating how a fixed-effect panel regression model can be applied reasonably to analyze price development across heterogeneous regions. The remainder of this study is structured as follows. The second section is devoted to a description of Swiss real estate markets. The third section reviews recent events in the monetary policy of Switzerland, while focusing on interest rates. In the following section, we explain developments of real estate prices for the underlying six real estate segments. After a brief review of literature in the fifth section, the sixth section explains the empirical strategy. Finally, in the last section we will present and discuss the empirical results.",

Fengler,Robert Rohrkemper,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Economic analysis and policy decisions require accurate information that is updated frequently and ideally available in real time. This is particularly valuable in times of crisis when large changes of economic fundamentals occur at high frequency. In the modern economy, private-sector firms own a wealth of granular high-frequency data. These data have the potential to improve economic policy decisions and inform the general public once they are made publicly available in an anonymized form. This basic truth became particularly conspicuous when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world and policy makers around the globe scrambled for the right measures to fight the imminent health crisis without choking economic activity. In the light of this situation, the authors launched the initiative Monitoring Consumption Switzerland (MCS) as a private–public partnership between the University of St. Gallen (HSG) and the two major Swiss payment service providers SIX and Worldline, both headquartered in Zürich. MCS receives transaction data on electronic payments and cash withdrawals of Swiss debit card holders in Switzerland and abroad as well as electronic payments by Swiss and foreign card holders at merchants in Switzerland made by means of debit cards, credit cards, and mobile payment wallets. The data thus comprise both an issuing data perspective, i.e., the debit card holder perspective, and an acquiring data perspective, i.e., the merchant/payment terminal perspective of the consumer transaction data. MCS shares the data with the public on the website https://monitoringconsumption.com/ with a delay of one week.Footnote 1 This paper provides the background to and detailed information on these data relevant to current and potential future users of its data. As SIX and Worldline cover a significant market share of the Swiss payment service markets, the data cover a considerable amount of private consumption in Switzerland, which we estimate to amount to about one quarter of the Swiss GDP. The data are available at a daily frequency and published weekly. To ensure anonymity of card holders and merchants, the transaction data are aggregated and scaled. They are sliced along geographical regions (the 26 Swiss cantons or 7 larger regions), along 7 levels of urban agglomeration and along 12 merchant categories (based on NOGA codes). Data coverage starts in January 2019, i.e., a year before the pandemic, and the current agreements ensure data updates at least throughout 2022. Due to this sectoral and geographical segregation, their high-frequency, and regular updates, the data have delivered immediate insights, for example, into how consumer spending has responded to the various policy measures enacted to curb the spread of COVID-19. MCS is among many initiatives and projects that have been launched in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic to monitor and track economic activity. As regards Switzerland, Kraenzlin et al. (2020) have been among the first to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on payment behavior in the Swiss retail sector. Carvalho et al. (2021) analyze credit and debit card data mediated through one of the largest banks in Spain; similarly, Andersen et al. (2020) study payments with card and mobile wallets, cash withdrawals and incoming money flows obtained from a large Danish retail bank. A more holistic view on electronic payment transactions is offered by Byrne et al. (2020) as regards the Irish economy by accessing the Credit and Debit Card Statistics of the Central Bank of Ireland, while Ardizzi et al. (2020) work with data obtained from the retail settlement system managed by the Bank of Italy; a similarly comprehensive data source is employed in Bounie et al. (2020) who study the card payment scheme of the French “carte bancaire” system. Besides traditional banks, Fintech start-ups also provide payment transaction data. For instance, Hacioglu et al. (2020) look at data of debit and credit card transaction data linked to U.K.’s largest personal financial manager. As for North America, Dahlhaus and Welte (2021) analyze debit and credit payment data gathered from two Canadian payment service providers. As regards the USA, Baker et al. (2020) use data obtained through a US personal financial manager to study user spending and income transactions from all linked checking, savings, and credit card accounts. The possibly most comprehensive data on US real-time consumption data are procured by Chetty et al. (2020) who collect credit and debit card spending and cash spending of US consumers. These data are further complemented by data on small business transactions and revenues, payroll data, job postings, educational data as well as mobility data. Besides this, a number of central banks and economic research institutes developed broader real-time measures of economic activity; examples include the weekly GDP trackers of the Deutsche Bundesbank for Germany,Footnote 2 of the OeNB for AustriaFootnote 3 and the SECO for Switzerland.Footnote 4 All these studies and indicators document that significant drops in consumption and economic activity are associated with the tightness of the regional lockdown measures and the extent of social distancing policies. The paper is organized as follows. We discuss the data sources in Sect. 2 and the data sets we publish in Sect. 3. Section 4 provides information on data quality assurance. Section 5 suggests approaches to validate the project data and Sect. 6 provides use cases. Section 7 concludes.",

This holds in particular for its exchange rate to the euro because the eurozone is Switzerland’s most relevant trading partner. A good understanding of the drivers of the EUR/CHF exchange rate is key for many market participants including investors, Swiss companies, foreign companies doing business in or with Switzerland, and central banks, in particular the Swiss National Bank (SNB). The Swiss franc is widely known as a safe-haven currency. Since the beginning of the financial crisis 2007, it has significantly strengthened against a number of major currencies, e.g., the euro. In attempts to counteract its “current massive overvaluation” (Swiss National Bank, 2016), the SNB resorted to drastic policy measures. In September 2011, it imposed a lower bound of 1.20 on the EUR/CHF exchange rate and announced its willingness to intervene in foreign exchange (FX) markets to support this lower bound by unlimited purchases of assets denominated in foreign currency. The associated increase in foreign currency investments during this period made the SNB the central bank with the largest balance sheet in relation to GDP (Cukierman, 2019). Figure 1 shows the SNB’s foreign currency investments and the monthly average EUR/CHF exchange rate. Development of the SNB’s foreign currency investments (FCI) in billion CHF (left vertical axis, blue dashed line) and the observed EUR/CHF exchange rate (right vertical axis, black solid line). Dotted lines indicate the estimated breakpoints (discussed in Sects. 2.2 and 4.1). The shaded area marks the peg period. Marked dots indicate the level of FCI at the end of January 2000, January 2008, September 2011, January 2015, and December 2020, respectively. Sample period: January 2000–December 2020. Data sources: SNB Data Portal and Refinitiv A few years later, in January 2015, the SNB took the markets by surprise when it decided to discontinue this policy. Despite the fact that the SNB only imposed a lower bound on the exchange rate and not an outright peg, the period from September 2011 to January 2015 is often called the “peg period.” The SNB has continued to intervene in FX markets in the years after the peg period, still pursuing the goal of mitigating the Swiss franc’s overvaluation. The market turmoil brought about by the financial crisis and the ensuing changes in monetary policy suggest that drivers of the EUR/CHF exchange rate might have changed as well over the past decades. For this reason, we select a sample period starting in 2000, which covers both pre- and post-crisis periods, the peg period, and the time after the peg. Using statistical techniques, we detect subperiods in which drivers and their parameters are relatively constant and the locations of the breakpoints between them. Comparing and contrasting the drivers across these periods is one contribution of this paper. For the detection of drivers, we use a step-forward procedure based on simple linear regression models which are common in the empirical FX literature (see, e.g., Fama, 1984, Ranaldo & Söderlind, 2010, Grisse & Nitschka, 2015, Yeşin, 2015; 2017, Dahlquist & Penasse, 2017). The main research question we investigate in this paper is, “What are the main drivers of the EUR/CHF exchange rate at a monthly horizon, and how do these drivers change across different subperiods, including the SNB’s minimum exchange rate policy 2011–2015?” In this paper, we focus on a monthly frequency. This choice is driven by our interest in medium-term effects, by the availability of data (one of our variables is available only at a monthly frequency), and by the lower noise in monthly data compared to higher frequencies. Starting with Meese and Rogoff (1983), there is a range of papers which found exchange rates to be essentially unpredictable. Using economic fundamentals as potential drivers, such as trade balance, national income and money supply, Meese and Rogoff (1983) find exchange rates to be almost unpredictable in the short and medium term. A simple random walk seems to perform significantly better than existing forecasting methods. This finding is widely known as the “Meese and Rogoff puzzle.” On the contrary, some papers find exchange rates to robustly explain certain macroeconomic fundamentals (Mussa, 1979, Engel & West, 2005, Chen et al., 2010, Sarno & Schmeling, 2014, Pincheira & Hardy, 2018). Other parts of the literature successfully identified economic variables that are able to explain exchange rates. Based on this literature, we identify potential drivers for the EUR/CHF exchange rate. For example, the relation between exchange rates and monetary policy has been addressed by a significant body of the literature (Sarno & Taylor, 2001, Chaboud & Humpage, 2005, Reitz, 2005, Engel & West, 2004, Staiger & Sykes, 2010, Sinnakkannu, 2010). Fratzscher et al. (2019) examine foreign exchange interventions based on data covering 33 countries from 1995 to 2011. They find fairly high success rates of FX interventions, especially in terms of reducing exchange rate volatility, i.e. smoothing the path of the exchange rate. Interest rate parities suggest that changes in interest rates might be potential drivers of exchange rates. Although empirical evidence against both the Covered Interest Rate Parity and the Uncovered Interest Rate Parity has been extensively discussed in the literature (e.g., Fama, 1984, Brunnermeier et al., 2008, Engel, 2016, Dahlquist & Penasse, 2017, Du et al., 2018), Rime et al. (2022) argue that the Covered Interest Rate Parity actually continued to hold in international money markets also after the global financial crisis when accounting for marginal funding costs, arguing that the seeming arbitrage opportunities found by Du et al. (2018) disappear once funding costs are included in the calculation. In addition to levels of interest rates, term structure slopes and their changes over time may have explanatory power for exchange rate movements (Ang & Chen, 2010, Andrews et al., 2022). Despite Switzerland’s small size, its economic strength and political stability increase the demand for the Swiss franc in times of crises. This safe-haven property has been documented, among others, by Ranaldo and Söderlind (2010), Grisse and Nitschka (2015), Auer (2015), Fatum and Yamamoto (2016), and Lee (2017). Grisse and Nitschka (2015) find in response to a rise in global risk, the Swiss franc appreciates against the euro and against typical carry trade investment currencies, but depreciates against the US dollar and the Japanese yen. They also find statistically significant time variation in the relation between Swiss franc returns and risk factors, with this link becoming stronger in times of stress. Another strand of the literature investigates the link between FX and equity. Depending on the level of financial stress, their relation can vary over time. Hossfeld and MacDonald (2015) document major differences in correlations between currency returns and global stock market returns conditional on the level of financial stress, which is another indication of regime dependence of exchange rate drivers. Controlling for the impact of carry trade reversal, they provide further evidence that the Swiss franc qualifies as a safe-haven currency since its returns are negatively related to global stock market returns in times of high financial stress. Leutert (2018) also document regime dependence of the relation between equity indices and the EUR/CHF exchange rate with the correlation changing from positive before 1999 to highly negative after 1999. The Swiss National Bank’s monetary policy during and after the peg period (September 2011–January 2015) has been controversially discussed. However, this policy has a significantly longer history with its roots going back to the mid-1970s, when the SNB was one of the first national banks that heavily intervened in the FX market. An increase in interventions was observed again from 2008 onward when the Swiss franc significantly appreciated against the euro. It culminated in the introduction of a strict exchange rate floor in September 2011, which was defended by the SNB until January 2015. The announcement of a minimum exchange rate against the euro and the SNB’s commitment to purchase unlimited amounts of foreign currency assets have been the subject of controversy and raised the question where the exchange rate would have been in the absence of the SNB’s policy. Using option pricing theory, Hanke et al. (2019) estimate the hypothetical exchange rate that would have been observed in the absence of the SNB’s interventions. Figure 2 shows the observed EUR/CHF exchange rate versus this latent exchange rate during the peg period. The latent exchange rate is significantly below the floor of 1.20 and varies between 1.01 and 1.18 Swiss francs per euro. Based on their results, we investigate also the drivers of this unobserved or latent exchange rate. This provides a new perspective on the SNB’s policy during the peg period. EUR/CHF observed (black) and latent exchange rate (blue, calculated following Hanke et al., 2019), monthly averages. Sample: September 2011–January 2015 While our results confirm that all categories of candidate drivers we select from the literature are indeed relevant for the EUR/CHF exchange rate, we find different combinations of these variables to drive the exchange rate during different subperiods or regimes. Our results confirm previous findings regarding the Swiss franc’s safe-haven properties. The effects of interest rate differentials and the relative development of yield curve slopes in the Swiss franc relative to the euro and the US dollar show the signs that are expected from economic theory. Foreign currency interventions by the Swiss National Bank become a relevant driver only after the end of the peg period in 2015. The paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 describes our methodology, followed by a presentation of the data in Sect. 3. Section 4 discusses the empirical results, and Sect. 5 concludes.",

A most pressing issue by that time was to evaluate the current or immediate economic stance and obtain a forecast of the intermediate outlook. Measurements of usual monthly (survey) indicators used in Swiss GDP now- and forecasting virtually became outdated overnight. The monthly release calendar proved to be too low frequency to obtain timely updates of the economic stance. There was a quest for indicators related to actual productive activity released at a higher frequency, on a weekly or even daily basis. A daily indicator, a fever or f-curve, was developed in Burri and Kaufmann (2020). The f-curve corresponds to the first principle component extracted from publicly available financial market data and news sentiment indicators built from articles of major Swiss journals. The f-curve turns out to highly correlate with survey indicators of Swiss economic activity.Footnote 1
Lengwiler (2020) used electricity consumption available from Swissgrid, a monthly series and a daily series aggregated from a 15-minute frequency. The extracted electricity gap showed a significant negative shift on March 13, 2020. Eckert et al. (2020) set up a mixed-frequency factor model for a large dataset including additional series highly correlated with current production, available at a weekly or daily frequency. The extracted factor identifies well as a weekly series for GDP growth. Likewise, Wegmüller et al. (2023) extract a weekly economic activity index from selected nine daily or weekly series, carefully adjusted for calendar and seasonal effects prior extraction. The indicator highly correlates with and improves now-casting of GDP growth. Finally, Brown et al. (2020) and Becerra et al. (2020) exploited increased data availability and developed platforms that visualize in real time, respectively, individual payments data or compiled economic indicators based on Google search.Footnote 2 Compared with these studies, which focus on extracting the actual economic stance at a daily or weekly frequency or now-casting quarterly GDP growth, this paper uses a simple model to provide forecasts of current- and following-year yearly GDP growth during a crisis. These forecasts are cross-checked with forecasts published by two Swiss forecasting institutions, the State Secretariat of Economic Affairs (SECO) and KOF Swiss Economic Institute (KOF). In the parent paper to the present one, Kaufmann (2020) (KA20 in the following) exploited the timely available number of short-time workers to obtain a now- and forecast of quarterly GDP growth at the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. In a first univariate auto-regression, the log number of monthly short-time workers was purged from the systematic component, to obtain the shocks or innovations to the series. Monthly innovations were cumulated to quarterly shocks, which entered contemporaneously and with lags a second univariate regression fitted to quarterly GDP growth. It turned out that shocks explained an additional 24% of variation in GDP growth, and the model forecasted well the decline in quarterly level GDP during the financial crisis. At the time, the model forecasted a maximum decline in quarterly GDP of − 5.7%, with the highest forecast density interval (HFDI) of − 9.5% to − 2.9%. The forecast was quite in line with those published by forecast institutions in Switzerland, like SECO or KOF. The forecasts computed in KA20 by May 2020 were based on a data download from the SECO webpage including numbers on short-time workers up to January 2020. This series was completed with numbers of short-time workers pre-registered for short-time work from February to April 2020, obtained by e-mail from SECO. Data vintages on short-time workers as well as numbers of workers pre-registered for short-time work are unavailable, unfortunately. Therefore, for the present paper, we build a pseudo-real-time data bank based on numbers of workers with settled payments after 30 to 210 days following the settlement period.Footnote 3 For GDP, we use the real-time dataset available on the SECO webpage (Indergand and Leist, 2014). We end the introduction by providing some historical background. Section 2 then presents the data and the building of data vintages. Section 3 outlines the econometric approach, presents the model and forecasting equations, and details the forecasting procedure. Section 4 discusses the results and compares forecasts to institutional forecasts. Section 5 concludes. Some historical background This follow-up paper is motivated by the fact that the pandemic has lasted much longer than first expected in 2020. To curb the first wave of infections, most countries followed lockdown strategies, imposing very strict social distancing measures. The benefit of reducing new infections to a very low number within two to three months came at high economic and social costs. Undoubtedly, the imposed measures saved lives and prevented the health system, and eventually the economy, to collapse (Gatti and Retali, 2021). On the other hand, early studies also report (negative) distributional effects, whereby generally households at the lower-end of the income distribution were affected more heavily by the pandemic in various dimensions like health, education and income (Martínez et al. 2021; Fuchs-Schündeln et al. 2022b, a). Moreover, even very strict and longer-lasting lockdown strategies proved unsuccessful in preventing resurgent infection waves. Switzerland experienced five waves, the fifth during Spring 2022 with a record-high incidence exceeding 4000 [compared to roughly 160 (300) in April 2020 (2021)].Footnote 4 Although more infectious, mutations of the Sars-Cov-2 virus proved less aggressive. Against the background of an increasing share of population vaccinated or recovered, the virus eventually has become endemic (Bundesrat, 2022). In the course of the pandemic, Switzerland never again introduced such strict measures as in the first half of 2020.Footnote 5 Subject to quarantining and testing rules, persons could always move freely. Beginning 2021, re-installed federal restrictions concerned mainly restaurants and recreational businesses, without imposing a complete shutdown, however. For example, while indoor dining was prohibited, restaurants were allowed to provide take-away and later on outdoor dining services. The maximum number of persons per group, or imposed indoor social distancing measures were successively relaxed during Spring 2021. To counteract the negative effect of ongoing cantonal and re-installed federal restrictions, the Federal Government prolonged or reactivated some of the simplified administrative procedures installed in Spring 2020 to apply for and obtain short-time work benefits, like cancelling the waiting time, offering summary settlement, extending the eligibility period, or disregarding earnings from secondary employment.Footnote 6 After the unprecedented increase to 1.4 million short-time workers in April 2020,Footnote 7 numbers decreased to a quarter million (254,000) in October. In November, the number of short-time workers started increasing again to reach over half a million (524,000) in February 2021. Since then, numbers have decreased, reaching 48,000 in October 2021.",

Rather, digital innovations are also widespread in the manufacturing sector, which primarily reflects that digital technologies can have general-purpose characteristics.Footnote 1 Such technologies are a crucial ingredient of economic growth (e.g., Helpman, 1998; Bresnahan & Trajtenberg, 1995), and their early adoption can yield long-lasting advantages for first-movers in their respective fields (e.g., Brynjolfsson et al., 2021; Tambe et al., 2020; Triulzi et al., 2020). Unsurprisingly, software-related patenting has surged dramatically over the last decades, whereas the bulk of the increase was heavily concentrated in a few tech-clusters (Chattergoon & Kerr, 2022).Footnote 2 With this respect, Bloom et al. (2021) find that clusters which were pioneers in inventing disruptive technologies over the last decades have higher wages and more high-skilled jobs many years after the technology first emerged, suggesting that early involvement in novel disruptive technologies may have long-lasting economic benefits. Which set of technologies are potentially disruptive today and in the near future? And how are different countries—particularly Switzerland—positioned with respect to innovations in these technologies? These are the questions to which our paper contributes. Naturally, technologies from the digital domain are primary candidates to focus on, since digitization is transforming all aspects of economic activity (e.g., Brynjolfsson & McAfee, 2014). However, many other technologies also evolve at high speed and might become disruptive as well (e.g., battery technology). Furthermore, since some digital technologies have already emerged more than 40 years ago, they differ considerably from each other with respect to their rate of technological improvement. For example, digital control systems for loudspeakers is a rather mature digital technology with mostly incremental improvements. In contrast, improvements occur very rapidly in cloud computing (Singh et al., 2021). Accordingly, not every digital technology is necessarily related to disruptive changes today and it is challenging to distinguish disruptive technologies from others. As a workaround, researchers have often focused on particular technologies that have already been found to be disruptive. The most prominent example is the subject of artificial intelligence and its potential labor market implications.Footnote 3 A recent study by Singh et al. (2021) takes a different and more holistic approach: Instead of focusing on one or a few selected technologies, these authors introduce a framework which allows to estimate different technologies’ improvement rates.Footnote 4 This enables us to distinguish very dynamic (and potentially disruptive) technologies from slower evolving ones. Our paper thus builds heavily on this framework to approach our above-stated research questions. To do so, we first create a new dataset from different sources of information. More specifically, we combine patent data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) with information on whether a patent contains a digital technology from Inaba and Squicciarini (2017) and a novel indicator for technological improvement rates of 1757 distinct technologies that we obtain from Singh et al. (2021).Footnote 5 To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the first to connect these different sources of information. This allows us to accurately analyze the state of cutting-edge innovation in Switzerland and abroad. A main advantage of our constructed dataset is that it enables us not only to evaluate the quantity of digital and non-digital innovations across countries and industries (i.e., their stock or share of digital and non-digital patents). It also allows us to approximate their technological quality (i.e., the technological improvement rate of a technology a patent is associated with). We show that this is relevant for two main reasons: First, the variation regarding the rate of technological improvement across digital technologies is rather large. Second, patents from the digital domain and such related to technologies with high improvement rates are associated with a higher probability to contain breakthrough innovations as measured by forward citations of patents. To demonstrate the latter, we follow Kerr and Kerr (2018) and estimate a linear probability model in which the left-hand side contains a dummy variable indicating whether a patent contains a breakthrough innovation, as measured by forward citations. We provide empirical estimates and robustness tests showing that this pattern is also robust for different industries. This suggests that being innovative in digital and fast-improving technologies is important in various industries of the economy, including, for example, the pharmaceutical or machinery industry, toward which Switzerland’s innovation system is relatively heavily specialized. Yet, we show that Swiss innovations in most of the country’s core industries are not particularly directed toward fast-improving digital technologies when compared to other countries. This is because the Swiss innovation system is generally only weakly engaged in digital technologies, and digital innovations in Switzerland are less likely to occur in the fastest improving digital technologies. In non-digital domains, Switzerland’s position is somewhat better, but it is also not among the leaders in rapidly evolving non-digital fields (except for innovations from the medical and pharmaceutical industries). Overall, Switzerland can thus be considered as a laggard in terms of innovations in today’s fastest improving technologies. We argue that this could be a cause for concern, especially if adaption and catch-up become more difficult in the future, and if new technologies represent substitutes for more traditional ones. Our paper is related to different strands of the literature that study technological changes and their interplay with competitiveness. From a technical point of view, our paper builds heavily on prior work regarding the emergence and speed of technological innovations (see, e.g., Singh et al., 2021; Triulzi et al., 2020; Magee et al., 2016).Footnote 6
Singh et al. (2021) provide us with our empirical measure for technologies’ improvement rates, which is the basis for all empirical analyses in this paper. Our paper extends prior work in this area in two ways: First, we demonstrate a robust association between patented inventions’ corresponding technological improvement rates and their probability to contain a breakthrough innovation as measured by forward citations. Second, we assess the extent to which countries’ innovation systems are specialized with respect to fast-improving technologies, with a particular focus on Switzerland. With this latter regard, our paper has a connection to several studies that focus on the state of innovation across industries in different countries. For example, Kelly et al. (2021) use patent texts to investigate long-run trends in innovation activities across different industries considering data back to 1840. Their results imply that innovation activities have been mainly dominated by the information technology industry in recent years. Another example is Confraria et al. (2021), who have a similar focus and investigate emerging technology patterns. One of their main findings is that European firms are not particularly well positioned in digital innovations such as software engineering and semiconductor devices. Furthermore, reports by the OECD (2019) or the European Commission (2017) provide extensive descriptive overviews of digital trends across countries, illustrating that firms from EU countries are typically lagging behind their peers from the USA and Japan in digital innovations. With this respect, our paper also has a loose connection to several contributions that are focusing on the impact of early involvement in disruptive technologies on competitiveness. A major example is Bloom et al. (2021), who identify a set of 29 disruptive technologies from the last decades and show for the USA that regions who were pioneers in inventing these technologies have obtained long-lasting benefits in terms of wages and high-skilled employment. Tambe et al. (2020) focus on the firm level and demonstrate that digital capital accumulation predicts the productivity of firms in the USA in the near future. Finally, our paper’s main focus is on Switzerland, whereas existing studies focus mainly on counting the stock of digital patents in selected technological areas (Gramke & Glauser, 2017, in German language) industries (Rutzer & Weder, 2021, also in German language) or on the general scope of patent activities of the Swiss innovation system (Grampp et al., 2018, also in German language). These studies use patent data and compare the innovativeness of Switzerland in digital domains with other countries. Besides overall trends, the work of Gramke and Glauser (2017) also investigates in more detail the positioning of Switzerland in some important fields such as AI, the Internet of things, and robotics. The general conclusion of these three studies is that Switzerland is not among the top innovators in terms of the number of digital patents. Finally, also OECD (2019) focuses on Switzerland and highlights that the country’s recent patent activities in ICT-related fields are below the OECD average. What we add to this literature is an analysis that additionally takes into account the specialization patterns of the Swiss innovation system with respect to its orientation toward faster or slower improving technologies. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 focuses on the concept of technological improvement rates and describes data sources that allow us to investigate it. It then shows that digital technologies are among the most dynamic technologies and provide empirical estimates suggesting that patents from the digital domain and those related to fast-improving technologies are associated with a higher probability to produce breakthrough innovations. Section 3 examines patterns of the Swiss innovation system with respect to digital and fast-improving technologies, compares them with other countries, and discusses the findings. Section 4 concludes the paper.",
