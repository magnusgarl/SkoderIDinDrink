43,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,30 March 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-010-0027-5,Incentive provision and coordination as market functions,February 2010,John E. Roemer,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The main functions of the market are to provide incentives for economic agents to perform economically useful activity, and to coordinate resource allocation. To be more precise, it is material incentives that the market provides, and that point will be key in what follows. It is not easy to provide a clean definition that would enable us to distinguish decisively between the incentive and coordination functions of the market, but I  think such a distinction exists and is important. Consider the first theorem of welfare economics (FTWE) which is, in my view, a theorem only about the coordination function of the market. Incentive problems are assumed away, as it is simply postulated that firm managers will maximize profits, that workers will supply effort, and so on. Prices, in the FTWE, are simply telling agents what to do. Contrast this with the principal – agent model (PAM), which focuses entirely on incentives. Here, prices or contracts or menus are not meant simply to direct agents to do the right thing, but to make them offers they cannot refuse. In the typical PAM, it may well be that the agent knows what the principal wants, but he (the agent) requires a material incentive to induce him to take that action. Indeed, the change in focus in economic theory, during the past thirty-five years, from general equilibrium theory to contract theory, is associated with a radical change in viewpoint: that the central problem of economics is not one of coordination but one of incentives. Indeed, the old definition of economics as the study of the allocation of scarce resources to competing uses is one based upon the coordination view. I  conjecture that today's economic theorists would prefer a more mechanism-design sort of definition, putting the emphasis on inducing economic agents to do the right things. I  wish to raise the question whether it is really the case that the primary function of markets is the incentive function. I  propose to think of the incentive problem as the problem of encouraging economic agents to expend effort, which will create an economic good (be it an innovation or a labor service). The coordination problem is the one of allocating economic resources to agents (firms and consumers) in an economy: that is, labors of various kinds to firms, other inputs of production to firms, and final goods to consumers. This distinction is imprecise. Is extracting the ‘labor’ from the ‘labor power’ of a worker a problem of coordination or incentive? This is a gray area. Roughly speaking, I  think of the incentive problem as one of bringing into being economic resources that do not already exist, and the coordination problem as the combining of existing resources into useful outputs. (The labor/labor power distinction focuses on the fact that there is an incentive problem in transforming labor power into labor, as Karl Marx famously emphasized; but that issue is ignored in classical general equilibrium theory and, in particular, in the FTWE.) I  wish to explore whether the market is relatively more important as a device for solving one of these problems than the other. Indeed, the principal example upon which I  will focus in this paper is the choice of occupation and the effort that is implied by the necessity to train for it. One of the most salient natural experiments for studying the relative importance of the market in providing coordination and incentives may be the economy of the Soviet Union. Almost everyone now agrees that there were vast inefficiencies in the Soviet economy, primarily due to the system of central allocation and planning, relied upon in lieu of the market. Is it possible to say that the main deficiency suffered due to the market's absence was of coordination, or of proper incentives? Certainly evidence has been offered for both viewpoints. Perhaps the view of the failure of incentives is best summed up in the Soviet joke, “They pretend to pay us and we pretend to work.” On the other hand, if we look at the debates that occurred in the 1960s in the USSR about introducing prices, it seems that the main concern was for coordination. In the (Evsei) Liberman debate (Zaleski 1967), economists talked about using prices to decentralize the planning problem; the assumption seems to have been that firm managers wanted to do the right thing, but it was often simply infeasible to do so, lacking prices. Leonid Kantorovich studied and solved the transportation problem, a special case of linear programming, for which he shared the Nobel Prize with Tjalling Koopmans; the transportation problem is entirely one of coordination. Going back somewhat further, even Friedrich Hayek – at least the pre-war Hayek– emphasized the coordination function of markets over their incentive function. In his interchange with Oscar Lange on market socialism, he wrote that he was willing to assume that firm managers under socialism were ‘loyal and capable (Hayek 1940);’ the problem, he said, was that without real competition in real markets, they would never learn the best technologies to use, what goods needed to be supplied, and so on. Planners would be incapable of giving them directions that would guide managers to the right actions, even though, Hayek assumed, they would desire to carry out those actions, if they knew what they were. Even the Hayekian view of the entrepreneur is ambivalent: Do entrepreneurs come up with new ideas because they want to make money, or because they love the game of creation and invention? If the former, then the market is providing incentives; if the latter, it is coordinating! I  do not know Hayek's view on entrepreneurs, but Schumpeter's view is clear: entrepreneurs are in it for the love of the game. The money is quite secondary to themFootnote 1. Schumpeter writes that entrepreneurs never finance their own projects; they are a distinct class from investors or capitalists. (This is not quite the same as saying that they are not in it for the money, but the point is related.) Robert Allen's (2003) recent Soviet economic history suggests that the main problem with the Soviet economy was one of poor coordination, not poor incentives. He writes that, until around 1970, the development strategy in the USSR was straight-forward: move peasants from the farms into the cities to man the factories. This produced industrialization and a rapid rate of growth. But by 1970 or so, the move from farm to factory was complete, and the next problem was to figure out how to innovate and target different sectors' growth, and here the planners made bad mistakes. Allen claims that factory managers pretty much did what they were told to do by planners: there was no major failure of incentive. But when more subtle questions of economic development had to be answered, the lack of participation by thousands of creative economic agents in a decentralized way became keyFootnote 2. Indeed, before 1970, there was very little criticism by western economists of the Soviet economic model: the main attacks were political. Indeed, many believed that the Soviet economic juggernaut would overtake the west. The formulation of the PAM in 1973 (see Ross 1973) changed all that: but we must ask, did that model change the way economists interpreted reality (with a good hammer, every problem looks like a nail), or was the view that the Soviet economy suffered from poor incentives based upon a new post-1960s reality? It would, of course, be extremely interesting to be able to answer this question about the Soviet economy for its own sake. But my principal interest in the question is motivated by my belief that, upon its answer, depends the possibility for, eventually, achieving much more equality of income and wealth than we currently have in market economies, while still using the market mechanism. Roughly speaking, if the market is needed mainly as a coordination device, then it should be possible to separate consumption from earnings without harming efficiency. Markets can be used to coordinate economic activity, and then substantial redistribution can be implemented to reduce inequality of consumption. On the other hand, if the market is needed mainly to provide material incentives, then it is much harder to redistribute without substantial effects on productivity. Indeed, this could explain why the Nordic countries have implemented a highly egalitarian distribution of income without, apparently, any substantial efficiency costs (see Lindert 2004). This explanation, however, is not Lindert's: he believes that the reason efficiency has been maintained in the Nordic economies is because taxes are designed cleverly, so as not to reduce output. (Capital is taxed relatively lightly, while labor, the immobile factor, is heavily taxed.) But Lindert's is only one interpretation. A second possible interpretation is that effort decisions of economic agents are fairly insensitive to relative earnings, but prices do give people instructions about what to do – where to expend effort. Let me reiterate one point: the claim that coordination is the main function of the market is not a claim that individuals do not maximize utility. If material incentives are not indispensable, that must be because income is not the most important argument in the preferences of economic agents. The incentives that people have to perform economic activity may not be terribly sensitive to their incomes: they may come from other motivations, such as enjoyment of work, making a social contribution, feeling one's life is productive, demonstrating to others that one is productive, and so on. Again, we may glean clues from the Soviet experience: it does not seem that people in general failed to become educated, although the material benefits to higher education were fairly small. Likewise, Cuba has (or had for many years) the highest literacy rate in Latin America, although surely the returns to education are much higher in capitalist countries in Latin America than in Cuba. It may well still be the case that Cuba's medical establishment is the best in Latin America, although their physicians are surely not very well paid. I  believe the truth is that markets are needed both for incentives and coordination: I  am questioning the virtual disappearance of coordination as a market function in recent economic theory. To continue with the Cuban example, the Financial Times notes that Raul Castro's government is planning to diminish the guaranteed level of social provision of foodstuffs to Cubans. Alfredo Jam, head of macroeconomic analysis in the Cuban economic ministry told the FT reporter, “We can't give people so much security with their income that it reduces their willingness to work. We can have equality in access to education and health, but not equality in income. (FT, August  19, 2008).” Evidently, Jam believes that incentives are important. As a final remark, to note how things have changed in economic theory, consider Hayek's (1945) statement to the American Economic Association, in his 1945 presidential address. That famous address is entitled, “The use of knowledge in society.” Hayek's critique of the First Theorem of Welfare Economics is not that it ignores incentives: it is that real markets are needed to find (equilibrium) prices. Indeed, there is no explicit discussion of incentives in this address. It is implicitly assumed that individual agents take actions to increase their profits, but little is made of that. The main point is that knowledge of time and place – local knowledge – is as important as scientific knowledge, and that that kind of knowledge can never be assimilated by a central planning bureau. There is, indeed, no dispute about whether planning is necessary: the question is only whether it can be centralized or must remain decentralized. From my viewpoint, Hayek, at least Hayek before 1950, was a champion of the market as a coordination device.",

In perfect markets rational actors perfectly anticipate all shocks, or at least turn uncertainties into tradable risks, against which they insure. It follows from this that all attempts by public policy or other collective action to provide security against uncertainty by intervening in market processes have to be broken down, as they impede this self-correcting capacity of the market (see OECD 1994 for the locus classicus of this approach in international policy-making). The key word in the policy-making that has resulted from this has been “flexibility”. Labour flexibility has many meanings, and industrial sociology recognizes forms of flexible working within work organizations and not just as movements in the external labour market (Wilthagen and Tros 2004). Eurostat (2007, Chap. 3) currently recognize three distinct forms: internal qualitative, or functional, which concerns a wide range of ways in which workers may take on varied and complex tasks; internal numerical, concerning the deployment of flexible working time and manning arrangements among an existing workforce; and external, concerning movement of workers among firms. Wilthagen and Tros (2004) insist that it should not be reduced to the three of these alone. However, in the dominant stream of policy thinking flexibility has until recently been a euphemism for ease of hire and fire, and for a general elimination of constraints that might be placed on management's freedom to dispose of labour as it wants. Very many policy measures taken by governments around the world have been moves in this direction. There is however a problem. The perfect labour market may well be an impossible dream. It is not possible for economic models to incorporate all shocks. It cannot be assumed that actors in the labour market have adequate knowledge rationally to anticipate likely uncertainties and to be able to turn them into tradable risks. If that is the case, then measures to provide for various kinds of security against economic uncertainty may be necessary if the confidence of labour-market participants is to be sustained; and the market itself requires their confidence, as labour-market participants are also consumers. But, of course, measures of this kind then impede the progress towards the perfect labour market. This dilemma has been recognized by policy-makers, in two different ways. First, in democracies they have found it politically impossible to remove social policy supports for economic security in the way recommended by the economic theory. Secondly, and more constructively, there is important evidence that some forms of security provision do not seem to impede labour-market efficiency but even seem to be positively associated with it. This has now been recognized in the OECD's 2006 follow-up to its 1994 Jobs Study (OECD 2006a). If this was already the case, the search for the perfect labour market has been even more thoroughly thrown off course by the financial crisis of 2007--2008. This has been a crisis at the heart of the neo-liberal model of market governance. Financial markets of the Anglo-American type, the type responsible for the crisis, had been seen as the purest expression of what could be achieved by the pure market, with their capacity for perfect anticipation and future discounting through calculated risk sharing (Fama 1971, 1991). Less widely understood, these markets have also been directly relevant to the problem of the labour market: instead of depending on social security benefits and job protection, workers could offset their labour-market uncertainty by taking on unsecured loans, the risky character of which was “lost” by being extensively traded in secondary markets. The consumer spending unleashed by these loans stimulated demand in the economy, further reducing uncertainty. It achieved similar goals to Keynesian demand management, but using market means alone and without recourse to government intervention (Crouch 2009; Bellofiore and Halevy 2009). We now know that this model was not sustainable. First, it is questionable whether the Anglo-American financial model really meets the criteria of the pure market. It seems to depend on traders not knowing the dimensions of the risks concealed within the bundles of assets in which they trade; but the perfect market depends heavily on rational actors motivated to acquire perfect knowledge. Second, the rush by governments to sustain the banking system after its collapse made that system dependent on political intervention of a kind completely incompatible with the rules of the market. The model seems to be surviving; the interests vested in it are too powerful for it to be permitted to collapse. But it can no longer be seen as a pure market, or as a market solution to problems of economic uncertainty. It is a distorted market, and one that has become dependent on government regulation and massive financial support. Whether or not the moral hazard introduced by governments intervening in this way will lead to worse outcomes than if governments had allowed the markets to engage in their own major correction is as yet unknown. In this context existing doubts surrounding the search for pure labour markets are doubly reinforced. First, if the financial system can exist only with support external to itself, including state support, should the labour market be expected to be any different? Second, if, in some countries, insecure or flexible labour markets were only feasible because workers had access to sources of credit not dependent on their labour incomes, what happens after the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage and other unsecured credit markets? If that system was the market's answer to labour-market insecurity, was it more cost-effective and efficient than orthodox social policy? In this context it is necessary to revisit the whole question of labour-market uncertainty and the most appropriate measures for reconciling workers' demands for protection from it with the need for flexibility. The crisis in unsecured credit enables us to see that not only formal public labour market and social policy are relevant to attempts at reducing economic security; and we should not assume that unsecured credit has been the only other relevant set of practices. Several other areas of social life, such as the family, have also been important, in at least some societies; areas that have not been involved in the central ideological conflict between markets and public social policy. In particular, we need to consider “practices” alongside policies. Practices contrast with policies in being implicit, with consequences that may be unrecognized by those following them, and in the control of many groups going beyond the scope of public policy. For example, the different implications for men and women of the way in which a transnational corporation organizes its supply chains may be more important for differences between the genders than any government policies on equal opportunities in the various countries involved. Or, to take another example, the availability of unsecured mortgages may be more important to low-paid workers' perceptions of their economic (if not their employment) security than any labour laws. The aim of this paper is to provide a framework for examining the relationship between flexibility and security that takes account of this wider context. Particular attention will also be paid to the implications of different flexibility and security regimes for the issues of inequality and sustainability. It is proposed that studies of the balance between flexibility and security, which currently concentrate on just a few familiar strands of formal labour and social policy, need to expand to consider the full context within which these measures play their part.",10
43,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,10 June 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-010-0030-x,"Inequality and the Labor Market – Theories, opinions, models, and practices of unequal distribution and how they can be justified",February 2010,Claus Offe,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"All societies face the dual challenge of solving two particular problems in a consistent and reliable way. The first problem is that of production, i.e., how and by whom are factors of production combined, and what division of labor is adopted, in order to generate and increase the overall output. The other is the problem of distribution: After production has taken place, its fruits must be allocated to those who have participated in the process, as well as others. Only the latter problem is what interests us here. There are, however, two evident links between the solutions of our two problems. First, and at least in the long run, the volume of production constrains the volume of what can be distributed. More interestingly, the pattern of distribution (say between workers and investors, or consumption and savings) has implications for the volume of future cycles of production. Any nearly complete normative theory of what distributive justice demands in terms of equality and to what extent inequalities must be accepted as justified will have to answer at least three questions. The first concerns the moral duties (e.g., the due recognition of need, desert, or entitlement) or/and desirable consequences (such as efficiency, well-being, socio-economic security) that support the demand for or constitute exceptions from equality. Secondly, the question needs to be answered that was famously posed by Sen (1980): “Equality of What?”, with the alternative philosophical answers being “resources” (or “opportunities”), “welfare”, and “capabilities”. The answers that policy-makers are concerned with are equalisanda such as income, wealth, housing, access to the labor market and jobs, life expectancy, social protection, access to services (education, health, police protection) and infrastructure such as public transportation. In a different conceptualization, equality may mean the equal opportunity of persons to pursue freely chosen life plans. I'll briefly return below to the debate that Sen's work has triggered. Thirdly, the universe
of people must also be defined across whom valued resources are to be distributed in a justifiable manner. Most authors do not address this issue at all, implying that the answer is the citizenry of the nation state, the latter fulfilling the demands of justice through redistributive tax and other policies. But even if this (very limited) understanding of the scope of (in)equality is accepted, ambiguities remain as to who is to be equalized to whom. To illustrate, consider an example from pension policy. Here, the question is: Which universe do we want to equalize across? The answer can be, first, that all pensioners should receive the same (i.e., a flat rate) pension; second, that, in a longitudinal perspective, levels of individual transfers should mirror the relative income position that the pensioner has occupied previously during his or her active years, thus equalizing, in line with the “Bismarckian” ideal, relative status over biographical time slices; third, it can mean that the cohorts of present pensioners should be allowed to partake in the economic gains made by the presently active cohorts, as in any “dynamic”, or indexed, pension system with regular adjustments of pensions to increases of current real wages, a method that equalizes income gains from growth across the entire adult population. While all three of these design options are related to some understanding of “equality”, evidently not all of them are mutually compatible. Issues of social and economic inequality are central to many debates in the social sciences. In my overview of some current problems, I  shall proceed as follows. First, I  wish to look at some of the recent normative debates among egalitarians and others on what justice requires concerning the distribution of resources. Apart from philosophical principles, there are also opinions, beliefs, and social norms, often strongly held, of ordinary citizens concerning the (un)desirability of (un)equal patterns of distribution; these beliefs and opinions are determined by a wide variety of causal factors. In the second part of the paper, I  briefly discuss the question of to what extent the labor market, as opposed to the institutional arrangements in which it is embedded and which are essentially of a political nature (the educational system, by the political regime of taxation and subsidies, etc.) determine observable patterns of income and other inequalities. In the third part, I  am going to address the question of how firms and other work organizations structure and justify inequalities among the holders of jobs and positions.",1
43,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,30 April 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-010-0029-3,Employer wage subsidies and wages in Germany: empirical evidence from individual data,February 2010,Gesine Stephan,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Targeted wage subsidies are tailored to particular groups of unemployed persons and typically granted for a limited period of time. They temporarily reduce a firm's labor costs for hiring and employing previously unemployed persons and can thus trigger the placement of such persons into jobs. To motivate a firm to hire a particular unemployed person for a particular job, a period of subsidization might prove helpful for several reasons: First, a worker's skills might not match the requirements of a job, but the mismatch is expected to diminish with training on the job. Second, a period of subsidization reduces an employer's uncertainty about a job applicant's productivity and thus serves as a screening instrument. Third, institutional factors such as minimum wages or collectively negotiated wages might drive a wedge between individual productivity and wages. Of course, the longer term effects of the subsidy depend on the issue whether the gap between the expected returns and costs of employment to the firm can be closed during the subsidization period. We are interested in the wage effects of targeted wage subsidies, which cannot be predicted ex ante. For instance, studies of three North American programs obtained quite different results: In the short-run, Hamersma (2008) found that 40% of subsidies were passed over to workers as a wage premium, while no effects could be found on cumulated wages over a longer time period. In contrast, Dubin and Rivers (1993) showed for the short-run that wages were lowest for workers participating in a wage subsidy program, while Brouillette and Lacroix (2008) obtained a similar result for cumulated wages. During the actual subsidization period, subsidies may provide opportunities for rent sharing, thus subsidized workers might receive higher wages than similar unsubsidized workers. Otherwise eligibility for a subsidy can be interpreted as a negative signal and stigmatize workers, thus incurring comparatively low wages. In the longer run, employment rates of previously subsidized workers may differ from those of unsubsidized workers, which will have an impact on cumulated wages. In Germany, an employer could be asked to reimburse part of the subsidy if he dismisses a worker during a “protection period” (that encompasses the subsidization period or an obligatory follow-up period of the same length): Firms may tend to dismiss previously subsidized workers immediately after the expiration of this period. Otherwise this period can provide sufficient time to increase productivity through learning-on-the-job and thus prolong job duration. Our study presents first evidence on wage rates received by participants in a German wage subsidy program as well as on their cumulated wages. In Germany, targeted wage subsidies paid to employers are an important instrument of active labor market policy: During 2003, more than 180,000 subsidized jobs were taken up. While the number of entries into the program decreased to 134,000 in 2005, afterwards they increased again, up to around 250,000 in 2007 and 2008. Transitions into subsidized jobs accounted for roughly 3% of all transitions out of unemployment in Germany during 2004 (Rothe 2007). Within our sample of medium-aged unemployed persons entering employment during the second quarter of 2003, as much as 6% of all transitions out of unemployment into employment were subsidized. In particular, we ask whether workers taking up a subsidized job during the second quarter of 2003 experienced wage gains or wage losses compared to otherwise similar, but unsubsidized newly hired workers. The wage question is of political importance, because wage subsidies are by German law intended to compensate employers for a temporarily reduced productivity of subsidized workers. Thus, if we observe wage gains or losses of subsidized workers this could be a hint on unintended effects of the program. To compare wages in subsidized and unsubsidized jobs, we combine propensity score matching with a difference-in-differences strategy. We show that subsidized workers in Germany receive daily wages that are not significantly different from those of similar unsubsidized workers. In contrast, taking into account that the subsequent employment rates of participants are higher, we find significant higher cumulated wages of (previously) subsidized workers during our observation period of 3.5  years. We interpret our finding of similar daily wages in the light of the German system of industrial relations: In Germany, collective contracts (still) play an important role for wage setting, and wages are usually attached to types of jobs rather than to individual workers. This implies that different wages for subsidized workers within similar jobs compared to unsubsidized workers might be perceived as unfair and not acceptable by workers and firms as well as by caseworkers of the Public Employment Service. Furthermore, wage undercutting might be infeasible, because subsidized jobs are on average rather low-wage jobs. Higher employment shares of previously subsidized workers – the underlying reason for higher cumulated wages – are probably related to the design of the subsidy: The “protection period” seems to be sufficiently long for many (previously) subsidized employees to catch up any productivity deficits that might have existed when taking up the job, or to invalidate ascribed productivity deficits. In particular the results on cumulated wage effects (resulting from differences in subsequent employment shares) are subject to several qualifications: Our approach ignores that the subsidy might have been essential for the hiring decision (which probably underestimates cumulated effects of the subsidy on wages). But it assumes that estimated higher employment shares of previously subsidized workers are in fact a result of subsidization, or of the “protection period” associated with the subsidy. However, although our analysis controls for a number of important firm-related features, we cannot entirely rule out that further (unobserved) selection processes of workers into firms took place. Furthermore, the analysis restricts itself to the estimation of direct effects of the subsidy on participating workers and does not take into account possible indirect effects (such as for instance effects on reservation wages, or substitution of unsubsidized workers through subsidized ones). In the following, Sect.  2 provides a literature review on theoretical aspects and on the empirical evidence, while Sect.  3 presents details on the program analyzed. Section  4 provides information on the data set and Sect.  5 depicts the econometric strategy. Section  6 presents the empirical results.",10
43,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,25 June 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-010-0032-8,The impact of financial participation on workers' compensation,February 2010,Martyn Andrews,Lutz Bellmann,Richard Upward,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The financial participation of employees in their firm, in the form of profit-sharing or share ownership, continues to increase across almost all European countries, albeit from a low level in many of them. The fourth European Working Conditions Survey (Welz and Macias 2007) suggests that, in 2005, around  10% of European workers participate in profit-sharing schemes, and around  2% in share ownership schemes. To a greater or lesser extent these schemes have been encouraged by European governments via the use of tax incentives and legislation. The second “Pepper Report” (Commission of the European Communities 1996), argued that increased use of profit-sharing would encourage greater productivity, wage flexibility, employment and employee involvement, and called on member states to promote the greater use of financial participation by employees. Although the concept of profit-sharing has existed for at least 150 years in Germany (Von Thünen 1850), this form of remuneration is still not widespread. The Property Development Act of 1984 (amended in 1994) was the first legislation which specifically encouraged the participation of employees in the assets of their firms (Carstensen et  al. 1995). Incentives for profit-sharing and share ownership include limited cash subsidies and some exemptions from tax and social security payments. Incentives for profit-sharing and share ownership are interrelated, and so we expect to find firms offering both schemes simultaneously. Legally, profit-sharing in firms can either be based on individual contracts between firms and workers or on contracts between the works council and the firm. The academic debate on financial participation initially focussed on a series of papers by Weitzman (e.g. Weitzman 1984,  1987), which suggested that profit-sharing could lower the marginal cost of hiring workers and hence permanently increase the level of employment. However, a key finding of the empirical literature on profit-sharing is that the introduction of such schemes is not generally associated with reductions in the basic wage.Footnote 1  This suggests that the widespread introduction of profit-sharing schemes would not have the positive employment effects advocated by Weitzman. A second finding of the empirical literature is that the introduction of profit schemes is associated with higher productivity. Prendergast (1999) implicitly suggests that these two facts may be linked. If the introduction of profit-sharing leads to higher total compensation for workers, this might explain higher productivity, either because of worker selection or efficiency wage mechanisms. In contrast, some workers' representatives have argued against the introduction of profit-sharing because they fear precisely what Weitzman hoped for: that profit-sharing would be a way for firms to reduce the marginal cost of hiring workers, while at the same time transferring some of the risk of variable profits from firms to workers. The European Foundation argues that employee representatives are more likely to accept the introduction of financial sharing if there is protection of workers from “unreasonable risk” and there is a prohibition of wage substitution (Welz and Macias 2007). In this paper we provide detailed evidence on the relationship between the use of financial participation schemes and total worker compensation using a large panel of German plants linked to data on the workers in those plants. We are able to control for a wide range of worker and plant characteristics which might affect the use of financial participation schemes as well as total compensation. The use of linked worker--plant panel data also allows us to control for unobserved plant and worker effects on compensation by comparing plants which introduce profit-sharing with similar plants who do not. Thus, we provide new evidence on how much workers gain from financial participation in their firms. We can also examine whether the introduction of financial participation has an effect on the selection of workers in and out of the plant.Footnote 2  In theory, workers' preferences for increased risk (or plants' preferences for workers with certain characteristics) could lead to changes in the composition of the workforce. By comparing workers who remain in the plant with those who join or leave we can effectively control for this when calculating the effect on workers' compensation. The use of linked worker–plant data also allows us to examine whether financial participation has effects on the distribution of compensation across different types of worker. Lemieux et  al.

Barnow,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Since the 1960s, social experiments have been increasingly used in the United States to determine the effects of pilots and demonstrations as well as ongoing programs in areas as diverse as education, health insurance, housing, job training, welfare cash assistance, and time of day pricing of electricity. Although social experiments have not been widely used in Europe, there is growing interest in expanding their use in evaluating social programs. Social experiments remain popular in the United States, but there has been a spirited debate in recent years regarding whether recent methodological developments, particularly propensity score matching and regression discontinuity designs, overcome many of the key objections to nonexperimental methods. This paper provides an assessment of some of the issues that arise in conducting social experiments and explains some of the things that can go wrong in conducting and interpreting the results of social experiments. The paper first defines what is generally meant by the term social experiments and briefly reviews their use in the United States. This is followed by a discussion of the advantages of social experiments over nonexperimental methods. The next section discusses the limitations of social experiments – what we cannot learn from social experiments. Next is a section discussing some of the things that can go wrong in social experiments and limits of what we learn from them. To illustrate the problems that can arise, the penultimate section provides a case study of lessons from the National JTPA Study, a social experiment that was used to assess a large training program for disadvantaged youth and adults in the United States. The last section provides conclusions.",4

Eine Analyse für den Zeitraum 1999 bis 2008,November 2010,Klaus Troltsch,Günter Walden,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In der aktuellen Bildungsberichterstattung wird für die Jahre 2008 und 2009 der Anteil der Betriebe, die eine eigene Ausbildung im Rahmen der dualen Berufsausbildung durchführen, mit jeweils 24 % ausgewiesen (Autorengruppe Bildungsberichterstattung 2008, S. 279; Bundesinstitut für Berufsbildung 2010, S. 191). Diese seit Jahren nur wenig veränderte Quote wird in wissenschaftlichen Untersuchungen, bildungspolitischen Stellungnahmen und einschlägigen Presseartikeln aufgegriffen und angesichts des hohen Anteils von Jugendlichen, die in den vergangenen Jahren keine Lehrstelle erhalten haben, als zu geringe Ausbildungsbeteiligung der deutschen Betriebe kritisiert (z. B. Baethge et  al. 2007; Autorengruppe Bildungsberichterstattung 2008; Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund 2008). Den gängigen Berechnungen zur Ausbildungsbeteiligung der Wirtschaft liegen zumeist aggregierte Querschnittsanalysen zu bestimmten Stichtagen entweder auf Basis amtlicher Statistiken oder von Stichprobenerhebungen zugrunde. Diese Art von Auswertungen und der Zeitvergleich von Querschnittszahlen vermag zwar Aufschluss über die generelle Entwicklung der Ausbildungsbeteiligung zu geben. Welche Gesamtdynamik den Ausbildungsstellenmarkt insgesamt kennzeichnet, ist an diesen Zahlen aber nicht zu erkennen. Es ist bekannt, dass sich als Wesensmerkmal kapitalistischer Wirtschaftssysteme die Grundgesamtheit der Betriebe im Zuge der ökonomischen Entwicklung ständig verändert, bestehende Betriebe aus dem Wirtschaftsprozess ausscheiden und neue Unternehmen hinzukommen (Schumpeter 1911; Schulte 2002; Fritsch u. Audretsch 1995). Ein besserer Kenntnisstand zur Dynamik des Ausbildungsangebotes dürfte auch zur Abschätzung des Erfolgs von bildungspolitischen Maßnahmen hilfreich sein. In Anbetracht der Situation auf dem Ausbildungsstellenmarkt versuchen Politik, Wirtschaft und Verbände mit vielfältigen Maßnahmen, bisher nicht ausbildende Betriebe zum Einstieg in eine eigene Ausbildung zu bewegen, zumal mehr als die Hälfte der nicht ausbildenden Betriebe über eine entsprechende Ausbildungsberechtigung verfügt (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung 2006, S. 146). Eine besondere Rolle bei der Verbesserung der Lage auf dem Ausbildungsstellenmarkt wird dabei dem nationalen Pakt für Ausbildung und Fachkräftenachwuchs zugemessen, der 2004 zwischen der Bundesregierung und den Spitzenverbänden der Wirtschaft abgeschlossen wurde (Nationaler Pakt für Ausbildung 2005). Während der dreijährigen Laufzeit des Ausbildungspaktes verpflichtete sich die Wirtschaft, jährlich 30.000 neue Ausbildungsplätze einzuwerben (Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung 2007, S. 74). Mit der Verlängerung des Ausbildungspaktes im Jahr 2007 ist diese Zahl auf 60.000 Ausbildungsplätze aufgestockt worden. Allerdings fehlen Informationen über die Zahl der Ausbildungsstellen, die aufgrund der wirtschaftlichen Dynamik ohnehin jedes Jahr entsteht, und damit eine Bezugsbasis zur Beurteilung des Erfolgs des Ausbildungspaktes. Auch die im Jahr 2003 beschlossene Aussetzung der Ausbilder-Eignungsverordnung (AEVO) sollte Erleichterungen für Betriebe bieten, um zusätzliche Ausbildungskapazitäten zu schaffen oder erstmalig in die Ausbildung Jugendlicher einzusteigen. Auch hier ist vor dem Hintergrund der wirtschaftlichen Dynamik der Erfolg schwer zu beurteilen (vgl. Ulmer u. Jablonka 2008). In diesem Aufsatz soll für die Jahre 1999 bis 2008 untersucht werden, durch welche zentralen Einflussfaktoren die Dynamik im betrieblichen Ausbildungsangebot bestimmt wird. Hierbei soll auch der Frage nachgegangen werden, ob sich die Jahre nach Abschluss des Ausbildungspaktes und der Aussetzung der AEVO deutlich vom vorausgegangenen Zeitraum unterscheiden und ob positive Effekte dieser bildungspolitischen Maßnahmen nachweisbar sind. In Abschn.  2 werden zunächst einige theoretische Vorüberlegungen zu den wesentlichen Einflussfaktoren der Dynamik im betrieblichen Ausbildungsangebot vorgestellt.

Noch stärker fällt auf, dass die Arbeitslosigkeit nun schon über lange Zeit hinweg doppelt so hoch ist wie im Westen. Personen, die in ostdeutschen Regionen leben, sind folglich in mindestens zweifacher Weise benachteiligt: Zum einen finden sie viel schwerer einen Arbeitsplatz, weil die Arbeitslosigkeit viel höher ist, zum anderen ist ihr Einkommen niedriger. Wie können derart große Unterschiede innerhalb eines Landes über einen so langen Zeitraum bestehen bleiben? Zwanzig Jahre sind eine lange Zeit. Die neoklassischen Standardansätze der ökonomischen Theorie ließen erwarten, dass sich Arbeitsmarktdisparitäten ausgleichen würden, selbst ohne unterstützende wirtschaftspolitische Maßnahmen. Stattdessen beobachtet man eine große Stabilität in den Unterschieden. Diese betreffen auch die kleinräumige Ebene. Ostdeutschland ist kein homogener Raum, es gibt vielmehr Regionen, die den Anschluss an den Westen durchaus schaffen, andere hängen jedoch weit zurück (vgl. Abb.  1).

A review",November 2010,Alfred Alexander Garloff,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Many economists argue that the institution of a minimum wage compresses the wage structure, thereby contributing to high unemployment, especially for low-skilled individuals. This hypothesis is common in economic literature in the context of the different experiences in the U.S. and Continental Europe regarding wage dispersion and unemployment (see, e.g., Katz and Autor 1999; Blau and Kahn 2002; Blanchard 2006). Krugman (1994, p. 62) states: “… that growing U.S. inequality and growing European unemployment are different sides of the same coin”. Many observers argue that skill-based technical progress, reorganization processes or globalization have decreased the demand for low-skilled work in industrialized countries, thereby lowering the market wage. However, in Continental Europe institutional factors have prevented wages from falling (enough), causing a reaction via the amount of laborers employed and thereby increasing unemployment of the low-skilled.Footnote 1 This view is not uncontested for several reasons. Firstly, changes in employment rates in Europe were quite similar across skill groups and changes in the employment rates of the low-skilled were quite similar in Europe and the U.S. (Acemoglu and Pischke 1999). A second reason is that institutional differences can explain differences in unemployment and inequality levels, but not in changes. Explaining changes in these variables requires changes in institutions. The decline of the minimum wage in the U.S., however, is often argued to be such an institutional change. Finally, some authors contest the view that wages in Continental Europe and the U.S. developed differently. More precisely, Dustmann et  al. (2009) argue that the development of wages in Germany was similar to that in the U.S., but that it occurred later.Footnote 2
 In the past, with a few exceptions, there was no state-administered minimum wage in Germany. Recently, the possibility to implement minimum wages for specific sectors has been enlarged dramatically. From a political point of view, the question of the introduction of minimum wages in Germany was a major topic of political discussion and competition between the parties of the big coalition in the summer of 2007. The result of this political process was not a general minimum wage, but basically that the possibility to declare negotiated wages to be binding by the government under certain conditions was extended from the construction sector to other sectors. As per § 5 of the “Tarifvertragsgesetz” (Collective Agreement Law) the Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs can declare the negotiated wage of a collective agreement binding for not-bounded employees of the same sector if the bounded employees constitute at least 50% and the declaration is according to “public interest”. However, representatives of employees and employers of the peak organizations have to agree to it, and it is due to the resistance of the latter that the execution of this law has decreased over the last few decades. In 1998, this order imposing extension (“Allgemeinverbindlicherklärung”)  was facilitated by the adding of § 1 Sec.  3a to the “Arbeitnehmer-Entsendegesetz” (Law on the Posting of Workers). It allows the Federal Minister of Labour and Social Affairs to declare a collective agreement binding through a “Rechtsverordnung” (legal decree), without a majority of the employees being bound by this agreement and, more importantly, even against the will of the peak organizations. However, the Arbeitnehmer-Entsendegesetz cannot be applied generally, but is restricted to specific sectors. Thus, for a minimum wage to be enforced, it has to be within a specific sector that, in turn, has to be incorporated into the law beforehand. And this was the outcome of the discussion between the parties of the big coalition in 2007: on 1  July the building cleaning sector was incorporated into the law, followed by the postal service on 28  December. Several additional sectors followed in 2008 and 2009. Clearly, the scientific debate has been triggered by these changes in the minimum wage legislation. There has been a partly acrimonious debate about the advantages and disadvantages of this policy measure, both among politicians and among economists.Footnote 3 Furthermore, the German scientific debate has gotten considerable inspiration from the contribution of König and Möller (2008), who claimed that the minimum wage in the construction sector in Western Germany was not detrimental to employment. Several papers criticizing or confirming appeared subsequently (e.g., Thum and Ragnitz 2008; Bachmann et  al. 2008 or Fitzenberger 2009).Footnote 4 The preliminary conclusion of this debate might be that the results of König and Möller (2008) are not flawed, but it is not clear how far these results generalize (Fitzenberger 2009). This result that, in the end, minimum wages might be not that detrimental to employment, is difficult to justify in neo-classical labor market models, except in the trivial case where they are not binding. From this point of view it is assumed that the pivotal determinant of wages is marginal productivity. If people differ in their marginal productivity, in equilibrium, they obtain different wages. Thus, the wage distribution is determined by the distribution of marginal productivity. Under these assumptions binding minimum wages generally lower the wage dispersion of those workers employed, but at the same time tend to reduce employment. This is the case, because then some individuals are too unproductive to still be employed at the higher minimum wage. Thus, a minimum wage causes structural unemployment. The situation is different under a frictional setting. Minimum wages are not necessarily expected to increase unemployment. The reason is that frictions are a source of monopsony power for employers and that wages are below marginal productivity (Manning 2003b). Clearly, there is potential for redistribution of rents without altering employment. Do minimum wages purely redistribute rents from the firms to the workers, or do they cause structural unemployment as well? I  show that the answer to this question is ambiguous and that the discussed model variants yield different results. I  obtain mostly zero employment effects. However, there are cases where the minimum wage generates even positive employment effects, because it does not alter the incentive of the firm to employ individuals, but it does increase the incentive for individuals to work. Search frictions in the present case arise because of incomplete information where the process of generating information is time-consuming. Under this setting, identical workers can earn different wages and the sources of wage dispersion are search duration and luck. A central result of these theories challenges the neo-classical framework: rising wage dispersion is associated with rising unemployment. Low wage dispersion is associated with low unemployment. This contradicts the basic idea of the relationship of wage dispersion and unemployment presented above.Footnote 5
 In what follows, I  present different search models of increasing complexity (see Table 1) and examine the effect of minimum wages on the realized wage distribution and employment. Since the labor market performance of individuals and the performance of firms are  extremely diverse, heterogeneity is seen to be an important feature of labor markets, and thus, a focus lies on the integration of heterogeneity in search models. Sections  2.1 and  2.2 establish the theoretical basis on which most models are built. In Sect.  2.1, I  present basics from partial search theory with exogenous wage dispersion and derive the reservation wage property. In Sect.  2.2, I  establish the baseline model, a model with an endogenous wage distribution and homogeneous individuals and firms. In order to discuss more realistic settings, I  discuss model extensions that allow heterogeneity on one or the other side of the market, and which serve to check the sensitivity of the results of the baseline model.
 I do not discuss the wage bargaining literature (often combined with the matching function approach) in this paper (e.g., Pissarides 2000), which has also contributed to the discussion on minimum wages (see, e.g., Flinn 2002, 2006, and Flinn and Mabli 2008 or Cahuc et  al. 2006 building upon Postel-Vinay and Robin 2002a). I  do this for two reasons: first, incorporating the wage bargaining literature here would require a lot of space. Second, I  want to concentrate on the part of the literature that permits an endogenous wage distribution for identical workers to discuss wage effects of minimum wages. I  consider this a major advantage as I  view different wages for similar workers as an important empirical fact of the labor market (see Lemieux 2006 for the opposite view). On the contrary, the wage bargaining literature mostly generates one single wage per skill group. Note, however, that the wage bargaining literature has a quite natural channel for an effect of a minimum wage on employment, namely the endogenous contact rate. This contact rate is shaped by the number of vacancies and unemployed, where vacancy creation is endogenous to the model and generally would depend upon a minimum wage. The result that a binding minimum wage increases unemployment, though, is not a unique finding in these matching models either: in Flinn (2006), “minimum wage increases may or may not lead to increases in unemployment” (p. 1013). The reason for this indeterminacy stems from the fact that both contact rates and the participation decision are affected, and that both can have counteracting effects on (un-)employment.",2

Den radikalen institutionellen und ökonomischen Anpassungen der ersten Jahre nach der Wiedervereinigung folgten ein dramatischer Rückgang der Beschäftigung und ein starker Anstieg der Langzeitarbeitslosigkeit. Während in der DDR sowohl Männer als auch Frauen in der Regel kontinuierlich vollzeiterwerbstätig waren und es keine offene Arbeitslosigkeit gab, fand seit 1990 neben dem massiven Rückgang der Beschäftigung und dem Anstieg der Arbeitslosigkeit zudem eine Flexibilisierung des Arbeitsmarktes statt. Atypische Erwerbsformen wie Teilzeitarbeit, geringfügige Beschäftigung (Minijobs), Selbständigkeit ohne Beschäftigte („Scheinselbständigkeit“, „Ich-AG“) oder auch Leiharbeit gewinnen seitdem an Bedeutung. Die Flexibilisierung der Beschäftigung hatte in Westdeutschland schon etwas früher eingesetzt und beschleunigte sich in beiden Landesteilen in den vergangenen  20 Jahren. Dies zeigt sich z. B. im Rückgang des Anteils der Vollzeitbeschäftigten an der Gesamtbeschäftigung. Betrug dieser in Ostdeutschland im Jahr 1991 noch über  90%, sank er im Jahr 2007 auf nur mehr zwei Drittel (Sachverständigenrat 2008). Diese Entwicklung ging in Ostdeutschland auch mit einem wachsenden Niedriglohnsektor (Brenke 2006; Brenke u. Zimmermann 2009) einher. Diese Veränderungen wurden von einem sinkenden gewerkschaftlichen Organisationsgrad der Arbeitnehmer und einer geringen Bedeutung von Arbeitgeberverbänden in Ostdeutschland begleitet (Schnabel 2005). Neben den unmittelbaren Konsequenzen für das laufende Einkommen hat dieser Wandel der Erwerbsverläufe im gesamtdeutschen Sozialversicherungssystem auch langfristige Auswirkungen. Denn die Absicherung z. B. im Fall von Arbeitslosigkeit, Erwerbsminderung oder Rente ist insbesondere an den zuvor über eine bestimmte Periode verdienten sozialversicherungspflichtigen Lohn gekoppelt. Durch die Integration der vergangenen ostdeutschen Erwerbsbiografien in das gesamtdeutsche Rentensystem wirken die kontinuierlichen Vollzeiterwerbsbiografien der DDR zwar noch nach, verlieren aber in den jüngeren Kohorten an Bedeutung.Footnote 1 Arbeitslosigkeit, niedrige Löhne und Diskontinuitäten prägen zunehmend die Erwerbsbiografien. Das wird heute schon zum einen in einem höheren Armutsrisiko in Ostdeutschland (Frick u. Grabka 2010) und zum anderen auch in bereits heute sinkenden Rentenanwartschaften (Frommert u. Himmelreicher 2010) deutlich. Obwohl allgemein erwartet wird, dass diese Entwicklungen nachhaltige Folgen für die Einkommenssicherung im Alter haben werden, sind empirische Forschungsergebnisse dazu spärlich gesät. Unsere Studie leistet einen Beitrag zur Beantwortung der Frage, wie sich die Veränderungen am Arbeitsmarkt in den Erwerbsbiografien widerspiegeln und die kumulierten Erwerbszeiten im Lebenszyklus beeinflussen. Dabei ist die Schätzung von Kohorteneffekten in den kumulierten Erwerbszeiten von zentraler Bedeutung. Die Geburtskohorte ist deswegen wichtig, weil der „Schock“ der deutschen Wiedervereinigung die Ostdeutschen in Abhängigkeit ihres Alters unterschiedlich betraf. Eine gängige Hypothese in diesem Zusammenhang ist, dass dieser „Schock“ für jüngere Personen ökonomisch leichter zu verarbeiten war. Ältere Arbeitnehmer wären von den Folgen der Transformation besonders stark betroffen und konnten sich schlechter anpassen als jüngere Kohorten, da sie einen Großteil des bereits im Sozialismus erworbenen Humankapitals abschreiben mussten (Gathmann 2005) und geringe Anreize zur Investition in das Humankapital älterer Menschen bestünden. Diese Argumentation dient in der Regel zur Erklärung der relativ geringen Renditen auf in der früheren DDR erworbene Berufserfahrung (Bird et  al. 1994; Krueger u. Pischke 1995; Steiner u. Wagner 1997; Franz u. Steiner 2000; Orlowski u. Riphahn 2008). Dies könnte ebenso die Beschäftigungschancen Älterer nach der Wende verringert haben und ein Grund für die massive Anwendung von Frühverrentungsprogrammen in den ersten Jahren nach der Wiedervereinigung gewesen sein. Auf der anderen Seite weist Hunt (2002) darauf hin, dass besonders gering qualifizierte Personen von Entlassungen betroffen waren und zunächst versucht wurde, gut ausgebildete und erfahrene Arbeitskräfte zu halten (Turner 1998). Hinzu kommt die Übernahme des westdeutschen Kündigungsschutzes, der ältere Arbeitnehmer eher bevorzugt. Hier gilt es zu prüfen, ob die Unterschiede in der Betroffenheit von Arbeitslosigkeit bzw. im Beschäftigungsrückgang auch bei gleicher Bildung mit den Geburtskohorten variieren. Wenn sich ältere Kohorten schlechter an die Bedingungen der Marktwirtschaft anpassen können, würde man erwarten, dass sich die Erwerbsprofile der jüngeren Kohorten – relativ zu den älteren – wieder positiver entwickeln sollten. Dies wird in der empirischen Analyse durch die Berücksichtigung von Kohorteneffekten in den kumulierten Erwerbszeiten geprüft. Da das Qualifikationsniveau eine wichtige Determinante des Arbeitslosigkeitsrisikos, ihrer Dauer und der Wiederbeschäftigungschancen ist (Steiner 1994; Berger et  al. 1996; Hunt 2004), werden die Modelle getrennt nach Geschlecht und Qualifikationsniveau geschätzt. Obwohl nach der Wende geringqualifizierte Frauen besonders stark vom Beschäftigungsabbau betroffen waren (Hunt 2002), hatte dies nicht zur Folge, dass sich Frauen vom Arbeitsmarkt zurückgezogen oder sich dem Erwerbsmuster westdeutscher Frauen angepasst hätten. Die Partizipationsquote von Frauen in Ostdeutschland liegt trotz hoher Arbeitslosigkeit weiterhin über dem westdeutschen Niveau, und auch der Abbau staatlich organisierter Kindererziehungseinrichtungen hatte anscheinend keinen Einfluss auf die Erwerbsquote ostdeutscher Frauen (Hunt 2002; Bonin u. Euwals 2005). Bei der Untersuchung der Erwerbsbiografien der Männer beziehen wir die versicherungspflichtige Vollzeiterwerbstätigkeit und Arbeitslosigkeit ein. Bei Frauen untersuchen wir zusätzlich auch Teilzeittätigkeit und Zeiten der Nichterwerbstätigkeit. Im nächsten Abschnitt präsentieren wir unsere Datenbasis und die Methode zur Identifikation der Kohorteneffekte. In Abschn.  3 beschreiben wir die Veränderung der Erwerbsbiografien über die Kohorten zwischen 1995 und 2005. Abschnitt  4 enthält die Darstellung und Interpretation unserer Schätzergebnisse zu den Kohorteneffekten. In Abschn.  5 werden die auf der Basis der geschätzten Kohorteneffekte bis zum Renteneintritt simulierten Erwerbsbiografien betrachtet. Dieses Basisszenario zeigt für die jüngeren ostdeutschen Geburtskohorten ein sehr pessimistisches Bild. Deswegen wird als Alternativszenario ein Modell ohne Kohorteneffekte simuliert. Dieses entspricht einem relativ optimistischen Szenario, da es auf der Annahme einer nachhaltigen Verbesserung des ostdeutschen Arbeitsmarktes basiert. Bei diesem optimistischen Szenario ergibt sich bei den jüngeren ostdeutschen Geburtskohorten im Vergleich zu den älteren zwar auch ein deutlicher Anstieg der Arbeitslosigkeit und Rückgang der Erwerbstätigkeit, diese Entwicklung ist gegenüber unserem Basisszenario jedoch sehr viel schwächer ausgeprägt.",3

43,3,Journal for Labour Market Research,23 November 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-010-0044-4,The implications of subjective career success,January 2011,Lorraine Dyke,Linda Duxbury,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Success is a  key outcome in careers research (Heslin 2005). Subjective success represents an individual's self-evaluation of her or his success (Gattiker and Larwood 1986; Peluchette 1993). Research suggests that subjective success is related to but broader than objective indicators of success (Abele and Spurk 2009b; Ng et  al. 2005) and may include criteria such as relationships, balance, enjoyment, and recognition (Dyke and Murphy 2006; Sturges 1999). The research done to date on subjective success focuses largely on the antecedents of subjective success and seeks to determine what makes people evaluate their careers positively (e.g. Abele and Spurk 2009b; Gattiker and Larwood 1986; Ng et  al. 2005; Peluchette 1993). Very few studies have explored the link between subjective career success and key organizational attitudes. This is unfortunate as research conducted within the person-environment fit tradition (Kristof-Brown et  al. 2005) would suggest that employees are more likely to report positive attitudes towards their work and their organization when there is a  fit between their definitions of subjective career success and their career achievements. To date, however, neither the literature on person-environment fit nor the subjective success research has examined this relationship. This paper addresses this gap by exploring the impact that attainment of subjective career success has on three key employee attitudes toward their work and organization: job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and intent to turnover. Subjective success represents an individual's self-evaluation of her or his career (Gattiker and Larwood 1986; Peluchette 1993). This study is based on the assumption that to understand the relationship between subjective success and key organizational outcomes, one needs to look at two things: what individuals value in their careers (achievements may not be valued in the same way by everyone) and whether they feel that they have the opportunity within their work environment to achieve their aspirations (Gunz and Heslin 2005; Heslin 2005). This assumption is consistent with Bailyn's argument that “the subjective, internal meaning of the career must be juxtaposed with its external more objective characteristics” (1989, p. 477). This assumption is also consistent with person-environment fit theory (Caplan and Harrison 1993; Edwards 1994; Kristof 1996). Organizations are likely to influence employees' achievement of subjective success in a  number of ways. First, objective criteria of success such as pay, promotion, and hierarchical level are rewards that are under the control of the organization. The manner in which organizations allocate these rewards may have a  significant influence on whether or not an employee feels successful. Further, other more subjective success criteria such as a  sense of personal accomplishment, recognition, enjoyable work, or positive working relationships can also be influenced by organizational context (Heslin 2005). Finally, organizations can potentially influence the achievement of non-work criteria of success such as work-life balance or good health by limiting the time and energy employees have to devote to these pursuits. The literature suggests that employees who work for organizations that understand and are able to facilitate employee subjective career success will report more positive attitudes towards work and their employer. Theoretical perspectives such as needs theories (Herzberg et  al. 1959), the theory of work adjustment (Dawis and Lofquist 1984), the attraction-selection-attrition model (Schneider 1987), and self-determination theory (Deci and Ryan 2000), for example, all support the notion that employees experience more positive attitudes when there is congruence between their preferences and the features of their workplace. A  meta-analysis of person-environment fit studies indicates that various types of fit (e.g. person-vocation, person-job, person-organization, person-group, and person-supervisor) are associated with positive attitudes toward work and the organization – with strong, pervasive effects noted particularly for job satisfaction, organizational commitment, and intent to turnover (Kristof-Brown et  al. 2005). The present research extends this tradition by examining the impact on attitudes of the congruence between employees' success aspirations and achievements. Job satisfaction refers to a  positive evaluation of one's job (Locke 1976; Spector 1997). Meta-analytic results indicate that job satisfaction has an impact on performance (Judge et  al. 2001), commitment, turnover intentions, and turnover (Tett and Meyer 1993). Job satisfaction has been used by some researchers as a  proxy for subjective success (e.g. Abele and Spurk 2009a; Judge and Bretz 1994; Judge et  al. 1995) but as Heslin (2005) notes, the concept of subjective success incorporates a  broader time frame and a  wider range of outcomes than immediate job satisfaction. Research has also found that career satisfaction and job satisfaction are distinct constructs (Erdogan et  al. 2004). Job satisfaction is influenced by a  variety of characteristics related to the job, the organization, and the employee (Glisson and Durick 1988). The meta-analytic results regarding person-environment fit support the notion that when the characteristics of the job or the organization match the characteristics of the employee, greater job satisfaction is likely to result (Kristof-Brown et  al. 2005). Similarly, we would expect that when the characteristics of the work environment support an employee's subjective success aspirations, they will be likely to evaluate the job more positively. Organizational commitment can be thought of as the bond between the employee and the organization (O'Reilly and Chatman 1986). Organizational commitment has a  different focus than job satisfaction: “commitment emphasizes attachment to the employing organization, including its goals and values, whereas satisfaction emphasizes the specific task environment where an employee performs his or her duties” (Mowday et  al. 1982, p. 28). Given that organizational commitment is conceptualized as a  bond or attachment to the organization, turnover intentions can be viewed as the opposite of commitment. Meta-analytic results support the negative relationship between organizational commitment and turnover intentions (Tett and Meyer 1993). Both organizational commitment and turnover intentions are likely to be influenced by an employee's experience of subjective success. Just as person-environment fit enhances commitment and reduces turnover (Kristof-Brown et  al. 2005), employees who believe that the organization has helped them to achieve subjective success may be more likely to view the organization favorably and to anticipate potential losses should they leave the organization. The above review of theory and empirical findings leads us to hypothesize that: Employees who experience greater subjective success will exhibit higher job satisfaction  (H1), higher organizational commitment  (H2), and lower turnover intentions  (H3).",10

In 2005 about 18% of full-time employees covered by social insurance earned wages that amounted to less than two-thirds of the median wage, and they were thus regarded as low-wage earners (Rhein and Grün 2007). While such a large share of low-wage workers may be a cause of concern on its own, for an accurate interpretation of this phenomenon it is important to know whether low-wage employment is a transitory or a persistent experience of individuals in their working careers. Put differently, are low-wage jobs mainly stepping stones to better-paid jobs or are low-wage careers the norm where employees in the low-wage sector have limited chances of upward mobility? If the latter is the case, can we identify individual characteristics or obstacles in the working environment that hinder employees from leaving the low-wage sector? The upward mobility of low-wage earners has been analyzed in a number of international studies for OECD countries and for Germany.Footnote 1 Most of these studies find that upward wage mobility differs among employees, with certain groups such as female and older workers having lower chances of reaching higher-paid jobs. While these and other individual determinants of upward mobility have been investigated in many studies, due to a lack of data relatively few studies have been able to analyze the impact of firm and workplace characteristics on employees' chance of escaping low-paid work. To be sure, a few studies exist that point to the relevance of the size and sector affiliation of a firm for employees' upward wage mobility (see, e.g., Stewart and Swaffield 1999; Cappellari 2002; Andersson et  al. 2005). For Germany, Schank et  al. (2009) recently have shown that low-wage employment is concentrated (and upward wage mobility is lower) in small firms and in certain industries. With Danish data, Bolvig (2005) has demonstrated that the characteristics of the employing firm matters for low-wage employees' likelihood of escaping a low-wage job, and she has been able to identify three types of firms: firms with high within-firm upward wage mobility, firms with high between-firm upward wage mobility (i.e. stepping-stones) and firms with low upward wage mobility (i.e. dead-end firms). This paper adds to the literature by paying special attention to the role of the plants and jobs in which low-wage earners are employed. Taking account of labour market segregation (i.e. that low-wage earners, foreigners, and women may be concentrated in certain firms), we investigate whether there do indeed exist dead-end firms and dead-end jobs where workers have very low chances of escaping low-wage employment. We also explore whether changing firms and/or jobs is a promising means of obtaining higher pay. Using representative linked employer-employee data of the German Federal Employment Agency, we analyze the wage and employment careers of full-time employees who earned low wages in 1998/1999. We follow this cohort over time and show to what extent these low-wage workers were able to earn higher wages in the following years and which individual, plant or occupational characteristics played a role in this context. The paper is organized as follows: After a description of our data set in Sect.  2, some research questions and hypotheses are identified (Sect.  3). Section  4 presents some descriptive evidence, while the results of our econometric analysis are discussed in Sect.  5. Section  6 concludes.",14

Although widely written about (Gunz and Heslin 2005), attempts at defining the concept are comparatively rare. Judge and Kammeyer-Mueller (2007, p.  60), for example, define career success as “the real or perceived achievements individuals have accumulated as a result of their work experiences”, an interesting development of an earlier version: “The positive psychological or work-related outcomes or achievements one has accumulated as a result of one's work experiences” (Judge et  al. 1995, p.  486). Sometimes, however, the career connection is fuzzier, for example “Career success may be defined as the accomplishment of desirable work-related outcomes at any point in a person's work experiences over time” (Arthur et  al. 2005, p.  179), but most commonly authors skip over the conceptual definition problem and move directly to its operationalization. Perhaps the most widely adopted approach to defining career success is to distinguish between two aspects of, in psychological terms, the state of an individual. It has a strong evaluative component (Jaskolka et  al. 1985; Judge et  al., 1995), in the sense that it is commonly thought of as a measure of either how well people seem to others to have done in their careers (objective success), or feel about how well they have done in their careers (subjective success). The two are not particularly strongly correlated (Judge and Kammeyer-Mueller 2007). Much has been written about the subjective-objective distinction (e.g. Abele et  al. 2011, in press), including the different senses in which subjectivism is used (ibid; Gunz and Heslin 2005) and the reference points used by career actors in making their assessments of subjective success (Heslin 2005). Here, however, we are concerned with an issue that is meta to the objective-subjective distinction; we are concerned, in other words, with the nature of the over-arching concept. In much of career research, conceptualizing career success (a major outcome variable) and careers in general are theoretically not sufficiently understood. Consequently, the paper addresses conceptual issues linked to career success, hoping to contribute to a better theoretical understanding of both careers and career success. We shall argue that career success is a construct that has not been fully thought through either theoretically or in its operationalization. We discuss the implications of this, and suggest a solution.",22

Especially in some regions of East Germany, the unemployment rate has persistently been higher than  20%. In recent years, GDP growth has risen and unemployment has declined. Yet, people of different ages and different skill levels apparently benefit differently from this improved economic situation. This impression prompted Schmidt (2000) and,  subsequently, Kluve et  al. (2009) to examine, for different demographic groups, the heterogeneous  cyclical sensitivity of unemployment rates and of transition intensities across labor-market states. These previous papers document that the heterogeneity of labor-market dynamics is substantial. They have not considered job-to-job flows, however, when calculating intensities of job losses and re-employment, although job-to-job transition rates are an important component of the German labor market. In contrast to the above-mentioned studies which use the German Socioeconomic Panel, we use a  very large micro dataset provided by the research institute of the Federal Employment Agency, the IAB employment subsample (IABS). The data allows us to distinguish job-to-job transitions on a  daily basis. Besides heterogeneity between demographic groups which is controlled for, we take job tenure into account since Jung and Kuhn (2009) show that  75% of all quits are by workers with tenure of less than two years. In contrast to Schmidt (2000), the analysis pays particular attention to the question of whether the cyclical behavior of job-to-job transitions differs across demographic groups and tenure. Furthermore, the findings are compared to the sensitivity of other transition intensities. To compare the cyclical sensitivity between different transition rates, a  similar approach is undertaken for the job-finding and job-loss rate. The cyclical relationship is modeled for the core group of male, medium-aged, medium-skilled workers. The sensitivity of all other groups is then modeled as the deviation from this core group. Our results indicate that women and unskilled workers are more influenced in their job-to-job transition rate by the cycle than the core group. In contrast, high-skilled, young, or old workers are less influenced by the business cycle. However, the sensitivity is even reversed for women, young, and old workers regarding their job-loss rates (flows from employment to unemployment). Additionally allowing for differences in cyclical sensitivity depending on job tenure, the results indicate that workers with a  short job tenure are the most influenced by the cycle while workers with a  long job tenure experience less pronounced swings. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section  2 provides a  brief overview of the literature, while Sect.  3 describes the data used  and the estimation framework. Section  4 documents the estimation results regarding the flows between the labor force states with an emphasis on transitions between jobs. Finally, Sect.  5 concludes.",4

Eine Analyse mit dem Matching-Ansatz,March 2011,Matthias Dütsch,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Die dominierende und für den deutschen Arbeitsmarkt charakteristische Beschäftigungsform ist das sogenannte Normalarbeitsverhältnis. Doch seit einigen Jahren ist eine zunehmende Diversifikation der Arbeitsformen beobachtbar. Während das Normalarbeitsverhältnis an Bedeutung verliert, etablieren sich neben diesem in immer stärkerem Maße atypische Beschäftigungsformen wie Teilzeitarbeit, geringfügige und befristete Beschäftigung, freie Mitarbeit oder Zeitarbeit. Unter den atypischen Beschäftigungsformen gewinnt die Zeitarbeit zunehmend an Bedeutung. Auch wenn ihr Anteil an der sozialversicherungspflichtigen Beschäftigung mit 2,72 Prozent im Jahr 2007 noch relativ gering war, stellte sie die dynamischste Beschäftigungsform der letzten Jahre dar. Die in absoluten Zahlen kleine Gruppe der Zeitarbeiter verzeichnete zwischen den Jahren 1997 und 2007 mit 235 % den größten Zuwachs (Statistisches Bundesamt 2008). Als Gründe für diese Entwicklung werden steigende Flexibilitätsanforderungen in der Wirtschaft und am Arbeitsmarkt infolge der Transnationalisierung der Ökonomie sowie des sozioökonomischen Wandels genannt. Betriebe reagieren auf die Veränderungen und erhöhen ihrerseits die Anpassungsfähigkeit mit Hilfe interner und externer Flexibilisierungsmaßnahmen. Im Kanon externer Anpassungsinstrumente steht die Zeitarbeit.Footnote 1 Häufig wird – entsprechend der in Segmentationsansätzen beschriebenen zweigeteilten Arbeitsmärkte (Doeringer und Piore 1971) – konstatiert, dass Zeitarbeiter so genannte „bad jobs“ in der Randbelegschaft einnehmen würden, die durch geringe Qualifikationsanforderungen und Verdienstmöglichkeiten sowie niedrige innerbetriebliche Statuspositionen gekennzeichnet seien. Betriebliche Personalanpassungen, beispielsweise infolge von Absatzschwankungen, würden vorrangig über den Auf- oder Abbau von Arbeitskräften in diesem Segment erfolgen (Köhler und Sengenberger 1983; Blossfeld und Mayer 1988). Zudem bestünden keine Aufstiegschancen innerhalb der Randbelegschaft und Übergänge in Stammbelegschaften seien selten (Gensicke et al. 2010). Daraus werden erhebliche Risiken und Gefahren für den Erhalt und Aufbau beruflicher Qualifikationen an diesen betrieblichen Rändern abgeleitet. Gleichwohl wird neben dieser eher skeptischen Einschätzung erwartet, dass durch atypische Beschäftigungsformen die Flexibilität und damit die Funktionsfähigkeit des Arbeitsmarktes steigen (Eichhorst et al. 2001; Sachverständigenrat 2005). Dabei wird Zeitarbeit als eines von wenigen marktwirtschaftlichen Instrumenten auf einem ansonsten eher streng regulierten Arbeitsmarkt angesehen, das dazu dienen könne, die „Fehlbalancierung zwischen Flexibilität und Sicherheit“ (Struck 2006; Heidenreich 2004) zu entschärfen. Der zunehmende Bedeutungsgewinn der Zeitarbeit auf dem Arbeitsmarkt und die unterschiedlichen Bewertungen dieser Beschäftigungsform bilden das Spannungsfeld, in dem die Frage aufgeworfen und untersucht wird, wie prekär die Beschäftigungsform Zeitarbeit ist. Dabei wird über bisherige Forschungsarbeiten hinausgehend eine quantitative Analyse zu sieben Dimensionen, die mittels objektiver sowie subjektiver Items operationalisiert werden, angestellt. Der Beitrag bietet in Abschn. 2 zunächst einen Überblick über den Forschungsstand und grenzt daraufhin die Beschäftigungsform Zeitarbeit sowie die Begriffe „atypisch“ und „prekär“ ab (3.). Abschnitt 4 beschreibt die Datengrundlage und die Schätzmethode. In Abschn. 5 werden die Ergebnisse der empirischen Analysen vorgestellt. Schließlich werden im letzten Abschn. 6 die Resultate noch einmal knapp zusammengefasst und bewertet.",8

Der Zusammenhang zwischen Veränderungen der Haushaltsstruktur und der Einkommensverteilung in Deutschland,March 2011,Andreas Peichl,Nico Pestel,Hilmar Schneider,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Seit der Wiedervereinigung ist die Einkommensungleichheit in Deutschland deutlich angestiegen (OECD 2008; Bach et al. 2009). Diese Entwicklung wird im 3. Armuts- und Reichtumsbericht der Bundesregierung (2008) ebenso thematisiert wie Maßnahmen, um der zunehmenden Einkommensspreizung zu begegnen. Bei der Formulierung effektiver Politikmaßnahmen kommt es allerdings darauf an, die treibenden Kräfte steigender Einkommensungleichheit zu verstehen. Neben der nahe liegenden Vermutung, dass die wachsende Ungleichheit Ausdruck einer zunehmenden Spreizung von Marktlöhnen auf Grund von nachlassender Verhandlungsmacht von Gewerkschaften sei, gibt es auch noch Faktoren jenseits der Lohnentwicklung, die einen maßgeblichen Einfluss auf die Ungleichheitsmessung haben können. Damit sind in erster Linie Veränderungen der Haushaltsstruktur gemeint, da die Haushaltsstruktur das Pro-Kopf-Einkommen bei der Bestimmung der personalen Einkommensverteilung beeinflusst.Footnote 1 Die Veränderung der Haushaltsstruktur ist Ausdruck für langfristige gesellschaftliche Trends, die sich unter anderem in einem stetigen Rückgang der Geburtenrate und einem steigenden Scheidungsrisiko äußern. Diese Entwicklung geht einher mit veränderten Erwerbsmustern. So geht Kinderlosigkeit häufig einher mit Doppelverdienerschaft, was seinerseits Auswirkungen auf die personale Einkommensverteilung hat. Wachsende Einkommensungleichheit eignet sich daher nur in dem Maße als Argument in der lohnpolitischen Debatte, wie Verschiebungen von Lohnungleichgewichten tatsächlich an der Entstehung von Einkommensungleichgewichten beteiligt sind. Bei der Analyse von Einkommensverteilungen werden in aller Regel äquivalenz- bzw. bedarfsgewichtete Einkommen zu Grunde gelegt. Dabei handelt es sich um Einkommensgrößen, die die Personenzahl und altersmäßige Zusammensetzung von Haushalten berücksichtigen. Das Ziel dieses Beitrags besteht darin, die Bedeutung veränderter Haushaltsstrukturen für die Einkommensungleichheit in Deutschland zu quantifizieren. Dabei ist Deutschland von besonderem Interesse, da die demografische Entwicklung hierzulande nicht nur durch zunehmende Alterung gekennzeichnet, sondern auch durch einen deutlichen Rückgang der durchschnittlichen Haushaltsgröße, die – gemeinsam mit Schweden – unter den Ländern der OECD am geringsten ist (OECD 2008 S. 59). Insbesondere hat der Anteil von Ein- und Zwei-Personen-Haushalten stark zugenommen.Footnote 2
 Ein Rückgang der durchschnittlichen Haushaltsgröße auf die Einkommensverteilung kann ceteris paribus sowohl zu einer Komprimierung als auch zu einer Spreizung der Einkommensverteilung führen. Der Nettoeffekt hängt letztlich davon ab, an welcher Stelle der Einkommensverteilung die Effekte auftreten. Der deutliche Rückgang der Geburtenzahl bedeutet beispielsweise, dass sich zusammenlebende Paare heutzutage eher für Kinderlosigkeit entscheiden. Dies führt dazu, dass diese über höhere äquivalenzgewichtete Einkommen verfügen, als dies bei einer höheren Geburtenrate, also mehr Kindern, der Fall wäre. Sofern Kinderlose eher überdurchschnittliche Erwerbseinkommen erzielen, trägt ihre Kinderlosigkeit zu einer Einkommensspreizung nach oben bei. Bei unterdurchschnittlichen Einkommen von Kinderlosen wäre eher eine Einkommenskomprimierung zu erwarten. Ähnlich verhält es sich mit der Zunahme von Single-Haushalten und Haushalten von Alleinerziehenden. Beides führt zu einem Anstieg der Zahl von Personen, die eher über geringere äquivalenzgewichtete Einkommen verfügen, da Fixkosten der Haushaltsführung auf weniger Personen verteilt werden können. Ob dies zu einer größeren oder kleineren Polarisierung der Einkommensverteilung führt, hängt davon ab, ob die entsprechenden Haushalte eher unterdurchschnittlich oder eher überdurchschnittlich verdienen. Somit hat der Rückgang der durchschnittlichen Personenzahl pro Haushalt ceteris paribus gegenläufige Auswirkungen auf die Einkommensverteilung. Faktisch ist davon auszugehen, dass unterschiedliche Einkommensschichten unterschiedliche demografische Trends aufweisen und auch verschiedene Tendenzen der Haushaltsformation, beispielsweise im Hinblick auf Heirats- und Geburtsraten, haben. So ist beispielsweise der Rückgang der durchschnittlichen Haushaltsgröße in den unteren Einkommens-Quintilen überdurchschnittlich hoch. Gleiches gilt für die Zahl der Kinder im Haushalt (vgl. Tab. 1). Dies verdeutlicht die Notwendigkeit einer Analyse des Zusammenhangs zwischen Haushaltsstruktur und Einkommensverteilung. Es sei jedoch darauf hingewiesen, dass unsere empirische Analyse rein deskriptiver Natur ist und wir keine Aussagen über eine kausale Beziehung zwischen sinkender durchschnittlicher Haushaltsgröße und steigender Einkommensungleichheit treffen können.  Vor dem Hintergrund der besonders ausgeprägten Entwicklung hin zu immer kleineren Haushaltsgrößen ist es bemerkenswert, dass die Bedeutung demografischer Trends auf die Einkommensungleichheit für Deutschland bislang kaum systematisch untersucht wurde. Die Organisation für wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (OECD) berichtet in einer Studie (OECD 2008), dass 88 Prozent der (absoluten) Veränderung des Gini-Koeffizienten der verfügbaren Einkommen zwischen 1985 und 2005 in West-Deutschland mit Veränderungen der Bevölkerungsstruktur (Haushaltsgröße, Alter des Haushaltsvorstands) zusammenhängen. Dieser Anteil ist im Vergleich mit anderen OECD-Ländern mit Abstand am höchsten. Er impliziert, dass die Entwicklung der Einkommensungleichheit nahezu vollständig von sich verändernden Haushaltsstrukturen bestimmt wird. Dies widerspricht unter anderem den Schlussfolgerungen des 3. Armuts- und Reichtumsberichts der Bundesregierung. Die hierdurch ausgelöste öffentliche Debatte darüber, welche Ursachen für die zunehmende Einkommensspreizung verantwortlich sind, unterstreicht die politische Relevanz der vorliegenden Fragestellung.Footnote 3 Allerdings war es uns nicht möglich die Ergebnisse der OECD zu replizieren. Zwischenzeitlich wurde von den Autoren der Studie auf Nachfrage bestätigt, dass das vorgenannte Ergebnis von 88 Prozent nicht korrekt ist. Vielmehr handele es sich dabei um einen Druckfehler.Footnote 4 Daher ist es geboten, den Einfluss der Haushaltsstruktur auf die Einkommensungleichheit neu zu bewerten. Für die Analyse greifen wir ebenso wie die OECD auf Daten des Sozio-oekonomischen Panels (SOEP) zurück. Unsere Quantifizierung des Einflusses der demografischen Entwicklung auf die Einkommensungleichheit basiert auf einem Verfahren zur Dekomposition von Ungleichheitsmaßen für unterschiedliche Bevölkerungsgruppen (Shorrocks 1980; Mookherjee und Shorrocks 1982; Shorrocks 1984). Für ähnliche Fragestellungen wurde diese Methode bereits für das Vereinigte Königreich (Mookherjee und Shorrocks 1982; Jenkins 1995) sowie für die USA (Martin 2006) angewendet. Jenkins (1995) nimmt für das Vereinigte Königreich eine umfassende Analyse der Einkommensungleichheit für den Zeitraum von 1971 bis 1986 vor und kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass die Veränderung der globalen Ungleichheit am stärksten im Zusammenhang mit der Veränderung der Ungleichheit innerhalb von Bevölkerungsgruppen zu sehen und demografische Trends von eher untergeordneter Bedeutung sind. Für den Zeitraum von 1976 bis 2000 untersucht Martin (2006) die Bedeutung veränderter Familienstrukturen auf die Einkommensungleichheit in den USA und kommt zu dem Ergebnis, dass etwa 41 Prozent des Anstiegs der Einkommensungleichheit in den USA im Zusammenhang mit veränderten Familienstrukturen stehen. Einen Überblick über den Zusammenhang zwischen Verschiebungen der Bevölkerungsstruktur und Einkommensungleichheit in verschiedenen OECD-Ländern findet sich darüber hinaus in OECD (2008). Dieser Zusammenhang ist mit einem Anteil von mehr als 20 Prozent außer in Deutschland besonders stark in Australien, Kanada, Frankreich, den Niederlanden und dem Vereinigten Königreich (siehe OECD 2008, S. 66 f.). Unsere Analyse zeigt, dass die Zunahme der Einkommensungleichheit in Deutschland in den letzten Jahren (1991 bis 2007) zu einem nennenswerten Teil mit der veränderten Haushaltsstruktur zusammenhängt. Mit anderen Worten: Ohne die demografische Entwicklung hin zu immer kleineren Haushalten wäre die Einkommensungleichheit heutzutage deutlich niedriger als sie es tatsächlich ist. Für die Veränderung der Einkommensungleichheit vor Steuern und Transfers beträgt der Anteil 61,4 Prozent, für Einkommen nach Steuern und Transfers 17,4 Prozent, wenn lediglich die Veränderungen der Haushaltsstruktur (Zahl und Altersstruktur der Haushaltsmitglieder) betrachtet werden. Berücksichtigt man zusätzlich den Erwerbsstatus, liegt der Anteil sogar bei 77,5 bzw. 22,2 Prozent. Die Arbeit ist im Weiteren wie folgt strukturiert: Zunächst verschafft Abschn. 2 einen Überblick über relevante Definitionen und Methoden zur Äquivalenzgewichtung von Einkommensgrößen sowie zur Messung und Dekomposition eines Ungleichheitsmaßes. In Abschn. 3 wird gezeigt, wie dieses Vorgehen für Deutschland mit Daten des SOEP umgesetzt wird, bevor in Abschn. 4 die Ergebnisse aufgeführt werden. Die Arbeit schließt mit einem Fazit in Abschn. 5.",2

The specific type of German flexibility, however, does not stem from high labor turnover rates (hiring and firing), but through an unprecedented level of buffer capacity within firms.“ (Möller 2010, S. 326) Die arbeitsmarktpolitische Debatte um die mangelnde Flexibilität des deutschen Arbeitsmarktes als Ursache der persistent hohen Arbeitslosigkeit wurde intensiv zu Beginn des letzten Jahrzehntes national und international geführt (siehe unter anderem OECD 1994 und 2004; Heckman 2002; SVR 2002). Die Zahl der registrierten Arbeitslosen erreichte mit über 5 Mio. im Januar 2005 (erster Monat der Erfassung der erwerbsfähigen, vormaligen Sozialhilfeempfänger) ein Maximum. Sie ging während des Aufschwungs 2006 und 2008 deutlich zurück. Umgekehrt stieg die Beschäftigung stark an. Die Zahl der registrierten Arbeitslosen sank auf unter 3 Mio. im Oktober 2008 und stieg während der durch die Finanzmarktkrise ausgelösten Rezession 2008 und 2009 kaum an. Die Mehrheit des Sachverständigenrates (SVR 2007, Ziffer 497 und 504) konstatierte 2007, „dass die Flexibilität und die Dynamik am Arbeitsmarkt zugenommen haben“ und „dass die Reformanstrengungen der vergangenen Jahre erste Früchte tragen“. Bezugnehmend auf einen Artikel von Paul Krugman in der New York Times vom 12. November 2009 spricht Möller (2010) von einem Beschäftigungswunder in Deutschland während der jüngsten Krise. Trotz hoher Betroffenheit von der Krise, die zu einem starken Einbruch des BIP um 4,7 vH im Jahr 2009 geführt hat, ist die Arbeitslosigkeit 2009 nur unmerklich angestiegen. Möller (2010) führt dies auf die hohe betriebsinterne Flexibilität (Arbeitskräftehorten) in Deutschland zurück. Zusammen mit den Beschäftigten, die im Rahmen von betrieblichen Bündnissen vorübergehend auf Vergünstigungen und tarifvertragliche Zusagen verzichtet haben, und dem effizienten Einsatz betrieblicher und arbeitsmarktpolitischer Instrumente wie Arbeitszeitkonten und Kurzarbeit war es möglich, den durch den dramatischen Einbruch der Güternachfrage insbesondere in exportorientierten Bereichen induzierten Rückgang der Arbeitsnachfrage abzufedern. Statt zu entlassen, wurden die Zahl der Arbeitsstunden vermindert und ein Absinken der Arbeitsproduktivität geduldet. Aber nicht alle Beschäftigten haben gleichermaßen von der konzertierten Aktion profitiert. So war das Instrument der Kurzarbeit vor allem dann erfolgreich, wenn es in Verbindung mit Weiterbildungsmaßnahmen genutzt wurde und wenn nicht die Gesamtbelegschaft, sondern ca. 60 % der Belegschaft von Kurzarbeit betroffen war. Längerfristig zeigen sich weniger positive Ergebnisse der Kurzarbeit in Bezug auf die Entwicklung der Beschäftigung (Hübler 2010). Dies entspricht dem Motto von Brenke et al. (2010) „Kurzarbeit – Nützlich in der Krise, aber nun den Ausstieg einleiten“ und wurde auch real umgesetzt. Für die neue Krisenfestigkeit des deutschen Arbeitsmarktes dürfen nicht nur die genannten Maßnahmen und Verhaltensweisen verantwortlich gemacht werden. Vielmehr ist auch zu berücksichtigen, dass im letzten Jahrzehnt der deutsche Arbeitsmarkt flexibler geworden ist und Arbeitsmarktrigiditäten zurückgegangen sind. Zum einen gingen nach 2002 die Lohnstückkosten in Deutschland im Vergleich zu anderen Industrieländern deutlich zurück. Gründe hierfür sind der Anstieg der Produktivität, die moderaten Tariflohnerhöhungen und der Rückgang der Spanne zwischen Effektivlöhnen und Tariflöhnen (SVR 2006, Tabelle 45). Zum anderen ist seit einigen Jahren eine starke Zunahme der Lohnungleichheit in Deutschland festzustellen (Dustmann et al. 2009; Antonczyk et al. 2010; Sengenberger 2009) und insbesondere im unteren Bereich der Lohnverteilung nimmt die Lohnungleichheit zu. Die Arbeitsmarktreformen Mitte des letzten Jahrzehnts haben augenscheinlich einen Rückgang der Arbeitsmarktrigiditäten bewirkt (SVR 2007). Das von der DFG geförderte Forschungsschwerpunktprogramm „Flexibilisierungspotenziale bei heterogenen Arbeitsmärkten“ untersuchte im Zeitraum 2004 bis 2010 unterschiedliche arbeitsökonomische Forschungsgegenstände, meist spezifisch für Deutschland, im Hinblick auf die Flexibilität des Arbeitsmarktes. Aus dieser Arbeit ergab sich eine Vielzahl an wirtschaftspolitischen Implikationen, die im Rahmen der Beiträge dieses Themenheftes herausgearbeitet werden. In unserem Beitrag Fitzenberger et al. (2008) nehmen wir eine Einordnung der Arbeit des DFG-Forschungsschwerpunktprogramms im Hinblick auf den Stand der arbeitsökonomischen und wirtschaftspolitischen Diskussion um die Flexibilität des Arbeitsmarktes zu Beginn des neuen Jahrtausends vor. Im Folgenden geben wir sehr kurz den Stand der wirtschaftspolitischen Diskussion vor und während der Laufzeit des Programms wieder. In der sogenannten „Jobs Strategy“ forderte die OECD (1994) mehr Flexibilität verkrusteter Arbeitsmärkte, Lohnsetzungen zur Reduktion der Arbeitskosten, eine Flexibilisierung der Arbeitsmarktinstitutionen sowie eine Reduktion des Kündigungsschutzes und der Mobilitätskosten. Häufig wurde in der Debatte konstatiert, dass die berufliche Ausbildung in Ländern wie Deutschland zu spezifisch ist und dass die Humankapitalbildung gestärkt werden sollte, z. B. durch eine Erhöhung der Anzahl an Hochschulabsolventen. Ausgangspunkt dieser Forderungen war die Beobachtung persistenter Arbeitslosigkeit, die nach jeder zyklischen Krise seit Mitte der 1970er Jahre angestiegen war und im darauf folgenden Aufschwung nicht auf das Niveau vor der Krise zurückgegangen ist. In diesem Sinne wird konjunkturelle Arbeitslosigkeit persistent, da der Arbeitsmarkt keine flexible Anpassung mit neuen Jobmöglichkeiten für die Arbeitslosen zulässt. Hierzu führt der SVR (2002, Ziffer 21) aus: „Die Rigiditäten auf dem deutschen Arbeitsmarkt sind höher als in den angelsächsischen Ländern … Allerdings zeigen sich die schädlichen Wirkungen von Rigiditäten vor allem bei exogenen Schocks wie der deutschen Vereinigung. Schließlich hat auch eine nicht beschäftigungsorientierte Lohnpolitik zur ungünstigen Beschäftigungsentwicklung beigetragen.“
 Heckman (2002) betonte in seiner Analyse des deutschen Arbeitsmarktes die Gefahr einer fehlenden Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Deutschland, so sein Argument, falle bei Spitzentechnologien zurück. Die Bedeutung spezifischen, lokalen Wissens und traditioneller Stärken sei rückläufig, da das wirtschaftliche Umfeld immer dynamischer werde. Die Arbeitsmarktinstitutionen in Deutschland werden als zu rigide angesehen, um hinreichend flexibel auf die ökonomischen Herausforderungen reagieren zu können. Da gleichzeitig die Anpassungsprobleme während der 1990er Jahre und der ersten Jahre des letzten Jahrzehnts gestiegen seien, fallen, so die Einschätzung, die volkswirtschaftlichen Anpassungskosten bei rigiden Institutionen noch stärker als ohnehin aus. In ihrer Reevaluation der „Jobs Strategy“ betont die OECD (2004) die Notwendigkeit einer verstärkten Lohnflexibilität und einer Dezentralisierung der Lohnverhandlungen, um die Rigidität bei den Lohnvereinbarungen aufzuheben. Trotz der moderaten Lohnentwicklung seit Mitte der 1990er Jahre war es in der Phase 2002 bis 2004 noch weitgehend offen, ob die Lohnsteigerungen, gemessen an der Produktivitätsentwicklung bei gegebener Arbeitslosigkeit, tatsächlich rückläufig waren (OECD 2004; SVR 2007, Ziffer 475–513). Zu beobachten war zudem, dass der starke Anstieg der Lohnungleichheit und eine höhere Lohnflexibilität mit einer positiven Beschäftigungsentwicklung in den OECD-Ländern einhergingen (OECD 2004). Dieser empirische Zusammenhang kann allerdings nicht zwangsläufig als ein kausaler interpretiert werden. Die relative Beschäftigungsentwicklung für junge oder ältere Arbeitnehmer ist insbesondere in Ländern, in denen die Lohnungleichheit seit den 1970er Jahren weniger stark angestiegen ist, ungünstiger verlaufen. Nach Einschätzung der OECD (2004) hat sich der Zielkonflikt zwischen positiver Beschäftigungsentwicklung und einer geringeren Einkommensungleichheit verschärft. Demgegenüber betont Horn (2011), dass die Stärkung der Wirtschaft und die Bekämpfung der Ungleichheit Hand in Hand gehen. Die arbeitsmarktpolitischen Empfehlungen des Sachverständigenrates im Jahr 2002 lasen sich angesichts der krisenhaften Entwicklung auf dem Arbeitsmarkt wie folgt: „Den Kern eines Programms für Beschäftigung und Wachstum muss eine Reform des Arbeitsmarkts bilden, denn die derzeitigen institutionellen Rahmenbedingungen setzen gravierende Fehlanreize“ (SVR 2002, Ziffer 22). Der Sachverständigenrat betont, dass eine verbesserte Vermittlungseffizienz, wie sie die Hartz-Reformen anstrebten, keine ausreichende Antwort zur Lösung der arbeitsmarktpolitischen Probleme sei. Im Kernpunkt der Forderungen des Sachverständigenrates standen die folgenden drei Punkte: (1) Stärkung der Nachfrage nach Arbeitskräften durch Senkung des Grenzabgabensatzes für Arbeit und Lohnerhöhungen unterhalb der Zuwachsrate der Arbeitsproduktivität; (2) Senkung der Anspruchslöhne und Ausbau des Niedriglohnbereichs z. B. durch Beschränkung des Bezugsdauer von Arbeitslosengeld auf 12 Monate für alle Arbeitnehmer; (3) Herstellung von mehr Flexibilität am deutschen Arbeitsmarkt und Verbesserung der Abstimmungsmechanismen. Vorgeschlagen werden hier vor allem Maßnahmen zur Erhöhung der Flexibilität bei Tarifverträgen, indem von den Möglichkeiten der Abweichung von Regelungen der Tarifverträge Gebrauch gemacht wird. Zudem wird die Vereinbarung und Verstärkung variabler Lohnkomponenten für sinnvoll erachtet. Inzwischen hat sich die Arbeitsmarktlage deutlich verbessert und selbst während der Krise war im April 2009 lediglich ein saison- und konjunkturbedingter Anstieg der Arbeitslosigkeit auf 3,6 Mio zu verzeichnen. Die hohe betriebsinterne Flexibilität in Deutschland hat einen weiteren Anstieg der Arbeitslosigkeit in der jüngsten Wirtschaftskrise verhindert (Möller 2010). Nach Meinung der Mehrheit des Sachverständigenrates (SVR 2007, S. 341) gibt es Anzeichen, „dass die Reformanstrengungen der vergangenen Jahre erste Früchte tragen“. Dieser Aspekt wird auch von Schneider und Zimmermann (2010) betont. Sie plädieren für eine mutige Fortsetzung des Reformweges mit dem Ziel der Vollbeschäftigung. Gleichzeitig mit der Verbesserung der Beschäftigungslage hat sich die Ungleichheit am Arbeitsmarkt, gemessen an der Lohnstruktur, erhöht. In den letzten zehn Jahren kam es zur Herausbildung eines starken Niedriglohnsektors. Diese Entwicklungen sind mit erheblichen Kosten verbunden (Wilkinson und Pickett 2009) und werden sehr kritisch kommentiert (Horn 2011; Sengenberger 2009). Sie dienen nicht zuletzt als Begründung für die seit einigen Jahren gestellte politische Forderung nach Einführung von allgemeinen Mindestlöhnen und einer stärkeren Regulierung des Arbeitsmarktes, insbesondere für den Bereich der Zeitarbeit. Die zunehmende Kluft zwischen Arm und Reich hat ihren Ursprung in ganz verschiedenen Politik- und Wirtschaftsbereichen wie Staatsverschuldung, Besteuerung, Lohnsetzung, betriebliche Reorganisation, technischer Fortschritt oder Globalisierung. Sie äußert sich nicht zuletzt auch in einem Auseinanderdriften von Bevölkerungsschichten, wie zwischen gut und schlecht ausgebildeten Arbeitskräften, zwischen Rentnern und Beitragszahlern, zwischen Familien mit Kindern und ohne Kinder (Konrad und Zschäpitz 2010). Akerlof und Shiller (2009) betrachten das Problem der Ungleichheit ebenfalls mit Sorge. Hält sich Armut im Kreis von Minderheiten doch besonders hartnäckig. Die Lösung dieses Problems kann nach ihrer Auffassung nicht dem Markt überlassen werden. Flexibilität des Arbeitsmarktes und Heterogenität der Arbeit hängen untrennbar miteinander zusammen. Im Lichte der Debatte um die mangelnde Flexibilität des deutschen Arbeitsmarktes untersuchte das zwischen 2004 und 2010 von der DFG geförderte Forschungsschwerpunktprogramm „Flexibilisierungspotenziale bei heterogenen Arbeitsmärkten“, welche Potenziale für schnellere und flexiblere Anpassungen auf dem Arbeitsmarkt unter Berücksichtigung möglicher Heterogenität der Arbeitsmärkte vorhanden sind. Der Förderzeitraum ging mit der veränderten Einschätzung zur Flexibilität des deutschen Arbeitsmarktes und der generellen Verbesserung der Arbeitsmarktsituation in Deutschland einher. Dies belegt die sowohl forschungs- als auch wirtschaftspolitisch hohe Relevanz der Thematik des Schwerpunktprogramms und der daraus hervorgegangenen Ergebnisse. In Fitzenberger et al. (2008) haben wir die Konzeption des Forschungsschwerpunktprogramms im Lichte des arbeitsökonomischen Diskussionsstandes am Ende des alten und zu Beginn des neuen Jahrtausends vorgestellt und diskutiert. Dabei wurde auch ein Überblick über Themen und Ziele der geplanten wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten gegeben. Unsere Darstellung ist von Sengenberger (2009) sehr kritisch rezipiert worden. Dies hat uns zu einer detaillierten Erwiderung veranlasst, in der wir die Ergebnisoffenheit der arbeitsökonomischen Forschung im Hinblick auf die Vorzüge konkreter Flexibilisierungsmaßnahmen betonen (Fitzenberger et al. 2009). Auf diese Diskussion im Spannungsfeld der beobachteten Veränderungen des deutschen Arbeitsmarktes hin zu einer stärkeren Flexibilisierung sei an dieser Stelle verwiesen. Ein Mehr an Flexibilität und Risiko kann angesichts von Risikoaversion der Beschäftigen durchaus problematisch sein. In diesem Band soll zum Abschluss des Schwerpunktprogramms über die wissenschaftlichen Ergebnisse einer großen Anzahl von Projekten zusammenfassend berichtet werden. Zudem geht es um die Verdeutlichung der wirtschaftspolitischen Implikationen. Die Intention des Forschungschwerpunktprogramms war eine sorgfältige ökonomische Analyse eines Mehr oder Weniger an Flexibilität in verschiedenen Bereichen der arbeitsökonomischen Forschung (Fitzenberger et al. 2008, 2009). Die in der Vergangenheit durchaus hilfreiche Analyse des Arbeitsmarktes unter der Annahme homogener Arbeitskräfte und homogener Betriebe hat zunehmend an Erklärungskraft verloren, da sich verschiedene Teilarbeitsmärkte in einer höchst unterschiedlichen Situation befinden können. Die vielfältigen Änderungen in den Rahmenbedingungen haben sehr unterschiedliche Reaktionen auf der Anbieter- und Nachfragerseite, aber auch innerhalb der Arbeitskräftegruppen und Betriebe hervorgerufen. Eine wachsende Heterogenität der Arbeitsmarktbedingungen über Qualifikationsgruppen, Berufe, Betriebe, Branchen oder Regionen hinweg ist die Folge. Als Beispiel sei genannt das gleichzeitige Auftreten von einem Nachfrageüberschuss bei hoch qualifizierten Arbeitnehmern und einem Angebotsüberschuss bei gering qualifizierten Arbeitnehmern. Offensichtlich gibt es hier Flexibilisierungsprobleme, die einen Ausgleich über Teilmärkte be- oder gar verhindern. Diese Beobachtungen führen zu neuen Herausforderungen, da den vermehrt auftretenden Starrheiten auf dem Arbeitsmarkt differenziert begegnet werden muss. Die verschiedenen Beiträge des Themenheftes machen mit ihren ganz unterschiedlichen Fragestellungen, Methoden und Datensätzen sehr gut deutlich, dass unter dem Blickwinkel der Flexibilisierung nicht jede Maßnahme in die gleiche Richtung zielt, dass einige in der bisherigen öffentlichen und wissenschaftlichen Diskussion erwartete Effekte sich durchaus empirisch bestätigen lassen, während andere eher im Gegensatz dazu stehen (siehe hierzu Fitzenberger et al. 2008). Institutionelle Veränderungen erzielen keineswegs immer die erwarteten Wirkungen oder haben unangenehme Nebeneffekte. Die Analyse darf sich nicht auf ein einziges Wirkungsfeld beschränken. Vielmehr muss sie gerade im Hinblick auf eine wirtschaftspolitische Einschätzung den verschiedenen Dimensionen Rechnung tragen. Vor allem ist es dringend notwendig, bei den Wirkungen zwischen verschiedenen Gruppen zu unterscheiden. In Zukunft wird es noch stärker notwendig sein, das Zusammenwirken verschiedener Maßnahmen gleichzeitig zu betrachten. Im Folgenden geben wir in Abschn. 2 einen kurzen Überblick über die Arbeit im DFG-Forschungsschwerpunktprogramm und fassen die weiteren Beiträge dieses Themenheftes in Abschn. 3 zusammen. Dieses Themenheft bildet den Abschluss der sehr erfolgreichen, auch in der Öffentlichkeit wahr genommenen gemeinsamen Arbeit im Schwerpunktprogramm.",2

Diese betrieblichen Reorganisationsprozesse sind durch verschiedene Bündel geschäftspolitischer, arbeitsorganisatorischer und personalpolitischer Maßnahmen, wie z. B. dem Abbau von Hierarchieebenen, Gruppenarbeit, job rotation, Weiterbildung, Anreizentlohnung und flexibler Arbeitszeiten, als Einzelmaßnahmen aber auch in ihrem Zusammenwirken auf die Beschäftigung und Entlohnung von Erwerbstätigen auf unterschiedlichen Qualifikationsstufen gekennzeichnet. Oftmals werden diese Entwicklungen auf den technologischen Wandel und die Veränderungen im internationalen Handel zurückgeführt, außerdem wird von wichtigen Studien, wie die von Aoki (1990), Hammer und Champy (1993), Appelbaum und Bott (1994), Osterman (1994), Pfeiffer (1994), Lindbeck und Snower (1996, 2000) und Gallie et al. (1998) die Interdependenz und die gegenseitige Unterstützung der einzelnen Maßnahmen betont, so dass sogar gelegentlich von einer „organisatorischen Revolution“ gesprochen wird. Bezüglich der Dynamik der Einführung der angesprochenen Dezentralisierung von Organisationsstrukturen finden Kirchner et al. (2008), dass ein Boom durch die Wirtschaftskrise 1992/93 in Deutschland ausgelöst wurde. Diesen Maßnahmen werden neben Produktivitätseffekten auch positive Auswirkungen auf die betriebliche Arbeitsnachfrage zugeschrieben, denn es werden Marktanteile gesichert oder sogar ausgebaut, was sich tendenziell beschäftigungsfördernd auswirkt. Nicht nur für Deutschland gibt es empirische Belege dafür, dass der mit der Einführung dieser Maßnahmen in den Betrieben sich vollziehende organisatorische Wandel – analog zu der Einführung neuer Technologien (Bellmann und Kölling 1997) nicht qualifikationsneutral erfolgt. Im Rahmen unseres Projektes wurden verschiedene Linked-Employer-Employee-Datensätze aus der Verknüpfung der Daten des IAB-Betriebspanels und der Daten der Beschäftigtenstatistik der Bundesagentur für Arbeit erstellt, um erstmals für einen verhältnismäßig langen Zeitraum von 1996 bis 2004 die Auswirkungen des organisatorischen Wandels auf die betriebliche Arbeitsnachfrage zu untersuchen. Krugman (1994) hat daraufhin gewiesen, dass die Lohn- und Beschäftigungseffekte des technologischen und des organisatorischen Wandels als zwei Seiten derselben Medaille zu betrachten sind. Das bedeutet, dass z. B. der Rückgang der Nachfrage nach un- und angelernten Beschäftigten durch eine entsprechende Lohnsenkung kompensiert werden müsste, um einen Abbau von Arbeitsplätzen für diese Beschäftigtengruppe zu vermeiden. Bestehen in dieser Situation Lohnrigiditäten oder werden tarifvertraglich die Löhne der Un- und Angelernten auf einem bestimmten relativen oder absoluten Abstand zu den Löhnen der Fachkräfte fixiert, ist ein Rückgang der Beschäftigung dieser Un- und Angelernten zu erwarten. Insofern würde bei einer Bestätigung der Hypothese eines „Skill bias“ des organisatorischen Wandels sich diese als Erklärung der vergleichsweise hohen Arbeitslosigkeit der Gruppe der Un- und Angelernten im Vergleich zu Personen mit Berufsausbildung und solchen mit Hochschulausbildung anbieten. In der Tat haben sich nach den Berechnungen von Biersack et al. (2008) die qualifikationsspezifischen Arbeitslosenquoten in Deutschland im Zeitraum 1975–2005 sehr unterschiedlich entwickelt. Dabei zeigt sich, dass die Arbeitslosenquote der Personen ohne Berufsabschluss 1975 noch bei 6,1 % lag, dann aber um mehr als das Vierfache auf 26,0 % anstieg. Dazu erhöhte sich die Arbeitslosigkeit in allen anderen Qualifikationsgruppen weniger stark. So lag im Jahr 2005 die Arbeitslosenquote für alle Erwerbspersonen bei 11,8 %. Erwerbspersonen mit abgeschlossener Lehre/Berufsausbildung waren hingegen zu 9,7 % von Arbeitslosigkeit betroffen. Auch die Arbeitslosenquoten von Hochschul- und Fachhochschulabsolventen fielen mit 4,1 % deutlich geringer aus. In Ostdeutschland gab es eine ähnliche Strukturalisierung aber auf deutlich höherem Niveau. Die ausgesprochen schlechten Arbeitsmarktchancen der Personen ohne beruflichen Bildungsabschluss zeigen sich auch bei den Anteilen der Nichterwerbspersonen. Während nach den Ergebnissen des Mikrozensus 2008 der Anteil der Nichterwerbspersonen im Alter von 55 bis 65 Jahren bei Akademikern 25,3 % betrug, lag diese Quote bei Personen ohne beruflichen Bildungsabschluss bei 55,5 % und bei Personen mit Lehr-/Anlernausbildung bei 42,7 % (Autorengruppen Bildungsberichterstattung 2010, 334). Mit einem qualifikationsverzerrten organisatorischen Wandel ließe sich auch der Rückgang der Einfacharbeit in Deutschland erklären. Nach Berechnungen mit den Daten des IAB-Betriebspanels ist der Anteil der un- oder angelernten Beschäftigten sowie von Angestellten bzw. Beamten für einfache Tätigkeiten, die keine Berufsausbildung erfordern (so genannte Einfacharbeit) von 28 % auf 23 % der Erwerbstätigen und im Zeitraum von 2001 bis 2008 in Westdeutschland und in Ostdeutschland von 16 % auf 13 % zurückgegangen. Für Deutschland insgesamt ist der Anteil der Einfacharbeit von 26 % auf 21 % zurückgegangen. Entsprechend hat sich der Anteil der Facharbeit im genannten Zeitraum in Westdeutschland von 67 % auf 72 % und in Ostdeutschland von 78 % auf 82 % erhöht. Für Deutschland insgesamt gab es einen Anstieg des Anteils der Facharbeit um 5 Prozentpunkte von 69 % auf 74 % (Bellmann und Stegmaier 2010). Die Entwicklung der Verteilung der Arbeitseinkommen in Westdeutschland über den verhältnismäßig langen Zeitraum von 1975 bis 2004 haben Dustmann et al. (2009) mit den Daten der IAB-Beschäftigtenstichprobe untersucht. Dabei konnten sie feststellen, dass die Lohnungleichheit deutlich zugenommen hat: In den 80er Jahren war die Zunahme der Lohnungleichheit auf die höheren Arbeitseinkommen beschränkt, während in den 90er Jahren sowohl untere als auch obere Teile der Einkommensverteilung betroffen waren. Die Autoren betonen für die Entwicklung im oberen Teil der Verteilung den Einfluss des technischen Wandels, während sie die Veränderungen im unteren Teil der Verteilung auf den Rückgang der Tarifbindung und eine Bevölkerungszunahme in Westdeutschland durch die Migration aus Mittel- und Osteuropa und Ostdeutschland zurückführen. Die Entwicklung in Westdeutschland erscheint damit der in den USA durchaus vergleichbar, wobei sie in Westdeutschland 10 Jahre später erfolgte. Nachdem bereits als Einflussfaktoren für die Entwicklung der qualifikatorischen Beschäftigungs- und Lohnstruktur der technologische Wandel, die abnehmende Tarifbindung und die Zuwanderung von Un- und Angelernten erwähnt worden sind, soll im Folgenden die Rolle des organisatorischen Wandels näher betrachtet werden.",1

Aufgrund wandelnder Rahmenbedingungen oder neu zur Verfügung stehender Informationen kann es für Unternehmen sinnvoll sein, bestimmte organisatorische Maßnahmen einzuführen. Zu denken ist hierbei einerseits an nicht-monetäre Organisationssysteme wie größere Autonomie von Arbeitsgruppen, Delegation von Entscheidungsrechten oder das betriebliche Vorschlagswesen. Dadurch werden Arbeitnehmer stärker an das Unternehmen gebunden und es wird erwartet, dass die betriebliche Effizienz verbessert wird. Dieser Neuaufbau von Organisationen mit einer größeren Beteiligung der Arbeitnehmer hat in den letzten Jahren stark zugenommen. Andererseits rücken monetäre Anreize in den Vordergrund. Hierbei ist an Gewinn- oder Kapitalbeteiligung als kollektive Anreizsysteme zu denken. Organisationen sind aber auch exogenen Einflüssen unterworfen. An dieser Stelle sind etwa gesetzliche Rahmenbedingungen zu nennen. Während endogene Änderungen normalerweise das Ziel haben, die Leistungsfähigkeit der Organisation zu erhöhen, können gesetzliche Vorgaben ganz andere Intentionen verfolgen. Bei politischen Entscheidungsprozessen spielen viele Faktoren eine Rolle, bei denen die Effizienzwirkung einer unter mehreren ist. Bei den gesetzlichen Restriktionen werden das Betriebsverfassungsgesetz (BVG) und das Mitbestimmungsgesetz (MitbesG) betrachtet. Diese Gesetze regeln die Mitspracherechte der Arbeitnehmer und haben im In- und Ausland weite Beachtung gefunden. Das deutsche System der betrieblichen und der Arbeitnehmermitbestimmung ist weit ausgebaut und findet in anderen Ländern keine Parallele. Untersucht werden die Auswirkungen der Mitbestimmungsorgane auf zentrale ökonomische Größen sowie auch die Determinanten der Einführung. Ob und in welchem Maße organisatorische Änderungen einen Einfluss auf verschiedene Größen wie z.B. Produktivität und Beschäftigung ausüben, wird im Rahmen des DFG-Projektes „Auswirkungen organisatorischer Änderungen auf den Unternehmenserfolg“ unter Nutzung verschiedener Datensätze und moderner ökonometrischer Verfahren von 2004 bis 2010 untersucht. Hierbei zeigt sich, dass Unternehmen und ihre Arbeitnehmer in vielerlei Hinsicht von diesen Neuerungen profitieren können, die unternehmensspezifischen Gegebenheiten aber in Bezug auf die Effekte eine große Rolle spielen. Unternehmen mit ganz bestimmten beobachtbaren und unbeobachtbaren Charakteristika neigen dazu, bestimmte Organisationsstrukturen einzusetzen. Nur unter Berücksichtigung dieser Selektionseffekte ist es möglich, aus den Ergebnissen empirischer Studien klare Politikimplikationen abzuleiten.",1

Beide Faktoren hängen von individuellen Charakteristika – wie z.B. Alter, Bildung, und Familienstand – aber auch von institutionellen Rahmenbedingungen – wie z.B. der Höhe und Dauer von Transferzahlungen – ab. Neben diesen „klassischen“ Determinanten gibt es aber auch eine Vielzahl von oftmals nicht beobachteten individuellen Eigenschaften, die auf das Suchverhalten von Arbeitslosen und damit die Arbeitslosigkeitsdauer wirken. Als zwei Beispiele seien hier (1) Antizipationseffekte von arbeitsmarktpolitischen Maßnahmen und (2) der Einfluss von Kontrolleinstellungen genannt. Der neue IZA Evaluationsdatensatz (siehe Caliendo et al. 2010b für Details) erlaubt es, eben solche Faktoren zu untersuchen. Grundlage des Datensatzes ist eine Stichprobe von Neueintritten in Arbeitslosigkeit basierend auf administrativen Daten der Bundesagentur für Arbeit, die mit einem innovativen Survey kombiniert wird. Im Survey werden „frische“ Arbeitslose, die zwischen Mitte 2007 und Mitte 2008 arbeitslos wurden, unter anderem zu ihrem Suchverhalten, Persönlichkeitseigenschaften, ethnischem Hintergrund und sozialen Netzwerken befragt. Die erste Befragung fand dabei kurz nach dem Eintritt in Arbeitslosigkeit statt, weitere Erhebungswellen die den Arbeitsmarkterfolg der Personen ein und drei Jahr(e) nach dem Eintritt messen, sind bzw. werden zur Zeit abgeschlossen. Erste Analysen deuten darauf hin, dass sowohl Unterschiede in der maximalen Dauer von Transferzahlungen als auch Unterschiede in Persönlichkeitseigenschaften zu einer Heterogenität im Suchverhalten bzw. in der Übergangswahrscheinlichkeit in Beschäftigung führen können. Personen mit kürzeren Anspruchsdauern auf Arbeitslosigkeit verlassen die Arbeitslosigkeit schneller. Zudem deuten die Ergebnisse auf heterogene Effekte des Bezugs von Arbeitslosengeld auf die Qualität der aufgenommenen Beschäftigung hin. Die Analyse der Effekte von Kontrolleinstellungen auf das Suchverhalten von Arbeitslosen zeigt zudem, dass Personen, die davon überzeugt sind durch eigenes Handeln die Ereignisse in ihrem Leben beeinflussen zu können, intensivere Suchanstrengungen aufweisen und einen höheren Anspruchslohn haben als Personen mit eher externaler Kontrolleinstellung. Des Weiteren zeigt sich, dass das deutsche System der Arbeitsmarktpolitik einen „Threat-Effekt“ ausübt, d.h., dass Arbeitslose mit einer hohen individuell wahrgenommenen Teilnahmewahrscheinlichkeit an Maßnahmen der aktiven Arbeitsmarktpolitik ihren Reservationslohn senken und ihre Suchanstrengungen erhöhen. Ziel dieses Beitrags ist, den IZA Evaluationsdatensatz sowie erste ausgewählte Ergebnisse kurz vorzustellen.Footnote 1 Die oben kurz skizzierten Ergebnisse sind politikrelevant und haben direkte Implikationen für die Gestaltung von aktiver und passiver Arbeitsmarktpolitik. Es zeigt sich, dass neben „klassischen“ Determinanten von Suchverhalten auch in der Regel bisher kaum beobachtete Faktoren wie Persönlichkeitseigenschaften und subjektive Erwartungen berücksichtigt werden müssen, um eine evidenzbasierte und passgenaue Politikberatung zu ermöglichen. Wir skizzieren im Ausblick zu diesem Beitrag kurz, welche weiteren Forschungsfragen mit Hilfe des IZA Evaluationsdatensatzes untersucht werden können.",2

Mehrere Studien belegen das rege Interesse internationaler Politiker und Wissenschaftler an dieser Ausbildungsinstitution. Die Wurzeln des Dualen Ausbildungssystems reichen bis in das Mittelalter zurück und sind im Lauf der Jahrhunderte mit wirtschaftspolitischen Institutionen Deutschlands zusammengewachsen. Vor diesem Hintergrund stellt sich die Frage, inwieweit das Duale Ausbildungssystem den derzeitigen Anforderungen der Arbeitsmärkte gerecht werden kann. Technologischer Wandel ruft neue Verhältnisse zwischen Kapital, Arbeit und Qualifikation hervor. Aber sind die Beschäftigten mit einer Ausbildung durch das duale Ausbildungssystem in der Lage, sich an die sich stetig ändernden Anforderungen am Arbeitsplatz anzupassen? Möglich wäre es, dass die Absolventen aufgrund einer zu eng gefassten Ausbildung an Hürden scheitern, die durch ein höheres Maß an Flexibilität zu überwinden wären. Mit dem Ziel, diese bildungs- und arbeitsmarktpolitisch höchst relevante Fragestellung empirisch zu erhellen, wird in diesem Beitrag die berufliche Mobilität und daraus resultierende Lohnmobilität ehemaliger Absolventen des dualen Ausbildungssystems untersucht. Die Rolle des Berufswechsels soll mit Hilfe des tätigkeitsbasierten Ansatzes, der Arbeitsinhalte in Tätigkeiten klassifiziert, beleuchtet werden. Als Erfolgsmaß der beruflichen Anpassung wird die Entwicklung des individuellen Lohns verwendet. Die Analyse gibt Aufschluss über drei Fragen, die im Zusammenhang mit der dualen Berufsausbildung intensiv diskutiert werden:  Befähigt die Ausbildung im Rahmen des dualen Ausbildungssystems Beschäftigte dazu, mit den durch technologischen Wandel veränderten Anforderungen am Arbeitsplatz mitzuhalten? Wie ist in diesem Zusammenhang der Berufswechsel zu bewerten? Positiv, als eine höhere Stufe auf der individuellen Karriereleiter, oder negativ, als Verlust von Humankapital, d.h. als Hinweis darauf, dass die Beschäftigten den veränderten Anforderungen ihres Berufs nicht gewachsen waren? Welche Konsequenzen ergeben sich aus den Ergebnissen für das System der dualen Berufsausbildung? Wo sollten Reformbemühungen ansetzen?",2
44,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,15 February 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-010-0052-4,Mobilitätshemmnisse heterogener Arbeitskräfte in Deutschland,June 2011,Melanie Arntz,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In einer Studie der OECD (2005) zur BinnenmigrationFootnote 1 in verschiedenen Ländern bestätigt sich eine vielfach gemachte Beobachtung: interne Migrationsraten fallen in europäischen Ländern niedriger aus als in den USA oder Australien, wobei Ost- und Südeuropa die niedrigsten Migrationsraten und Westeuropa, allen voran Großbritannien, die höchsten Migrationsraten aufweist. Deutschland rangiert im innereuropäischen Vergleich in der Mitte. Ähnliche ländervergleichende Ergebnisse finden sich auch in Faini (1999) und Braunerhjelm et al. (2000). Ein besseres Verständnis der Ursachen dieser beobachteten Unterschiede ist von hoher politischer Relevanz, da die räumliche Mobilität von Arbeitskräften, sei es durch interregionale Umzüge oder die Bereitschaft zum interregionalen Pendeln, einen nicht unwesentlichen Beitrag zu einem höheren Wachstumspfad leisten kann. Ein höheres Wachstum kann insbesondere durch den Abbau eines räumlichen Mismatches zwischen Arbeitsangebot und Arbeitsnachfrage und damit höheren Beschäftigungsraten gelingen. Darüber hinaus kann die räumliche Mobilität der Arbeitskräfte dazu beitragen, interregionale Beschäftigungs- und Einkommensdisparitäten abzubauen. Idealtypisch führt ein negativer regionaler Arbeitsnachfrageschock zu einer steigenden Arbeitslosigkeit bei gleichzeitig sinkenden Löhnen sowie einer sinkenden Partizipation am Arbeitsmarkt. Die niedrigen Löhne stimulieren einerseits die Arbeitsnachfrage, andererseits verursachen sie eine Nettoabwanderung. In der Folge dieser Anpassungsprozesse erreichen die Partizipations- und Arbeitslosenquote ebenso wie die Löhne das ursprüngliche Niveau. Für die USA, Australien und Neuseeland konnten Studien nachweisen, dass eine hohe Abwanderungsneigung im Zuge eines regionalen Schocks ein wesentlicher Bestandteil dieses Anpassungsmechanismus ist (vgl. Blanchard und Katz 1992; Debelle und Vickery 1999; Choy et al. 2002). Demgegenüber fällt die Anpassung durch Abwanderungsprozesse in einem europäischen Kontext sehr schwach aus, so dass in der Folge eines regionalen Arbeitsnachfrageschocks primär die Partizipationsraten reagieren (vgl. Decressin und Fatàs 1995; Nahuis und Parikh 2002). Für Deutschland konnte Möller (1995) zwar nachweisen, dass die Binnenmigration langfristig einen wichtigen Beitrag zum regionalen Anpassungsprozess leistet, dies in der kurzen Frist jedoch kaum wirksam ist. Die Identifikation von Mobilitätshemmnissen ist daher von hoher politischer Relevanz. Allerdings deutet die Binnenmigration verschiedener Bildungsgruppen in Abb. 1 darauf hin, dass dieses Vorhaben die Heterogenität verschiedener Arbeitsmarktgruppen berücksichtigen muss. Insbesondere zeigt sich die in allen Ländern niedrigere Mobilität unqualifizierter Arbeitskräfte im Vergleich zu hochqualifizierten Arbeitskräften.  Anteil an Personen zwischen 15–64 Jahren, die in 2003 ihren Wohnort überregional verlegt haben, Quelle: Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. OECD Employment Outlook (2005), S. 94 Dies deutet darauf hin, dass das Mobilitätskalkül, d.h. der Vergleich des erwarteten zukünftigen Nutzens in einer potenziellen Zielregion abzüglich der Migrationskosten mit dem erwarteten Nutzen des Verbleibs in der Herkunftsregion, individuell unterschiedlich ausfällt, wobei Migrationskosten monetäre und nicht-monetäre Kosten der Mobilität umfassen und somit neben den direkten Umzugskosten auch psychologische Kosten und Informationskosten mit einschließen (vgl. Sjaastad 1962; Shields und Shields 1989). Die geringere Mobilitätsneigung unqualifizierter Arbeitskräfte deutet darauf hin, dass diese im Vergleich zu qualifizierten Arbeitskräften insgesamt einen geringeren Nutzenzuwachs durch Migration nach Abzug der Migrationskosten erzielen.Footnote 2 Die größere Mobilitätslücke zwischen unqualifizierten und qualifizierten Arbeitskräften in Europa im Vergleich zu den USA (vgl. Abb. 1) weist zudem darauf hin, dass institutionelle Gegebenheiten zu Mobilitätshemmnissen beitragen, die unqualifizierte Arbeitskräfte in stärkerem Maße betreffen. Institutionelle Rahmenbedingungen, die sich zwischen den USA und Deutschland unterscheiden und zumindest eine potenzielle Teilerklärung für die in Deutschland größere Mobilitätslücke zwischen Unqualifizierten und Qualifizierten liefern, sind beispielweise die großzügigeren Regelungen zur aktiven und passiven Arbeitsmarktpolitik. Ein wesentliches Ziel des DFG-Forschungsprojektes „Flexibilisierungspotenziale heterogener regionaler Arbeitsmärkte durch räumliche Mobilität“Footnote 3 war es, institutionelle Mobilitätsbarrieren in Deutschland zu identifizieren und dabei ein besonderes Augenmerk auf das Mobilitätsverhalten unterschiedlicher Qualifikationsgruppen zu legen. Ein Teil der im Rahmen des Projektes gewonnenen Erkenntnisse werden im Folgenden anhand dreier Forschungsarbeiten erläutert, deren wirtschaftspolitische Relevanz im Anschluss diskutiert wird.",5

Vor allem das System flächen- und branchenübergreifender Tarifverträge muss sich häufig dem Vorwurf aussetzen, eine Anpassung von Löhnen an firmenspezifische Erfordernisse zu behindern und somit die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit insbesondere unterdurchschnittlich produktiver Unternehmen zu beeinträchtigen. Zunehmende Verbandsflucht von Arbeitgebern sowie die Einführung von Öffnungsklauseln und Härtefallregelungen in Verbandstarife stellen eine Reaktion auf den Vorwurf von mangelnder Flexibilität des Systems dar. Vor dem Hintergrund dieser Entwicklungen ist es Ziel des vorliegenden Beitrags, die Rolle der Tarifbindung für die Anpassungsfähigkeit von Löhnen an firmenspezifische Erfordernisse zu beleuchten. Dies erfolgt auf Basis der Ergebnisse des Teilprojekts „Lohnhöhe, Rent-Sharing und Tarifbindung“, die im Folgenden vorgestellt werden sollen. Die Arbeiten des Teilprojekts ordnen sich in die Literatur zum Einfluss der Tarifbindung auf die Lohnstruktur ein, deren umfangreiche Evidenz auf Basis deutscher Daten nicht zuletzt auch auf eine Vielzahl von Arbeiten des Schwerpunktprogramms zurückgeht. Zentrales Ergebnis dieser Literatur ist, dass die Anwendung von Tarifverträgen zu einer Verringerung der Lohnungleichheit führt, indem vor allem Beschäftigte am unteren Ende der Lohnverteilung von tariflicher Entlohnung profitieren (Heinbach und Spindler 2007; Burda et al. 2008; Fitzenberger et al. 2008). Eine Reihe von Untersuchungen führt die durch Tarifverträge induzierte Lohnkompression hierbei explizit auf die Reduktion von Lohnunterschieden zwischen verschiedenen Gruppen von Beschäftigten zurück (Cardoso und Portugal 2005; Stephan und Gerlach 2005; Card und de la Rica 2006; Gerlach und Stephan 2006; Kohn und Lembcke 2007; Heinze und Wolf 2010). Während die Mehrheit der Studien ihr Augenmerk auf qualifikatorische sowie geschlechtsspezifische Lohndifferenziale richtet, gibt es zu den Auswirkungen der Tarifbindung auf Firmenlohndifferenziale bislang vergleichsweise wenig Evidenz. Die im Folgenden diskutierten Arbeiten versuchen diese Lücke zu schließen. Hierzu sollen folgende Fragen beantwortet werden: In welchem Ausmaß lässt sich unter Flächentarifverträgen eine Anpassung von Löhnen an die firmenspezifische Ertragslage beobachten? Falls nein, werden mögliche negative Folgen von unflexiblen Flächentarifabschlüssen für unterdurchschnittlich produktive Unternehmen in den Lohnverhandlungen internalisiert? Welche Rolle spielen dynamische Aspekte bei der Anpassung der Entlohnung an Veränderungen firmenspezifischer Bedingungen? Reagieren Löhne in unterschiedlichem Ausmaß auf kurzfristige und langfristige Nachfrage- und Technologieschocks? Zur Beantwortung dieser Fragen soll im folgenden Abschn. 2 zunächst die Bedeutung der Tarifbindung für den deutschen Lohnbildungsprozess diskutiert werden. Abschnitt 3 stellt die Datenbasis der Untersuchungen dar. Abschnitt 4 beschäftigt sich mit der Frage, inwieweit Flächentarifverträge zu einer Entkopplung der individuellen Entlohnung von der firmenspezifischen Ertragssituation führen. In Abschn. 5 geht es anschließend um die Frage, welchen Einfluss die Branchenheterogenität auf das Niveau von Tarifabschlüssen hat, während Abschn. 6 schließlich die Bedeutung der Frequenz von Produktivitätsschocks für die Lohnflexibilität aufgreift.",1

Maier,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In der aktuellen, durch die Finanzkrise ausgelösten Wirtschaftskrise entwickelt sich der deutsche Arbeitsmarkt im internationalen Vergleich relativ gut. Dies war bis vor wenigen Jahren nicht der Fall. Die damals noch höhere, strukturelle Arbeitslosigkeit führte dazu, dass der institutionelle Rahmen des deutschen Arbeitsmarkts grundlegend hinterfragt wurde. Vor diesem Hintergrund wurde argumentiert, dass das wesentlich von kollektiver Lohnsetzung geprägte Entgeltsystem keine hinreichende Flexibilität auf der Betriebsebene zuließe, diese jedoch im Zeitalter der Globalisierung mehr und mehr notwendig werde. Dabei ist in diesem Zusammenhang immer noch fraglich, ob den heterogenen Anforderungen an den Arbeitsmarkt aus einer zunehmenden Internationalisierung von Märkten und Unternehmen sowie eines immer schneller fortschreitenden technologischen Wandels überhaupt begegnet werden kann. Unabhängig davon sind sowohl das Ausmaß und die Nutzung bestehender tarifvertraglicher Flexibilisierungspotenziale als auch ihre Wirkungen bisher nur vereinzelt Gegenstand der Forschung (Fitzenberger und Franz 1999; Franz und Pfeiffer 2003). In jüngerer Zeit erfahren tarifvertragliche Flexibilisierungsmöglichkeiten jedoch stärkere Aufmerksamkeit (z.B. Gürtzgen 2008; Kohaut und Schnabel 2007; Kohn und Lembcke 2007). Eine mögliche Flexibilisierung der tarifvertraglichen Bestimmungen – die im Fokus dieses Forschungsprojekts steht – ist die Einführung so genannter Tariföffnungsklauseln, mit deren Anwendung im Rahmen des Tarifvertrags vom Günstigkeitsprinzip nach § 4 Abschn. 3 Tarifvertragsgesetz abgewichen werden kann. Durch die Öffnung der als zu starr angesehenen Flächentarifverträge soll erreicht werden, dass auf eine wirtschaftliche Krisensituation des Betriebs durch die flexible Gestaltung von Arbeitszeiten und – unter bestimmten Voraussetzungen – auch von Entgelten schnell und effektiv reagiert werden kann. Gleichzeitig werden die Vorteile einer einheitlichen, für alle tariflich gebundenen Beschäftigten verbindlichen Regelung der Arbeitsbedingungen und der Entlohnung beibehalten. Bisherige Arbeiten zum Thema Öffnungsklauseln konzentrieren sich vor allem auf die Fragen, welche Öffnungsklauseln sich in welchen Bereichen etabliert haben (Bispinck 2003), oder ob sie in der betrieblichen Praxis angewendet werden (Franz und Pfeiffer 2003). Allerdings lagen längere Zeit kaum umfassende oder repräsentative Informationen über Verbreitung und Inanspruchnahme tarifvertraglicher Öffnungsklauseln und deren Wirkungen vor. Grundsätzliches Ziel ist es daher, sowohl die bestehenden Möglichkeiten als auch die tatsächliche Inanspruchnahme der tarifvertraglichen Flexibilität im deutschen Lohnbildungssystem aufzudecken und darauf aufbauend ihre Auswirkungen auf die Lohnstruktur und die Entwicklung betrieblicher Beschäftigung zu untersuchen. So ermitteln Burda et al. (2008) beispielsweise die Unterschiede zwischen tarifgebundenen und nicht-tarifgebundenen Arbeitnehmern entlang der Lohnverteilung. Gürtzgen (2008) analysiert die Effekte der Tarifbindung auf die Löhne unter Verwendung des LIAB-Datensatzes für den Zeitraum 1995–2002 und berücksichtigt dabei auch die Selektion von Arbeitnehmern in tarifgebundene Betriebe. In dieser Arbeit werden ergänzend auch die Informationen zum Ausmaß und zur Anwendung tarifvertraglicher Öffnungsklauseln verwendet. Von zentraler Bedeutung ist die Frage, ob und in welchem Maße herkömmliche tarifvertragliche Rahmenbedingungen den Betrieben bereits eine ausreichend flexible Anpassung und Differenzierung der Entgelte ermöglichen. Deshalb soll analysiert werden, ob die zusätzliche Möglichkeit der Flexibilisierung durch Öffnungsklauseln von den Betrieben genutzt wird und ob diese zu einer günstigeren betrieblichen Entwicklung beiträgt. Insgesamt zielt das Forschungsprojekt somit auf eine Beantwortung der Frage, ob eine flexiblere Lohnanpassung und -differenzierung eine sinnvolle und wirksame Antwort auf die Anforderungen heterogener Arbeitsmärkte darstellen kann. Der weitere Text gliedert sich wie folgt: In Abschn. 2 wird die Entwicklung der Tarifpolitik von den 1990er Jahren ausgehend vorgestellt. Die Beschreibung der damit einhergehenden Entwicklung der tarifvertraglichen Öffnung folgt in Abschn. 3. Welche Faktoren zu einer Tariföffnung führen, wird in Abschn. 4 ermittelt, bevor in Abschn. 5 der Zusammenhang zwischen der Existenz sowie der Anwendung von Öffnungsklauseln und der betrieblichen Entwicklung untersucht wird. Abschn. 6 fasst die Ergebnisse zusammen und schließt mit der Diskussion wirtschaftspolitischer Implikationen.",9

Pfeiffer und Gernandt 2007; Müller und Steiner 2009; Antonczyk et al. 2010; Möller 2010; Biewen und Juhasz 2010). Als Gründe dafür werden unter anderem die Ausweitung des Niedriglohnsektors mit zum Teil sehr geringen Stundenlöhnen, die Verbreitung geringfügiger sozialversicherungsfreier Beschäftigung und die im Rahmen der so genannten „Agenda 2010“ umgesetzten Arbeitsmarktreformen angeführt. Vor diesem Hintergrund werden in der Wissenschaft wie auch der Wirtschafts- und Sozialpolitik als Reformalternativen Lohnsubventionen in Form so genannter „Kombilohn-Modelle“ und die Einführung eines gesetzlichen Mindestlohnes diskutiert (vgl. z. B. Sinn et al. 2002; Steiner 2004). Kombilohn-Modelle haben das Ziel, durch eine einkommensabhängige Lohnsubvention geringe Erwerbseinkommen zu ergänzen und die finanziellen Anreize zur Aufnahme einer gering entlohnten Tätigkeit zu verbessern.Footnote 1 In Deutschland existiert ein Kombilohn in Form der Hinzuverdienstmöglichkeiten beim Bezug von Arbeitslosenunterstützung. Eine spezielle Form eines Kombilohnes ist auch die vollkommene oder teilweise Freistellung der Sozialbeiträge bis zu einem bestimmten Schwellenwert (untere Sozialversicherungsgrenze bzw. „Geringfügigkeitsgrenze“). In der Bundesrepublik wurde im Zuge der „Agenda 2010“ die Förderung „geringfügiger“ Beschäftigung in Form der Freistellung von der Sozialversicherungspflicht oder reduzierten Arbeitnehmersozialbeiträgen („Mini-“ und „Midi-Jobs“) ausgeweitet. Die Verbesserung der Beschäftigungsmöglichkeiten im Niedriglohnbereich steht in Deutschland nach wie vor auf der wirtschaftspolitischen Agenda (vgl. z.B. Sachverständigenrat 2006; Bofinger et al. 2006). Die Ausweitung des Niedriglohnsektors und der sozialversicherungsfreien Beschäftigung wird allerdings auch mit dem Argument kritisiert, dass damit Wettbewerbsverzerrungen zulasten der tariflich organisierten Wirtschaftsbereiche und erhebliche finanzielle Belastungen der Sozialversicherung verbunden wären. Aus dieser Sicht führen Kombilohnmodelle zu sinkenden Marktlöhnen, da der Staat einen Teil der Arbeitskosten im Niedriglohnbereich übernimmt, und zu einer Verdrängung sozialversicherungspflichtiger Beschäftigung. Zur Verhinderung von „Dumping-Löhnen“ und dieses Verdrängungswettbewerbs wurde von der SPD, unterstützt von den Gewerkschaften, den Grünen und der Linkspartei, im letzten Bundestagswahlkampf ein gesetzlicher bundesweiter Mindestlohn von 7,5 € pro Stunde vorgeschlagen. Ein zentraler Kritikpunkt an der Einführung eines gesetzlichen Mindestlohnes sind die damit verbundenen negativen Beschäftigungseffekte, die für Deutschland in mehreren empirischen Studien untersucht wurden. Die wichtigsten Ergebnisse dieser Untersuchungen werden in Abschn. 2.2 zusammengefasst und kritisch bewertet. Zwar unterscheiden sich die Simulationsergebnisse zum Teil erheblich zwischen den Studien. Dennoch kommen alle Studien zu dem Ergebnis, dass die Einführung eines gesetzlichen Mindestlohnes in der Höhe von 7,5 € pro Stunde mit mehr oder weniger großen Beschäftigungsverlusten verbunden wäre. Auch die empirischen Ex post-Analysen zur Einführung eines Mindestlohnes in der Bauwirtschaft, auf die in Abschn. 2.1 eingegangen wird, weisen darauf hin, dass die Einführung eines effektiven Mindestlohnes mit Beschäftigungsverlusten verbunden ist. Die Arbeitsmarktwirkungen von Lohnsubventionen, die in Abschn. 3 behandelt werden, hängen wesentlich von deren Ausgestaltung, dem bestehenden System der Einkommenssicherung und der Beschäftigungs- und Lohnanpassung auf den relevanten Teilarbeitsmärkten ab. Wenn die Lohnflexibilität durch einen gesetzlichen Mindestlohn nach unten beschränkt wird, sind von einer arbeitnehmerseitigen Lohnsubvention keine positiven Beschäftigungseffekte zu erwarten, da das gestiegene Arbeitsangebot keine Lohnsenkung bewirkt. In diesem Fall bleibt zur Kompensation eines Mindestlohnes auf die Arbeitskosten nur eine Lohnsubvention, die an den Arbeitskosten der Unternehmen ansetzt. Um die negativen Beschäftigungseffekte der Einführung eines Mindestlohnes zu neutralisieren, werden in einigen EU-Ländern schon seit längerem Mindestlöhne mit einer arbeitgeberseitigen Lohnsubvention kombiniert (vgl. OECD 1998). In Abschn. 4 werden die Ergebnisse einer Evaluationsstudie für Deutschland zu den Beschäftigungseffekten eines Mindestlohnes in Kombination mit einer aufkommensneutralen Lohnsubvention zur Kompensation der gestiegenen Arbeitskosten präsentiert. Der abschließende Abschn. 5 fasst die wichtigsten Ergebnisse zu den Beschäftigungseffekten von Mindestlöhnen und Lohnsubventionen zusammen und diskutiert diese unter dem Blickwinkel möglicher Reformoptionen für den Niedriglohnsektor in Deutschland. Die Arbeiten, auf denen der Beitrag basiert, entstanden im von der DFG geförderten Forschungsprojekt „Work Incentives, Earnings-Related Subsidies, and Employment in Low-Wage Labor Markets – Empirical Analysis and Policy Simulations for Germany“ (Ste 681/5-3) im Rahmen des DFG-Schwerpunktprogramms „Flexibilisierungspotenziale bei heterogenen Arbeitsmärkten“.",4

Lehren aus einem Modellprojekt,June 2011,Hilmar Schneider,Arne Uhlendorff,Klaus F. Zimmermann,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Das deutsche System der sozialen Mindestsicherung in Form von Arbeitslosen- und Sozialhilfe generiert implizite Mindestlöhne und somit negative Anreizwirkungen auf das Arbeitsangebot im unteren Einkommensbereich. Bei der sozialen Mindestsicherung in Form von Arbeitslosengeld II und Sozialhilfe handelt es sich um einen Zahlungsanspruch, der bei Erfüllung der Bedürftigkeitskriterien zeitlich praktisch unbegrenzt ist. Die Höhe des Transferbezugs sowie die nahezu vollständige Anrechnung des eigenen Erwerbseinkommens auf den Transferbezug determinieren einen impliziten Mindestlohn. Übersteigt dieser Mindestlohn den am Markt erzielbaren Lohn, was vor allem bei gering qualifizierten Erwerbspersonen der Fall sein dürfte, ist die Inanspruchnahme von Transferzahlungen attraktiver als die Ausübung einer Erwerbstätigkeit, selbst wenn das erzielbare Erwerbseinkommen über der Höhe des Transferanspruchs liegt und damit eine eigenständige Existenzsicherung möglich wäre. Je höher die Transferzahlungen und damit der Mindestlohn, desto größer ist der Anreiz, auf eine Erwerbstätigkeit zu verzichten und stattdessen Transferzahlungen in Anspruch zu nehmen (siehe beispielsweise Christofides 2000 oder Schneider und Uhlendorff 2005). Trotz dieser negativen Anreize kann man im deutschen Transfersystem sogenannte „Aufstocker“ beobachten. Die weitaus meisten von ihnen arbeiten jedoch nur in relativ geringem zeitlichen Umfang und verhalten sich somit durchaus anreizkonform, da die so erzielten Einkommen weitgehend anrechnungsfrei bleiben. Der Anteil der Personen, die einer Vollzeitbeschäftigung nachgehen bei der sie weniger als die Grundsicherung verdienen und die daher zusätzliche Transferleistungen beziehen, ist dagegen sehr gering (Brenke und Ziemendorff 2008). Eine mögliche Option, mit der sich einerseits die hohen Belastungen für die öffentlichen Haushalte reduzieren lassen und die andererseits den Betroffenen Perspektiven für ein unabhängiges Einkommen vermittelt, besteht in einer Kopplung des Transferanspruchs an die Verpflichtung zur Ausübung einer Erwerbstätigkeit (Bonin et al. 2007). Dieses auch als Workfare bezeichnete Konzept geht auf amerikanische Vorbilder zurück (vgl. z. B. Ochel 2003) und bezieht seine Wirkung aus einer Verschlechterung des Transfernutzens, ohne die Einkommensposition des Hilfebedürftigen zu beeinträchtigen. Mit Transfernutzen ist hierbei der Nutzen gemeint, den Personen während des Bezugs von Transferleistungen realisieren. Im theoretischen Modell hängt dieser Nutzen von der Höhe des Einkommens und vom Umfang der Freizeit ab. Dies führt dazu, dass niedrig entlohnte Tätigkeiten am Markt akzeptabel werden, denn im Vergleich zur Situation ohne Workfare ist eine Beschäftigung mit einer Entlohnung, die nur geringfügig über dem Transfereinkommen liegt, nun deutlich attraktiver. Eine Alternative zur Reduktion des Anreizproblems stellen vorhandene Sanktionsmöglichkeiten beim Bezug von Arbeitslosengeld II dar, siehe beispielsweise Boockmann et al. (2009) für eine entsprechende empirische Analyse. In Deutschland ist das Workfare-Prinzip bislang erst vereinzelt eingeführt worden und entsprechende Evaluationsstudien liegen bisher nicht vor. Die Ergebnisse von Mikrosimulationsstudien deuten aber auf erhebliche positive Effekte auf das Arbeitsangebot hin (Bonin und Schneider 2006). Diese positiven Effekte auf das Arbeitsangebot werden von Laborexperimenten bestätigt. Sie zeigen zusätzlich, dass die Akzeptanz von Workfare – zumindest unter den im Experiment geltenden Bedingungen – bei den Teilnehmern am Experiment sehr deutlich ist (Falk und Huffman 2007). Dieser Beitrag diskutiert das Modellprojekt „Arbeit Sofort!“, bei dem der Bezug von Sozialhilfe an die Aufnahme einer Tätigkeit im Rahmen eines öffentlich geförderten Beschäftigungsprojekts gebunden wurde.Footnote 1 Das Projekt wurde vom Herbst 2002 bis zum Sommer 2003 im Berliner Bezirk Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf durchgeführt. Sein Ziel bestand in der Erhöhung der Beschäftigungswahrscheinlichkeit der Teilnehmer. Für die Evaluation von „Arbeit sofort!“ werden daher die Erwerbsverläufe der Teilnehmer mit den Erwerbsverläufen einer geeigneten Gruppe von Sozialhilfeempfängern verglichen, die nicht an „Arbeit sofort!“ teilgenommen haben. Beschäftigungsinformationen liegen nur in eingeschränkter Form in den Sozialamtsdaten vor, weshalb die Personendaten aus dem Sozialamt mit Geschäftsdaten der Bundesagentur für Arbeit in einem anonymisierten Verfahren verknüpft wurden. Wir stellen in Abschn. 2 zunächst das Projekt „Arbeit Sofort!“ vor. Abschn. 3 referiert unsere Datenaufnahme, Abschn. 4 berichtet über die Evaluationsergebnisse. Die Schlussfolgerungen in Abschn. 5 stellen die Befunde in einen wirtschaftspolitischen Zusammenhang und reflektieren, was für die Verbesserung des Erkenntnisfortschritts getan werden muss.",2

For example, the level of temporary employment for OECD countries for 2003 is about 13–14%. Russia has the same tendency of extremely fast growing numbers in these atypical forms of employment. Until the 1990s, temporary and part-time employment was highly restricted by the state and unpopular in the Russian labor market. Firstly, the partial liberalization of labor legislation allowed the use of different types of contract by widening the list of reasons why an employer could hire a temp or part-timer. Secondly, the new Labour Code enacted in 2002 (which further increased the list of cases allowing the hiring of atypical workers) encouraged the growth of temporary employment (Labour Code 2003). By the end of 2003 about seven million Russian employees were hired under temporary contracts and about three million workers were part-timers.Footnote 1 Nevertheless Russia had about 55 million people (about 85% of all employed) working on a full-time basis with contracts unlimited in time. So we could say that the typical working arrangementsFootnote 2 were still predominant in this country (Fig. 1).  Dynamics of temporary and part-time employment in Russia, 1992–2003 (% of total employment, Rosstat publications on labor statistics) Is it good or bad for the economy to have increasing numbers of atypical employees? There is a longstanding dispute in the literature on this issue (Tucker 2002). At least two main frameworks could be mentioned here: the flexicurityFootnote 3 approach and the discussion of “good” and “bad” jobs. On the one hand, a high proportion of non-standard workers is an indicator for labor market flexibility, which allows enterprises to adapt quickly to different market changes and economic shocks. On the other hand, it also implies high social risks, uncertainty, wage shortages and loss of employees’ human capital. Usually atypical employment is referred to as “bad” or odd while permanent and full-time jobs are considered to be “good” as they are associated with good wages, high career opportunities, social security and stability for the future. So the main task for social policy is the optimal balance between flexibility and security on the labor market and creation of “good” jobs at the same time. That is why the issue of payment for typical and atypical jobs is extremely important. Unfortunately there are almost no studies on this issue in Russian. Does this transition country, which faced a dramatic reform period (since the early 1990s) with serious economic shocks differ from developed countries? Are the mechanisms of wage formation the same or different? The vast majority of existing publications on western countries claim that temporary workers and part-timers usually receive lower wages than do typical employees. Although there are some papers which address the peculiarities and scope of non-standard employment in Russia (Gimpelson and Kapelyushnikov 2006, 2007), they do not discuss wages. So it is not clear at all whether non-standard workers win or lose in terms of wages in Russia. Moreover if their wages do really differ, then how large is the gap? The paper is aimed at revealing the difference in payments between typical and atypical workers in Russia and to show how large this wage gap is. The contribution of the paper is that it addresses the lack of information on Russia and enriches the literature on typical and atypical employment issues. Moreover, it contributes to the discussion on the methodology of estimating the wage gap between temporary/permanent and part-time/full-time employees as the author tries to assess the pure wage gap while taking into account observed and unobserved characteristics. The focus is put on two major types of non-standard employment that are more widespread in Russia: temporary employment and part-time employment. The paper consists of five parts: theoretical considerations, discussion of existing empirical results, data and methodology, results and conclusions.",3

Dort werden explizit drei Kernkompetenzbereiche definiert und vor dem Hintergrund allgemeiner gesellschaftlicher Anforderungen begründet: 1. selbstständiges Handeln, 2. Interagieren in sozial heterogenen Gruppen und
3. interaktive Nutzung von Instrumenten und Hilfsmitteln. Jede dieser Schlüsselkompetenzen setzt die Mobilisierung von Wissen sowie von Einstellungen, Gefühlen, Werten und Motivation voraus, die zur Bewältigung komplexer situativer Anforderungen benötigt werden. Schlüsselkompetenzen gehen damit über Wissen und Fähigkeiten oder Fertigkeiten hinaus und kombinieren im Menschen liegende kognitive und evaluativ-motivationale Handlungsbedingungen mit externen situativen Anforderungen. Bei den Schlüsselkompetenzen geht es – vereinfacht gesagt – also nicht nur um „Wissen“, sondern um „Können“. Mit dem Besitz von Schlüsselkompetenzen können nach den Vorstellungen der Vertreter dieses Ansatzes sowohl der individuelle Erfolg als auch die gesellschaftliche Wohlfahrt gefördert werden. Empirisch erfasst wurden ausgewählte Schlüsselkompetenzen international vergleichend bisher in den drei PISA-Studien 2000, 2003 und 2006. Mit dem Bologna-Abkommen zur Einführung gestufter Studiengänge in der EU von 1999 ist darüber hinaus für alle BA-Studiengänge vorgesehen, neben fachspezifischen Qualifikationen auch Schlüsselkompetenzen und Berufsorientierungen zu vermitteln. Auch an der Universität Bielefeld werden in nahezu allen Fakultäten seit Einführung der BA-Studiengänge Veranstaltungen zur Förderung von Schlüsselkompetenzen und zur Berufsorientierung angeboten. In diesem Zusammenhang hat eine Lehrforschungsgruppe der Fakultät für Soziologie untersucht, inwieweit in ausgewählten einschlägigen Veranstaltungen im Wintersemester 2006/2007 Schlüsselkompetenzen vermittelt sowie Formen der Motivation und des Selbstbilds verändert worden sind. In diesem Beitrag sollen die folgenden Fragen beantwortet werden:  Was verstehen wir unter den Schlüsselkompetenzen „Selbstständiges Handeln“ und „Interagieren in sozial heterogenen Gruppen“? Was verstehen wir unter Motivation und Selbstbild als eng mit Kompetenzen verbundenen Konzepten? Welche Effekte haben die an der Universität eigens zum Zweck der Vermittlung von Schlüsselkompetenzen angebotenen Lehrveranstaltungen auf die Entwicklung der Schlüsselkompetenzen sowie auf die Entwicklung bestimmter Arten von Motivation und des Selbstbilds? Welche hochschuldidaktischen Konsequenzen sind aus den Ergebnissen der Arbeit für die zukünftige Vermittlung von Schlüsselkompetenzen zu ziehen?",1

Altersdiskriminierung bei der Ausbildungsplatzvergabe,March 2012,Christian Imdorf,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In der Schweiz und in Deutschland ist die duale Ausbildung in Betrieb und Berufsschule die überwiegende Form der Berufsausbildung. Aufgrund ihres direkten Bezugs zur Arbeitswelt gilt diese Form der Ausbildung als ein Erfolgsmodell, das im internationalen Vergleich durch tiefe Jugendarbeitslosigkeitsquoten besticht. Zahlreiche Untersuchungen zeigen jedoch, dass in den letzten Jahrzehnten der Übergang von der Sekundarstufe I in die Berufsausbildung für viele Ausbildungssuchende schwieriger geworden ist (für einen Überblick vgl. Hupka-Brunner et al. 2011). Das Risiko eines verzögerten Übergangs in die betriebliche Berufsausbildung ist für Jugendliche mit unzureichenden schulischen Qualifikationen (also mit Hauptschul- oder fehlendem Schulabschluss), für Frauen sowie für Ausbildungssuchende mit Migrationshintergrund besonders hoch. Als benachteiligt werden dabei Personen aufgefasst, die im Vergleich zu ihren Altersgenossen bei der Versorgung mit Ausbildungsplätzen im Nachteil sind (BIBB 2010: 251). Das Alter der Ausbildungsplatzsuchenden wurde bisher jedoch selten als eigenständiger Risikofaktor des Übergangs in Ausbildung bedacht und untersucht. Dies erstaunt, denn inzwischen liegen hierzu einige bemerkenswerte empirische Befunde vor. Das Mindestalter für den Eintritt in die duale Berufsausbildung ist institutionell durch den Beginn der Schulpflicht, die Vollzeitschulpflicht sowie arbeitsgesetzliche Bestimmungen geregelt. Es liegt sowohl in der Schweiz als auch in Deutschland bei ca. 16 Jahren.Footnote 1 Bildungsstatistische Daten belegen jedoch eine zunehmende Verzögerung des Ausbildungsbeginns, der heute in beiden Ländern deutlich über der institutionell vorgegebenen Altersnorm liegt. Das Durchschnittsalter aller AusbildungsanfängerinnenFootnote 2 lag im Jahr 2006 in der Schweiz bei 18 Jahren (Ohne Autor 2008) und in Deutschland bei 19,3 Jahren (Beicht et al. 2007). Das im Durchschnitt höhere Alter der Ausbildungsanfänger in Deutschland dürfte sich durch den im Vergleich zur Schweiz größeren Lehrstellenmangel der vergangenen Dekade und der damit zusammenhängenden Expansion des Übergangssystems erklären (ausführlicher dazu Seibert et al. 2009: 598). Während sich der Beginn der Ausbildung für Jugendliche zunehmend verzögert, bekunden auch ältere Lehrstellensuchende Probleme bei der Suche nach einem Ausbildungsplatz. Sowohl in Deutschland als auch in der Schweiz sinken nach mehr als zweijähriger Ausbildungsplatzsuche die Chancen auf eine betriebliche Ausbildung markant (Beicht und Eberhard 2009: 89; Hupka-Brunner et al. 2010: 22f.). In der Schweiz betrifft das bereits Jugendliche, die älter als 19 Jahre sind, Für Deutschland ist bekannt, dass Bewerber, die über 20 Jahre alt sind, erheblich schlechtere Chancen haben, einen Ausbildungsplatz zu finden (BIBB 2010: 80). Somit lassen sich zwei auf den ersten Blick konträre Sachverhalte konstatieren: Während die Ausbildungsbetriebe immer weniger jüngere Auszubildende einstellen, finden etwas ältere Bewerber nur schwer einen Ausbildungsplatz. Die Verzögerung des Eintritts in die duale Ausbildung bei gleichzeitig verminderten Chancen, ab einem gewissen Alter noch einen betrieblichen Ausbildungsplatz zu erhalten, bedeutet für die Ausbildungssuchenden ein limitiertes biographisches Zeitfenster für einen erfolgreichen Eintritt in eine Ausbildung. Ziel des vorliegenden Artikels ist es, theoretisch sowie empirisch zu klären, ob und wie die bildungsstatistisch dokumentierten unteren und oberen Altersgrenzen für den Übergang in die Ausbildung mit der Ausbildungsplatzvergabe der Betriebe zusammenhängen. Dabei interessiert, aus welchen betrieblichen Beweggründen das Bewerbermerkmal Alter, welches die Selektionsverantwortlichen bereits den Bewerbungsdossiers entnehmen können, bei der Auswahl der Auszubildenden berücksichtigt wird. Der Autor schlägt vor, die betrieblichen Motive mit der französischen Soziologie der Konventionen zu theoretisieren. Altersangaben könnten – so die theoretische Annahme – auf dem Hintergrund selektionsrelevanter Konventionen der Arbeit interpretiert werden, den wesentlichen Beziehungs- und Koordinationsprinzipien in Arbeits- und Ausbildungsorganisationen. Diese Prinzipien gewährleisten die Abstimmung der gegenseitigen Erwartungen und Anforderungen zwischen den betrieblichen Akteuren und den (zukünftigen) Auszubildenden, weshalb sie im Selektionsprozess die Beurteilung der Bewerber anleiten. Als Rechtfertigungsprinzipien ermöglichen sie zugleich die Begründung und Legitimation der Personalauswahl. Falls sich das Alter aus betrieblicher Sicht als selektionsrelevant erweist, stellt sich somit die Frage, auf welche Konventionen der Arbeit Betriebe konkret Bezug nehmen, um diesem Auswahlkriterium Sinn zuzuweisen und es damit zu rechtfertigen. Die Daten der Schweizer Studie ‚Lehrlingsselektion in kleinen und mittleren Betrieben‘ (Imdorf 2010b) ermöglichen eine empirische Klärung dieser Frage. Der Aufsatz ist folgendermaßen gegliedert: Im Anschluss an einen kurzen Überblick über bisherige Erklärungsansätze der Altersdiskriminierung bei der Stellen- und Ausbildungsstellenvergabe und ihrer Begrenzungen (Abschn. 2) wird in die konventionensoziologische Betrachtung der Personalselektion eingeführt und die betriebliche Bedeutung des Auswahlkriteriums Alter darin verortet (Abschn. 3). Nach einer kurzen Darstellung der Stichprobe, der erhobenen Daten sowie der Datenanalyse (Abschn. 4) werden die empirischen Ergebnisse aus der Schweiz zu betrieblichen Präferenzen für Bewerber zu Ungunsten von direkten Schulabgängern sowie zu Ungunsten von als zu alt geltenden Bewerbern präsentiert. Der Aufsatz schließt mit einer Diskussion der zentralen Konventionen der Arbeit, mit denen Betriebe die Durchsetzung von Altersgrenzen bei der Vergabe ihrer Ausbildungsplätze rechtfertigen.

Im Sommer 2006 ersetzte der Gründungszuschuss (GZ, §§ 57 und 58 SGB III) im Rahmen des „Gesetzes zur Neuregelung der Grundsicherung“Footnote 1 die beiden Vorgängerprogramme Existenzgründungszuschuss (ExGZ) und Überbrückungsgeld (ÜG). Ziel der Reform war neben der Erhöhung der Transparenz und Übersichtlichkeit vor allem eine Entlastung der Arbeitsverwaltung und eine effizientere Ausgestaltung des Förderinstruments. Der GZ bietet gründungswilligen Arbeitslosen im Rechtskreis SGB III eine monetäre Unterstützung auf ihrem Weg in die berufliche Selbständigkeit, wobei sich die Förderung grundsätzlich in zwei Phasen unterteilt: In einer ersten Förderphase wird für neun Monate das zuletzt bezogene Arbeitslosengeld I (ALG I) sowie ein Pauschalbetrag von 300 Euro zur sozialen Absicherung ausgezahlt. Daran anschließend kann in einer optionalen zweiten Förderphase – auf die kein Rechtsanspruch besteht – anspruchsberechtigten Personen der monatliche Pauschalbetrag für weitere sechs Monate gewährt werden. Vor dem Hintergrund der mehrheitlich positiven Ergebnisse einer Vielzahl von Evaluationsstudien zu den Vorgängerprogrammen ExGZ und ÜG wurde die Zusammenlegung zum neuen Instrument GZ eher kritisch beurteilt (vgl. Caliendo et al. 2006, 2010). Ausgehend von der institutionellen Ausgestaltung des GZ und den Erfahrungen mit den beiden Vorgängerprogrammen, entwickeln Caliendo und Kritikos (2009) verschiedene Hypothesen im Hinblick auf die erwartete Effizienz, den Umfang und die Effektivität der Förderung mit dem GZ. Während keine wesentlichen Änderungen im Hinblick auf die Effektivität antizipiert werden, stellen die Autoren jedoch zwei konkrete Erwartungen hinsichtlich des Umfangs und der Effizienz klar heraus: Es wird prognostiziert, dass aufgrund der institutionellen Ähnlichkeit des GZ zum ÜG das zuvor mit dem ExGZ erreichte Spektrum an gründungswilligen Personen mit dem GZ nicht mehr erreicht wird. Dies betrifft insbesondere Personengruppen mit niedrigen ALG I Ansprüchen, in der Mehrzahl geringer Qualifizierte, vormals Teilzeitbeschäftigte – zumeist Frauen – und junge Männer, welche sich mit dem GZ hinsichtlich des individuellen Förderbetrags folglich schlechter stellen (vgl. auch Winkel 2006). Eine weitere Hypothese ergibt sich aus Plausibilitätsüberlegungen: Durch die degressive TransferentzugsrateFootnote 2 des GZ könnten gründungswillige Personen dazu verleitet werden, das ALG I so weit wie möglich auszuschöpfen und erst dann zu gründen, wenn sie nur noch die minimal nötigen Ansprüche (90 Tage) abgeben müssen. Vor dem Hintergrund der längeren Förderdauer und der daraus resultierenden schlechteren monetären Effizienz des GZ, betonen Caliendo und Kritikos (2009) die Bedeutung dieser zweiten Hypothese. Eine zusätzliche Maximierung des Transferbezugs vor Programmteilnahme würde die monetäre Effizienz des GZ weiter verringern. Das vorliegende Papier greift die entwickelten Hypothesen auf und kann erstmals empirische Evidenz zur Relevanz der beiden Erwartungen aufzeigen. Die Datengrundlage für die Untersuchung stellen zufällig gezogene Eintritte in den Gründungzuschuss im ersten Quartal 2009 dar, deren administrative Daten von der Bundesagentur für Arbeit mit Informationen aus Telefoninterviews ergänzt wurden. Eine komparative Analyse bestätigt zwar nicht die Erwartung, dass GZ Geförderte ihren Anspruch auf ALG I ausreizen, zeigt jedoch deutlich, dass mit dem GZ nicht mehr die gleiche Breite an gründungswilligen Personen erreicht wird. Die Teilnehmerstruktur des neuen Instruments ähnelt der des ÜG, jedoch bestehen auch hier signifikante Unterschiede in der Teilnehmerkomposition. Basierend auf diesem Ergebnis, wird daher in einer vertiefenden Analyse zum Gründungsgeschehen mit dem GZ untersucht, inwiefern sich die Bruttoverbleibsquoten, Beschäftigungswirkungen und Einkommen der Gründer/innen von vormaligen ExGZ und ÜG-Empfänger/innen unterscheiden. Während sich dieser Aspekt vor allem auf die Nachgründungsphase bezieht, werden aber auch die Vorgründungsphase (Gründungsmotive) und die Gründungsphase (Eigenkapitaleinsatz, Branchenstruktur) detailliert untersucht. Neben der Untersuchung programmspezifischer Hypothesen sowie der daraus resultierenden deskriptiven Analyse zum Gründungsgeschehen steht die Untersuchung von potentiellen Mitnahmeeffekten im Fokus der Studie. Um einen Mitnahmeeffekt im Bereich der Gründungsförderung nachzuweisen, müssen grundsätzlich zwei Bedingungen erfüllt sein: Erstens muss die Gründungsentscheidung unabhängig von der Förderung stehen und zweitens muss ein Einfluss der Förderung auf den Erfolg bzw. Misserfolg der Selbständigkeit ausgeschlossen werden. Gerade die zweite Dimension war bisher aufgrund von Datenrestriktionen schwierig zu evaluieren und blieb bei der Beurteilung von Mitnahmeeffekten zumeist unberücksichtigt (vgl. Caliendo et al. 2005; Caliendo und Kritikos 2010). Die vorliegende Datenbasis ermöglicht nun erstmalig die Betrachtung dieser zweiten Dimension, so dass die vorliegende Studie einen wesentlichen Beitrag zur Diskussion um potentielle Mitnahmeeffekte im Bereich der Gründungsförderung liefert (vgl. Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales und Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung 2011; Heyer et al. 2011). Das Papier ist folgendermaßen gegliedert: In Abschn. 2 wird zunächst ein kurzer Überblick über die institutionelle Ausgestaltung und die Entwicklung der Existenzgründungsförderung für Arbeitslose in Deutschland gegeben. Daran anschließend gehen wir in Abschn. 3 kurz auf relevante Vorarbeiten zu Gründungen aus der Arbeitslosigkeit ein. Dazu stellen wir zunächst die wesentlichen Ergebnisse der Evaluation der beiden Vorgängerprogramme ExGZ und ÜG dar und erläutern die wesentlichen Erwartungen, die mit einer Zusammenlegung der beiden Programme zum Gründungszuschuss verbunden waren. Abschnitt 3 schließt mit einem Überblick zur internationalen Evidenz bevor in Abschn. 4 die neue Datenbasis zum Gründungszuschuss beschrieben und ein deskriptiver Vergleich mit den beiden Vorgängerprogrammen vorgenommen wird. Anschließend erfolgt in Abschn. 5 die vertiefende Analyse der GZ-Teilnehmerstrukturen, bevor das Papier in Abschn. 6 mit einem Fazit abschließt.",16

Erstens müssen sie entscheiden, ob und wenn ja in welchem Umfang sie ausbilden möchten und ggfs. die dafür erforderlichen Voraussetzungen schaffen. Falls die Betriebe sich für eine Ausbildung entscheiden, ist zweitens zu überlegen, ob die Weiterbeschäftigung der Auszubildenden nach dem Ausbildungsabschluss angestrebt wird. Und drittens ist zu entscheiden, wie die Ausbildung in ihrem Betrieb organisiert werden kann. Die drei Fragen stehen in Wechselbeziehungen zueinander: So lässt sich die erste Frage – jedenfalls rational – nur beantworten, wenn Überlegungen zu den anderen Fragen angestellt wurden und der Betrieb sich eine Erwartung hinsichtlich der entstehenden Kosten, aber auch des Nutzens bilden konnte.Footnote 1 Außerdem kann vermutet werden, dass die Organisation der Ausbildung durch das Übernahmeinteresse beeinflusst wird, da die Organisation zum einen die Qualität der Ausbildung und damit die spätere Einsetzbarkeit als Fachkräfte bestimmt und zum anderen die unmittelbaren Kosten und Erträge der Ausbildung von dieser abhängen. Die Hypothese der Wechselbeziehung zwischen Ausbildungsmotiv und Ausbildungsorganisation steht im Zentrum dieses Artikels.Footnote 2 Zusätzlich wird untersucht, welche weiteren Faktoren die Organisation der Ausbildung beeinflussen. Ein bedeutender Faktor sind dabei die Auszubildenden selbst. Ihre Fähigkeiten und Kenntnisse beeinflussen die Einsetzbarkeit im Produktionsprozess auf der einen Seite und den Umfang der notwendigen arbeitsplatzfernen Ausbildungsmaßnahmen auf der anderen Seite. Eine Approximation dieser Kenntnisse und Fähigkeiten bieten die allgemeinen schulischen Kompetenzen der Auszubildenden. Der Einsatz der Auszubildenden im Betrieb wird aber auch durch verschiedene exogene Faktoren beeinflusst. So sind in den Ausbildungsordnungen der Berufe Vorgaben enthalten, welche Ausbildungsinhalte im Verlauf der Ausbildung im Betrieb zu vermitteln sind. Trotz dieser institutionellen Einschränkungen bleibt den Betrieben ein relativ großer Spielraum bei der Organisation der Ausbildung vor Ort. Auch Betriebsmerkmale, wie beispielsweise die Betriebsgröße, können einen Einfluss auf den möglichen Arbeitseinsatz der Auszubildenden haben. So wechseln die Auszubildenden in Großbetrieben häufiger zwischen den Abteilungen, um einen Überblick über den gesamten Betrieb zu bekommen. In jeder Abteilung sind dann zunächst Phasen nötig in denen die Auszubildenden diese kennenlernen und daher nicht produktiv eingesetzt werden können. Die Organisation der Ausbildung wird über die Verteilung der Zeit der Auszubildenden im Betrieb operationalisiert. Die Auszubildenden können ihre Zeit im Betrieb mit einfachen oder Fachkräftetätigkeiten verbringen oder sie werden auf verschiedene Art und Weise unproduktiv ausgebildet. Unproduktiv meint dabei, dass für den Betrieb unmittelbar keine verwertbaren Produkte oder Dienstleistungen entstehen. Das Ausbildungsmotiv der Betriebe wird über die Übernahmestrategie operationalisiert. Betrieben, die „auf jeden Fall weiterbeschäftigen“ wollen, wird ein Investitionsmotiv zugeschrieben (vgl. Merrilees 1983), da der zentrale Nutzen der Ausbildung die Sicherung des eigenen Fachkräftebedarfs ist und die Ausbildungsphase als Investition gesehen werden kann. Betrieben, die keine Übernahme der Auszubildenden planen, da sie entweder keinen Fachkräftebedarf erwarten oder diesen über andere Wege decken, wird ein Produktionsmotiv (vgl. Lindley 1975) zugeschrieben. Rational handelnde Ausbildungsbetriebe mit diesem Motiv müssen versuchen, die anfallenden Ausbildungskosten während der Ausbildung durch die Beiträge der Auszubildenden zum Betriebsoutput zu decken, da ein Nutzen nach Ausbildungsende ausgeschlossen ist. Der vorliegende Beitrag ergänzt die vorhandene empirische Literatur zu den Ausbildungsmotiven in zwei Punkten. Zum einen kann auf den aktuellen Datensatz der BIBB-Kosten-Nutzen-Erhebung 2007 (BIBB-CBS 2007) (vgl. Schönfeld et al. 2010) zurückgegriffen werden, der gegenüber anderen Datenquellen den Vorteil hat sich explizit auf Fragen der Ausbildungsorganisation im Betrieb zu beziehen. Zum anderen wird erstmals das Motiv über eine direkt erfragte strategische Ausrichtung bezüglich der Übernahme modelliert. Dies hat gegenüber der tatsächlichen Übernahmequote den Vorteil, dass externe Faktoren wie eine veränderte wirtschaftliche Situation, das freiwillige Ausscheiden oder das PoachingFootnote 3 von Absolventen keinen verzerrenden Einfluss haben können. Es ist zu beachten, dass u.a. aufgrund der Eigenschaften des Querschnittdatensatzes keine kausalen Aussagen aus den Ergebnissen der durchgeführten Regressionsanalysen abgeleitet werden können. Die gefundenen Koeffizienten liefern dennoch interessante Erkenntnisse bezüglich der untersuchten Zusammenhänge und können als Ausgangspunkte für eine inhaltliche Diskussion verwendet werden. Der Artikel gliedert sich wie folgt auf: Im zweiten Abschnitt werden, ausgehend von der Literatur, Hypothesen entwickelt. Im dritten Abschnitt wird der Datensatz kurz vorgestellt, im vierten Abschnitt werden die Variablen erläutert, mit denen dann die Hypothesen empirisch überprüft werden. Abschnitt fünf fasst zusammen und zieht Schlussfolgerungen.",8

As the quotation from Karl Marx suggests, gregariousness is an important aspect of human life. It should also have significant implications for the distribution of jobs and wages in the economy.Footnote 2 However, there is not much research on the relationship between gregariousness, interactive jobs and labour market outcomes. The study by Krueger and Schkade (2008) indicates that gregarious female workers sort themselves into jobs that entail more social interaction. To the best of our knowledge, there is no comparable evidence on sorting by males and on the relationship between interactive jobs and wages. A number of related studies examine the role of personality factors for wages. Among others, the work by Heineck and Anger (2010) and Mueller and Plug (2006) suggest that outgoing, talkative and sociable, in other words, more gregarious workers may suffer some wage penalty. Our contribution to the literature utilises data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP, Wagner et al. 2007). We examine the implication of gregariousness for sorting into interactive jobs and related wage differences for male and female workers in Germany. The richness of socio-economic characteristics and psychometric measures on personality, gives us the opportunity to focus on the determinants of sorting and on wages from working in a job with more or less social interaction. In our study, social interaction at the workplace has been constructed by expert assessments based on the level of the standard occupational four-digit classification scheme. Individual tastes for gregariousness are taken from the personality factor extraversion as well as from respondents’ information on the extent of social interaction in leisure time. Krueger and Schkade (2008) explore the drivers for sorting into interactive jobs with data based on the day reconstruction method. Since the authors do not have direct information on the personal taste for gregariousness, they interpret social interactivity during leisure time as a proxy for gregariousness preferences also during working hours. Social interaction is defined “as the percentage of the day that a job requires a worker to be engaged in conversation with customers, clients or co-workers” (ditto, p. 861). They find that female workers who are more gregarious in their leisure time also exhibit a higher probability to be employed in a job with more social interaction. Furthermore, they demonstrate that females working in interactive jobs are on average more satisfied with their jobs compared with workers in jobs with less social interaction. Since measured personality factors may depend—at least to some extent—on job attributes, interdependency may create biased estimates. To investigate the direction of such a potential bias in our study, a supplemental sample of seventeen-year-olds is utilised. The sample is taken from the SOEP youth questionnaires. Questions deal with preferred job attributes later at work, among them the desirability of social interaction. Since the youth questionnaire contains the same psychometric measures of personality as the questionnaire for adults, the sample allows us to investigate the relevance of gregariousness without the problem of interdependency as the seventeen-year-old respondents are not employed yet. Our empirical findings suggest first that around 83 per cent of the female workers and 80 per cent of the male workers are gregarious during leisure time. At the working place, 59 per cent of women and 30 per cent of men are engaged in jobs with medium or high interpersonal interaction. The estimates indicate a significantly positive relationship between the personality factor extraversion and the probability to work in an interactive job. The analysis with the SOEP youth questionnaire demonstrates that extraversion contributes to the desire for social interaction in the job already in adolescence, strengthening the results in the samples of adults. There is some initial evidence that gregariousness in leisure time and social interaction at the working place are associated with (moderately) higher wages, except when high interaction occurs in large firms. Future research is needed to assess the time spent in social interaction at the work place and its productivity effects for each worker in greater detail. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 a theoretical model of sorting and wage differentials in an environment of heterogeneously interactive jobs and divergent tastes for social interaction at the working place is introduced, together with a review of empirical findings. In Sect. 3 data are introduced. Section 4 discusses the econometric results on the determinants of choosing interactive jobs and Sect. 5 on the extent of wage differences. Section 6 concludes.",
45,2,Journal for Labour Market Research,29 June 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-012-0106-x,"Average wage, qualification of the workforce and export performance in German enterprises: evidence from KombiFiD data",July 2012,Joachim Wagner,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Empirical investigations with firm level data from official statistics often use the average wage paid in a firm, computed as the total wage bill over the number of employees, as a proxy variable for human capital intensity of production. The information on the number of employees and on the wage bill is widely available in surveys of firms conducted by the statistical offices all over the world. More detailed information on the qualification of the workforce (like the share of employees with a certain level of education attained or vocational training concluded), however, is only rarely available at the firm level in this type of dataFootnote 1 (see Syverson 2011, p. 340). As a case in point, and to motivate this study by pointing to a potential pitfall caused by using the average wage as a proxy variable for human capital intensity, consider a recent study on the links between firm characteristics and exports in enterprises from German manufacturing industries (Wagner 2011a). Germany is one of the leading actors on the world market for manufactured goods but not every firm from a manufacturing industry in Germany is an exporter. In 2006 the share of exporters in all enterprises was 69 percent in West Germany and 52 percent in East Germany.Footnote 2 Reliable information on the characteristics of exporting and non-exporting firms and on the links between firm characteristics and the share of exports in total sales is important to guide theorists and policy makers in an evidence based way. In Wagner (2011a) recently released rich high quality data for a large representative panel of enterprises from German manufacturing industries are used to investigate the links between firm characteristics and export activities, and a decisive role of human capital intensity for exporting is found. Unfortunately, in the enterprise level data used in this study there is no better proxy for human capital intensity than the average wage per employee in a firm. For example, the data has no information on the share of employees with a university degree or the share of employees that successfully passed the exams following apprenticeship.Footnote 3 To justify the use of the average wage in a firm as a proxy variable for human capital intensity in the absence of more direct measures it is argued that although qualification of the work force is not the only determinant of the average wage in a firm it can be expected to be highly positively correlated with it. Furthermore, it is pointed out that in the empirical models that link wage per employee to exporting both firm size and industry affiliation are included and, therefore, both firm-size wage differentials and inter-industry wage differentials are controlled for. While due to the lack of detailed information on the qualification of the employees this approach is widely used in the literature it is not without problems especially when it comes to the analysis of the links between exports and human capital intensity. It is a stylized fact found in many micro-econometric studies from a number of countries that exporters pay higher wages (see Schank et al. 2007 for a survey). Recent studies using linked employer-employee panel data show that wage differences between exporters and non-exporters become smaller but do not completely vanish once observable and unobservable characteristics of the employees and of the workplace are controlled for.Footnote 4 Therefore, any empirical model that uses the average wage in a firm as a proxy variable for human capital intensity of production to investigate the link between firm characteristics and the propensity to export suffers from an endogeneity problem—the higher the wage per employee the higher is the probability that the firm is an exporter not only because more human capital intensive firms have a higher probability to export but also because a firm that exports has a higher wage per employee irrespective of the (observed and unobserved) qualification of the work force! This paper makes two contributions to the literature. First, it presents empirical evidence on the quality of the average wage in a firm as a proxy variable for the qualification of the employees. Second, it demonstrates that detailed information on the qualification of the workforce sheds new light on the role of highly qualified employees for success on export markets that is not revealed by the average wage as a proxy variable. In the empirical investigations it uses unique newly available data for German enterprises from the KombiFiD project (discussed in detail below) that for the first time combine information from the statistics of employees covered by social security and information from surveys performed by the Statistical Offices. Based on the results of this paper it is argued that combined firm level data that stem from different data producers should be widely accessible for research. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data used and the definition of variables. Section 3 looks at the link between the average wage in a firm and the qualification of the workforce. Section 4 compares results from empirical models for export participation and for the share of exports in total sales that use either the average wage of a firm or information on the qualification of the workforce to measure the human capital intensity of the production. Section 5 concludes.",20
45,2,Journal for Labour Market Research,03 July 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-012-0107-9,Fixed-term contracts and wages revisited using linked employer-employee data,July 2012,Christian Pfeifer,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"High unemployment and competitive pressure led to a call for labor market flexibility and to labor market reforms with respect to temporary employment in many European countries since the 1980s (OECD 2002, pp. 127–185; Gebel and Giesecke 2009; Pfeifer 2009). These reforms have made it easier for firms to employ workers on a temporary basis and increased the share of workers with temporary contracts, especially fixed-term contracts (FTCs). In Germany, for example, FTCs were highly regulated until the introduction of the Employment Promotion Act („Beschäftigungsförderungsgesetz“) in 1985. This legal change relaxed the former rule that the employer had to demonstrate the temporary nature of the work (e.g., by providing objective reasons such as seasonal fluctuations) and that FTCs had a maximum duration of only six months. The Employment Promotion Act of 1985 allowed a single FTC to last up to 18 months without justification if the employee was newly hired or if an apprentice could not be offered a regular job. In 1996, the duration of FTCs was raised to 24 months with three renewals possible within this period. If the contract was justified by an objective reason, the legal restrictions did not apply. In January 2001, the regulation of FTCs in Germany was again renewed and regulated in a single law („Gesetz über Teilzeitarbeit und befristete Arbeitsverträge“). The new legislation includes the prohibition of discrimination at the workplace, which refers to equal pay and treatment. Such an equal pay policy seemed necessary due to the labor market segregation in good permanent jobs and bad temporary jobs. Theoretical predictions about the wage effects of FTCs are contradictory. On the one hand, compensating wage theory predicts that temporary workers should receive, ceteris paribus, higher wages than permanent workers, because workers are usually risk averse so that they prefer permanent contracts and need to be compensated for FTCs. Dual (segmented) labor market theory, on the other hand, predicts that temporary workers have jobs in lower paying industries and firms (Taubman and Wachter 1986; Leontaridi 1998). In fact, even dual internal labor markets are very common, i.e., one firm employs a permanent (core) workforce as well as a temporary (peripheral) workforce (Rebitzer and Taylor 1991; Saint-Paul 1991; Pfeifer 2009). Whereas the former enjoys benefits of internal labor market structures (e.g., high wages, long-term stable employment, training, promotions), the latter is used as a flexible buffer to deal with demand shocks and has worse working conditions such as low wages. FTCs can also serve as stepping stones into internal labor markets in form of extended probation periods, during which the firm screens workers with uncertain quality (Booth et al. 2002; Güell and Petrongolo 2007; Boockmann and Hagen 2008). Workers are usually paid lower wages during probation and get a wage increase after being contracted permanently when satisfying the firm’s hiring standards. In sum, the two rationales “compensating wage differentials” (wage premium for FTC) and “dual internal labor markets” (wage penalty for FTC) lead to opposing predictions. Theoretical considerations about wage effects of FTCs across the wage distribution should also take into account workers’ differences in labor market opportunities. If workers at the upper tail of the wage distribution have good labor market opportunities (e.g., labor supply shortage of highly qualified experts or successful managers), they might work voluntarily with FTCs and change firms more frequently to increase their wages during bargaining processes. Consequently, the wage differentials between workers with temporary and permanent contracts are likely to be small or even in favor of FTCs at the upper tail of the wage distribution. On the other hand, workers with bad labor market opportunities at the lower tail of the wage distribution (excess labor supply) are likely to suffer more from segregation. If their temporary employment does not allow them to enter internal labor markets, the wage penalties for FTCs at the lower tail of the wage distribution should be larger. Due to excess labor supply and larger quality uncertainty of workers with bad labor market opportunities, extended probation periods in form of FTCs are likely to be used more frequently, which should also lead to larger wage penalties for FTCs at the lower tail of the wage distribution. From an empirical perspective, it is well established that workers with FTCs earn on average significant lower wages than workers with permanent contracts (e.g., Booth et al. 2002; Hagen 2002; OECD 2002, pp. 141–144; Brown and Sessions 2003, 2005; Mertens and McGinnity 2004, 2005; Mertens et al. 2007). Some studies also explore the wage differentials across the wage distribution and find larger than average wage differentials at the lower tail of the wage distribution and low but still significant wage disadvantages for FTCs at the top of the wage distribution (Mertens and McGinnity 2005; Mertens et al. 2007). Due to data limitations previous studies, at least for Germany, suffer from several shortcomings. While household survey data such as the GSOEP (German Socio-Economic Panel) contain information about FTCs and worker characteristics, they do not comprise information about a worker’s workplace so that within-firm wage differentials cannot be estimated. Consequently, the estimated wage differentials might suffer from an omitted variable bias due to unobserved firm characteristics. If, for example, FTCs are more likely to be employed by low wage firms, which also pay workers with permanent contracts low wages, the within-firm wage differential should be smaller than the wage differential across low and high wage firms. In order to deal with this issue, linked employer-employee data are necessary. Unfortunately, the linked employer-employee data set of the IAB (LIAB), which is often used to analyze the German labor market because it contains a large number of firms with their total workforce and many firm characteristics, does not contain information about a worker’s contract type. Therefore, I use an administrative linked employer-employee data set from the German Federal Statistical Office—the German Structure of Earnings Survey 2006. Due to its large sample size, the German Structure of Earnings Survey is also more suitable to analyze the wage differentials across the wage distribution than smaller survey data sets. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. The next section informs about the German Structure of Earnings Survey, sample restrictions, variables, and the estimation strategies. Section 3 presents the estimated wage differentials between workers with FTCs and permanent contracts. The paper concludes with a short summary in Sect. 4.",4

45,3,Journal for Labour Market Research,04 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-012-0124-8,Minimum wages in German industries—what does the evidence tell us so far?,December 2012,Joachim Möller,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Germany is one of the few countries in Europe that has not introduced a general statutory minimum wage. Up to now, minimum wages have only been implemented in a dozen branches or occupations. However, there is an on going highly controversial debate on whether or not to impose a general wage floor in the country. This debate is reflected in an academic controversy. On the one side are those who believe that although the neoclassical paradigm perhaps does not describe the labor market perfectly, it is nevertheless adequate. In this setting, the market is at, or at least close to, a competitive equilibrium and workers are paid according to their marginal productivity. A wage floor artificially drives up the remuneration of workers. As a consequence, employment falls when firms are moving upwards along the labor demand curve. Hence minimum wages are detrimental insofar as low-productivity workers lose their jobs. If the real wage elasticity of labor demand is low, it is possible that the total wage bill increases—which could be a desirable effect. However, given that low-skilled workers count for the majority of low-paid workers and the unemployment rate of this group is still at an unacceptable level, disemployment effects of a minimum wage have to be considered as highly undesirable. This, and the fact that under the conditions of a competitive labor market minimum wages squeeze the firms’ profits, might explain the strong resistance of a considerable fraction of German economists to the minimum wage. On the other side are those who point to the fact that the labor market is highly imperfect and the neoclassical paradigm is not suitable, even as approximation to reality. If employers exert market power in some way or other, the competitive equilibrium view becomes obsolete. Under limited competition on the labor market, it may well be that workers are paid below the value of their marginal productivity. The firm has an incentive to keep employment below the market clearing level when it is possible to force workers down to the labor supply curve. In such a situation, a government intervention is able—at least within a certain range—to increase both wages and employment at the same time. Of course, a pure monopsony environment as in the classical case of a company town is not a realistic description of a modern economy where workers are mobile and can escape the narrow confines of a local labor market. However, new approaches of monopsonistic competition as outlined, for instance, by Manning (2003a, 2003b), show that a corresponding situation can arise in a realistic labor market setting. The reasons why a firm might exert some monopsonistic power range from asymmetric information between employers and employees to the specific circumstances, restrictions or preferences of an individual worker. Take, for instance, the case of a single mother when a child care facility happens to be around the corner from the firm: she would then tend to accept a wage offer somewhat lower than she would be typically willing to accept under other circumstances. Although the neoclassical and the monopsonistic approach represent fundamentally different views of the labor market, it should be stressed that both lead to the same predictions in two specific situations: (i) in the trivial one, where the minimum wage is so low that it is not binding and (ii) in the case where the minimum wage is beyond the equilibrium level of a competitive market. Whereas in the former case, no effects can be expected, both approaches would predict the same negative employment response of the labor market in the latter. The discrepancy between the neoclassical and the monopsony view is in the question of whether the minimum wage could be binding even below the competitive market clearing level. Similar to the theoretical academic controversy, the empirical evidence on the disemployment effects of a wage floor is ambiguous as well (see Neumark and Wascher 2008; Manning 2011). Whereas, from the neoclassical point of view, the effect of a binding minimum wage is always detrimental, an advantage of the monopsony approach might be seen in the fact that it is flexible enough to explain opposite employment effects depending on the specific circumstances. The crucial point in the debate, therefore, is whether or not there is an area of freedom where a binding minimum wage has no negative employment effects. If so, then an intelligent minimum wage strategy can be used to pursue not only social aims, i.e. to improve the situation of workers at the very low tail of the wage distribution, but also to improve the functioning of the labor market because the number of vacancies is reduced. In general, empirical minimum wage research in Germany has lagged behind standards in international literature for quite a long time. Before several studies were initiated by the German Ministry of Labor in 2010, most contributions aimed at analyzing the effects of a minimum wage simply used inadequate methods. In the next section we first describe two of these deficient approaches before turning to a more state-of-the-art analysis.",18
45,3,Journal for Labour Market Research,20 November 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-012-0121-y,The administration and impact of a national minimum wage: lessons for Germany,December 2012,Peter Dolton,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Introducing a national minimum wage (NMW) has been on the political agenda in Germany for several years since the labour market reforms of 2003 to 2005. The arguments for its introduction are complex. Fortunately other countries have many years of experience of such systems. In this article we summarise the basic lessons to be learnt from other countries experience, in terms of what effects such a NMW might have on the labour market, employment and inequality. We also ask the question—of whether these lessons from other countries mean anything for Germany. We begin by taking a quick look at the most recent applied econometric literature on MWs and rehearse what we now know about its effects. Most of the papers we consider are from the post 1995 period of modern econometric analysis following the important work of Card and Krueger (1994, 1995). We then consider position of Germany and explain why the answer to the issue of its potential introduction in Germany is not straightforward. We go on to consider how one may administer a NMW and specifically look at the recent experience of the UK introducing a NMW in 1999 and explain what was good and bad about this experience and what lessons can be learnt for Germany.",1

Wäschereien im Objektkundengeschäft bieten neben dem Waschen und Wiederaufbereiten von Textilien häufig auch das Leasing von Wäsche (z. B. Berufsbekleidung) sowie Logistikleistungen an. Kunden sind Einrichtungen des Gesundheitswesens (z. B. Krankenhäuser, Pflege- und Seniorenheime), das Hotel- und Gaststättengewerbe sowie Betriebe aus vielen anderen Branchen. Wäschereien im Objektkundengeschäft sind oft industrieähnliche Unternehmen mit hohen Sachkosten (vor allem Maschinen und Energieverbrauch) und Schichtarbeit an den Waschstraßen zur besseren Auslastung der kapitalintensiven Anlagen. In den letzten Jahrzehnten ist neben dem Privatkundengeschäft eine breite Dienstleistungspalette für unterschiedliche gewerbliche Kunden entstanden. Zu den wichtigsten Marktsegmenten zählt der Textilservice in den Bereichen Berufskleidung, Gesundheitswesen sowie Hotel- und Gaststättengewerbe. Die Ausschreibung des Bundesministeriums für Arbeit und Soziales zur Evaluation der Mindestlohnregelungen für die Wäschereidienstleistungen im Objektkundengeschäft sah vor, die Wirkungen auf die Beschäftigung, den Schutz der Arbeitnehmer/innen und die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit der Unternehmen in den Mittelpunkt zu stellen. Neben diesen drei Wirkungsdimensionen ging es auch um die Frage nach den Auswirkungen der Mindestlöhne auf die tatsächliche Bezahlung. Bei der Entwicklung des Untersuchungsdesigns der Evaluation der Mindestlohnregelungen im Bereich der Wäschereidienstleistungen im Objektkundengeschäft mussten sehr gravierende Einschränkungen hinsichtlich der Datenverfügbarkeit berücksichtigt werden. Die Möglichkeiten mikroökonometrischer Wirkungsanalysen mit dem Differenz-von-Differenzen-Ansatz wurden geprüft, erwiesen sich aber aus mehreren Gründen als nicht durchführbar. Da die Mindestlohnregelungen erst am 24. Oktober 2009 in Kraft traten, lagen bis zum Abschluss der Evaluation am 31. August 2011 keine Daten vor, die den Zeitraum nach der Einführung der Mindestlohnregelungen abbildeten. Außerdem konnte der Geltungsbereich der Mindestlohnregelungen in vorliegenden Statistiken nicht identifiziert werden, weil der Umsatzanteil von Wäschereien im Objektkundengeschäft hier nicht erfasst wird. Darüber hinaus wird der Bereich „Wäscherei und Chemische Reinigung“ in der aktuellen Klassifikation der Wirtschaftszweige (WZ 2008) als WZ 96.01.0 nur noch zusammen auf 5-Steller-Ebene ohne weitere Differenzierung ausgewiesen.Footnote 1 Insofern lassen sich die Wäschereien, die unter die Mindestlohnregelungen fallen, nicht von denjenigen unterscheiden, auf die dies aufgrund ihres geringeren Umsatzanteils im Objektkundengeschäft nicht zutrifft. Vor diesem Hintergrund stellte sich die Frage, welche alternativen Methoden für die Evaluation der Mindestlohnregelungen im Bereich der Wäschereidienstleistungen im Objektkundengeschäft in Frage kommen könnten. Dabei war zu berücksichtigen, dass die Branche wissenschaftlich bislang wenig erforscht ist. Um die Wirkungen der Mindestlohnregelungen trotz des Mangels geeigneter administrativer Daten analysieren zu können, sah unser Untersuchungskonzept neben Auswertungen der amtlichen Statistik im Rahmen des Möglichen sowie Sonderauswertungen der Bundesagentur für Arbeit zu unterschiedlichen Aspekten der Branchenentwicklung als zentrale Bausteine eine eigene Betriebsbefragung und als qualitative Untersuchungsschritte Expertengespräche und Betriebsfallstudien vor. In diesem Beitrag werden Ergebnisse der Evaluation der Mindestlohnregelungen für Wäschereidienstleistungen im Objektkundengeschäft dargestellt (Bosch et al. 2011a). In Abschn. 2 gehen wir zunächst ausführlicher auf die Genese der Mindestlohnregelungen in der Branche ein. In Abschn. 3 wird ein Überblick zur Entwicklung der Wäschereibranche vor der Einführung der Mindestlohnregelungen gegeben. In Abschn. 4 stehen die Ergebnisse der deskriptiven und qualitativen Untersuchungsteile im Mittelpunkt. In Abschn. 5 fassen wir die zentralen Ergebnisse zusammen und geben einen Ausblick auf weiteren Forschungsbedarf.",

Während das Gesetz zunächst nur das Bauhaupt- und zwei Baunebengewerbe betraf, wurden bis zum Jahre 2010 elf weitere Branchen für jeweils unterschiedliche Geltungszeiträume in das AEntG aufgenommen. Die mit dem AEntG geschaffene Möglichkeit der Einführung branchenspezifischer Mindestlöhne hat eine kontrovers geführte wirtschaftspolitische Diskussion um die möglichen Folgen von Mindestlöhnen entfacht. Die Kontroverse resultiert nicht zuletzt aus den äußerst uneinheitlichen Ergebnissen, zu denen empirische Studien zu Mindestlohnwirkungen gelangen (für einen Überblick siehe z. B. Neumark und Wascher, 2007). Verglichen mit der Vielzahl internationaler Studien gab es zu den Auswirkungen von Mindestlöhnen auf dem deutschen Arbeitsmarkt mit Ausnahme der Studie von König und Möller (2008) lange vergleichsweise wenig empirische Evidenz. Vor diesem Hintergrund hat das Bundesministerium für Arbeit und Soziales (BMAS) die empirische Evaluation der Wirkungen der bestehenden gesetzlichen Mindestlohnregelungen bis zum Herbst 2011 in acht Branchen in Auftrag gegeben. Der folgende Beitrag liefert eine Zusammenfassung der Ergebnisse der Evaluation der Auswirkungen des Mindestlohns in der Abfallwirtschaft, die am Zentrum für Europäische Wirtschaftsforschung (ZEW) in Zusammenarbeit mit dem Institut für angewandte Sozialwissenschaft (infas) durchgeführt wurde. Der Mindestlohn in der Abfallwirtschaft trat per Rechtsverordnung über die Aufnahme der Abfallwirtschaft in das Arbeitnehmerentsendegesetz erstmals zum 1. Januar 2010 in Kraft. Die Einführung des Mindestlohnes wurde bereits seit 2008 zwischen den drei Tarifpartnern der Branche Verdi, dem Bundesverband der Deutschen Entsorgungswirtschaft e.V. (BDE) und der Vereinigung kommunaler Arbeitgeberverbände (VKA) insbesondere vor dem Hintergrund eines erheblichen – vor allem über die Lohnkosten ausgetragenen – Preiswettbewerbs verhandelt. Dabei wurden seitens der Tarifpartner vor allem die niedrigen Entgelte der privaten Entsorgungsunternehmen und der vermehrte Einsatz von Leiharbeitskräften beklagt, deren verstärkter Einsatz vor der Mindestlohneinführung ein wichtiges Instrument zur Kostensenkung darstellte.Footnote 1 Der zwischen den drei Tarifpartnern ausgehandelte Mindestlohntarifvertrag trat schließlich zum 01.01.2010 mit einem flächendeckenden Mindestlohn in Höhe von 8,02 Euro bundesweit in Kraft. Der Mindestlohn lag somit etwas unterhalb der niedrigsten Lohngruppen des vorher gültigen Tarifvertrages TVöD-E für die kommunalen Arbeitgeber, war jedoch deutlich niedriger als die untersten Stundenentgelte des mit dem BDE ausgehandelten Tarifvertrages.Footnote 2 Der Mindestlohn gilt für alle Beschäftigten der Abfallwirtschaft, d.h. auch für Leiharbeitskräfte. Der derzeit aktuelle Mindestlohntarifvertrag hat eine Laufzeit bis zum 31.12.2012 und sieht einen Mindestlohn von 8,33 € pro Stunde vor. Der Mindestlohn in der Abfallwirtschaft wurde in einer Branche eingeführt, die durch eine besondere Wettbewerbssituation auf dem Gütermarkt charakterisiert ist. Die Liberalisierung des Entsorgungsmarktes mit einem möglichen Marktzutritt von privaten Entsorgungsunternehmen wurde 1996 mit dem Kreislaufwirtschafts- und Abfallgesetz (KrW-/AbfG) eingeleitet. Die Liberalisierung betraf primär die Entsorgung gewerblicher Abfälle, während für die Hausmüllentsorgung weiterhin öffentlich-rechtliche Entsorgungsträger verantwortlich sind. Die von den öffentlichen Entsorgungsträgern organisierte Hausmüllentsorgung erfolgt getrennt für einzelne Entsorgungsgebiete und ist durch einen Anspruch der privaten Haushalte auf Entsorgung ihrer Abfälle bei gleichzeitiger Überlassungspflicht der Abfälle und einer Verrechnung der Entsorgungskosten über Gebühren gemäß dem Kostendeckungsprinzip gekennzeichnet. Die Hausmüllentsorgung wird entweder über kommunale Eigenbetriebe oder über öffentliche oder private Unternehmen inkl. öffentlich-privater Gemeinschaftsunternehmen (im Rahmen öffentlicher Ausschreibungen) durchgeführt. Insgesamt sind Teile der Abfallwirtschaft trotz der Liberalisierung der Branche somit weiterhin durch einen eingeschränkten Wettbewerb geprägt. Aufgrund des Kostendeckungsprinzips im öffentlichen Gebührenrecht sowie der Praxis von Preisgleitregelungen können Dienstleister im Bereich der Hausmüllentsorgung ihre Kosten über die Abfallgebühren auf die Abfallerzeuger überwälzen, so dass die Anreize zu Kosteneinsparungen gering sind und es zu einer hohen Varianz der Müllgebühren zwischen den einzelnen Entsorgungsregionen kommt. Der 2010 eingeführte Mindestlohn wirkt zudem in einer Branche, die nicht nur durch eine besondere Wettbewerbssituation auf dem Gütermarkt, sondern darüber hinaus durch eine beträchtliche Heterogenität gekennzeichnet ist. Letztere resultiert nicht nur aus der Koexistenz privater und kommunaler Anbieter, sondern spiegelt ebenfalls eine durch die Vielfalt von Klein- bis Großbetrieben charakterisierte Größenverteilung wider. Diese Heterogenität reflektiert zum Teil die Diversität der Tätigkeitsfelder der Branche, die unterschiedliche Bereiche wie die Abfallsammlung, -beseitigung, die Abfallverwertung (Rückgewinnung/Recycling) sowie die Reinigung von Verkehrsflächen umfassen. Während die Markteintrittsbarrieren aufgrund hoher Kapitalintensität und notwendigem technischen und institutionellen Wissen in Teilen der Abfallwirtschaft als hoch anzusehen sind (z. B. im Bereich des Recyclings), sind andere Tätigkeitsfelder wie z. B. die Straßenreinigung mit deutlich geringeren Markteintrittsbarrieren versehen. Die durch Vereinbarung der Regierungsfraktionen vorgegebenen Zielgrößen der von der Auftragnehmerin durchzuführenden Evaluation waren Beschäftigung, Arbeitnehmerschutz und Wettbewerb. Im Hinblick auf die Wirkungsanalyse beschränkt sich der folgende Beitrag auf die Darstellung der Ergebnisse zur Beschäftigung und zum Arbeitnehmerschutz, da aufgrund der Kürze des Beobachtungszeitraums nach der Mindestlohneinführung im Januar 2010 mit geringen nachweisbaren Effekten auf die Wettbewerbsintensität zu rechnen ist. Grundsätzlich deuten theoretische Überlegungen darauf hin, dass die zu erwartenden Effekte maßgeblich von der Wettbewerbssituation auf dem Arbeits- und Gütermarkt abhängen (vgl. z. B. Borjas, 2010). Eine Beurteilung der Mindestlohnwirkungen in der Abfallwirtschaft setzt somit zunächst eine umfangreiche Analyse der branchenspezifischen Konstellation auf beiden relevanten Märkten voraus. Ein erster Arbeitsschritt der Evaluation bestand daher in der Erstellung eines aktuellen Branchenbildes für die Abfallwirtschaft mit dem Ziel, die Entwicklung der Branche bis zum aktuellen Rand sowie die zugrundeliegenden Konstellationen auf dem Arbeits- und Gütermarkt darzustellen. Der zentrale Bestandteil der Evaluation umfasste die kausale Wirkungsanalyse der Einführung des Mindestlohnes. Die zentrale Leitfrage, die hierbei beantwortet werden sollte, lautete: Wie hat die Mindestlohneinführung die relevanten Zielgrößen verglichen mit einer hypothetischen Situation ohne den Mindestlohn verändert? Diese nicht beobachtbare, kontrafaktische Situation wurde im Rahmen der Evaluation durch zwei verschiedene Kontrollgruppen abgebildet, (1) durch Unternehmen einer nicht vom Mindestlohn betroffenen Branche und (2) durch nicht betroffene Unternehmen der Abfallwirtschaft, die vor der Mindestlohneinführung bereits oberhalb des Mindestlohnes entlohnt haben. Ein Kontrollgruppenansatz innerhalb der Branche hat den Vorteil, dass die Vergleichbarkeit von Treatment- und Kontrollgruppe leichter erfüllt sein sollte. Allerdings sollten bei diesem Evaluationsdesign wegen der erheblichen Heterogenität innerhalb der Branche Treatment- und Kontrollunternehmen nach Möglichkeit aus der gleichen Sparte der Abfallwirtschaft stammen. Da sich aufgrund der Datenlage zur Lohnstruktur bei Projektbeginn a-priori keine Aussagen zur unterschiedlichen Betroffenheit der Unternehmen vom Mindestlohn in den einzelnen Teilbereichen der Branche treffen ließen, wäre die Beschränkung auf einen Kontrollgruppenansatz innerhalb der Branche mit einem Risiko behaftet gewesen. Um diesem Risiko Rechnung zu tragen, hat die Evaluation ebenfalls den alternativen Ansatz unter Verwendung einer Kontrollbranche ohne Mindestlohn verfolgt. Eine zentrale Herausforderung für die Wirkungsanalyse ergab sich aus der zum Evaluationsbeginn vorliegenden Datenlage. Für Messzeitpunkte nach Einführung des Mindestlohns im Jahre 2010 standen innerhalb der Projektlaufzeit kaum amtliche Unternehmens- und Beschäftigtendaten zur Verfügung. Zur Schließung dieser Datenlücke wurde daher eine repräsentative telefonische Befragung bei Unternehmen der Abfallwirtschaft durchgeführt, die für netto 492 Fälle Kennziffern für die Zielgrößen Beschäftigung, Arbeitnehmerschutz und Wettbewerbsfähigkeit erfasst hat. Für die Umsetzung des Kontrollbranchenansatzes wurden zudem netto 260 Unternehmen der ausgewählten Kontrollbranche, des Garten- und Landschaftsbaus, befragt. Damit eine erste Differenz entlang der Zeitachse gebildet werden kann, wurden die entsprechenden Größen nicht nur für den Zeitpunkt der Erhebung, sondern auch retrospektiv erhoben. Der folgende Beitrag ist wie folgt strukturiert. Abschnitt 2 geht detaillierter auf die Umsetzung des Evaluationsauftrages im Hinblick auf die Datenlage und den verwendeten Kontrollgruppenansatz ein. Abschnitt 3 zeichnet die Entwicklung der Abfallwirtschaft sowie der ausgewählten Kontrollbranche bis zum aktuellen Rand, d.h. bis kurz vor der Einführung des Mindestlohnes nach. Abschnitt 4 stellt das quantitative Ausmaß der Betroffenheit der Branche auf Basis der für die Evaluation erhobenen Unternehmensdaten dar. In Abschn. 5 werden die zentralen Hypothesen zu den erwarteten Mindestlohnauswirkungen vor dem Hintergrund der spezifischen Güter- und Arbeitsmarktkonstellation der Branche diskutiert. Abschnitt 6 widmet sich der kausalen Wirkungsanalyse auf die Zielgrößen Beschäftigung und Arbeitnehmerschutz. Abschnitt 7 schließt mit einer Zusammenfassung und einem Ausblick auf potenzielle zukünftige Evaluationsvorhaben.",

46,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,29 August 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-012-0108-8,Explaining age and gender differences in employment rates: a labor supply-side perspective,March 2013,Stephan Humpert,Christian Pfeifer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Empirical observation of most labor markets reveals the lower (re-)employment probability of female and older workers. In Germany, employment rates decline with age after the maximum is reached at prime ages between 30 and 50 years for men and 40 to 50 years for women (see Table 1). It can also be seen that women in all age categories have lower employment rates than men. This employment gap increases with age among younger individuals until the age of 30 to 35 years, declines among middle-aged individuals, and increases again for older individuals after the age of 50. Thus, the disadvantage from which women suffer may emerge during motherhood but is still an evident problem for older women. Non-employment often leads to individual hardship (e.g. lower consumption standards) and is also associated with burdens on society because taxpayers have to finance unemployment benefits or early retirement schemes. In times of demographic change, it is a challenge for policy and human resource management to activate the resources of female and older people in the labor market to maintain a sufficiently large labor supply. Furthermore, demographic change has brought financial problems for public retirement schemes, so that many countries have recently increased the mandatory retirement age (e.g. 65 to 67 years in Germany). It is, however, questionable whether older workers still have the necessary employment skills. Most of the political discussion focuses on labor demand-side factors, i.e. if the productivity of older workers still matches the wages paid, and assumes that old workers still want to work. This assumption might not always be correct. For example, the active participation of workers in early retirement schemes is well-known. In this paper, we explore age and gender differences in labor supply. More specifically, we analyze reservation and entry wages, preferred and actual working hours, and satisfaction with leisure and jobs.  One stream of the literature on economics and industrial relations analyzes the labor demand side to explain age and gender-specific employment gaps (e.g. discrimination, productivity and wages). Another stream looks at the labor supply side. The neoclassical standard textbook model of labor supply and the job search theory both assume that individuals only choose employment over non-employment if the offered wage is larger than the reservation wage. If women and older workers on average suffer a greater difference between reservation wages and offered wages compared with men and younger workers, the employment probability of women and older workers will be lower. For example, age might have a stronger positive effect on reservation wages (e.g. owing to higher preference for leisure) than on offered wages (e.g. owing to depreciation of human capital), which decreases the average employment probability of older workers. For women, one might expect that leisure preferences and reservation wages would increase during motherhood, whereas productivity and, consequently, offered wages are not positively affected. Because of human capital depreciation, employment interruptions may even lead to lower wage offers and therefore hamper the integration of women and especially mothers in the labor market. We use large-scale household panel data from Germany (GSOEP: German Socio-Economic Panel) to analyze average age and gender differences in reservation wages, entry wages as proxy for offered wages, preferred and actual working hours, and leisure and job satisfaction. In the context of reservation wages, we also make a methodological contribution by showing the importance of hourly information. Our analyses focus on the years 2007 and 2008, because these are the only years for which we can compute hourly reservation wages. Previous research has largely used weekly or monthly reservation wages, which are not suitable for analyzing age and gender differences. If, for example, female and older workers prefer to work fewer hours than men and younger workers, their weekly or monthly reservation income is, ceteris paribus, lower. This might even be the case if their hourly reservation wages are larger but not large enough to compensate for fewer working hours. In our empirical analysis, we find that older workers indeed have larger hourly reservation wages but lower monthly reservation wages owing to their preference for working fewer hours. The estimated age effects are greater for women than men. We further find that the presence of children in the household increases reservation wages and reduces the supplied working hours of women, whereas no significant effects are detected for men. Although our econometric analysis is largely descriptive, we find consistent evidence that older workers and mothers have higher preferences for leisure and higher reservation wages, which might explain the observed gaps in employment rates. This paper is structured as follows. The next section summarizes the theoretical background derived from labor supply and job search models as well as previous empirical studies. Section 3 describes the data, variables, and methods. The regression results are presented in Sect. 4. The paper concludes with a summary and discussion of the findings in Sect. 5.",7

Bidisha,Anupam Das,Adian A. McFarlane,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Income inequality has risen in many industrialized countries since the mid-1970s (Brandolini and Smeeding 2009). It is often assumed that such an increase is due to the changes in wage and institutional structures (Corak 2004) and returns to education and skill (Gottschalk and Smeeding 1997; Katz and Autor 1999). These factors may have caused important alterations to the earnings profile over time, with the result that a child in her generation’s earnings distribution could be quite different from that of her parent. Economists have also long argued that parental income plays an important role in determining the potential income of children (Behrman and Taubman 1990). It is therefore an important policy issue to understand the extent to which family background influences the potential income of children and the way earnings patterns have changed over generations. The term intergenerational mobility refers to the relationship between the socio-economic status of parents, particularly income, and the status of children when they become adult (Corak 2004). The issue of generational mobility is very important when considered in the context of immigrants or ethnic minorities. Immigrants often are unable to transfer their education received in their home countries because of discrimination, lack of good networking skills, and language difficulty in the labour market. All these attributes could easily be transmitted to the next generation. As for ethnic minorities, discrimination in the labour market, unobservable features related to skill or earnings (e.g., certain ethnic groups might have comparative advantage over other groups in performing certain tasks), certain cultural and social norms influencing earnings capacity (people of certain ethnic groups might be prejudiced against certain types of education or jobs) may result in differences in the intergenerational mobility from that of the native ethnic group. The issue of intergenerational mobility of ethnic minorities in this aspect could represent the performance of the second generation (non-native) immigrants as opposed to the children of the native population. The growing inequality in recent decades, along with the increased presence of immigrants from different backgrounds and skill mix has made the UK an intriguing case to study. The question that arises is: do immigrants and ethnic minorities show similar generational mobility to that of the native population? While this question is important, research on it is conspicuously deficient. The existing literature tends to focus on the performance of current immigrants and analyzes the intergenerational mobility at a specific point in time. Nevertheless, the economic performance of immigrants can be better understood from a longer-term dimension while analyzing the assimilation of immigrants. Moreover, the issue of equal opportunity in the host country can best be addressed from an intergenerational viewpoint. In a recent study, Dustmann and Theodoropoulos (2010) conclude that ethnic minority immigrants and their children are on average better educated than their native peers although members of the ethnic minorities do not have higher employment probabilities. Using the Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), both Solon (1992) and Zimmermann (1992) provide evidence on the correlation between father’s income and son’s income. In both cases, the estimated coefficient is approximately 0.40. Aydemir et al. (2009) conclude that fathers’ earnings can explain only 18 to 27 percent of the earnings of second generation immigrants in Canada. On the contrary, Borjas (1993) finds a significant positive relationship between the earnings of the first and second generation immigrants in the US. This result is supported by Card et al. (2000) who find a high intergenerational income correlation for immigrants. This magnitude of this correlation lies within the range of 0.40 to 0.60. Research on Britain also indicates similar results. Dearden et al. (1997) use the National Child Development Survey data set and find that the coefficients of parent’s earnings (β) range from 0.40 and 0.60 for men and 0.45 to 0.70 for women. Ermisch and Francesconi (2004) use the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). Their findings suggest that the coefficients for father-child mobility and mother-child mobility range from 0.45 to 0.75 and 0.30 to 0.50 respectively. Nicoletti and Ermisch (2008) have also used the same dataset. They conclude that the intergenerational mobility did not change significantly across cohorts from 1950 to 1960; however, a negative trend in mobility was observed during 1961 to 1971. The existing literature, therefore, suggests a striking difference in intergenerational mobility across countries as well as within countries. From this backdrop, we intend to analyze the issue of intergenerational mobility with particular emphasis on ethnic background and immigration status. To our knowledge, no other study has previously estimated the intergenerational mobility coefficient for different groups for the UK. Hence, our analysis is expected to shed light on the performance of both the first and second generation immigrants and ethnic minorities in Britain. To estimate the intergenerational mobility coefficient, we use the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) dataset within the two-sample two stage least square (TS2SLS) framework. To preview, we find that approximately 33–36 percent of native children’s earnings can be explained by that of their fathers. For immigrants and ethnic minorities (including all non-Caucasian natives and immigrants), we find the mobility coefficient to be significantly different and much smaller in magnitude. Only 13 percent earnings of the children from immigrant families can be explained by that of their fathers’, while the magnitude of the mobility coefficient for ethnic minorities is as low as 0.08. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the theoretical motivation of this research. Section 3 presents the econometric specification. Section 4 discusses the data and methodological issues. Section 5 presents empirical results and Sect. 6 concludes the paper.",1
46,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,07 September 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-012-0109-7,What drives the intention of Bavarian crafts apprentices to change employer or occupation? An empirical study in the crafts sector,March 2013,Robert Wagner,Maximilian Wolf,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In spite of intensive efforts by employers to reduce labour turnover, employees frequently change employer or career (Neal 1999). Jovanovic (1979) argues that workers decide to change jobs in which their productivity is revealed to be low. Assuming establishments pay employees their marginal product, workers move out of jobs if their outside option is better (McLaughlin 1991) or the current wage is low relative to alternative wages (Parsons 1991). Therefore, wages are a key determinant in job changing decisions (e.g. Topel and Ward, 1992; Fitzenberger and Spitz, 2003). However, Freeman (1978) identifies job satisfaction as a driving force behind the decision on future job mobility. Job satisfaction in general and several job satisfaction dimensions significantly influence an employee’s decision on job mobility (Clark, 2001; Kristensen and Westergård-Nielsen, 2004) as well as the intention for job mobility (Shields and Price, 2002; Delfgaauw, 2007; Böckerman and Ilmakunnas, 2009). This means that, even if employers face a shortage of skilled labour, they cannot prevent labour turnover if employees are dissatisfied. All studies analysing the effects of pecuniary as well as non-pecuniary job factors on job mobility focus on the labour market in general. As far as we know, the effect of job related factors on the intention of crafts apprentices in Germany to change employer or occupation after apprenticeship training has not yet been analysed. Low job satisfaction during apprenticeship training could be one reason for the low retention rate of around 30 % in the German crafts sector after apprenticeship graduation (Harhoff and Kane, 1997; Büchel and Neubäumer, 2001). On average, establishments from the crafts sector pursue a productivity orientated training strategy and invest less in training than establishments from other sectors (Mohrenweiser and Backes-Gellner, 2008; Mohrenweiser and Zwick, 2009). Low investment in training decreases training quality (Soskice 1994), reduces apprentices’ job satisfaction and increases involuntary labour turnover. In the German crafts sector, involuntary labour turnover leads to a lack of skilled workers (Haverkamp et al. 2009). In this paper, we analyse which job related factors affect the intention of crafts apprentices to change employer or occupation after finishing apprenticeship training. In contrast to previous studies, we do not just estimate the intention for worker-initiated job mobility—we simultaneously estimate whether apprenticeship graduates intend to change employer or occupation. Applying a multinomial logit model, we show that occupational enjoyment, job security and regional proximity to the current employer are the most important factors that affect the intention to change employer or occupation. We use a new data set containing unique information about future career plans and job related factors driving the intention of apprentices to change employer or occupation in the crafts sector. Our analysis contributes to the previous literature on job mobility by focusing on the specific group of German apprentices in the crafts sector. Furthermore, we test a broader set of job related factors that affect the intention to change employer or occupation than previous studies. Our results have practical implications for several institutions in the Bavarian crafts sector.Footnote 1 First of all, the analysis of job related factors for apprentices allows training establishments to develop systematic strategies to retain a higher proportion of apprenticeship graduates (e.g. initial screening of new apprentices). Second, organizations such as chambers (Handwerkskammer) that are responsible for the execution of apprenticeship training in the crafts sector can make use of the findings in order to adapt the dual apprenticeship systems to the needs of juveniles. Third, policy makers and the German Confederation of Skilled Crafts (Zentralverband des Deutschen Handwerks) can tackle the lack of skilled labour by enhancing the image of the crafts sector based on our results. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the most important literature on job satisfaction and job mobility. In Sect. 3, we provide an overview of the data set before analysing the connection between job related factors and job mobility in the next sections, using a multinomial logit model. After discussing the results, Sect. 6 summarizes the most important findings and provides a conclusion.",2

Wurde einst der frühe Ausstieg aus der Erwerbsarbeit und ihren Belastungen von der Mehrheit der Gesellschaft als sozialer Fortschritt und Beitrag zur Humanisierung des Arbeitslebens angesehen, bestimmt heute zunehmend das Leitbild des „aktiven Alterns“ – die möglichst lange Teilhabe am Arbeitsleben, das sinnvolle Tätigsein, Gebrauchtwerden und Dazugehören bis ins hohe Alter – die Vorstellungen vom guten, gesunden und menschengerechten Altern. Waren Ältere vormals aufgefordert, ihre Arbeitsplätze möglichst frühzeitig für Jüngere zu räumen und den Arbeitsmarkt durch ihren Rückzug ‚sozialverträglich‘ zu entlasten, werden sie nun nach weit verbreiteter Einschätzung zumindest in längerfristiger Perspektive dringend gebraucht, weil sie einen immer größeren Teil der Erwerbsbevölkerung und der Belegschaften stellen und jüngere Nachwuchskräfte knapper werden (kritisch dazu u.a. Roberts 2006, S. 69–71). Während lange Zeit das Defizitmodell des Alters die gesellschaftliche Sichtweise auf die Älteren prägte und insbesondere die betriebliche Personalpolitik bestimmte, formt nun in wachsendem Maße das (ebenfalls einseitige und vereinfachende) Bild der „jungen Alten“ die gesellschaftliche Wahrnehmung sowie den politischen (weniger oft noch den betrieblichen) Umgang mit dieser Gruppe (van Dyk und Lessenich 2009): „Es sind die jungen, aktiven, geistig mobilen, kontaktreichen, kommunikativen, gesunden, körperlich fitten und sportlichen, mitunter auch politisch aufmüpfigen Alten (…)“ (Dieck und Naegele 1993, S. 43), deren Erfahrungswissen und Fähigkeiten für Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft unverzichtbar seien. Verfolgte die Politik bei der Steuerung des Altersübergangs vor allem in den 1980er Jahren primär das arbeitsmarktpolitische Ziel der Verringerung des Arbeitsangebots, stehen spätestens seit Mitte der 1990er Jahre die bedeutenden Finanzierungsprobleme der sozialen Sicherungssysteme im Vordergrund, welche zunächst aus der enormen Zunahme von Frühverrentungen und der hohen Arbeitslosigkeit nach der Wiedervereinigung resultierten, sich in Zukunft aber mehr und mehr (auch) aus der gesellschaftlichen Alterung ergeben werden. So erscheint es weiten Teilen der Politik und der Wissenschaft als unabdingbar, dass die Älteren einen Teil ihrer hinzugewonnenen gesunden Lebensjahre für eine längere Erwerbsbeteiligung nutzen und damit ihren Beitrag zur Entlastung der sozialen Sicherungssysteme leisten. Entsprechend wurden die Weichen in der Sozial- und Arbeitsmarktpolitik inzwischen längst in Richtung einer längeren Lebensarbeitszeit gestellt: Rascher und umfassender als in vielen anderen europäischen Ländern wurden in Deutschland seit Anfang der 1990er Jahre die Möglichkeiten eines sozial abgesicherten vorzeitigen Übergangs in den Ruhestand schrittweise beschnitten (Kraatz et al. 2006) und so der frühzeitige Ausstieg für Betriebe und vor allem die Älteren selbst erheblich verteuert. Ein beträchtlicher Teil der älteren Arbeitnehmer hat auf die veränderten Rahmenbedingungen reagiert und bleibt nun länger im Beruf, um hohe Rentenabschläge zu vermeiden; dazu zählen insbesondere Ältere in Berufen mit vergleichsweise gemäßigten Arbeitsbelastungen. Für andere führt die Politik der Lebensarbeitszeitverlängerung jedoch zu längeren und prekäreren Statuspassagen vom Erwerbsleben in den Rentenbezug, verbunden mit erheblichen Einbußen bei der gesetzlichen Rente (Brussig 2010a, S. 6, 8, 13 f.; Brussig 2010b; Brussig und Wojtkowski 2007, S. 12; Jabsen und Buchholz 2009, S. 18, 25; Mika und Baumann 2008; Motel-Klingebiel und Engstler 2008; Trischler und Kistler 2010a, S. 29–32; Trischler und Kistler 2010b). Betroffen davon sind vor allem ältere Arbeitslose – darunter wiederum überproportional viele Geringqualifizierte mit vormals gesundheitlich belastenden beruflichen Tätigkeiten –, denn ihre Reintegrationschancen in Arbeit haben sich auch unter dem Vorzeichen der neuen Aktivierungspolitik nicht grundlegend verbessert und ihr Risiko eines langen Verbleibs in Arbeitslosigkeit ist nach wie vor besonders hoch (Statistik der Bundesagentur für Arbeit 2011, S. 35 f.; zur altersspezifischen Verweildauer im Arbeitslosengeld-II-Bezug: Statistik der Bundesagentur für Arbeit 2010, S. 12, 15 f.; siehe auch Brussig 2011; Walwei 2010, S. 422 f.). Die offensichtlichen Grenzen einer Aktivierung und beruflichen Eingliederung dieser Gruppe manifestieren sich in einem politischen Zugeständnis, das von 1986 bis Ende 2007 überdauerte: Bezieher von Arbeitslosengeld, Arbeitslosenhilfe oder Arbeitslosengeld II ab dem Alter von 58 Jahren konnten in diesem Zeitraum für den so genannten „Leistungsbezug unter erleichterten Voraussetzungen“ (ELB) nach Paragraph 428 Sozialgesetzbuch (SGB) III optieren: Sie konnten erklären, dass sie keine Arbeit mehr aufnehmen wollten, und waren dann von der Verpflichtung zur Arbeitssuche befreit. Da sie nicht mehr als arbeitslos galten, blieben ihnen arbeitsmarktpolitische Maßnahmen, die diesen Status voraussetzten, verschlossen. Zudem mussten sie in Altersrente wechseln, sobald sie einen Anspruch auf eine abschlagsfreie Rente erlangt hatten. Weitere Auflagen oder Einschränkungen gab es für die betroffenen älteren Leistungsbezieher nicht. In den letzten Jahren vor dem Auslaufen der Regelung des Paragraphen 428 SGB III nutzte jeweils eine große Mehrheit der Anspruchsberechtigten diese Ausstiegsoption.Footnote 1 Vor dem Hintergrund der politischen Bemühungen um eine stärkere Teilhabe Älterer am Arbeitsleben und der veränderten gesellschaftlichen Verhaltenserwartungen ihnen gegenüber beschäftigt sich dieser Beitrag mit den Beweggründen für den Rückzug vom Arbeitsmarkt: Präferierten die meisten Betroffenen Freizeit gegenüber der Erwerbsarbeit, weil ihnen Transferzahlungen während der Arbeitslosigkeit und der nahende Renteneintritt eine finanziell akzeptable Alternative zum Angebot ihrer Arbeitskraft zum Marktlohnsatz boten? Oder sah die überwiegende Zahl der Älteren für sich keine Chance mehr auf dem Arbeitsmarkt und zog sich aus Resignation und Perspektivlosigkeit zurück? Aus den Antworten auf diese Fragen ergeben sich jeweils spezifische Folgerungen für die Arbeitsmarktpolitik gegenüber Älteren. Aus methodischer Sicht bietet die Untersuchung der Erwerbsorientierung älterer Arbeitsloser anhand der Institution des ELB einen besonderen Vorteil. So dürften arbeitslose Bezieher von Transferleistungen, die dem Arbeitsmarkt zur Verfügung stehen müssen, bei Fragen nach ihrer Erwerbsneigung, Konzessionsbereitschaft und Suchaktivitäten in hohem Maße zu sozial erwünschten Antworten tendieren (siehe Krumpal und Näher 2012). Solche Verzerrungen sind hingegen bei denjenigen Leistungsbeziehern, denen der Gesetzgeber explizit das Recht eingeräumt hat, nicht mehr arbeiten zu wollen, in geringerem Maße zu erwarten. Indizien dafür liefern die Ergebnisse einer zusätzlichen Auswertung der für diese Untersuchung verwendeten Befragungsdaten. Dazu wurden die ab 58-jährigen ELB-Berechtigten (Nutzer und Nichtnutzer des ELB) mit 56- und 57-jährigen Leistungsbeziehern ohne Anspruch auf den ELB verglichen – in Hinblick auf die Arbeitssuche in den letzten vier Wochen vor dem Interview, die Gründe für unterlassene Arbeitssuche und die Motive für die Kontaktaufnahme mit dem Jobcenter. Insgesamt zeigte sich in der Gruppe der Befragten mit legaler Vorruhestandsoption ein höherer Anteil an Personen, die signalisierten, eine Rückkehr in das Erwerbsleben nicht mehr anzustreben. Dieses Ergebnis hatte auch unter Kontrolle zusätzlicher soziodemographischer, -ökonomischer und erwerbsbiographischer Faktoren Bestand. Daher ist anzunehmen, dass die im Folgenden ausgewerteten Aussagen häufiger als bei älteren Arbeitslosen ohne ELB-Option die tatsächlichen handlungsrelevanten Motive der Betroffenen und seltener lediglich gesellschaftliche Erwartungen widerspiegeln. Dennoch ist auch in der Untersuchungsgruppe mit Verzerrungen zu rechnen: Zum einen dürfte ein Teil der Befragten trotz der legalen Ausstiegsmöglichkeit ihre Arbeitsunwilligkeit als sozial unangemessen empfunden und daher nicht berichtet haben; denn im Zuge der öffentlichen Debatte um die Folgen des demographischen Wandels hat der frühzeitige Ruhestand an gesellschaftlicher Legitimität eingebüßt (siehe u.a. van Dyk und Lessenich 2009). Zum anderen beruhen die hier vorgestellten Analysen auf einer Querschnittbefragung, in der die Beweggründe für die Wahl des ELB retrospektiv erfragt wurden. Da somit Ursache und Wirkung nicht in ihrer tatsächlichen zeitlichen Reihenfolge getrennt voneinander erhoben wurden, wie dies bei Panelstudien möglich ist, bleibt unklar, in welchem Ausmaß die berichteten Handlungsmotive nachträgliche Rechtfertigungsversuche der Befragten für ein als sozial unerwünscht angesehenes Verhalten (post-hoc-Rationalisierung) oder deren tatsächliche Entscheidungsgründe abbilden (siehe auch Auspurg 2010, S. 17). Der Beitrag untersucht die Rückzugsgründe auf Basis von Befragungsdaten, die zwischen 2005 und 2006 durch quantitative Interviews mit Beziehern des Arbeitslosengelds II gewonnen wurden. Daher beschränkt sich die empirische Analyse auf eine Teilgruppe der Adressaten des ELB: die meist langzeitarbeitslosen Älteren in der Grundsicherung für Arbeitsuchende. Im Vergleich zu den älteren Arbeitslosen insgesamt kennzeichnet diese Gruppe ein besonders hoher ökonomischer Druck zur Aufnahme einer Arbeit, da die Betroffenen etwaige Ersparnisse bis auf Freigrenzen auflösen mussten, sie während des Hilfebezugs nur sehr geringe Anwartschaften in der gesetzlichen Rentenversicherung erwerben und für den aktuellen Lebensunterhalt lediglich das soziokulturelle Existenzminimum zur Verfügung haben. Zudem kann vermutet werden, dass die hier untersuchten Erwerbslosen ihren Arbeitsplatz nicht im Rahmen einer betrieblichen Vorruhestandsregelung aufgegeben haben, denn diese Vereinbarungen basieren typischerweise auf einer lückenlosen Abfolge von Beschäftigung, Bezug von Arbeitslosengeld und Rentenbezug. Daher dürfte die Ruhestandsorientierung von älteren Beziehern des Arbeitslosengelds II schwächer ausgeprägt sein als die der älteren Arbeitslosen insgesamt. Dieser höhere Erwerbsdruck trifft jedoch zusammen mit deutlich schlechteren Beschäftigungsaussichten aufgrund langer Erwerbslosigkeitsdauern und vielfach weiterer vermittlungshemmender Merkmale. Für die aktivierende Arbeitsmarktpolitik handelt es sich deshalb um eine besonders schwierige Gruppe. Im Folgenden werden zunächst die möglichen Gründe für die starke Inanspruchnahme des ELB aus der Perspektive der mikroökonomischen Arbeitsangebotstheorien einerseits und der psychologisch-soziologischen Arbeitslosigkeitsforschung andererseits diskutiert (Abschn. 2). Nach der Vorstellung der verwendeten Daten und der Untersuchungsgruppe (Abschn. 3.1) werden die aus den Theorien abgeleiteten Hypothesen zunächst anhand der von den Älteren selbst berichteten Motive überprüft (Abschn. 3.2). Diese subjektiven Befunde werden ergänzt durch eine logistische Regressionsanalyse der sozioökonomischen Einflussgrößen auf die Wahl des ELB (Abschn. 3.3). Der letzte Abschnitt fasst die wichtigsten Ergebnisse zusammen und zieht Schlussfolgerungen (Abschn. 4).",3

It is, however, less known how the amount of time spent on housework activities affects workers’ wages. If housework has a negative impact on wages, the gender difference in time spent on housework activities may contribute to explaining the gender pay gap. There is a growing empirical literature documenting that hours spent on housework activities adversely affect workers’ wages which also finds the effect to be more pronounced for women than for men and to differ according to marital status. More recent contributions also report a different impact of housework on wages for part-time and full-time workers and that the effect varies for different types of housework activities and is particularly strong for daily routine housework (for a recent survey of the literature, see Maani and Cruickshank 2010). While there has been considerable research on the impact of housework on wages using U.S. data, some studies have also looked at other Anglo-Saxon countries, such as the UK, Australia, and Canada. Yet, to our knowledge only three studies exist for continental European economies that differ much in their labour market institutions compared to Anglo-Saxon economies. Moreover, in continental European countries like Italy or Germany women show a much lower labour market attachment and thus the housework–wage relationship may differ here, too. What is more, the German case seems to be of particular interest given the persistent differences between the East and the West German labour markets: While labour market participation of East German women is found to be significantly higher than for West German women (e.g., Hanel and Riphahn 2011), there is also ample evidence that the gender pay gap is lower in East Germany (e.g., Hunt 2002; Maier 2007). What is more, there is evidence that (1) East German women value employment considerably higher and commit themselves more to paid work than West German women (Adler and Brayfield 1997), (2) part-time work is less widespread and accepted and time allocation to household activities is less gendered in East than in West Germany (Bauer et al. 1996), and (3) prejudices against female employment are less pronounced among East Germans (Lee et al. 2007). These observations seem to still reflect to some extent the entirely different policies with respect to female employment in the former German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany documented in Bauer et al. (1996). Given these profound differences, investigating the effect of housework on wages separately for East and West Germany may also shed some light on the different gender pay gaps in both parts of Germany. The current paper is intended to add to the literature by systematically investigating the effect of time spent on housework on individuals’ wages for Germany making use of two different data sources: the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) and the German Time Use Survey (GTUS). By using two different data sets, by investigating the effect of housework on wages for part-time and full-time working as well as married and single individuals, and by providing separate estimates for East and West Germany, we improve in several ways on earlier work by Anger and Kottwitz (2009) who use GSEOP data and constrain their analysis to full-time working, married individuals and who also pool West and East German observations. In contrast to Anger and Kottwitz (2009) and most of the international literature, running FE (where possible) or OLS wage regressions we find no significant (neither in the economic nor in the statistical sense), adverse effect of housework on individuals’ wages for any of the subgroups considered. This also does not change when instrumenting housework in the wage regressions to alleviate endogeneity concerns. Since endogeneity of housework in the wage regression is likely to bias the coefficient of housework downwards, we conclude that we find robust evidence against a negative impact of housework on wages for German workers. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the existing theoretical and empirical literature on the housework–wage nexus and derives our hypotheses. Section 3 presents our econometric specification. Our data are described in Sect. 4. Section 5 presents and discusses the results of our econometric analysis, and Sect. 6 concludes.",
46,2,Journal for Labour Market Research,05 February 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-013-0127-0,The impact of temporary employment and employment protection on labour productivity: evidence from an industry-level panel of EU countries,August 2013,Domenico Lisi,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Despite the international differences in the relative importance of temporary employment (TE), it is evident that in the last decades temporary jobs have been becoming an important feature of the labour market landscape in the majority of OECD countries. In particular, the share of TE in most EU countries has grown dramatically, both in the form of fixed-term contracts (FTC) and temporary work agencies (TWA), raising the question of the possible effects of this structural change in the labour market. In the different experiences of EU countries a considerable number of country-specific factors have been playing an important role in determining this change. Nonetheless, as emphasized by a growing literature, some common determinants appear to have been crucial in shaping this feature. In particular, the high employment protection (EPL) for permanent employment (PE) along with a less stringent regulation for TE would seem to be the main explanation of the rapid growth of TE in EU countries. Similarly, the low protection for PE in the United States, the United Kingdom and other countries would explain the low use of TE made by employers. The new scenario has raised concern over the potential increase of the dualism in the labour market between high protected workers finding a stable job and those low protected remaining in the trap of precariousness, with little prospect of upward mobility. Moreover, temporary contracts frequently offer less access to the welfare system and other fringe benefits, as unemployment insurance, sick leave, paid vacations (see Appendix 3, Table 12). Indeed, this dualism would represent an undesirable difference between the welfare conditions of these two worker types in the society. From an efficiency point of view, the increasing share of TE raises the question of what would be the impact on labour productivity. This issue would have potentially very important policy implications, especially since in the last twenty years labour productivity growth accounted for more than half of GDP growth in OECD countries (OECD 2003). The theoretical literature available so far has not established a clear prediction on the sign of the effect of TE, existing different convincing reasons for both directions. On one hand, TE is disproportionally filled by younger and less educated workers, and temporary workers often have less access to training programmes (OECD 2002 and 2007a). Moreover, given the temporary, and frequently short, duration of contracts it would be rationale for a firm to fix a lower reservation productivity under which to layoff temporary workers than permanent ones, in order to avoid the direct and indirect firing costs (Lisi 2012). On the other hand, TE allows firms a much more flexible and efficient organization of resources and, in turn, eliminates the disincentive to invest in risky, but potentially valuable, projects (Engellandt and Riphahn 2004). Moreover, it might be rationale for temporary workers to exert a greater effort in order to get the renewal of the contract and/or the passage to a stable job (Dolado and Stucchi 2008). Therefore, the issue of the direction of the effect remains an empirical question. Similarly, while the literature has already offered a convincing answer to the issue of the role of EPL for PE on employment level, the theoretical literature available so far has not fully clarified what is the impact on labour productivity. Indeed, this question has been already the object of interest of few empirical studies, some of which succeed in identifying the negative impact of EPL for permanent contracts (e.g. Bassanini et al. 2009). However, the strategy to identify the impact of TE does not seem to be as satisfactory as that for PE. Nonetheless, to these studies has to be acknowledged the merit to have introduced an identification strategy more satisfactory than the previous standard cross-country analysis. Following this new empirical literature, the aim of this paper is to shed light on this issue by assessing the impact of both EPL for PE and TE (both FTC and TWA) on labour productivity growth. To the extent that the level of TE and EPL affects firms decision on investment and, in turn, the level of capital affects labour productivity growth, we estimate a reduced form model to capture the overall effect, assuming a Cobb-Douglas production function with constant returns to scale. The empirical strategy follows a diff-in-diff approach introduced in the finance literature by Rajan and Zingales (1998) and later extended in other areas in economics. In the field, Micco and Pagés (2006) and Bassanini and Venn (2007) introduced this approach to evaluate the impact of different labour market policies. The method exploits both cross-country variation in EPL for PE and TE and variation in the relevance of EPL in different industries deriving from a particular diff-in-diff assumption. However, differently from the previous literature we apply this idea of the different binding of EPL across industries only for permanent employment, whereas we implement a different strategy for TE. In fact, as will be argued ahead in the paper, the use of the variation in the EPL index for TE does not seem a proper approach to identify the impact of TE. Differently, it would seem more appropriate to use directly the variation in the share of TE. In this way we should be able to isolate the impact of TE on labour productivity growth, without passing through the relation between the change in the EPL for TE and actual use of temporary contracts in the labour market. Moreover, to the extent that the share of TE might be endogenous and, in particular, driven by the same unobservable factors driving labour productivity, we perform an IV-estimate to check the robustness of our findings. To this extent, our more accurate identification of the effect of the use of TE on labour productivity should represent a valid contribution to the literature. The main result is that TE has a negative impact on labour productivity growth, even if small in magnitude. In particular, an increase of 10 percentage points of the share of TE would lead to a decrease of about 2–3 % in labour productivity. Furthermore, the analysis confirms the findings of the previous literature that EPL for regular contracts reduce labour productivity growth more in those industries requiring for their own characteristics a greater employment reallocation. The paper proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 introduces the main stylized facts about labour market regulation and, in particular, TE in EU countries. Then, Sect. 3 reviews briefly the previous literature and discusses some theoretical issues. Section 4 illustrates the identification strategy and introduces the main features of the dataset. Later on, Sect. 5 presents the results of the analysis and examines the robustness of our findings. In conclusion, Sect. 6 discusses the policy implications and some final remarks.",9

Diese Einschätzung zielt zunächst auf das gesetzliche Rentenversicherungssystem als obligatorische und wichtigste Komponente der Alterssicherung, lässt sich aber auch auf die freiwillige betriebliche und private Ebene der Alterssicherung beziehen. Die Leistungen der gesetzlichen Rentenversicherung (GRV) beruhen auf dem sogenannten Äquivalenzprinzip, d.h. der ausgezahlte Betrag ist abhängig vom versicherungspflichtigen Arbeitseinkommen im gesamten Erwerbsverlauf der Person. Diese Erwerbszentrierung des Alterssicherungssystems führt dazu, dass unbezahlte Tätigkeiten, wie die Erziehung von Kindern, nur für eine vergleichsweise kurze Zeit kompensiert werden und dass sich das Lebenszeiteinkommen stark in der Höhe der Alterssicherung niederschlägt (Rake 1999). Aber auch in der betrieblichen Alterssicherung, die ebenfalls eng an die Erwerbstätigkeit geknüpft ist, und in der privaten Alterssicherung, die vor allem von der Höhe des verfügbaren Einkommens abhängt, erwerben Frauen deutlich niedrigere Ansprüche (Heien et al. 2007). Angesichts der niedrigen eigenständigen Rentenansprüche von Frauen vor allem in Westdeutschland kommt ihrer Absicherung im Haushaltskontext und über sogenannte abgeleitete Rentenansprüche eine wichtige Rolle bei der Vermeidung von Altersarmut zu.Footnote 1 Aufgrund ihrer Kosten wie ihrer Verteilungs- und Anreizwirkungen werden abgeleitete Renten allerdings zunehmend kritisiert (Klammer 2005). Außerdem führen verschiedene gesellschaftliche Veränderungen, wie die hohe Zahl von Ehescheidungen sowie der steigende Anteil nicht-ehelicher Lebensgemeinschaften, dazu, dass eine eigenständige Alterssicherung für Frauen immer wichtiger wird (Stegmann 2003). Aufgrund des kontinuierlichen Anstiegs der Frauenerwerbstätigkeit seit dem Ende des zweiten Weltkriegs scheint eine auskömmliche eigenständige Absicherung von Frauen zunehmend erreichbarer (Allmendinger et al. 2008). Es gibt allerdings weiterhin zahlreiche Ungleichheiten zwischen Männer- und Frauen-Erwerbsbiografien. So weisen Frauen instabilere Karriereverläufe auf (Falk 2005) und sie verdienen – auch in vergleichbaren Jobs und Firmen vergleichbarer Größe – deutlich weniger als Männer (Achatz et al. 2005; Hinz und Gartner 2005). Frauen unterbrechen ihre Erwerbstätigkeit häufiger wegen der Geburt und Erziehung von Kindern und der Pflege hilfsbedürftiger Angehöriger und sind nach Erwerbsunterbrechungen öfter von Phasen der Nicht-Erwerbstätigkeit betroffen (Drobnič et al. 1999; Bender et al. 2000). In Deutschland führen Negativanreize durch das Ehegattensplitting und eine im internationalen Vergleich vergleichsweise großzügige Familienpolitik außerdem dazu, dass insbesondere verheiratete westdeutsche Frauen dem Arbeitsmarkt entweder gänzlich fernbleiben oder in Teilzeit bzw. geringfügiger Beschäftigung arbeiten (Thenner 2000). In jüngeren Kohorten ist in Westdeutschland ein abnehmender Anteil an Hausfrauen-Biografien zu erkennen, dafür nehmen diskontinuierliche und Teilzeit-Erwerbsbiografien zu (Simonson et al. 2011). All diese Faktoren tragen dazu bei, dass eine Vielzahl von Frauen keine dem Leitbild der deutschen Sozialversicherung entsprechende, kontinuierliche Vollzeiterwerbsbiografie mit zumindest durchschnittlichem Einkommen aufweist (Allmendinger et al. 1991). Erwerbsbiografien, die diesem Leitbild nicht entsprechen, führen zu geringen eigenständigen gesetzlichen Rentenansprüchen (Rasner 2006). Auch die betriebliche Altersversorgung sowie die private Vorsorge sind eng an die Erwerbstätigkeit gebunden bzw. hängen von der Sparfähigkeit ab. Die unterschiedlichen Erwerbsverläufe führen daher zu einer Lücke zwischen der Alterssicherung von Männern und Frauen, die – in Anlehnung an Einkommensunterschiede zwischen den Geschlechtern – als Gender Pension Gap bezeichnet wird. Es ist ein erklärtes Ziel europäischer Politik, Alterssicherungssysteme an die veränderten sozialen und ökonomischen Rollen von Männern und Frauen anzupassen sowie die Vereinbarkeit von Beruf und Familie zu fördern (European Commission 2003, 2012). In Deutschland sind im gesetzlichen Rentenversicherungssystem in den letzten Jahrzehnten kompensatorische Leistungen für Kindererziehungszeiten ausgebaut worden, obwohl Reformen insgesamt auf einen Rückbau der Sicherungsleistungen zielten. Gleichzeitig haben sich auch im Bereich der betrieblichen und privaten Altersvorsorge Veränderungen ergeben, die geschlechtsspezifische Auswirkungen auf die Alterssicherung haben. Die Frage ist, wie sich diese Maßnahmen auf den Gender Pension Gap in den verschiedenen Säulen des Alterssicherungssystems auswirken. Insbesondere die Rolle betrieblicher Altersversorgung sowie der staatlichen Förderung privater Zusatzversicherungen für Ungleichheiten in der Alterssicherung von Männern und Frauen ist bisher wenig erforscht, da geschlechtsspezifische Daten über die betriebliche und private Altersvorsorge in vielen Ländern, so auch in Deutschland, noch wenig vorhanden sind. Die vorliegende Studie will hier in verschiedener Hinsicht einen Beitrag leisten: Auf der Basis von Daten, die sowohl detaillierte Informationen über Erwerbsbiografien als auch über Anwartschaften auf den verschiedenen Ebenen der gesetzlichen, betrieblichen und privaten Alterssicherung bieten, können bisherige Studien ergänzt werden, die sich vor allem mit der gesetzlichen Alterssicherung von Männern und Frauen beschäftigen bzw. wenige Längsschnittinformationen über den gesamten Lebensverlauf zur Verfügung haben. Wir untersuchen zunächst den Einfluss rentenrechtlicher Regelungen auf den Gender Pension Gap in zwei Kohorten, indem die gesetzlichen Renten aus eigener Beschäftigung den gesamten gesetzlichen Renten gegenübergestellt werden, die darüber hinaus Kompensationen, beispielsweise für Kindererziehungszeiten oder Arbeitslosigkeit, enthalten. Ferner analysieren wir den Einfluss weiterer Sicherungssysteme auf den Gender Pension Gap, indem wir die gesetzlichen Renteneinkünfte mit den gesamten Alterseinkünften, einschließlich der betrieblichen und privaten Altersvorsorge, vergleichen. Um verschiedene biografische Einflussfaktoren auf den Gender Pension Gap näher zu beleuchten, werden im Folgenden zweiten Abschnitt zunächst theoretische Überlegungen sowie institutionelle Rahmenbedingungen in Deutschland vorgestellt. Im dritten Abschnitt werden die Ergebnisse bisheriger Untersuchungen dargestellt. Im Anschluss werden im vierten Abschnitt die Daten und die methodische Herangehensweise der vorliegenden Studie erläutert bevor im fünften und sechsten Abschnitt die empirischen Ergebnisse vorgestellt und schließlich diskutiert werden.",17

Angesichts des prognostizierten Anstiegs des Altenquotienten von 34 in 2008 auf etwa 52 im Jahr 2030 (Statistisches Bundesamt 2009a, S. 39ff.) sind Erhöhungen der Beitragssätze oder Absenkungen der Leistungsniveaus zur Sicherstellung der langfristigen Finanzierbarkeit der umlagefinanzierten Sozialversicherungen unumgänglich. Neben seinen Konsequenzen für die sozialen Sicherungssysteme wird der demografische Wandel sich allerdings auch direkt auf die Unternehmen auswirken und insbesondere deren Personalpolitik vor neue Herausforderungen stellen. Zählten im Jahr 2009 noch 43 Millionen Menschen zu den Erwerbspersonen (Statistisches Bundesamt 2011b), so wird diese Zahl je nach zugrunde gelegten Annahmen zur Bevölkerungsentwicklung und Erwerbsbeteiligung bis zum Jahr 2030 auf 37 bis 41 Millionen Personen zurückgehen.Footnote 1 Dieser Rückgang hat zum einen zur Konsequenz, dass zukünftig bis zu einem Drittel des jährlichen Produktivitätszuwachses allein dafür benötigt wird, das Bruttoinlandsprodukt je Einwohner auf dem heutigen Niveau aufrecht zu erhalten (Börsch-Supan 2003, S. 13). Zum anderen bedeutet diese Entwicklung allerdings auch, dass sich der Wettbewerb um qualifizierte Arbeitnehmer zukünftig weiter verschärfen wird. Anknüpfend an bereits existierende Arbeiten werden im vorliegenden Beitrag verschiedene Szenarien zur zukünftigen Entwicklung der Anzahl der Erwerbspersonen und des Arbeitszeitvolumens betrachtet, um auf dieser Basis Politikempfehlungen dahingehend abzuleiten, welche Weichenstellungen in den kommenden Jahren zu treffen sind, um dem demografisch bedingten Arbeitskräfterückgang zu begegnen. Mittels der von Burniaux et al. (2004, S. 27ff.) entwickelten und von der Europäischen Kommission (2006, S. 175ff.) verfeinerten Kohorten-Komponenten-Methode wird hierzu zunächst ein Szenario modelliert, welches neben der Berücksichtigung der Bevölkerungsentwicklung auch die beobachtbare kohorten- und geschlechtsspezifische Dynamik bei der Erwerbsbeteiligung erfasst.Footnote 2 Aufbauend darauf werden dann verschiedene Szenarien modelliert: Neben einer Abschätzung der Erwerbspersonenzahl bei einer Erhöhung des effektiven Renteneintrittsalters werden die Konsequenzen eines früheren Erwerbseintritts, einer steigenden Erwerbsbeteiligung der über 60-Jährigen, einer verstärkten Erwerbsbeteiligung von Menschen mit Migrationshintergrund sowie einer erhöhten Erwerbsbeteiligung der Frauen untersucht. Neben der Zahl der Erwerbspersonen (extensives Arbeitsangebot) wird das zukünftige Arbeitsvolumen auch von der von der Arbeitszeit je Erwerbstätigen (intensives Arbeitsangebot) und der Erwerbslosenquote beeinflusst. Daher werden aufbauend auf der Erwerbspersonenprojektion im vorliegenden Beitrag auch die Auswirkungen des demografischen Wandels auf die zukünftige Entwicklung des Arbeitszeitvolumens untersucht. Als mögliche Szenarien zur Sicherung des Arbeitskräftepotentials werden dabei eine Verringerung der Erwerbslosenquote sowie eine Erhöhung der Arbeitszeit über eine Verringerung der Teilzeitbeschäftigung als auch über eine Ausweitung der Arbeitszeit für Teilzeitbeschäftigte betrachtet. Abschließend werden diese Arbeitszeitszenarien dann mit Hinblick auf die Entwicklung des Bruttoinlandsprodukts je Einwohner bei unterstellter konstanter Produktivität beleuchtet. So kann gezeigt werden, in welcher Höhe zukünftige Produktivitätszuwächse zur Absicherung des Wohlstandsniveaus von heute nötig sind. Im Weiteren ist der vorliegende Beitrag wie folgt gegliedert: Abschn. 2.1 gibt einen Überblick über das Referenzszenario der Demografie, das dieser Arbeit zugrunde liegt. Abschnitt 2.2 stellt die Ausgangsdaten sowie das Projektionsmodell vor, dessen Ergebnisse und Modifikationen in Abschn. 3 diskutiert werden. Aufbauend darauf wird in Abschn. 4 der Einfluss einer erhöhten Jahresarbeitszeit sowie die damit implizierte Entwicklung des Bruttoinlandsprodukts je Einwohner bei konstanter Produktivität berechnet. Abschnitt 5 schließt mit einem Fazit.",8

Autor,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The canonical production function found in economic models is anthropomorphic—it’s built to resemble humans. It features a role for labor and a role for machinery (capital), and, in general, these roles are distinct. This is not illogical—after all, these are separate inputs. But what precisely is distinctive about the role of each input is left opaque, and the nature of the interactions among them is highly constrained. In particular, capital is either a complement or a substitute for labor, different types of labor are either complements or substitutes for one another, and these roles are essentially fixed. Changes in the supply of each input can of course affect marginal products, but each factor’s “purpose” in the production function is both distinct and static. These restrictions stem from the fact that the canonical production function implicitly equates two distinct aspects of production. One aspect is which factors are used as inputs, e.g., capital, high skill labor, low skill labor. The other is what services these factors provide. In the canonical setup, a factor’s identity and its role in the production function are synonymous. In reality, however, the boundary between “labor tasks” and “capital tasks” in production is permeable and shifting. We observe numerous instances in which technological advances allow machinery to substitute for labor in performing a specific set of tasks—for example, dispensing boarding passes and assigning seats at airport check-in counters in lieu of gate agents—while simultaneously complementing labor in other tasks, for example, allowing gate agents to rapidly identify alternate flights and issue new tickets. This evolving division of labor has a clear economic logic: novel tasks—those demanded by new products, techniques, or services—are often assigned first to workers because workers are flexible and adaptive. As these tasks are formalized and codified, they become fallow for automation since machinery typically has a cost advantage over human labor in rote execution of repetitive tasks. A growing body of literature argues that the shifting allocation of tasks between capital and labor—and between domestic and foreign labor—has played a key role in reshaping the structure of labor demand in industrialized countries in recent decades. Analyzing this phenomenon is difficult within the canonical production function framework, however, because the assignment of tasks to labor and capital is, for most conceptual purposes, static. To overcome this conceptual hurdle, it is valuable to consider a setting where the equilibrium mapping between production tasks and productive factors responds dynamically to shifting economic and technological forces. The “task approach” to labor markets offers one promising, though far from complete, set of conceptual tools for studying these forces. In this brief essay, I first sketch a formal model, developed by Acemoglu and Autor (2011), that offers a flexible and tractable approach for analyzing the interactions among skill supplies, technological capabilities, and potential trade and offshoring opportunities in shaping the demand for factors, the assignment of factors to tasks, and the productivity and hence the wage of each factor. This model removes what we view as an artificial set of distinctions typically made between labor, capital, and trade (or offshoring) in the canonical production model, where different factors of production play distinct and often incommensurate roles. In the this alternative model, the fundamental units of production are job tasks, which are combined to produce output. Tasks can be supplied by domestic labor, foreign labor, or capital, the capabilities of which may change over time. Consequently, the assignment of factors to tasks in this model is determined by comparative advantage; in equilibrium, only the least-cost factor is assigned to any given task. The second part of the essay briefly discusses some of the key conceptual and practical challenges that researchers face in bringing the “task approach” to the data. The literature is already grappling with these issues, as I note below, and I’m cautiously optimistic that progress will be rapid. I end by highlighting some of the pitfalls that researchers may encounter in applying the task approach, most prominently, loose and inconsistent task definitions that tend to sow confusion, and the beguiling temptation for researchers to confidently forecast the “future of work” based only on the very modest understanding that we have developed to date.",181

Barnow,David Greenberg,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"When evaluating a pilot or demonstration program, there are risks from drawing policy inferences from a single test. First, the positive impact could be due to chance, although a large enough sample size makes chance alone an unlikely explanation for a large, statistically significant positive impact estimate. Second, if the treatment is conducted in a single site, then it might not be the treatment itself that accounts for a large difference with the control group. For example, in an educational setting with one class in the treatment group and one in the control group, the treatment group could have an unusually effective teacher, and the treatment of interest, say the curriculum used, might not be the source of the differences between groups. Most of the replication efforts we have identified sought to replicate an intervention that had promising results in the initial study by increasing the sample size and the number of locations where the intervention was tested. Replications are sometimes used to conduct research on other issues of interest including the following:  
Additional target groups. In some instances this includes other racial and ethnic groups, and in others extending the treatment from a general population to individuals with specific characteristics, such as disabilities. 
Additional geographic locations. For example, programs tested in urban areas have been replicated in rural areas. 
Different intervention parameters. Some programs, such as welfare programs and health insurance, can be characterized by a few specific characteristics for example the benefit reduction rate for earnings in a welfare program or the co-payment rate in a health insurance program. Replications may test a wider range of parameters than the original demonstration, or, if policy interest is more focused, they may test a narrower range of parameters.Footnote 1
 
Additional related treatments. If the replication effort includes enough observations, it is possible to expand the experiment to test related interventions in an “experiment within the experiment.” For example, the income maintenance experiment replication efforts tested the effects of adding day care subsidies in one replication (Gary) and counseling, vocational education, and training in another (Seattle-Denver). Interestingly, we are not aware of any cases in which replications were performed when the original evaluation found no impact. Although this is understandable, with the high cost of social experiments limiting the number that can be tested, it is worth considering whether any promising interventions have been dropped inappropriately because of negative or statistically insignificant findings in the initial evaluation, particularly when the sample size was small. We use the term replication to designate sequential testing of an intervention, rather than testing an intervention simultaneously in multiple sites. Examples of initial tests in multiple sites using random assignment include the evaluation of the Jobstart demonstration (Cave et al. 1993), which was implemented in 13 sites; the National JTPA study, which was implemented in 16 sites (Orr et al. 1996); and the Employment Retention and Advancement demonstration (Hamilton and Scrivener 2012), which was implemented in 12 sites.Footnote 2 The rationale for implementing tests in multiple sites initially is similar to the reason for replicating promising demonstrations—to assure that the findings reflect the impact of the intervention rather than some other factor, to test the intervention in a variety of settings, and obtain more precision in the impact estimates. Replication is not as simple a matter as it may first appear. A number of the replication efforts described below fail to find impact estimates similar to the original evaluation. Schorr and Farrow (2011) claim that the history of replication and scale-up efforts is “discouraging.” They cite seven reasons why replication efforts have been unsuccessful:  Insufficient understanding of what made the original intervention successful; Insufficient care and resources devoted to the quality of implementation and the process of scaling up; Insufficient attention to the culture within the helping organization and the regulatory and systems context surrounding it; Insufficient attention to local capacity and the organizational environment within which the intervention must be sustained; Failure to understand that what works for most children and families may not change outcomes for the children and families who are most at risk; Failure to understand the “uptake problem” among local front-line personnel and supervisors; Funders’ reluctance to devote significant sums to the substantial operational costs of scaling up (Schorr and Farrow 2011, p. 17).  Although all of these factors can be issues, many times it is a failure to understand what made the intervention successful along with a tendency try to reduce expenditures in the replication efforts that lead to problems in replication efforts. In some of the cases described below, the problems are more obvious; for example, in two replication efforts, the Center for Employment and Training (CET) and Quantum Opportunity Program (QOP), there was a failure to implement the program design with fidelity. Social experiments have a longer history in the United States than in Europe, and replications date back to the 1960s and 1970s for both large and small social experiments in the United States. In recent years, interest in and use of social experiments has grown considerably in Europe, and a recent conference at the Institute for Employment Research focused on recent field experiments conducted in Europe and the United States.Footnote 3 As social experiments increase in Europe, the lessons from replications conducted in the United States can provide guidance on when and how to replicate.",3

The adverse effects of job-loss on an individual’s income and socio-economic status on the other hand are also well known (see e.g. Gangl 2006; Kuhn 2002; Schmelzer 2012; Schmieder et al. 2010). The question remains whether the positive effects of occupational changes still apply when they happen in order to overcome a time of unemployment. The findings so far are rather scarce. It is unclear whether a change of occupation leads to new opportunities possibly ameliorating the situation after unemployment or whether the opposite is true and an occupational change out of desperation further deteriorates the socio-economic consequences of spells of unemployment. This process has to be understood in the context of the close interplay of the occupational labour market structure and the educational system. Considering the strong boundaries between occupational labour market segments brought about by a high level of standardisation of vocational education as e.g. in Germany, changes of occupation become problematic especially when individuals have attained a high level of formal education. Consequently the rates of job mobility are higher in less standardized educational systems (Allmendinger 1989; Schmelzer 2011). The educational standardization defining occupations as bundles of specific skills can be viewed as a means of facilitating the labour market matching by reducing the transaction costs for the employer as well as the individual looking for a job (Abraham et al. 2011). At the same time this means a high risk of losing one’s investment in vocational education to an occupational change as the specific skills and certificates might not be transferable to other occupations, leading to poorer job opportunities. For unemployed individuals receiving unemployment or welfare benefits this might be especially severe as they might be forced by the employment agencies to take up employment even though the job does not match their qualifications. Gangl (2004b) shows that more generous welfare systems increase the chances of a good job match with less detrimental effects on the socio-economic outcome. In Germany a stricter welfare legislation was introduced in 2005 demanding benefits recipients to take up any employment offered by the employment agency even though it is not in the former field of occupation (§10 Social Code II). The article will therefore address the following research questions:  What is the impact of occupational changes on the socio-economic outcomes on re-employment following a spell of unemployment? In how far does vocational training mediate this process?  In order to empirically investigate these questions a sample of both employed and unemployed individuals from the panel study “Labour Market and Social Security” (PASS) conducted by the German Institute for Employment Research is used. Changes of occupation are measured using the concept by Matthes et al. (2008) clustering occupations into segments with high transferability of skills. The socio-economic outcome is measured via the International Socio-Economic Index (ISEI). This is a latent measure for the transmission of education to income characterising each particular occupation (Ganzeboom et al. 1992). The next section will discuss the linkage of the occupational structuring of labour markets and aspects of human capital and signalling theories in order to build a theoretical framework for the analysis of determinants and outcomes of an individual’s change of the occupational field upon re-entry into the labour market. The dataset and the statistical methods employed in the analysis will then be introduced in the following section. The fourth section provides a comprehensive account of the results and is followed by summarizing and concluding remarks in the last section.",2
46,4,Journal for Labour Market Research,15 October 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-013-0148-8,Poverty and the social participation of young people—an analysis of poverty-related withdrawal mechanisms,December 2013,Andreas Damelang,Georgi Kloß,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the public discourse on equal access to education and participation opportunities, informal learning usually plays a minor role. However, the acquisition of extracurricular skills during childhood and adolescence is increasingly important (Stecher 2005) to secure the individual benefits required to compete for coveted jobs and traineeship positions (Zinnecker 1994). Informal learning does not occur in pedagogically approved contexts but in everyday life (Lipski 2000). Participation in organised sports, music and cultural activities with peers plays a major role. Social origin influences formal and informal learning opportunities. In particular, children and young individuals who are at risk of poverty or affected by poverty have diminished opportunities. Recent studies have demonstrated that the social background of young individuals strongly determines their social participation (Düx et al. 2008; Engels and Thielebein 2010; Gaiser and Rijke 2006; Gensicke et al. 2006; Otto and Kutscher 2004). Especially young people with lower socio-economic status have a lower participation rate in, for example, sport clubs or organisations. In particular, socially better-off and integrated youth benefit from the positive effects of participation. The welfare state ensures the provision of the material basic needs (e.g., housing, food, and clothing) of needy children. However, the satisfaction of cultural and social needs is deficient. To counteract these deficiencies, the federal government introduced the so-called “educational package” (“Bildungs- und Teilhabepaket”) in 2011, which aimed “to improve the social integration of children and young people into existing clubs and community structures and to intensify the contact with their peers” (Sauer and Kossens 2011, p. 870; translated by the authors). Therefore, the government pays club and course fees up to € 10 monthly for young individuals who receive Unemployment Benefit II (ALG IIFootnote 1).Footnote 2 The “educational package” is based on the assumption that children and young people from poor and needy families are excluded from such services because of the costs of social participation. Poverty research has demonstrated that monetary resources restrict opportunities for participation but that withdrawal also occurs because of shame. Poor children and youth are ashamed of the poverty of their parents and internalise their parents’ lack of self-esteem (Gillen and Möller 1992). Thus, they withdraw from previous contacts or avoid them from the beginning (Kern 2004). Both mechanisms—financial constraints and social withdrawal because of shame—result in an accumulation of educational disadvantages for children and young individuals affected by poverty, although the socio-political approach only focuses on the first mechanism. This article addresses the question of whether financial constraints restrict participation in extracurricular contexts or whether withdrawal is causative. To investigate this question empirically, we divide extracurricular leisure activities into fee-based and non-contributory organisations. If financial constraints are the decisive factor for participation, different participation rates should be found only in fee-based and not in non-contributory organisations. However, if financial constraints only play a minor role with social withdrawal being the main cause, then lower participation should also be observed in non-contributory organisations. We operationalise participation in sport, music or cultural clubs as fee-based activities and leisure activities organised by church communities as non-contributory activities. The access to both types of leisure opportunity is open to all regardless of social or religious background. To disentangle poverty-related withdrawal mechanisms, we use the panel study “Labour Market and Social Security” (PASS), which was developed for the labour market, welfare state and poverty research in Germany (Trappmann et al. 2010). The survey data are well suited for the study of needy individuals and their participation in society because of the oversampling of recipients of benefits in accordance with the German Social Code Book II. In the following sections, we first explain the importance of informal learning and then discuss the mechanisms of social withdrawal with regard to participation in extracurricular leisure activities. Then, we present the data, our research design and the empirical findings. Finally, we summarise the results and discuss socio-political implications.",10

Ein wichtiger Indikator für die große Resonanz in der Wissenschaft und der Fachöffentlichkeit sind die bis zum Zeitpunkt der Fertigstellung dieses Beitrags in SSCI-Journals mit den Daten des IAB-Betriebpanels und des darauf aufbauenden Linked-Employer-Employee Datensatzes des IAB (LIAB) publizierten 106 Artikel. Dafür lassen sich sechs wichtige Gründe anführen. Erstens ist die dynamische Entwicklung des Fragebogens und die Berücksichtigung neuer Fragen als Schlüssel für den Erfolg des IAB-Betriebspanels zu nennen: Der ersten Befragungswelle gingen intensive Vorbereitungen voraus, u.a. wurden verhältnismäßig umfangreiche Vorerhebungen durchgeführt (Bellmann et al. 1991 und Dostal et al. 1993) und Expertisen über bereits bestehende Betriebsbefragungen eingeholt (Gerlach et al. 1990; Hauptmanns und Ostendorf 1994). Wir haben dann ein Verfahren entwickelt, in dem neue Fragen für das IAB-Betriebspanel vorgeschlagen, im Plenum der Vertreter der am IAB-Betriebspanel beteiligten Institutionen diskutiert, in der Fragebogengruppe konkretisiert, im Pretest überprüft und erneut im Plenum beraten werden. Damit berücksichtigen wir den Sachverstand nicht nur der beteiligten Wissenschaftler, sondern auch den der Mitarbeiter der Ministerien und von TNS Infratest Sozialforschung, die verantwortlich für die Feldarbeit sind und ihre Erfahrungen einbringen. Zweitens ist der hohe Rücklauf von ca. 85 % bei den wiederholt befragten Betrieben als Basis für die Längsschnittanalysen hervorzuheben. Dazu hat neben den persönlich-mündlichen Interviews die Unterstützung der Bundesvereinigung der deutschen Arbeitgeberverbände (BDA) und der Bundesagentur für Arbeit (BA) durch entsprechende Empfehlungsschreiben des Präsidenten bzw. des Vorstandsvorsitzenden beigetragen. Die hohe Qualität des Fragebogens ist an dieser Stelle ebenfalls als sehr wichtig anzusehen. Drittens ist die BA Teil des deutschen Sozialversicherungssystems, die aus den über die sozialversicherungspflichtig Beschäftigten vorliegenden Daten eine Betriebsdatei aufbaut, die sich als eine hervorragende Ziehungsgrundlage für die Stichprobe der zu befragenden Betriebe bewährt hat. Einzigartig ist viertens die Verknüpfung der Daten des IAB-Betriebspanels mit den administrativen Daten der BA. Zwar wurden Linked-Employer-Employee Datensätze in den letzten zehn Jahren in vielen Ländern aufgebaut, leider sind aber die Informationen über die Betriebe oftmals auf wenige Variablen beschränkt (Alda et al. 2005; Hamermesh 1999; Bellmann et al. 1999; Bellmann und Schank 2000; Bellmann et al. 2002a, 2002b). An dieser Stelle ist die erfolgreiche Zusammenarbeit mit dem Forschungsdatenzentrum (FDZ) besonders hervorzuheben (Allmendinger und Kohlmann 2005; Kohlmann 2005; Bender und Heining 2011; Bender et al. 2013). Dieses Matching, aber auch die persönlich-mündlichen Interviews und das Editing bei TNS Infratest Sozialforschung erlauben Datenprüfungen und Konsistenzchecks, die dazu beitragen, die hohe Datenqualität sicherzustellen und noch zu steigern. Zudem existiert sechstens beim IAB-Betriebspanel und dem LIAB ein geregelter Zugang für externe Wissenschaftler – insofern befindet sich das IAB-Betriebspanel in guter Gesellschaft, z.B. mit dem SOEP, dem PASS oder den KombiFiD-Daten. Das IAB-Betriebspanel ist mit 40 neuen Projekten pro Jahr der zentrale Datensatz des FDZ. Allein der LIAB wurde im Jahr 2012 500-mal und das IAB-Betriebspanel über 900-mal über Datenfernverarbeitung abgefragt (Bender et al. 2013). Ich kann und will an dieser Stelle nicht auf alle angesprochenen Punkte im Detail eingehen. Ich werde den Schwerpunkt meiner Ausführungen auf den ersten Punkt, also die Entwicklung des Fragebogens und die Aufnahme neuer Fragen im IAB-Betriebspanel, legen, die einerseits in der wissenschaftlichen Diskussion im In- und Ausland sowie der Fachöffentlichkeit virulent sind, aber andererseits Forschungslücken schließen sollen, indem wir neue Themen angehen und neue Fragen stellen. Weil Fragen dazu sowohl in der amtlichen Statistik aber auch in anderen Wissenschaftlern zugänglichen Datenquellen fehlen, sind die Fragen im IAB zur betrieblichen Gewinn- und Kapitalbeteiligung, der Existenz eines Betriebsrats, der Orientierung an Tarifverträgen, der Verbreitung betrieblicher Bündnisse für Beschäftigungs- und Standortsicherung und zu den personalpolitischen Maßnahmen für ältere Arbeitnehmer einzigartig. Folgende fünf Themenbereiche stehen im Zentrum der wissenschaftlichen Untersuchungen mit den Daten des IAB-Betriebspanels:  Betriebliche Flexibilität Fachkräftebedarf, betriebliche Aus- und Weiterbildung Innovationen sowie technischer und organisatorischer Wandel Industrielle Beziehungen sowie die Auswirkungen der Finanz- und Wirtschaftskrise 2008/2009 auf den Arbeitsmarkt. Diese Themenbereiche unterliegen selber natürlich einem stetigen Wandel, einige Fragen waren von Beginn an im IAB-Betriebspanel enthalten, andere kamen später hinzu: Sie wurden aber nicht nur für sich untersucht, sondern auch im Hinblick auf Beschäftigungs-, Lohn- und Produktivitätseffekte und es bestehen natürlich auch Beziehungen zwischen diesen Einflussfaktoren und Effekten. Darauf werde ich am Schluss meiner Ausführungen eingehen. Zunächst möchte ich die wichtigsten Ergebnisse auf die von uns gestellten Fragen und die Entwicklung der Fragen in diesen Themenbereichen erörtern.",3

Many methods were developed in the past but the application in empirical economics follows with a lag. Some methods are well-known but have experienced only little attention. New approaches focus on characteristics of the data, on modified estimators, on correct specifications, on unobserved heterogeneity, on endogeneity and on causal effects. Real data sets are not compatible with the assumptions of classical models. Therefore, modified methods were suggested for the estimation and inference. The road map of the following considerations are four hypotheses where the first two and the second two belong together:  Significance is an important indicator in empirical economics but the results are sometimes misleading. Assumptions’ violation, clustering of the data, outliers and only partially identified parameters are often the reason of wrong standard errors using classical methods. The estimation of average effects is useful but subgroup analysis and quantile regressions are important supplements. Causal effects are of great interest but the determination is based on disparate approaches with varying results.  In the following some econometric methods are developed, presented and applied to Cobb-Douglas production functions.",1

Unternehmen) stammen in Deutschland vor allem aus zwei Quellen:Footnote 1
 Seit 1993 wird im Auftrag des Instituts für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung der Bundesagentur für Arbeit (IAB) jährlich eine repräsentative geschichtete Stichprobe aller Betriebe mit mindestens einer sozialversicherungspflichtig beschäftigten Person befragt. Die Angaben aus den Befragungswellen werden über die Jahre verknüpft und bilden das IAB-Betriebspanel (Fischer et al. 2009). Die Statistischen Landesämter erheben regelmäßig in Betrieben und Unternehmen aus allen Teilen der Wirtschaft Daten zu einer Vielzahl von Themen. Diese Angaben können über die einzelnen Wellen einer Erhebung sowie über verschiedene Erhebungen miteinander verknüpft und für ganz Deutschland zusammengeführt werden. Die so entstehenden Längsschnittdaten für Betriebe und Unternehmen sind die so genannten AFiD-Panel, wobei das Akronym AFiD für Amtliche Firmendaten für Deutschland steht (Malchin und Voshage 2009). Wissenschaftler können das IAB-Betriebspanel und die AFiD-Panel für Analysen nutzen. Der Zugang ist jeweils projektspezifisch vertraglich zu regeln und erfolgt über das Forschungsdatenzentrum (FDZ) der Bundesagentur für Arbeit im Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (Kohlmann 2005) bzw. über die FDZ des Statistischen Bundesamtes und der Statistischen Ämter der Länder (Zühlke et al. 2004). Aus Nutzersicht ist hierbei wichtig, dass bei der Verwendung der Daten des IAB-Betriebspanels keine Gebühren anfallen; die Kosten für die Nutzung eines AFiD-Paneldatensatzes mit zahlreichen Wellen können dagegen insbesondere dann, wenn projektspezifische Erweiterungen erforderlich sind, erheblich sein. Ein wesentlicher Unterschied zwischen den beiden Paneldatensätzen besteht in der Art ihrer Entstehung und den damit verbundenen Kosten. Während die AFiD-Panel auf vorhandene Datenbestände zurückgreifen können und diese Daten lediglich neu aufbereitet (d.h. unter Verwendung entsprechender Identifikatoren über die Wellen einer Erhebung und dann über mehrere Erhebungen verknüpft) werden müssen, ist für das IAB-Betriebspanel jedes Jahr eine eigenständige Erhebung durch Interviewer eines Befragungsinstituts sowie eine anschließende Aufbereitung der erhobenen Daten erforderlich. Auf der Grundlage meiner umfangreichen Erfahrungen aus zwanzig Jahren Arbeit mit Firmenpaneldaten versuche ich in diesem Beitrag zu zeigen, warum das IAB-Betriebspanel und die AFiD-Panel komplementäre Inputs für die Empirische Wirtschaftsforschung bilden. Beide Datensätze haben spezifische Stärken und Schwächen, die sie zur Analyse von konkreten Fragestellungen jeweils mehr oder weniger gut geeignet machen. Dies soll hier – oft unter Verweis auf eigene empirische Studien von mir – gezeigt werden.",
47,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,17 October 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-013-0141-2,Beschäftigungsanpassung in deutschen Betrieben: Flexibler als gedacht?,March 2014,Richard Upward,Hans-Dieter Gerner,Lutz Bellmann,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Es wird oft behauptet, dass ein entscheidender Unterschied zwischen dem US-amerikanischen und den kontinental-europäischen Arbeitsmärkten in der betrieblichen Anpassungsfähigkeit des Beschäftigungsniveaus besteht. Beispielsweise argumentieren Pries und Rogerson (2005), dass die Arbeitskräftemobilität in Europa wesentlich niedriger sei als in den USA, obwohl sich die Arbeitsplatzmobilität ähnele; dies könne teilweise durch politische Maßnahmen und institutionelle Unterschiede wie Mindestlöhne und Entlassungskosten erklärt werden. In Europa sind die Eintrittsraten in die Arbeitslosigkeit niedriger, dafür ergeben sich aber auch längere Arbeitslosigkeitsdauern. Die betrieblichen Einstellungs- und Entlassungsraten sind in Europa ebenfalls niedriger als in den USA. Auf der makroökonomischen Ebene trägt die Möglichkeit der Betriebe, Arbeitskräfte in einer Rezession zu entlassen und sie in einer Boomphase wieder einzustellen, zu den konjunkturellen Schwankungen der Eintritte in die Arbeitslosigkeit bei. Dabei finden Darby et al. (1986), dass die konjunkturellen Schwankungen der Arbeitslosigkeit durch die Eintritte in die Arbeitslosigkeit bestimmt werden, die Wahrscheinlichkeit für Entlassungen über den Konjunkturzyklus variiert. Im Unterschied dazu präsentieren Hall (2005) und Shimer (2007) empirische Evidenz dafür, dass die Eintritte in Arbeitslosigkeit relativ unabhängig vom Konjunkturzyklus sind und dass die Erhöhung des Arbeitslosenbestands in einer Rezession hauptsächlich auf die geringere Abgangsrate aus der Arbeitslosigkeit zurückzuführen ist. Fujita und Ramey (2009) liefern allerdings Evidenz dahingehend, dass die Eintritte in Arbeitslosigkeit keineswegs konjunkturunabhängig sind. Schließlich erklären Elsby et al. (2009) die konjunkturellen Schwankungen der Arbeitslosigkeit sowohl mit den Eintritten in und Austritten aus der Arbeitslosigkeit. Diese Studien beziehen sich auf die USA. Die unterschiedlichen Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Diskussion über die Arbeitskräfteströme im Konjunkturverlauf, aber auch allgemein, bei weitem noch nicht abgeschlossen ist. Für Europa würde die These der geringen Arbeitskräftemobilität implizieren, dass die Eintritte in die Arbeitslosigkeit geringer ausfallen sollten als in den USA. Auf der mikroökonomischen Ebene erlaubt die zunehmende Verfügbarkeit von detaillierten Unternehmens- und Betriebsdaten, die mit Beschäftigtenangaben verknüpft werden können, die Untersuchung des betrieblichen Einstellungs- und Entlassungsverhaltens in Abhängigkeit von Veränderungen des Beschäftigungsniveaus. Für die USA haben sowohl Burgess et al. (2001, 11) als auch Davis et al. (2006, 17) gezeigt, dass der Abbau von Beschäftigung mit der Zunahme von Entlassungen bewältigt wird, während der Anstieg der Beschäftigung mit Einstellungen verbunden ist. Die Stabilität dieser Beziehungen ist bemerkenswert. Die davon abweichenden empirischen Ergebnisse für Frankreich von Abowd et al. (1999) sind für uns eine weitere Motivation für eine Untersuchung der Zusammenhänge zwischen der betrieblichen Beschäftigungsentwicklung und den Einstellungen und Entlassungen für Deutschland. Wir verwenden dafür die Daten des IAB-Betriebspanels und der Beschäftigtenstatistik der Bundesagentur für Arbeit (BA). Außerdem betrachten wir Beziehungen zwischen Arbeitskräfte- und Arbeitsplatzmobilität in Abhängigkeit unterschiedlicher Gruppen von Arbeitskräften, da diese z. B. unterschiedlich stark durch die gesetzlichen Kündigungsschutzregelungen vor Entlassungen geschützt sind. Der Aufbau dieses Beitrags ist folgender: Im nächsten Abschnitt wird der empirische Ansatz präsentiert und ein Literaturüberblick gegeben. Im dritten Abschnitt gehen wir auf die Datengrundlage unserer Untersuchungen ein. Im vierten Abschnitt werden die Beziehungen zwischen Arbeitskräfte- und Arbeitsplatzmobilität auf der Grundlage des IAB-Betriebspanels untersucht. Im fünften Abschnitt betrachten wir negative Beschäftigungsanpassungen für unterschiedliche Beschäftigtengruppen. Der letzte Abschnitt enthält die Schlussfolgerungen und einen Forschungsausblick.",2

Across countries, firms have shown different reactions to this crisis, but also within countries firms’ behavior has differed from previous reactions. For example, German firms predominantly adjusted working hours, while less adjustment of the number of employees was visible (see Burda and Hunt, 2011). This points to a fundamental change in firms’ adjustment processes. Several studies for Germany indicate that firms’ employment adjustment has indeed changed over time (see, e.g., Gartner and Klinger, 2010; Herzog-Stein and Seifert, 2010). However, these studies are mostly based on descriptive analyses of aggregated data. In contrast, the present study provides a more detailed econometric analysis based on data at the establishment level. Using a representative panel data set on German establishments, I estimate a dynamic labor demand model for the period 1996 to 2010. This allows us to compare employment adjustment in the two business cycles occurring between 1996 and 2010 and to investigate econometrically whether firms’ adjustment behavior has changed over time. Moreover, I analyze labor demand separately for Western and Eastern Germany, thus extending the sparse empirical evidence on dynamic labor demand in Eastern Germany. I also provide new insights concerning the functional form of firms’ adjustment costs. Adjustment costs are an important component of dynamic labor demand theory. Firms’ adjustment behavior depends on the functional form of the adjustment costs they face. Although empirical evidence so far indicates a fixed and convex specification (see Vermeulen, 2006, p. 11), this has not been established for Germany yet. In the only studies for (Western) Germany which contain an intensive analysis of the functional form, Kölling (1998) prefers a convex and Yaman (2011) a linear functional form of adjustment costs, making the empirical evidence for Germany ambiguous. I will use a different switching regression approach than Kölling (1998) and will show that for Germany in addition to the convex specification a fixed component of adjustment costs is also relevant. Thus, I provide empirical support for the assumption of fixed and convex adjustment costs in Germany. Furthermore, the existing studies do not contain separate results for Western and Eastern Germany, which I provide. The paper proceeds as follows: Sect. 2 sketches the main aspects of adjustment costs and presents the relevant empirical evidence on the functional form of adjustment costs. Section 3 provides a description of our data. Section 4 shows the empirical model, while Sect. 5 presents and discusses the results of a basic dynamic labor demand model. I investigate the change of firms’ adjustment behavior over time in Sect. 6, and Sect. 7 concludes.",6

It strongly influences opportunities in life, especially with regard to wage levels and welfare state entitlements (Heinz 2006; Vobruba 2000). As a result, job stability has a high value from the worker’s perspective. It shelters from the risk of unemployment and allows the development of human capital (Blossfeld et al. 2006; Boockmann and Steffes 2010; Winkelmann and Zimmermann 1998). However, recent studies have concluded that the German labor market is characterized by a significant and growing proportion of mobile workers (Blossfeld et al. 2006; Giesecke and Heisig 2011). Despite this change, modern approaches to understanding employment systems show that job stability can also be assured in open employment systems when there are adequate opportunities for interfirm mobility (Alewell and Hansen 2012; Lepak et al. 2006; Struck and Dütsch 2012). These allow workers to both preserve and further develop their occupational skills throughout their employment careers. However, downward mobility or transitions to unemployment cause a loss of qualifications and lead to unfavorable labor market chances in the future (ebd.). To date, most research has focused on the individual determinants influencing employment trajectories. The important role of factors such as gender, nationality, educational level, and the particular age cohort in explaining employment (dis-)continuities has been widely documented (Bergemann and Mertens 2004; Giesecke and Heisig 2011; Hillmert et al. 2004). Furthermore, it is accentuated that employment trajectories are governed by endogenous causality; cohort analyses indicate that a poor start to the employment career may impact negatively on future mobility patterns (Blossfeld 1986; Hillmert et al. 2004). Although Coleman (1990) has pointed to the importance of the broader social context for individual behavior, research on labor mobility has paid less attention to structural effects. Thus, the impact of firm-specific factors and regional disparities on employment trajectories has remained largely unexplored. Because “new structuralism” stresses the significance of accounting for firm characteristics (Baron and Bielby 1980), it seems pertinent to consider these factors further. Moreover, spatial economics, especially the seminal theory on “new economic geography” (Krugman 1991), has triggered a wave of empirical work on spatial analysis. Using this theoretical approach, several economists have shown the relevance of regional factors for the development of both employment and wages in Germany (Blien 2001; Blien et al. 2001; Möller and Tassinopoulos 2000). This article seeks to contribute more fully to research on employment trajectories by focusing on three structural framework conditions in greater detail. These are (1) whether and to what extent job exits as well as upward, lateral, or downward interfirm mobility and transitions into unemployment are influenced by firm-specific characteristics; and (2) whether and to what extent these mobility processes correlate with various regional determinants. Additionally (3) different economic conditions will be taken into account to analyze their impact on labor mobility. Thereby, it should be studied if employees can minimize the significant effect of individual determinants and endogenous causalities, which are stated by life course researchers, by taking advantage of particular framework conditions. The article studies these conditions by combining a German linked employer-employee dataset with data on regional characteristics from the Federal Institute for Research on Building, Urban Affairs and Spatial Development (BBSR). Based on this hierarchically structured dataset, it deploys a multilevel framework to evaluate the different mobility processes. The article starts by reviewing the current state of research in Sect. 2. Theoretical considerations are presented in Sect. 3. Data and the estimation strategy are described in Sect. 4. Section 5 contains the empirical results on employment careers in Germany. Finally, Sect. 6 summarizes the findings.",12
47,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,30 July 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-013-0138-x,Firm leadership and the gender pay gap: do active owners discriminate more than hired managers?,March 2014,Boris Hirsch,Steffen Mueller,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"One of the most notable stylised facts in labour economics is that women earn substantially less than men. For example, the European Commission (2010) reports an average gender gap in gross hourly earnings of about 17.6 per cent for the EU-27 countries in 2007 and 23.0 per cent for Germany. Though part of this pay differential can be attributed to gender differences in education, occupation, or work experience, a considerable part of the gender pay gap remains unexplained (see, e.g., the large meta-analysis of Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer (2005) comprising more than 260 international studies between the 1960s and the 1990s). While part of this unexplained gender pay gap may simply reflect differences in human capital or occupational segregation not controlled for, part of it may also reflect discrimination against women. Theoretical attempts of explaining this sort of wage discrimination typically take up Becker’s (1971) concept of employer discrimination due to distaste. In this framework, discriminatory employers are prejudiced against women and offer lower wages to women compared to equally productive men, giving rise to an unexplained gender pay gap in the sense given above. Since non-discriminatory employers employ more women at wages below their productivity, discriminating employers forego profits and discrimination comes at a competitive disadvantage. Discriminatory employers thus pay for discrimination. Up to now, there is only little empirical research on how the characteristics of firm leaders influence the gender pay gap, though they are likely to reflect firm leaders’ possible discriminatory preferences and thus their discriminatory behaviour. While there has been some research on the effect of the sex of firm leaders (e.g., Cardoso and Winter-Ebmer 2010; Hirsch 2013), there exists—to the best of our knowledge—no piece of evidence on differences in the gender pay gap between owner-run and manager-run firms. This comes at a surprise because, as we shall argue later on, active owners and hired managers can be expected to live out their costly discriminatory preferences to a different extent depending on how strong firm profits drive firm leaders’ actions. Whereas owner-managers may unopposedly pay for discrimination, owners should be less fond of costly taste-based discrimination if ownership and control are separated. Yet, agency problems may allow hired managers to indulge their tastes at such low personal costs that they even discriminate more against women than owner-managers. Using linked employer–employee data for Germany, this paper investigates for the first time whether the unexplained gender pay gap in owner-run firms differs from that in manager-run firms. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Sect. 2 develops our hypothesis in more detail and reviews some related empirical literature. Section 3 describes our data set. Section 4 presents and discusses our results, and Sect. 5 concludes.",

Der Datenzugang erfolgte mittels kontrollierter Datenfernverarbeitung beim Forschungsdatenzentrum des IAB. Für hilfreiche Hinweise zu früheren Versionen des manuskripts möchte ich mich bei den anonymen Gutachtern bedanken. Seit rund einer Dekade befasst sich eine Reihe von Studien mit der Wirksamkeit öffentlicher Fördermaßnahmen. In der Regel handelt es sich jedoch um Untersuchungen, die sich mit Maßnahmen der aktiven Arbeitsmarktpolitik befassen. Insbesondere durch die Neuordnung im Rahmen der Reformen auf dem Arbeitsmarkt (sog. „Hartz“-Reformen) gab es einen großen Anreiz die Wirksamkeit alter und neuer Arbeitsmarktprogramme zu evaluieren (siehe hierzu z. B. Heyer et al. 2012). Demgegenüber wurden und werden andere Maßnahmen der öffentlichen Förderung, z. B. Investitionszuschüsse oder steuerliche Vergünstigungen für Unternehmen kaum hinsichtlich ihrer Wirksamkeit untersucht. Zwar müssen in Fällen, in denen beispielsweise EU-Fördermittel verwendet werden, Angaben über die Verwendung gemacht werden. Jedoch handelt es sich dabei nicht um kausale Analysen der Wirkung einzelner Maßnahmen auf wirtschaftlich relevante Indikatoren, sondern eine begleitende Analyse im Kontext von Zielvorgaben.Footnote 2 Ein weiterer Punkt, der bei der Untersuchung von Maßnahmewirkungen zu beachtet werden sollte, ist die Vielzahl von Quellen, aus denen eine Förderung bewilligt werden kann. Neben Mitteln des Bundes, die häufig über Förderbanken wie die KfW oder die Rentenbank vergeben werden, hat jedes Bundesland auch eigene Programme und Förderinstitutionen. Zusätzlich können auch Mittel direkt bei der EU beantragt werden. Es stellt sich auch in diesen Fällen die Frage, ob die intendierten Wirkungen erreicht werden bzw. ob sich auch indirekte Effekte auf weitere Indikatoren ergeben. Im Folgenden werden daher Angaben aus dem IAB-Betriebspanel von 1996 bis 2009 dazu genutzt, um die kausale Wirkung von öffentlicher Wirtschaftsförderung auf Investitionen, Arbeitsnachfrage und Produktivität zu untersuchen. In der Regel müssen die Unternehmen zahlreiche Vorbedingungen erfüllen, damit eine Maßnahme bewilligt werden kann. Beispielsweise wird häufig die Eigenschaft eines kleinen bzw. mittleren Unternehmen (KMU) verlangt. Daher kann nicht davon ausgegangen werden, dass geförderte und ungeförderte Betriebe zufällig verteilt sind. Aus diesem Grund werden hier Matchingverfahren angewendet, um eine mögliche Selektivität der Beobachtungen zu berücksichtigen und die Robustheit der Resultate zu überprüfen. Unbeobachtete Heterogenitäten zwischen den Betrieben sollen durch bedingte „Differenz-von-Differenzen“-Schätzer als Maß für die unterschiedliche Entwicklung beiden Gruppen berücksichtigt werden. Die vorliegende Studie ist in mehrere Abschnitte gegliedert. Zunächst erfolgt ein kurzer Überblick über bisherigen Studien auf diesem Feld. Anschließend wird in Abschn. 3 das Untersuchungsdesign vorgestellt. Abschnitt 4 enthält eine Beschreibung der Daten und erste deskriptive Ergebnisse. Die Resultate für multivariaten Schätzungen der Förderwahrscheinlichkeit und die bedingten DvD-Schätzer werden in Abschn. 5 dargestellt. Eine Zusammenfassung der Ergebnisse beschließt die Studie.",3

The recent recession and the resulting dramatic increase in involuntary job losses have increased interest in this issue. Millions of prime-age workers have been displaced, and those fortunate enough to find employment have often suffered substantial reductions in earnings. Studies of the U.S. labor force have indicated that displaced workers suffer a large and persistent loss of earnings (for example, Ruhm 1991; Jacobson et al. 1993; Kletzer and Fairlie 2003). Ruhm (1991) found that the weekly earnings of displaced workers were 16 % lower than those of non-displaced workers 1 year following the displacement. Four years after displacement, their earnings remained 14 % below their former earnings. Given the large and ongoing losses suffered by displaced workers, it is important to determine the factors affecting the magnitude of earnings losses associated with displacement. The goal of this paper is to investigate the effect of accumulated human capital, and particularly occupational human capital, on earnings losses. Specifically, to what extent does the similarity between pre- and post-displacement occupations affect the earnings losses of the displaced workers? We hypothesize that the earnings losses associated with displacement are affected by the degree to which occupation-specific skills can be transferred across occupations. Among reemployed workers following displacement, we predict those who switch to a closer (more similar) occupation will suffer smaller earnings losses than those who switch into a dissimilar occupation, as they lose fewer of their occupation-specific skills. Unlike most of the previous studies of job displacement, we use a continuous measure of occupational skills transferability to measure the similarity between pre- and post-displacement occupations of reemployed displaced workers. This paper uses the data from the 2004, 2006, 2008, and 2010 Displaced Worker Survey (DWS) biennial supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) to estimate the portion of earnings losses attributable to lack of occupational skills transferability. This dataset contains the retrospective data on both pre- and post-displacement labor market circumstances, including occupations, for a large sample of workers who lost their jobs over the period of 2001–2009. The O*NET dataset is used to estimate the measure of occupational similarity applied in the analysis of earnings losses. The main findings of this paper show that post-displacement earnings losses are highly correlated with the degree of similarity between pre- and post-displacement occupations. Displaced workers who find jobs in occupations similar to their previous jobs, as measured by occupational skills transferability, suffer smaller earnings losses than those who find less similar jobs. For example, displaced workers whose new jobs measure 10 percentage points closer to their previous job on the occupational similarity measure experience approximately 3.6 percentage points fewer earnings losses. In addition, this relationship is non-linear: higher skills transferability reduces earnings losses at a decreasing rate. The further analysis also shows the positive relationship between pre-displacement earnings and the degree of occupational similarity. These findings provide important insight into the determination of earnings losses following job displacement. In particular, from a theoretical perspective, this research contributes to the human capital literature by emphasizing the importance of occupational human capital and the idea that occupational skills are (partially) transferable across occupations. The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 summarizes the literature on the role of human capital, particularly occupational human capital, in earnings losses due to displacement. Section 3 explains the estimation of an index of occupational similarity, and Sect. 4 sets up the methodological framework. Section 5 describes the main dataset and related variables, and Section 6 discusses the descriptive statistics. Section 7 presents the main findings and robustness tests. The last section concludes and discusses some of the implications for future research.",7

On the other hand the dual VET system represents one of the most important areas of corporatist governance in Germany. The political economy of skill formation shows the specific impact of the dual system of VET on the production model and the development of the welfare state model in Germany (Soskice 1999; Culpepper and Finegold 1999; Streeck 1991; Thelen 2004). Recent research on the political economy of collective skill formation (Busemeyer and Trampusch 2012) follows this approach, building on previous research that emphasises the the link between VET and other political-economic institutions (Busemeyer and Trampusch p. 12), especially labour market institutions. Due to its institutional approach, the political economy debate is geared to the level of regulation and thus neglects the empirical processes underlying ongoing changes in regulation. The focus is on the dual vocational education of skilled workers and the social partners associations as its political representatives (Busemeyer and Trampusch, p. 22). This explains why the skill formation system as a whole (including higher education and school-based training tracks) has received little attention in the political economy literature focusing on institutions. The same applies to higher education research although there have been some new approaches to link the higher education development more directly to the political economy debate (Graf 2009, 2010; Andres and Pechar 2013). For more than a century the development of the general education system was more or less neglected in discussions on VET, for three reasons: First, the Gymnasium track traditionally led to higher education programmes at universities, not to VET programmes (only a few students entered dual programmes after leaving the Gymnasium). Second, the social background of students in VET and higher education varied and consequently there was little competition for educational qualifications. Third, until the second half of the twentieth century, educational programmes for craftsmen and skilled workers seemed to focus on basic cognitive skills (reading, mathematics) only, rather than the wider range of cognitive skills emphasized at universities and other types of schools for general education. This is reflected in the fact that up to now no school leaving certificate is required to enter dual VET programmes. These conditions fundamentally changed during the second half of the twentieth century: Cognitive prerequisites for VET continuously increased and since the mid-1960s educational reform and expansion in Germany (old Länder) has gradually resulted in increasingly higher levels of education and in a differentiation of the educational landscape and young peoples’ educational careers. In addition, when the dual VET system was dominant and higher education played only a minor role, both sectors co-existed without any problems. However, since the beginning of the twenty-first century this situation has changed substantially. For the first time in the German qualification system, the number of new entrants into university and the number of entrants into dual vocational education and training (VET) was just about the same in the past few years. Up to the beginning of this century the number of entrants into dual VET was nearly twice as high as the number of entrants into university studies (Fig. 1). This quantitative shift in the relationship between the major educational sectors invigorated the discussion on the future of the German skill formation system as a whole: Will the system change towards higher education or will the traditional model of dual vocational education remain the backbone of German industry and the educational model for the majority of employees? A third option would be a new model of skill formation, integrating both systems into a new educational order. Entrants to VET (dual system) and higher education 1950–2011. (Vocational schools: new entrants, until 1990 and from 2005 old Länder, 1991–2004 old Länder plus Ost Berlin, New entrants in higher education: until 2000 old Länder, from 2002 old Länder plus Ost-Berlin, Source: Federal Statistical Office) The quantitative relationship between both sectors is demonstrated by the development in new entrants. Until the mid-1960s higher education was reserved for a small group of students, in particular from the middle classes. By that time, vocational education was the main pathway into qualified employment for the majority of young people (Fig. 1). Then, education reform and educational expansion created new dynamics: by the late 1960s entrants to university—and later to colleges of applied sciences (Fachhochschule)– started to continuously increase, whereas entrants to VET, with some temporary upward and downward turns, continuously decreased. The preliminary end of this development was reached in 2011/2012 when there was an equal number of entrants in both sectors.Footnote 1
 The question of possible developments of the German skill formation system not only concerns employment and economic growth; it also has an impact on social structure and industrial relations. In Germany this question is currently being discussed mainly from three perspectives, which are the points of departure for this paper: First, there is the politically pragmatic point of view, mainly supported by the social partners, focussing on their domain of vocational education and training. Given the expansion of higher education, they are concerned about the future of the dual VET system. This refers to the attractiveness of dual vocational education compared to higher education with respect to the demographic decrease of school-leavers in the coming 2 decades and the reform of higher education within the Bologna process (Kuda et.al. 2012). It is not surprising that this question is mainly addressed by the social partners, in particular by the trade unions: their possibilities for recruiting new members and for participation in society are at risk. In the frame of reference of vocational training policy as well as higher education policy the steep increase in the number and proportion of first-year students has provoked a critical debate about this development under the topos of the accelerating academisation of the labour market and the employment system. A second perspective is based on the new institutionalism in social sciences. Here the German VET system represents an outstanding paradigm for the interaction between institutions in coordinated market economies because the German model is considered to be a “paradigmatic case of a distinctly successful and decidedly ‘nonliberal’ training regime” (Thelen 2012, p. VI). Relating to the discussion on the transformation of the German model, this perspective is important and therefore will be discussed further. A third theoretical perspective, particularly widespread in higher education research, is based on the assumption that mass higher education is the appropriate qualification model for the emerging knowledge society. According to this approach one of the reasons for the shift from vocational training to higher education is a fundamental transformation in the patterns of knowledge production from experience-based knowledge to theoretical knowledge in different forms. Because of this, higher education institutions have become (besides other non-university research institutions) dynamic places for knowledge generation and dissemination, either in a discipline or in a more application oriented context (Gibbons et al. 1994; de Weert 1999; Brennan 2008; Välimaa and Hoffman 2008). So, the growing ‘academisation’ of skill formation mirrors the continuous enforcement of a particular type of knowledge in society in general as well as in the sector of work in particular. And this process is accompanied by some changes in class structures, especially by the emergence and extension of the social classes of higher- and lower-grade professionals (Erikson and Goldthorpe 1992, p. 38). In view of the historical institutional separation of the main educational sectors (discussed in Sect. 2 below)—higher education and dual vocational education and training—the text will examine in more detail the how the relationship between the two sectors has changed in recent years (as already described in Sect. 1). Against the background of recent developments, we will then discuss the significance of the changes in vocational education and training and higher education with respect to the social structure and the labour market (Sect. 3). After that, we will scrutinise the factors and conditions determining these shifts. These will be analysed from two perspectives: the changing educational behavior and the changing structures in the labour market and employment (Sect. 4). Finally we will describe some new attempts at linking vocational and higher education (Sect. 5) before turning to the institutional side of these developments and discussing whether the new configuration of the relationship between vocational education and higher education indicates a fundamental transformation in the German system of skill formation (part 6). This includes new organizational arrangements between both sectors as well as new governance structures.",58

Anderson,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Germany occupies a distinct position in the welfare state literature because it is widely held to be the prototype of the “conservative” or “Bismarckian” welfare regime. Insurance-based cash benefits financed by payroll contributions cover the risks of unemployment, sickness, and old age for workers and their families, whereas social services are relatively underdeveloped relative to other affluent democracies. Social provision preserves status differences: social insurance pays benefits closely linked to previous earnings, with better-off groups (civil servants, self-employed professionals, and high income-earners) enjoying more generous social protection than the average wage-earner. Nevertheless, this fragmented system of social provision provides universal coverage for most social risks. The dominant explanation of the postwar development of the German welfare regime is that it rests on a long period of consensus among political economic and societal actors about the basic contours of social provision (see, for example, Von Winter 1997). Christian Democratic dominance in legislative politics after WWII was accompanied both by the necessity of forming coalitions with the Liberal Party (FDP) or the Social Democratic Party (SPD), and the potential for veto in the Bundesrat, the upper chamber of parliament. Social policy was thus forged by competitive appeals by the CDU/CSU (Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union) and the SPD for the “pro-welfare vote”, and by several compromises between the CDU/CSU and SPD at the expense of the FDP. These conditions ensured that social policy would not be based on radical redistribution or efforts to reshape society (as in Scandinavia). Instead, the development of social provision after WWII was marked by the resurrection of central principles of social policy developed in the late nineteenth century: Bismarckian social insurance for wage earners, special schemes for tenured civil servants, and an important role for civil society associations in the administration of social services like health care and education (Alber 1989; Esping-Andersen 1990). Recent scholarship moves beyond the analysis of the political and social forces that have shaped the German welfare regime by highlighting the complementarities between social protection schemes and economic institutions. Scholars using the Varieties of Capitalism (VoC) framework highlight the economic functions of social protection in coordinated market economies (CMEs) like Germany (Hall and Soskice 2001). Here, social policies are not just the currency of electoral politics, or mechanisms for insuring against social risks, but they are also key elements of an integrated set of socio-economic institutions in which employers and other economic actors use non-market forms of coordination to pursue their economic goals. In CMEs, for example, generous social insurance encourages workers to invest in skills, and uniform social insurance programs prevent employers from using fringe benefits to poach qualified workers from other firms (Estevez-Abe et al. 2001). The institutional development of the German welfare regime in the past 3 decades is puzzling from the perspective of both literatures. Most analyses of social policy development since about 1990 emphasize the liberalization of both social insurance and social services (Streeck 2007; Trampusch 2009; Palier and Thelen 2010; Vail 2009). Although authors disagree about the extent of liberalization, the general trend is clear: recent reforms have weakened the breadwinner bias of social policy institutions; weakened corporatist administration of core programs like pensions and health care; introduced market mechanisms into core programs; and increased individuals’ and the state’s share of financing relative to contributions. Given the emphasis on policy stability in welfare state regime scholarship and the VoC literature, these shifts in social protection are surprising. Do fundamental changes in the post-war political consensus or the workings of the economic institutions crafted via the post-war settlement explain these shifts, or are other causal forces at work? This article enters these debates by analyzing policy shifts in two core programs: old-age pensions and health care. Both programs are prototypes of Bismarckian/conservative program design, and both systems have experienced tremendous cost pressures because of demographic change and rising non-wage labor costs (Häusermann 2010). The article makes three central claims. First, reforms have indeed brought about significant change, but the basic structures and redistributional profile of the German welfare state nevertheless remain intact. A series of reforms has reduced benefit generosity, and have aimed to change the governance structures of both pension and health care programs. The introduction of voluntary private pension provision (the Riesterrente) in 2001 and the Health Care Fund (Gesundheitsfonds) in 2009, in particular, should be seen as reforms that reconfigure the incentives both to the insured and to providers. Although political compromises watered down these reforms, they introduce changes in pension and health care financing that may serve as institutional templates for future reforms. At the same time, however, key conservative principles concerning benefit entitlement and financing remain largely intact. In both programs, derived rights based on family status remain strong. Similarly, occupational fragmentation continues to characterize the overall structure of both systems. Weak attempts to incorporate all income-earners (wage-earners, tenured civil servants, and self-employed professionals) into one universal scheme have been notable failures. Thus, the liberalization of health care and pension provision has not seriously challenged the occupational fragmentation and breadwinner orientation of social policy. In the field of pensions, however, 3 decades of reform have significantly weakened the insurance principle. Second, 2 decades of reform will produce more inequalities than in the old systems. There is more differentiation in pension levels, and growing numbers of pensioners will receive benefits that are not much higher than the poverty line (Bridgen and Meyer 2014; Hinrichs 2012). Take-up rates for occupational and private pensions are highly stratified by income, as are the value of the tax expenditures and subsidies used to encourage coverage. Similarly, health care reforms will increase individual out-of-pocket expenses, which will hit lower income groups harder. The disparities between private and public insurance have also increased, and the income-levels and conditions of medical practice for various specialties and health sectors are becoming more diversified. In both health and pensions, reforms mean that private actors—banks and insurance companies, on the one hand, and private, for-profit hospital chains, on the other—are gaining both in market share and political influence. Thus, while basic structures and programs remain intact, the social safety net has become substantially thinner. Third, the article argues that this pattern of institutional change is not new, but is typical of the politics of incrementalism that has characterized the German welfare state since its inception. I emphasize the impact of German political institutions, the structure of electoral competition, and the legacies of conservative social policy to explain this negotiated, incremental pattern of policy development. Bicameralism creates strong incentives for the major parties to compromise on social policy reforms, even when they express different social policy preferences in their electoral strategies. Indeed, the pattern of reform in pensions and health care since the 1990s shows that consensus social policy-making continues to flourish, despite claims to the contrary in the literature (see, for example, Trampusch 2009). Majority governments whose social policy legislation requires the consent of the Bundesrat are usually forced to compromise with the opposition. In making these compromises, the two major ‘Volk’ parties are torn between two imperatives: electoral competition based on the generosity of social benefits; and the highly-politicized rate of social insurance contributions, a legacy of the systems’ dependence on social insurance contribution financing. The parties’ partisan visions result in very different proposals to meet these goals; but in the end, the shared conviction that a balance between contribution rates and social spending is a systemic imperative provides the basis for compromise. These arguments challenge the existing literature in several ways. First, I characterize the trajectory of change not in terms of inevitable responses to negative policy feedbacks (Trampusch 2009; Streeck 2007), but rather as a process of on-going recalibration of highly institutionalized programs underpinned by conservative welfare principles. Reforms in both pensions and health care emphasize cost-cutting rather than paradigm shift, and the specific mix of instruments employed in this recalibration process is heavily mediated by political compromises. Second, the analysis emphasizes political decision-making rather than industrial relations as the key arena shaping reforms. In doing so, the article emphasizes the political origins of social policies and the ongoing political contestation that shapes social policy development. To be sure, party stances incorporate the views of societal stakeholders, but there is little evidence that changes in the political economy have been the primary driver of welfare state reforms. Nor is there convincing evidence that state intervention was intended to arrest institutional exhaustion caused by labor market practices. Third, the analysis casts doubt on the usefulness of the Varieties of Capitalism (VoC) framework for explaining social policy change. Indeed, there is little evidence that institutional isomorphism and complementarity between systems of social protection and education/industrial relations shaped reform in pensions and health care.",6

For most of the twentieth century, the richest markets for manufactured goods were also the largest and fastest growing ones. For German manufacturers, this meant that the bulk of their exports and FDI efforts targeted the developed (western) European, North American and North Asian economies. This geo-economic growth distribution, however, began to change in the last decade. Most forecasting agencies suggest that the new trends are likely to accelerate in the next several decadesFootnote 1. For example, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EUI) (2011) expects world real GDP growth to increase approximately 4 % yearly between 2010 and 2015. But the EUI projects OECD country growth rates to be only 2 % yearly, while non-OECD annual growth should exceed 7 % for the same time period. A different measure by the same institution shows Asia (including Japan) growing twice as fast as the rest of the world over the same time period (Fig. 1). In the same vein, the German Chamber of Commerce estimates that China will go from having 1/3 of potential middle class consumers as the United States (70 to 236 million) in 2001 to having well over twice as many in 2015 (700 to 284 million).Footnote 2 The later number shows that while current trends represent a relative shift in demand expansion, rather than an absolute locational shift, the quantitative levels separating the two markets are narrowing rapidly. Growth and price forecast. (Source: Economist Intelligence Unit 2011) In many specific industrial product areas, from consumer electronics and automobiles to hydro-electric turbines, the contrasting demand situations are quite dramatic. Developed markets have reached saturation points where demand is primarily driven by existing product replacement (when demand expands at all it is doing so in the low single digits), while there is double digit demand growth for the same products in developing Asia or other Brics. In the global electronic and electromechanical industries, for example, Deutsche Bank Research shows that between 1998 and 2007 US and German demand grew less than 2 %, while Chinese, Russian, Malaysian and Indonesian demand exceeded 10 % (Fig. 2). Emerging markets growing faster than developed markets. (Source: Rollwagen and Ranik 2012) Global machinery and automobile markets exhibit similar imbalances. The German Automobile Association (VDA) notes that developing countries accounted for just 22.3 % of global automobile demand in 2000, but expects this share to reach 48 % by 2020 (Fig. 3). The picture is very similar in the machinery industry. The German Machinery Association (VDMA) shows that by 2011 China became the world’s single largest machinery producing country, selling nearly twice as many machines (of all types)—€ 230 billion to € 563 billion—as Germany (Fig. 4). Our interviews with a German hydro-electric turbine manufacturer revealed that the company currently only sells replacement parts and components in Europe and North America. All new global demand for turn-key hydro-electric generating complexes comes from Latin America, Asia and Africa.Footnote 3
 Emerging market share of global passenger car demand World machinery sales 2011. (Source: http://www.produktion.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/weltmaschinenumsatz-vdma.jpg) These very significant relative manufacturing demand shifts are fostering a massive strategic shift in MNC developing economy strategies and, more specifically, in the relative weight of export vs FDI. In short, emerging market demand growth is so rapid, technologically challenging and quantitatively massive that it cannot be serviced through exports alone. Viewed by sector, the shift between export and FDI within German MNCs is very clear. German automobile producers, for example, currently manufacture more vehicles outside Germany than they produce inside Germany (Fig. 5). By far, the largest offshore production location for German car makers is China, followed by Spain, Brazil, the Czech Republic and Mexico (Fig. 6).Footnote 4
 Foreign output higher than domestic production. (Source: VDA Jahresbericht 2011) Offshore production of German passenger cars, by country. (Source: VDA Jahresbericht 2008) Trends in Machinery production are less pronounced; exports still overwhelm offshore production in most German machinery branches. In part, this stems from many producers’ small batch and customization orientation. Home facility capacity can accommodate the quantity and variety of world demand.Footnote 5 But the sector’s export direction and FDI trends follow the same general pattern being described here. Emerging markets, especially China, attracted enormous German output and FDI in the last ten years. Take, by way of illustration, the direction of German machine tool exports. In 1984, China took only 1.2 % of total exports, while the US was Germany’s largest single country customer, at 11.3 % of exports. By 2011, however, China was Germany’s single largest export market, taking 29 % of machine tool exports. The US was second with a comparatively modest 9.1 % share (Fig. 7). FDI trends follow this export shift. While the US still remains the largest German FDI location (with 15.7 % of German machinery FDI in 2006), China’s share grew significantly. As late as 2001, China received only 2.1 % of total German machinery FDI, but by 2006, China had a 5.2 % share.Footnote 6
 German machine tool exports: major customer markets. (Source: VDMA 2012) The numbers show that German MNCs are trending toward local production in offshore markets rather than relying, as they traditionally have, mainly on exports. This issue is more pressing for the automobile industry than it is for the machinery industry. But as the data on the machine tool industry show, the issue is non-trivial for many machinery producers as well. This shift has to be understood strategically: German MNCs build up design and production competence in important, large foreign markets because they believe that is the best way to gain market share there. This shift should not be viewed, however, as a move to abandon exports as a strategic capability. Exporting ability is a crucial strategic element in a MNC’s repertoire enabling it to balance global production capabilities and capacities. Indeed, intra MNC production competence reallocation seems to be re-casting which units export (and to whom) rather than eliminating the practice. In many cases, new MNC production locations in China, Brazil or the US are now just as likely to export their products to third markets as are German and European locations. The mix of local production and export is produced by strategic calculations within MNCs that involve global considerations of cost, capacity and stakeholder interest. Many strategic concerns involving the relationship between export and offshore production are perennial and familiar, such as the desire to avoid currency unpredictability or tariff discrimination by host country governments (e.g. Caves 2007). But increased offshore investment and upgrading enhances many traditional headaches associated with exporting and introduces additional strategic problems. For example, a major traditional factor working against exclusive reliance on exports is receiver market regulations and standards. This problem intensified in recent years as offshore markets became larger and more complex. The more receiver market regulations and standards diverge from the home country’s, the more special design and production adjustments are required to make the product “sellable” in a foreign market. The larger the target market, the greater the claim this special attention makes on home location design and production capacity. Beyond a certain volume (which varies by technology, product and receiver country regulations and standards), such adaptations overburden home country operations. As a result, the argument for shifting those investments to the market they are being made for becomes compelling. Additionally, large offshore and emerging markets have very distinctive consumer cultures with specific product design and performance preferences. The more intractably idiosyncratic market tastes are, and the larger the target market, the more practical and cost effective design and production localization becomes. The “intractability” of local preferences and tastes is especially high when there is intense producer market competition. Firms—other MNC competitors as well as indigenous producers– compete for market share by appealing to local preferences in their product designs. If the market is large and intensely competitive—as it is in China or in the United States—then local design and production is advantageous. Local designers are more familiar with (often rapidly shifting) local preferences than far off German designers are. Local production facilities can adjust more rapidly to product changes and innovations because, unlike the larger home production facilities, they don’t have to compete for internal production capacity with lines devoted to other export markets. In this way, local upgrading enhances offshore subsidiary competitiveness. Localizing design and production operations, finally, are not only strategic responses to regulatory and market factors, they also create strategic advantages. Above all, local design and production capacity facilitates local materials and components sourcing. Automobile and machinery industry material inputs and components outside of Germany are often less expensive and lower in quality than they are in Germany. Since offshore competitors use these inputs in third markets, German producers are pushed to do the same to avoid being priced out of the market– especially in mid-range markets where cost competes with quality in the consumer choice. Adjusting product designs and production processes to accommodate different quality materials and components, however, is most effectively accomplished locally, with designers and purchasing agents familiar with indigenous resource markets. Making such changes nearby also avoids the costly possibility that home country engineers and production personnel might block such changes on the grounds that they degrade the product and violate basic design standards. In short, design and production localization can create strategic advantage in foreign markets by facilitating cost reduction and minimizing internal resistance to change. Finally, one shouldn’t go too far in emphasizing the trend toward “producing where you sell”. Localization does not completely eliminate old style export from home market plants as a strategic component within the MNC arsenal. First, the most high-end vehicles in German automobile companies product spectrum are still made in Germany and exported to markets all over the world. This is possible because volumes for any particular market are small and therefore the associated adaptation costs (compliance with local regulations and standards) are not too expensive or too capacity demanding. A similar logic is at work in many machinery sub-sectors. Secondly, in general, for all products, regardless of the value or market segment, whether one exports or shifts production to a foreign market is a cost and available capacity question. If it is possible to service demand in a foreign market with product made in German factories without incurring excessive adaptation costs or over-burdening indigenous production lines, then exporting is preferable to off-shoring and localization. Conceiving of offshore production expansion and export capability retention as strategic tools is not only a departure from traditional German MNC practice. It is also part of a larger global competitive strategy reconceptualization process within MNCs. Traditionally, German firms saw their competitive strength in product quality and technological sophistication. Classically, they avoided price competition by targeting high-end customers or customers with special needs, most of whom were located in highly developed political economies. Now, however, German manufacturers see their advantage differently. Instead of insulating their products from price competition through the production of esoteric and highly specialized technologies, they emphasize the internal and external processual capabilities associated with product development engineering and manufacturing. This enables continuous innovation at a high and ever changing technological level, while simultaneously lowering the overall cost structure. Three factors account for this movement from one strategy to the other. First, German competitor product quality is improving, making the boundaries with high end products less clear, and hence, competitor products more attractive. Further, German MNC competitors do not simply come from the traditional group of highly developed countries. There are also important emerging market economy competitors. This is especially true in many machinery and automobile component sectors. German producers can still try to leverage their engineering expertise and reputation to stay competitive at the higher end of product markets. But the location of the “high end” is constantly changing. This pressures German players to focus on costs and emphasize constant innovation (c.f. Brandt and Thun 2010; Herrigel et al. 2013, 2014). Second, the bulk of offshore automobile and machinery market demand is for high quality middle range products. (Herrigel et al. 2013, 2014; Brandt and Thun 2010). Demand for German quality products is modest in the advanced markets and is too small in emerging ones to produce significant growth. German MNC manufacturers believe that if they want to continue to grow, they must become competitive in offshore market segments in which cost and manufacturing quality play a decisive role. Ignoring rapidly growing middle range demand in favor of high value added niche markets both threatens stagnation and creates the possibility that German producers will lose touch with the specific technical and production needs that customers in emerging markets are developing. Third, global competition fosters innovation by challenging and destabilizing traditional market strategies, firm competences and roles. Often this is portrayed exclusively as a high technology phenomenon (Zysman and Breznitz 2012; Berger 2013). Innovation in information technologies, new media, and bio-engineering create whole new industries, challenge traditional firms and elevate new corporate players and new more open practice and governance forms to prominence. As significant as those on-going transformations are, they divert the eye from the turbulent innovation, product and process transformation dynamics occurring in more “traditional” sectors, such as automobiles and machinery. Consider the introduction of micro-electronics, new materials (such as plastics and composite materials) and, most recently, hybrid and other alternative energy technologies in the automobile industry. In order to incorporate these new technologies into their products, firms must quickly re-allocate resources for new competence development. This generates not only acute cost consciousness (devoting resources to future innovation means that actors in the present must make do with less), it also leads to extensive vertical disintegration. Firms move in new directions by hiring and collaborating with outside specialists who work jointly with them to develop new products. They save costs by sub-contracting component manufacturing to specialized suppliers who have greater expertise and can more efficiently produce them. Innovation, constant cost reduction and the strategic supply chain enhancement are all of a piece (Herrigel 2010). Through these shifts in practice, German MNCs dynamically reconceive their competitive advantages. Rather than looking to avoid competition by insulating themselves in high-end niches, German producers now leverage innovation, cost control and supply chains to beat their competition with ever improving products and customer solutions. Competitiveness lies less in the control of a particular technology or product, and much more in a firm’s ability to continuously learn and innovate in ways that change the technology and respond to customer desires in a cost competitive way. At the limit, just as it overturns the opposition between offshore production and export, the new strategy also increasingly ignores the distinction between manufacturing and services. German manufacturing MNCs are not merely particular product manufacturers, they are continuously innovative experts in sophisticated (and rapidly changing) areas of technical consumer desire. This latter element drives, in particular, machinery industry emerging market FDI. These global German MNC strategic product development and production shifts pose significant governance challenges. Firms must optimize exports with global production capacity while simultaneously reconciling constant imperatives for process and product optimization, innovation, cost reduction and learning, not only within individual plants, but also centrally and locally across vast global organizations. This is not easy: innovation can increase costs; optimization and cost reduction can undermine learning; too much local autonomy can generate centrifugal pressures weakening the various forms of leverage (learning, knowledge, purchasing) that come with global concern membership; too much central direction can undermine local innovation and organizational capabilities crucial for competitive advantage in foreign markets. Not only that, global competition is so dynamic that there is never a natural sweet-spot in which all of these competing goals and pressures can be stably reconciled or a happy equilibrium attained. New products, technical innovation, competition among suppliers, new local regulations, currency value shifts, organizational learning induced possibility –and much more—constantly destabilize the ordered practices that firms develop and generate new adjustment and governance challenges. Innovation, cost reduction and learning are imperatives for all actors throughout MNC operations. Yet environmental uncertainty is so great that at any given moment players have no clear sense of what strategy would be most optimal for them to achieve those goals. In this context, traditional top down principal-agent management practices do not work. They rely on the ability of higher-level management to set effective strategy and provide lower-level actors with clear incentives to fulfill tasks. In the current continuously changing environment, however, higher-level management does not have sufficient knowledge of lower-level conditions to create effective incentives. Moreover, actors at lower levels are faced with unpredictable destabilizations on their terrain which affect their roles and interests in ways that make centrally imposed incentives either irrelevant or counter productive. In response, firms are abandoning these hierarchical arrangements for more mutually dependent and cooperative arrangements between central and local players that allow for continuous organizational self-recomposition. The logic of the new governance forms is best illustrated by the widely proliferating formalized “experimentalist” systems, such as corporate (Ganzheitliche) production systems (CPSs).Footnote 7 CPSs are formal systems that organize group or stakeholder based goal setting within firms to achieve product and process innovation, optimization (cost reduction) and learning on a continuous basis.Footnote 8 The systems are rooted in team goal setting procedures (regular goal setting meetings) and constitute a hierarchical architecture of team based goal conversations, ultimately linking (through many mediations) the shop floor to the top management. The conversations are also systematically cross-functional—in the best systems, cross-functionality runs throughout the firm, from the shop floor to top executive suites. And, crucially for the story here, the team conversations are global. Product, customer, design and manufacturing, and continuous improvement teams all are constituted in multiple locations and form super-ordinate or umbrella teams that engage with one another across markets and geographical space to identify common goals and standards. Local experiments are continuously and openly compared (and defended). The following example, reconstructed from interviews at a German Truck and Omnibus transmission producer, illustrates the globally recursive and learning elements of these systems.Footnote 9 The process begins with joint German design and manufacturing teams in South Germany developing a new variant of a medium sized transmission for the global market. Technical specifications, cost targets, and manufacturing time are worked out in an iterative process of experimentation and exchange between design and manufacturing engineers, the prototyping workshop and the home location shop floor. Conversations between this product team and a higher-level global strategy team, very early on, suggest that the transmission will also be produced in China, Russia, India and other emerging markets. Design and manufacturing teams from these markets are incorporated into the development process and technical specifications, cost targets and manufacturing cycle parameters (metrics and standards) for those markets are provisionally established. We followed the transfer of the technology to the Chinese markets. German design and manufacturing engineers, as well as skilled workers from the proto-type workshop and home location shop floor, travel to China to assist local engineers and workers with the initial production set up. Local Chinese engineers educate their skeptical German counterparts about the Chinese location’s possibilities and limits. Adjustments along several dimensions are made locally, involving a variety of metrics and standards on input materials, contour design, machine usage and cycle time. Engineers from the transmission producer’s Chinese design center are called in to assist the collaborating teams with these adjustments. Design and production metrics and standards are altered, so the German design office is consulted to approve suggested changes to the original targets. The local production and design teams defend the changes to the central teams. In the process, the central team notices that the adjustments in manufacturing flow can be used for the same product in eastern European and in Indian production locations. Changes are made to the central design. Production performance both in Germany and in offshore locations is, in this systematic fashion, regularly reviewed, metrics and standards are optimized, and roles and relations recomposed. All of this iterated transfer and exchange occurs within the company’s CPS language and team based procedures, which requires regular goal setting and performance review meetings. CPSs insist on explicit, written down, metric and standards specification. Significantly, stakeholder teams working with agreed upon metrics and standards drive each step in this development and transfer process. The jointly defined standards and metrics serve as benchmarks for local experimentation. Iterated revision, guided by the formal metrics, characterizes the entire process. Transnational know-how transfer and experience driven learning, facilitated by team interactions, are systematic features of this system. There is, moreover, recursivity in the system as the central (Germany based) teams learn from local (China based) team experiments, even as the latter are learning from the former. Finally, metric and standards revision involves organizational role and rule changes. Design and production labor allocation is continuously optimized and varied. Stakeholder interests are not aligned by the system, they are continuously changed through metric and standard creation, performance review and optimization processes.Footnote 10
 These CPS dynamics pervade contemporary global corporate behavior, across a remarkable array of sectors. The new governance forms identify possibilities for learning and innovation and diffuse discoveries throughout the global firm. German producers regard such governance skills as a competitive advantage (Friedli and Schuh 2013; Heil et al. 2013).",27

Max Weber, Werner Sombart and others used this notion to describe the specific characteristics of the German economy in the early 20th century. Socialists like Hilferding used it to highlight specific forms of industrial cartelization and close relations between banks and large enterprises (Hilferding 1910). Several decades later, in the mid-1970s, the social-democratic chancellor Helmut Schmidt started his election campaign using the motto “Modell Deutschland” as a specific response to the structural challenges experienced after the deep supply shocks of the oil-price crisis that took place at that time. Despite its fuzziness, the notion of the German model has played a central role in the debate on the varieties of capitalism since the early 1990s (Esping-Andersen 1990, Albert 1993; Streeck 1992, 1997; Hall and Soskice 2001a). The basic claim in the debate is that `capitalism’ or market societies may be organized in rather different forms. These differences include wage bargaining and other labor market institutions, the stance towards active labor market policy, the organization and generosity of the social security system, forms of cooperation between social partners or interest groups, educational systems and forms of economic specialization, among others. The traditional German model has been characterized along these dimensions in the literature. Shortly after re-unification, some authors were already skeptical about the chances that the specific “German” variety of capitalism would survive in the face of financial strain and “globalization,” i.e., under conditions of growing integration into the world economy, offshoring and high capital mobility (Streeck 1997). This skepticism was strengthened at the beginning of the millennium when the German economy in general and German labor market in particular came under pressure. Was there an erosion of the fundamental features of the German model, culminating in the labor market reforms of 2003–2005 and Chancellor Gerhard Schröder’s “Agenda 2010”? Did these developments mean that the German model had been abandoned? In the following, I will argue that—in order to adapt to new conditions in the European and world economy—the German economy and social system had to be transformed along several dimensions. Some of the core elements of the system were weakened and others were strengthened. Overall, the German variety of capitalism is still intact, although an increasing dualism might threaten the concept of a solidaristic society. Hence, this raises the question of how these tendencies can be counteracted without jeopardizing the indisputable economic successes and marked favorable labor market development of the country. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, I discuss the various features ascribed to the German model in the literature and suggest an eclectic approach to obtain a workable definition. Section 3 analyzes the long-term creeping threat to the German model of steadily growing unemployment and globalization. Section 4 addresses the Hartz reforms and the rationale behind the reform process. Section 5 describes the concepts and effects of the reform. The challenges to the German model are the subject of Sect. 6. Finally, Sect. 7 contains a discussion of the results and the conclusion.",10

German cohort study on work, age and health",October 2015,Angela Rauch,Anja Burghardt,Silke Tophoven,Female,Female,Female,Female,"In the next several decades, the age composition of the German labour force will change significantly. Among other factors, this change is driven by the ageing of the baby boomer cohorts, born in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Subsequent birth cohorts are comparatively smaller. Thus, the working population’s average age will continually increase while the size of the working population will decrease (Fuchs et al. 2011; Fuchs et al. 2008). Meanwhile, the statutory retirement age was raised from 65 to 67 years of age. Currently, the baby boomers are at the threshold of higher working age. The labour participation of baby boomers is high, with a labour force participation rate of approx. 90 % among men and 80 % among women. Although the baby boomers entered the labour market in an economically difficult time, on average, their employment trajectories can be considered to be stable today (Tisch and Tophoven 2012). However, the baby boomers’ future transition into retirement and the general demographic shift will result in an increasing old-age dependency ratio and challenge the German social system in an unprecedented way. To remain competitive and to relieve the social system, policymakers have attempted to reduce pathways to early retirement and to preserve the workability of the elderly. The preservation of the workability is of increasing importance, as the statutory retirement age was raised to counter the demographic pressure on the social system. In this environment, the baby boomer generation is the pathfinder cohort as it will be the first cohort that has to work until a higher age than previous birth cohorts.Footnote 1
 Individual health and healthy working conditions are basic requirements to prolong individuals’ working lives. To preserve workability until higher working ages, the promotion and maintenance of individual health is of increasing importance. Some previous studies consider the interrelation between individual health and ageing (Kocka and Staudinger 2009); others are concerned with the association between health, work and employment (Schuring et al. 2007; Benach et al. 2004; Bound et al. 1999). The new cohort study “lidA – leben in der Arbeit. German cohort Study on work, age and health” combines both approaches, and for the first time, allows investigation of the interrelations between individual ageing, work related factors and health among two baby boomer cohorts.",4

However, more recent national policies have been influenced by the European Employment Strategy and force older workers to remain in the labour market longer (Annesley 2007). In Germany, these policies, together with growing employment participation by women, have resulted in continuously rising labour market participation rates of workers aged 50 years and older. Meanwhile, early retirement appears to persist: Currently, a significant number, approximately 20 %, of annual retirees make use of disability pensions to withdraw from employment (Deutsche Rentenversicherung 2013). Individual retirement decisions mirror institutional retirement pathways (Fasang 2010) and personal preferences and agencies (Higgs et al. 2003). Early retirement therefore is a result of individual preferences as well as legal frameworks. For the baby boomersFootnote 1, as the next generation of pensioners in Germany, most institutional retirement pathways have been closed. Early retirement, especially before the age of 60, is only possible due to work disability and the allowance of disability pensions. However, the allowance of disability pensions is subject to rigorous examination, and only individuals with serious health concerns are considered. A great number of individuals consider withdrawal from employment due to individual health impairments without pension payments. Research indicates that early retirement is closely associated with health and that impaired physical or mental health is the main reason for early labour market withdrawal (Cai and Kalb 2006; van den Berg et al. 2010b; Siegrist et al. 2006). However, work motivation and individuals’ perceptions of their physical and mental work ability have also been argued to influence employment decisions (Taylor and Shore 1995; van Dam et al. 2009; Tuomi et al. 2001). In this sense, Peter and Hasselhorn (2013) even argue that in modern societies, poor health may no longer directly influence labour market exit because occupational health and safety measures, compensating technical aids and organisational arrangements might help include people with health-related impairments in the labour market. Rather, the perception of whether one is able to perform the required tasks in a particular workplace (self-perceived work ability) and is willing to participate in the labour market (work motivation) should have a direct influence on the immediate decision to exit employment. To promote work participation for those at advanced working age, disentangling health from the perception of work ability and preference for work appears necessary (Chirikos 1993). Therefore, this study asks how self-perceived work ability and work motivation mediate the relationship between health and labour market exit. Better knowledge of the associations among health, work ability and work motivation and the influence of these issues on actual labour market participation for those of advanced working age will allow policy makers and human resources managers to support longer employment of older workers. Several studies have examined the association between health and labour market participation (see e.g. van den Berg et al. 2010b; Bound et al. 1999; Alavinia and Burdorf 2008), and other studies have considered the influence of health and working conditions on work ability and work motivation (Siegrist et al. 2006; Wahrendorf et al. 2013). The interdependent influences of health, work ability and work motivation on actual labour market participation among ageing employees have not been the focus of previous research. Additionally, previous approaches studying health, work ability or work motivation of older workers concentrate on individuals close to retirement age. However, I argue that today’s older workers are very heterogeneous, particularly in terms of their labour market experience and educational background. Cohorts close to retirement show lower average levels of education and more stable employment trajectories than those currently reaching higher working age. Therefore, different age cohorts within the group of older workers should be analysed independently. This study concentrates on two cohorts born within the German baby boom (in 1959 and 1965) for at least two reasons: First, by the time of retirement, the baby boomers will dramatically increase the old age dependency ratio and challenge the social security systems, such as the pension system or health care system. Therefore, the state has a particular interest in encouraging these cohorts to abstain from early retirement. In fact, the baby boomers are the first cohort whose official retirement age has been raised to 67. Second, the baby boom cohorts are currently too young for institutional pathways to early retirement other than disability pensions. While many of the older cohorts had the opportunity to retire early, most institutional pathways to early retirement are closed for the baby boom cohorts (Buchholz et al. 2013; Ebbinghaus and Hofäcker 2013). As in many other modern societies, the “early exit trend” is no longer sustainable in Germany (Stattin 2005), and individuals are expected to continue working until they reach the official retirement age. Therefore, labour market exit due to institutional retirement incentives is currently almost impossible among the ageing baby boom cohorts, and policies encouraging employees to remain in the labour market target the baby boomers in particular. In the following section, I review the debate on health, work ability, work motivation and labour market withdrawal at advanced working age before discussing relevant theoretical considerations in Section Three. In Section Four, the hypotheses tested in this approach are summarised. Section Five introduces the data used and the methods applied. Section Six summarises the results, and Section Seven concludes the study by discussing the findings.",9
48,3,Journal for Labour Market Research,25 July 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-014-0165-2,Working in gender-dominated occupations and depressive symptoms: findings from the two age cohorts of the lidA study,October 2015,Silke Tophoven,Jean-Baptist du Prel,Veronika Kretschmer,Female,Unknown,Female,Female,"Depression is the mental disease leading to the highest percentage of sickness absence of all mental diseases in Germany (Techniker Krankenkasse 2008). Working days lost due to mental disorders show the highest increase since 2000, while decreasing for all other diseases. In general, the prevalence of depressive symptoms is higher in women than in men (e.g., Kessler 2003; Nolen-Hoeksema 2001). Accordingly, the percentage of mental disorders, especially of depression and other affective disorders, of all reasons for sickness absence is also higher in women than in men (Meyer et al. 2012). Furthermore, mental disorders were the main reason for the transition to disability pension (men: 35.2 %; women: 47.4 %) in 2011 (Deutsche Rentenversicherung Bund 2012). The investigation of work-related causes for depressive symptoms is therefore of high medical as well as economic relevance (Jacobi et al. 2004; Rau et al. 2010; Techniker Krankenkasse 2008). Nowadays, employees of both genders are increasingly faced with work-related factors for poor mental health, which can also be traced back to the gender-segregated labour market and typically male and female work tasks (Bildt and Michélsen 2002; Payne and Doyal 2010). In Germany, there is evidence that the prevalence of mental disorders differs strongly by occupation and occupational sector. Persons employed in the service sector and in emotionally involving occupations show a higher prevalence of sickness absence caused by mental disorders (Meyer et al. 2012). In particular in strongly gender-segregated occupations, both genders show a higher incidence rate of work-related hassles, job strain and sickness absence. Women in male-dominated occupations tend to report more anxiety or mood disorders (Evans and Steptoe 2002; Hensing and Alexanderson 2004; Mota et al. 2012), while male employees in female-dominated occupations report more ill-health symptoms (Svedberg et al. 2009). Moreover, for women, Peter et al. (2006) detect a relationship between over-commitment and working in male-dominated occupations examining myocardial infarction risk. Thus, working as minority group in opposite-gender dominated settings seems to be a risk factor for poor health. According to literature research, several work-related psychosocial factors are also related to mental health. For instance, perceived work stress functions as a strong predictor of depression among men and women (Munce et al. 2006). This association also became apparent when using one of the best established instruments to measure work-related stress: the effort-reward imbalance model (e.g., Godin et al. 2005; Schulz et al. 2011; Tsutsumi et al. 2012). Furthermore, inter-role conflicts emerging from both work and family demands can be reported to lead to negative work-related, non-work-related and stress-related consequences (Allen et al. 2000). Several studies have already shown a significant association between work-family conflict and depression (e.g., Kato and Yamazaki 2009; Wang et al. 2012). In this context, depression can also be determined as one stress-related health complaint (van Veldhoven and Beijer 2012). Against this background, we aim to answer the question to what extent depressive symptoms are associated with employment in gender-dominated occupations with particular regard to women in male-dominated occupations in comparison to women in female-dominated occupations and to men in female-dominated occupations in comparison to men in male-dominated occupations. We examine these relationships separately for men and women. Additionally, we adjust the relationship between occupational gender segregation and depressive symptoms for perceived work stress and work-family conflict. To better understand possible associations between working in gender-dominated occupations and depressive symptoms, we also aim at investigating the role of interactions between gender domination and work stress as well as work-family conflict in association with depressive symptoms. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 provides a theoretical background as well as an overview on previous research related to our research questions and leads to concluding assumptions. In Sect. 3 we describe methods and data used. Our results are presented in Sect. 4. The last section concludes with a discussion of the results as well as strengths and limitations of our study and concluding remarks on our findings.",9

Ergebnisse eines faktoriellen Surveys,December 2015,Christina Neeß,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Personalentscheider sehen sich im Auswahlprozess neuer Mitarbeiter ex ante unvollständiger Information hinsichtlich der Produktivität von Bewerbern ausgesetzt (Arrow 1973; Garibaldi 2006; Spence 1973). Diese Informationsasymmetrie betrifft ein suchendes Unternehmen vor allem dann, wenn es um die Rekrutierung von Berufsanfängern geht: Mit vergleichsweise wenig Erfahrung ausgestattet zeigt der Berufseinsteiger in seiner Bewerbung geringfügige verlässliche Information anhand derer ein Personalverantwortlicher die Entscheidung über eine Einstellung treffen kann (Altonji und Pierret 2001). Bei der Gruppe der Hochschulabsolventen kommt dieser Mechanismus vor dem Hintergrund des umgreifenden Wandels, den die deutsche Hochschullandschaft derzeitig erlebt, besonders zum Tragen. Mit der Bologna-Reform hat sich die Studienstruktur in Deutschland flächendeckend verändert, indem Diplom und Magister weitestgehend von neu strukturierten Studiengängen mit Bachelor- und Masterabschlüssen abgelöst wurden. Infolgedessen herrscht vor allem bei der Einschätzung der Bachelor-Abschlüsse derzeitig noch eine große Unsicherheit seitens der Unternehmen bzw. deren Personalverantwortlichen (vgl. z. B. Banscherus et al. 2010). Diese Entwicklungen verstärken somit die ohnehin von Unsicherheit geprägte Rekrutierung von Hochschulabsolventen. In diesem Sinne stellt sich die Frage, auf welche Bewerberkriterien Arbeitgeber achten und ob die Reputation von Universitäten und Hochschulen im Auswahlprozess Hilfestellung bietet. Der Ruf einer Organisation kann sich über verschiedene Kanäle, wie beispielsweise durch die Presse (Fombrun und Shanley 1990) oder durch Informationen aus dem persönlichen Netzwerk, auf das der nachfragende Akteur zurückgreifen kann, verbreiten (Abraham und Meyer 2012; Buskens und Weesie 2000; Uzzi und Lancaster 2004). Im speziellen Kontext der Hochschulreputation nehmen seit einiger Zeit Hochschulrankings eine bedeutsame Rolle ein, da derartige Rangvergleiche Studieninteressierten, Hochschulmanagern und nicht zuletzt Personalentscheidern mehr Informationen zu den Inhalten und der Qualität einzelner Bildungseinrichtungen liefern sollen (Dill und Soo 2005). Auf Grundlage dieser Überlegungen greift der vorliegende Beitrag das Problem der Informationsasymmetrie im Auswahlprozess von Hochschulabsolventen auf. Hierbei wird untersucht, auf welche Bewerbermerkmale Entscheider in Unternehmen bei der Vorauswahl potenzieller Mitarbeiter achten. Dabei soll auch geklärt werden, in welchem Ausmaß der Name einer Universität von Personalentscheidern als Informationsmerkmal wahrgenommen und in den Auswahlprozess einbezogen wird. Zur Untersuchung der skizzierten Forschungsfragen werden vor dem Hintergrund humankapital- und signaltheoretischer Überlegungen Hypothesen aufgestellt. Ergänzt werden diese durch Annahmen zur Bedeutung von Netzwerken und dem Einfluss räumlicher Nähe von Organisationen. Die empirische Überprüfung basiert auf Daten einer bundesweiten Befragung unter Fachführungskräften in Unternehmen, bei der erfragt wurde, welche Kriterien bei der Einstellung von Hochschulabsolventen wirtschaftswissenschaftlicher Studiengänge wichtig sind. Für die Fragestellung dieses Beitrags erfolgt die Analyse von Daten aus dem in die Studie integrierten faktoriellen Survey. In dem experimentell angelegten Design haben rund 1000 Befragte die Qualifikation fiktiver Bewerber bewertet. Auf dieser Grundlage wird der Einfluss individueller Kompetenzen im Vergleich zur Bedeutung von Hochschulreputation untersucht.",2

The widespread thesis is that this technology is opening completely new and unknown technology application potentials with no less than disruptive social and economic consequences (Avant 2014). In this view, a new era is recognizable that in the international debate is variously called the “second machine age” (Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014), the “third industrial revolution” (Rifkin 2011) or, in the German-speaking world, the “fourth industrial revolution”—respectively, “Industry 4.0” (research Union and acatech 2013). Without question, this debate has all the characteristics of “hype”: spectacular changes and prospects are predicted and, in professional circles, politics and far beyond, no other issue is so often attributed such an important role in the visions of future social and economic development. One is reminded of the second half of the 1990s as the New Economy’s “multimedia”, “World Wide Web” and “e-commerce” seemed to hail the advent of a new societal prosperity. Therefore some observers of the current development wonder whether the current debate is perhaps just “new wine” being poured into “old bottles” (e.g. Jasperneite 2012). In summing up this debate however, beyond all the rhetorical exaggerations there are some quite convincing arguments for the reality of an advance in technological development that is now taking place, the structural consequences of which are still hardly foreseeable. The assumption is that the development of digital technologies has reached a stage that is opening up entirely new qualities of application that are not structurally comparable to those of previous decades. To ground this claim of a new quality of technological development with considerably widened application potentials and structure-changing consequences, the literature invokes almost unanimously what has been a virtual leap in the technological progress of recent years (for different perspectives see e.g. Geisberger and Broy 2012; Avant 2014; Brynjolfsson and McAffee 2014, p. 4; Evangelista et al. 2014). This development, for the majority of authors, has brought an extremely ambivalent social change: the one hand, very beneficial consequences particularly for income and potential for consumption. On the other hand digitization also brings some very thorny challenges in terms of accompanying changes to economic structures and work. In the following therefore, digitization refers to the process of socioeconomic change triggered by the introduction of digital technology, the application systems based on it, and especially, their production networks (Hess 2015). Here two phases of digitization can be distinguished: In the first phase, this process has already been established since at least the end of the 1990s in those sectors of the economy where the production, consumption and communication is directly based on intangible transactions and the use of data and information. These are above all service sectors such as music production and distribution, publishing and press, or also financial services, the digitization of which has meant far-reaching structural changes in individual business models as well as company and industry branch structures (Zuboff 2010; Brynjolfsson and McAfee 2014). Amazon is often cited as an example of cases where it makes less and less sense to ask whether a company is a retailer, logistics company, web-based service company or—as one might think more recently—perhaps also a grocer. For this company like many similar ones, it is rather only the systematic use of “big data” that is the basis of its business model. Today however, already a second phase of the process aims to realize the digitization of physical objects of all kinds. Shoshana Zuboff calls this development a “second-wave mutation” of the technological and related socioeconomic change (Zuboff 2010, p. 8). In a primarily technological perspective this context is also called the “Internet of things” (e.g. Fleisch and Mattern 2005; Bullinger and ten Hompel 2007). Here are spoken of “cyber-physical systems” (CPS) which open huge and previously unknown potential for many different application areas such as housing, medical, or transportation systems, in addition to general industrial production (e.g. Geisberger and Broy 2012). By the term CPS is understood the information technology interaction between, on the one hand, physical systems with embedded software, and, on the other hand, global data networks with distributed and interactive application systems. More concretely, CPS means “smart” and “intelligent” devices, vehicles and equipment, as well as the logistics, coordination and management processes that are linked to advanced Internet applications. The hypothesis has therefore also been formulated that digitization is now on the point of encroaching on the core areas of economic activity and thus of creating a hitherto unknown connectedness between completely new application areas and their societal consequences. The materiality of the processes in question however makes this new digitization wave far more complex than the previous one (e.g. Zuboff 2010; Geisberger and Broy 2012). A main thematic point of the current debate is the digitization of industrial production and logistics, respectively the industrial application of CPS technologies which has been propagated since 2011 especially in Germany by computer and engineering researchers, influential business associations, technology-intensive companies in the electrical and mechanical engineering industries, as well as policymakers under the catchy label “Industry 4.0” (research Union and acatech 2013). On the one hand this connects to long-discussed and partially realized production concepts based on a progressive integrated use of databases for planning, managing and monitoring of production (e.g. Westkämper et al. 2007). Prominent among these was already in the 1980s the concept “Computer Integrated Manufacturing” (CIM) (Harrington 1973; Scheer 1987; Hirsch-Kreinsen et al. 1990). On the other hand it is stressed that Industry 4.0, compared to the previous approaches, is aiming for a completely new level of process automation. Through highly flexible Internet linkage of data levels with real factory processes, fundamentally new potentials for the planning, control and the organization of production processes and entire value chains are being opened. In addition, it is emphasized that the advanced use of customer and market data now possible is a prerequisite to the development of entirely new business models and the acquisition of new market segments (e.g. Broy 2010; Reinhart et al. 2013; Sendler 2013). Overall therefore, all the authors therefore assume that with the realization and diffusion of Industry 4.0 systems, as well as generally with the increasing digitization of social and economic processes, conversion processes will be triggered that in the longer term are sustainable but not yet foreseeable in their consequences for socioeconomic structures and particularly, for labor (e.g. Hirsch-Kreinsen et al. 2015).",161
49,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,02 March 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-016-0196-y,Imbalanced Job Polarization and Skills Mismatch in Europe,July 2016,Theo Sparreboom,Alexander Tarvid,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"An adequately educated and trained labour force is essential for economic growth. Education and training raise the productivity of workers and create capacity to innovate and adopt new technologies. Conversely, shortages of educated and skilled workers, or workers with education and skills that do not match labour market needs, lower the potential for growth and may raise unemployment. However, translating ‘adequate’ into concrete education and training policies is a challenging task, not least because jobs are continuously changing. Structural change, technological change, globalization and trade have a bearing on the tasks and duties performed in our economies, which are to an important extent reflected in differential changes in job growth across occupations. These changes in the occupational structure, by implication, affect the economy-wide requirements in terms of education and skills of workers. Furthermore, various imperfections in labour markets give rise to skills mismatch, and this issue has risen on policy agendas because of the skills-intensive nature of much economic and technological change, as well as the impact of the economic crisis (Cedefop 2010; European Commission 2012; World Economic Forum 2014). This paper considers the education and training of the labour force based on an analysis of trends in and the relationships between job polarization and skills mismatch. Both job polarization and skills mismatch have become topics of increasing interest, but most of the literature has focused either on skills mismatch or on job polarization, and not on possible relationships between the two. Nevertheless, such relationships have been suggested in the literature on job polarization (Goos and Manning 2007). Job polarization means that the share of high- and low-skill jobs grow at the expense of medium-skill jobs, and such trends have been linked to the decline in the demand for routine or codifiable tasks, including both manual and cognitive tasks (Acemoglu and Autor 2011; Goos et al. 2014, 2013). Starting from a hypothetical steady state in the labour market in which the supply of education and skills perfectly matches demand, and all jobs are fulfilled by adequately trained workers, polarization would have several effects that could increase skills mismatch. In particular, in the absence of a supply response, underqualification could be expected to rise among workers performing the growing share of high-skill jobs, while overqualification would rise for workers performing low-skill jobs, if these jobs are increasingly taken by workers previously employed in medium-skill jobs. Whether such trends would materialize is uncertain for at least three reasons. Firstly, the supply of educated workers in many countries is on an upward trend, which may or may not be in accordance with the increasing share of high-skill jobs. Secondly, the literature suggests that labour markets are often characterized by a certain extent of skills mismatch, and different starting positions with regard to current or past levels of skills mismatch will clearly affect how polarization at the demand side will play out. In theory, if the supply of educated workers is polarized (in the sense of relatively high shares of workers with low and high levels of education), polarization at the demand side could lead to a reduction of measured levels of skills mismatch. Finally, job polarization may interact with unemployment, which adds to the uncertainty with regard to labour market outcomes if workers with different levels of education are affected differently by unemployment. Therefore, the relationship between polarization and skills mismatch seems an empirical matter. We analyse the relationships between imbalanced job polarization and skills mismatch at two levels in European countries. At the country-level, we estimate a system of two equations, one for each of the country-level variables gauging imbalanced polarization and mismatch, respectively. The main result is that imbalanced job polarization decreases mismatch between skills demand and skills supply proxied by level of educational attainment, but there is no statistically significant effect from skills mismatch to imbalanced job polarization. Thereafter we consider the individual-level and study the determinants of mismatch by running multi-level mixed effects logistic models. Determinants are divided into two categories: individual-level and macro-level, and imbalanced job polarization is one of the macro-level determinants. The main result is that the effect of imbalanced job polarization on individual-level mismatch was arguably favourable for individuals in non-crisis time (it decreases overeducation risk although it increases the chances of undereducation, both gauged using the normative measure) but unfavourable during the global financial crisis of 2008–2009 and the following two years. The effect on overeducation gauged by the statistical measure is the opposite to the effect based on the normative measure, but we demonstrate that these results nevertheless allow for a coherent view on the interaction between job polarization and skills mismatch in Europe. The paper contributes to the literature by an analysis of the relationship between job polarization and skills mismatch in a large group of European economies based on a job polarization index, which allows for the measurement of the extent of imbalanced job polarization in a single number for a given country and year. Similarly, we use a recently introduced measure of skills mismatch at the macroeconomic level, alongside traditional measures of skills mismatch at the individual level. The remaining structure of the paper is as follows. We start with a review of the literature on job polarization and skills mismatch in Sect. 2. Subsequently, we define measures of polarization and skills mismatch (at macro- and micro-levels) and review trends in Sect. 3. Section 4 first analyses the relationships between imbalanced job polarization and macro-level skills mismatch, and thereafter between imbalanced job polarization and individual-level skills mismatch. The last section concludes.",13
49,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,18 May 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-016-0201-5,"The association between graduates’ field of study and occupational attainment in West Germany, 1980–2008",July 2016,Markus Klein,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The literature on social stratification increasingly paid attention to the impact of horizontal differentiations in postsecondary education on occupational attainment or earnings (for an overview see Gerber and Cheung 2008). Among these horizontal differentiations, the field of study is regarded as one of the key determinants of socio-economic inequality. Initial research in the US primarily looked at the mediating role of college major for the gender wage gap (e. g. Bobbitt-Zeher 2007; Brown and Corcoran 1997; Daymont and Andrisani 1984; Gerhart 1990). Further studies addressed the question why fields of study differ in labour market outcomes and associate these differences with specialization effects (Van de Werfhorst and Kraaykamp 2001; Klein 2011a; Paglin and Rufolo 1990; Shauman 2006) or stress the mediating role of job characteristics (Roksa 2005; Wolbers 2003). Other research was concerned with cross-national comparisons and how the institutional context shapes the association between fields of study and a variety of labour market outcomes (e. g. Giesecke and Schindler 2008; Kim and Kim 2003; Reimer and Steinmetz 2009; Van de Werfhorst 2004). Despite this vast literature, changes in the association between graduates’ field of study and labour market returns across time have been rarely investigated (for an exception see Gerber and Schaefer 2004 on Russia). Due to changes on the supply-side, i. e. educational expansion and on the demand-side, i. e. occupational upgrading and technological changes returns to different fields of study cannot be assumed to remain constant across periods. Changes in the labour market value of fields of study are consequential for trends in socio-economic inequalities and intergenerational social mobility. During educational expansion children from higher social background may increasingly feel the need to differentiate themselves from children from lower social background by choosing more frequently fields of study that involve higher rewards in the labour market (see “effectively maintained inequality” hypothesis, Lucas 2001). If these rewarding fields become more beneficial in terms of labour market outcomes over time compared to less rewarding fields, this development contributes to a widening socio-economic gap among graduates. Both from a supply- and demand-side perspective there are reasons to argue that graduates’ field of study has become more important in job allocation procedures over time. From a signalling perspective (Spence 1973), higher education qualifications may increasingly lose their signalling capacity in terms of potential productivity if more and more students are able to attain a degree in the course of higher education expansion. Employers may therefore take other observable indicators such as qualitative differences (field of study, higher education institution, final grade) into account in order to differentiate between graduates in their hiring decisions. When higher education degrees become increasingly more unreliable during higher education expansion, employers are supposed to increasingly use graduates’ field of study as selection criterion (Hansen; Jackson et al. 2005; Van de Werfhorst 2002). Reimer et al. (2008) suggest that amidst educational expansion increasingly untalented students would gain access to higher education and opt for the less academically challenging fields like humanities or social sciences, rather than STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields. As a consequence, the signalling value of less demanding fields in the labour market would decline. The authors provide some support for their hypothesis: the higher the proportion of tertiary graduates in a country, the higher the relative unemployment risk for graduates from humanities. From a demand-side perspective, amidst an increasing demand for high-skilled labour due to technological changes some fields of study may have more substantially profited from these occupational changes in terms of availability of appropriate graduate jobs than others. During occupational upgrading in West Germany administrative and managerial positions as well as technical expert positions have expanded more strongly than positions in social and cultural services (Klein 2011b). Some field of study groups (STEM fields, business) may have benefited from these compositional changes more than others (humanities, arts, social work) in terms of occupational attainment. This article contributes to the literature by assessing changes in the relationship between graduates’ field of study and labour market outcomes (risk of unemployment, access to service class positions) over time in West Germany. For the analysis I make use of a long series of large-scale German labour force surveys (Microcensus) between 1980 and 2008.

Beim Übergang auf die Hochschulen, die auch als vierte Schwelle bezeichnet wird, gibt es zudem signifikante Herkunftseffekte, darunter den Bildungsstand der Eltern. Nach den Analysen des Studentenwerks wechselten von 100 Jugendlichen, die eine Studienberechtigung an einem allgemeinbildenden Gymnasium, an einer Gesamtschule oder einem Fachgymnasium erworben haben, 84 an eine Hochschule, wenn sie eine Mutter oder einen Vater mit einem akademischen Abschluss haben, im Vergleich zu lediglich 37, wenn weder Mutter noch Vater einen akademischen Abschluss haben.Footnote 2 Die Übergangsquote an die Hochschulen war demnach für Oberstufenschüler/innen aus einer nicht-akademischen Herkunftsfamilie noch nicht einmal halb so hoch wie für Jugendliche aus einer akademischen Herkunftsfamilie. Als wichtige Ursachen für diese soziale Disparität gelten bei gegebener Struktur des Bildungssystems die ökonomischen Ressourcen der Herkunftsfamilien und Sozialisierungseffekte durch die Familienumgebung. So hängt die Wahl zwischen Studium und Berufsausbildung von den erreichten Schulnoten ab, und diese wiederum hängen vom sozio-ökonomischen Hintergrund der Eltern ab.Footnote 3 Für Jugendliche aus einem akademischen Elternhaus scheint zudem das Motiv, einen sozialen Abstieg zu vermeiden, wirksam zu sein (Becker und Hecken 2009; Schindler und Reimer 2010), das bei den übrigen Jugendlichen entfällt. Schüler/innen aus nicht-akademischen Elternhäusern trauen sich selbst bei gleichen Schulleistungen seltener ein Studium zu als Jugendliche aus akademischen Herkunftsfamilien und entscheiden sich daher eher für eine Berufsausbildung (Becker 2010; Lörz 2012). Jugendliche aus akademischen Herkunftsfamilien erhalten schon in der Familie Einblicke in den Hochschulalltag und eine akademische Tätigkeit. Die alltägliche Interaktion mit akademisch gebildeten Eltern trägt vielfach dazu bei, das Vertrauen in die Bewältigung eines Studiums zu stärken und befördert den Übergang an eine Hochschule. Jugendlichen aus einer nicht-akademischen Herkunftsfamilie stehen diese Erfahrungen nicht oder nicht in gleichem Umfang zur Verfügung. Insofern können Unterschiede in der Sozialisierung innerhalb der Familien zur Verstärkung sozialer Disparitäten beitragen, auch jenseits von finanziellen Einschränkungen und asymmetrischen Informationen zu Kosten und Nutzen eines Studiums. Eine wissenschaftlich und auch bildungspolitisch kontrovers diskutierte Frage lautet, ob und wie dieses spezifische Vertrauen, ein Studium erfolgreich zu bewältigen (studienspezifische Selbstwirksamkeit)Footnote 4, bei gegebener Struktur des Bildungssystems und gegebenen staatlichen finanziellen Unterstützungsleistungen verbessert werden kann, um familiären Sozialisierungseffekten entgegenzuwirken. An der Universität Bielefeld wurde ein Studienorientierungsprogramm entwickelt, das Jugendlichen in der Oberstufe helfen soll, aktiv eigene Einblicke ins Studium und auch in akademische Berufstätigkeiten zu erhalten, um durch eigene Anschauungen und Erfahrungen dieses Vertrauen herstellen oder verbessern zu können. Dieses Studienorientierungsprogramm heißt „Duales Orientierungspraktikum“ (Leitfaden Universität Bielefeld 2004; im Folgenden abgekürzt mit DOP) und wird an Schulen der Sekundarstufe 2 in Nordrhein-Westfalen eingesetzt. Im Rahmen der Maßnahme erhalten Schulen unter anderem Zuschüsse für Fahrtkosten zum Besuch einer Hochschule und zur Absolvierung eines Praktikums in einem Berufsumfeld, das zum gewählten Studium passt. In der vorliegenden Studie untersuchen wir die Entwicklung des Vertrauens in die eigenen Fähigkeiten, ein Studium erfolgreich zu meistern, in der Sekundarstufe 2 und schätzen unseres Wissens erstmalsFootnote 5 den Einfluss, den eine Teilnahme an dem genannten Studienorientierungsprogramm DOP im Schuljahr 2011/12 auf die Entwicklung dieses Vertrauens ausgeübt hat. In der empirischen Untersuchung wird das Vertrauen in die eigenen Fähigkeiten mit der studienspezifischen Selbstwirksamkeit analog zum Konzept der berufsspezischen Selbstwirksamkeit von Rigotti et al. (2008) operationalisiert. Die wiederholten Befragungsdaten umfassen eine Gruppe von Teilnehmer/innen am DOP im Schuljahr 2011/12, die im Schuljahr vor Beginn der Maßnahme und bis zu drei Jahre nach der Maßnahme im Zeitraum zwischen 2011 und 2014 von den Autoren erhoben wurden. Befragt wurden ferner zeitlich parallel Kontrollgruppen von Nichtteilnehmer/innen, um die direkte Wirkung des DOP mittels eines Differenz-von-Differenzen-Ansatzes abschätzen zu können. Der Datensatz enthält neben der studienspezifischen Selbstwirksamkeit aussagekräftige Informationen zum Schulerfolg (gemessen an Schulnoten), zum höchsten schulischen und beruflichen Abschluss der Eltern der Befragten, zur psychosozialen Unterstützung durch die Familie, zum kulturellen Kapital der Familie sowie weiteren Aspekten der Persönlichkeit der Befragten, die als Kontrollvariablen eingesetzt werden, darunter auch subjektive Einschätzungen zu Risiko- und Zeitpräferenzen. Die ökonometrischen Befunde deuten darauf hin, dass die Teilnahme am Studienorientierungsprogramm DOP die studienspezifische Selbstwirksamkeit vor allem bei Jugendlichen aus einem nicht-akademischen Elternhaus verbessert hat. Bei Jugendlichen aus einem akademischen Elternhaus wurden in den erhobenen Daten keine signifikanten Wirkungen festgestellt. Da die eigene Untersuchung (siehe dazu Abschnitt 7) ebenso wie die Studien von Becker (2010), Lörz (2012) und Watermann und Maaz (2004) nahelegen, dass höhere Werte der spezifischen Selbstwirksamkeit den Übergang zur Hochschule befördern, scheint das untersuchte Programm DOP dazu beigetragen zu haben, soziale Disparitäten beim Hochschulzugang zu verringern. Unsere Studie leistet einen originären Beitrag zum Verständnis ungleicher Zugänge zur Hochschule. Neben der studienspezifischen Selbstwirksamkeit werden in der Literatur weitere herkunftsspezifische Unterschiede in ihrer Relevanz für die Entscheidung Ausbildung oder Studium thematisiert. Nach Becker und Hecken (2009) und Schindler und Reimer (2010) schrecken die Studienkosten Arbeiterkinder ungleich stärker vom Studieren ab als Akademikerkinder.Footnote 6 Die Resultate der vorliegenden Studie ergänzen diese Befunde und legen nahe, dass beim Design von Maßnahmen zur Studienorientierung die studienspezifische Selbstwirksamkeit als relevante Determinante für den Übergang an die Hochschule beachtet werden sollte. Der Rest des Textes hat folgenden Aufbau: In Abschnitt 2 wird das Duale Orientierungspraktikum vorgestellt. Abschnitt 3 erörtert das grundlegende Forschungsdesign sowie die Operationalisierung des verwendeten Messkonzepts der studienspezifischen Selbstwirksamkeit und der weiteren Kontrollvariablen. Abschnitt 4 stellt die Datenbasis und empirische Auswertungen vor. Die ökonometrischen Befunde zu den Wirkungen des DOP werden in Abschnitt 5 zur Diskussion gestellt, Robustheitstests in Abschnitt 6. In Abschnitt 7 wird die Bedeutung der studienspezifischen Selbstwirksamkeit für den Übergang auf die Hochschule erörtert. Die Schlussfolgerungen stehen in Abschnitt 8.",5

Sources of such data have, however, been relatively scarce, based on surveys in only a few countries. One of these is Britain, where there is a long tradition of applying survey methods to the study of job skills, both at the employer and at the employee levels. The “Social Change and Economic Initiative” (SCELI) of 1986 included for the first time a set of questions for individuals on the broad skills requirements of their jobs. These same items were included again in the Employment in Britain survey of 1992, and in 1997 the Skills Survey added to the indicators of broad skill requirements a raft of questions on the generic skills used in jobs. Two more skills surveys were completed in 2001 and 2006, and these were followed by the Skills and Employment Survey 2012. The result is that, even though these surveys were not originally designed as a series, through careful replication of items a systematic and unusual record of change in British jobs has been assembled. Through this development of the job requirements approach, a number of valuable insights have been gained, which have shed light on theories about technological and organisational change, and have helped to mould the way that policy-makers think about the problem of skill in the British context.Footnote 1 Our objective in this paper is to provide an overview of key insights about job skills and work organisation that can be derived from these surveys. While many of our findings are about the distributions of the generic skills among jobs in Britain, the most striking insights have concerned trends. This is an era of economic and social change, characterized and driven both by the external forces of technology and rising global competition, and by a progression of management ideas and practices, which impinge on employees’ work experiences. Economics and sociology each unveil grand narratives about the evolution of skill in the modern workplace. An understanding of how workplaces have developed in practice is therefore invaluable in helping evaluate these accounts. After a brief description of the data series, we proceed, therefore, with an overview of changing skills and work organisation. Section 3 looks at the extent to which different types of skill are rewarded in British labour markets and how this has evolved over time. This discussion leads to a discussion of their valuation in the presence of skills mismatches—whereby the level of the skills held by individuals does not match the level required in the jobs they are doing. In our conclusion, we discuss the extent to which our findings have proved useful for the purposes of policy-makers.",17

Very often, researchers have used as a proxy for these skills measures of educational level and labour market experience (and tenure). Even though there exists a vast literature on the returns to education and experience that clearly shows a positive payoff to both of them, there has always been some sort of discomfort with the precise content of such indicators or, in other words, with equating workers’ skills to the workers’ educational level. The obvious problem is that education (or schooling) and experience are investment measures and, therefore, can only provide very general insights on issues like what factors determine the skills that employers demand, why these skills are required or how these skills requirements change over time. To a large extent the use of schooling and experience data can be justified on the grounds of practicality: it was the only type of data available in large scale surveys and over time. Fortunately, this is changing thanks to the availability of new data sets such as, among others, the Skill Survey in the UK, the CHEERS and REFLEX projectsor the new OCDE data set from the PIAAC survey. At the same time, some serious theoretical discussion is being developed under the rubric of the “task approach” to analyze job skill requirements (Autor et al. 2003; Autor and Handel 2013). Pouliakas and Russo (2015) discuss that the crux of the task framework is that the core activities that workers undertake in their jobs are linked to the skills required by workers to carry out these tasks. The task approach potentially offers a microfundation for linking the aggregate demand for skills in the labour market to the specific skills demands of given job activities (Autor and Handel 2013:60). In this paper we aim to add some empirical evidence to the growing literature in this area. Specifically, we will initially discuss how job tasks requirements are related to technological, product innovation and work organization characteristics of the firm. We then will estimate, as has been a tradition in this literature, a Mincer wage equation but with the inclusion of the measures of generic skills characteristics of the job. Thus, we will be able to determine the value of each of these generic skills, and discuss which of them make the worker more productive. We also want to discuss more directly what happen to the respective coefficients when both types of variables, traditional human capital variables and skills, are included in the equation estimated. The man contributions of this paper are related to the use of a unique employer-employee data set which offers wide and detailed information on firms, workers and workplace characteristics. The characteristics of the data set help to address the problem of using information on job characteristics at the level of occupations instead of information at the individual worker level. In addition, most papers do not have the appropriate data to relate job skill requirements to the technological and human resource practices specific context. Our data will allow us to discuss them. The paper is laid out as follows. In the next section we review the literature addressing the returns to skills and the determinants of generic skills. In Sect. 2 we describe the survey we draw our data from and develop the indices that measure the utilization of generic skills. In Sect. 3 we present our empirical analysis. A brief conclusions section summarizes the main results.",6

Handel,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The first edition of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (DOT) was published by the U.S. Department of Labor in 1939 to assist the Employment Service in matching job-seekers to vacant positions during the Depression. Subsequent editions of the DOT appeared in 1949, 1965, and 1977. In 1991 a partial revision of the fourth edition appeared as the final DOT database. In addition to helping the United States Employment Service find jobs for the unemployed, the DOT was also intended as a source of occupational information for career counsellors and students interested in understanding education and training requirements and other demands of different jobs. In her introduction to the final edition of the DOT, the Secretary of Labor, Lynn Martin, noted that it “appears at a time when there is growing recognition of the need for lifetime learning [and] when rapid technological change is making the jobs of current workers more complex than they were even a few years ago…” (United States Department of Labor 1991, p. iii). These sentiments are still relevant today; indeed, they have been voiced continuously in the subsequent two decades. In addition to narrative job descriptions, the principal content of the DOT is various measures of job skill requirements and other important job characteristics for over 12,000 specific job titles. The DOT rated the level of General Educational Development (GED) and Specific Vocational Preparation (SVP), or job-specific training, required by jobs. Other important measures rated the cognitive, interpersonal, and physical demands of jobs. This tripartite categorization of worker activities into relations with data, people, and things has been validated in other work, including O*NET, and continues to be a useful category scheme for understanding work requirements (Kohn and Schooler 1983; Peterson et al 1999, pp. 251 ff.). A large set of measures assessed job requirements in terms of the aptitudes (e.g., manual dexterity), temperaments (e.g., directing others), interests (e.g., artistic), physical demands (e.g., lifting) and environmental conditions (e.g., exposure to chemicals). The data contained in the DOT was collected by trained job analysts in ETA field offices across the United States based on their observations and interviews at selected job sites. Job analysts visited workplaces on a continuous basis and each new edition of the DOT replaced existing scores with the new scores collected in the intervening period. Although the DOT was devised primarily to serve practical purposes, social scientists began using the data in the 1960s (Miller et al. 1980, p. 7). Social science use of the DOT grew after Spenner’s (1979) seminal work and the large-scale evaluation of the DOT by Miller et al. (1980) sponsored by the National Academy of Sciences, which resulted in the first widely available machine-readable data files with DOT scores linked to standard U.S. Census occupation codes. The crosswalk of more than 12,000 DOT occupation codes to the much smaller set of approximately 450 Census occupation codes permitted researchers to merge DOT scores with standard labour force surveys. Nevertheless, the DOT was devised by applied psychologists and practitioners for career counselling, not social science research, and the evaluation by Miller et al. (1980) raised a number of questions regarding the quality of the data. They found the DOT over-represented blue-collar manufacturing jobs, the jobs rated were a convenience sample rather than a probability sample, and most ratings in the fourth edition (1977) were simply carried from previous editions, often dating to the 1950s and 1960s without necessarily reevaluating them thoroughly because the scale of the required field visits proved prohibitively time-consuming and costly. Others noted that the DOT scores are occupation averages, which means the measures contain no within-occupation variation (Miller et al. 1980; Attewell 1990; Spenner 1990; Vallas 1990; U.S. Department of Labor 1993, p. 20). Although some research shows DOT measures perform better than some of the critics suggest (Kohn and Schooler 1983; Handel 2000), the age of the DOT data, nature of the sample, and quality of the measures argued for new and better information on skill requirements and other job characteristics.",43

Handel,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Researchers across several fields, including sociology, labour economics, education, and public policy, are keenly interested in understanding levels and trends in job skill requirements, and their relationships to technology and work organization. The nature of job skill requirements is central to a number of broader research topics in the United States and elsewhere, notably ... the growth of wage inequality since the late 1970s, which some have ascribed to a technologically-induced skills shortage (Katz and Murphy 1992; Danziger and Gottschalk 1995; Autor, Katz, and Krueger 1998; Morris and Western 1999; Fernandez 2001; Bresnahan et al. 2002). persistently disappointing earnings and employment prospects of less-skilled workers (Holzer 1996). persistent racial inequality and high poverty levels, and concern over the movement of persons from welfare to rewarding work (Wilson 1996; Moss and Tilly 2001; Holzer and Stoll 2001). potential for remediation of inequality through improved education, smoother transitions from school to work, and diffusion of employee involvement or “high performance” workplace practices (Murnane and Levy 1996; Rosenbaum and Binder 1997; U.S. National Commission on Excellence in Education 1983; Smith 1997; Appelbaum, Bailey, Berg, and Kalleberg 2000; Osterman 2000). concern over the possibility of various forms of job degradation (routinization, effort intensification, outsourcing, precarity, lower real wages and benefits) resulting from the adoption of “lean and mean” organizational reforms (Harrison and Bluestone 1998; Harrison 1994; Graham 1993; Green 2006; Handel 2005a). All of this research rested on theories, findings, or assumptions regarding the nature, level, and trend of job skill requirements. However, a longstanding problem was that most of these studies used either rough proxy measures of job skill demands available in nationally representative data sets (broad occupation group, personal education, average education within occupations), occupation-level job measures from individual cross-sections (e. g., DOT or O*NET scores)Footnote 1, or, more rarely, case-level measures created for unique surveys administered to restricted samples (Holzer 1996; Fernandez 2001). Other research used open-ended and relatively unstandardized interview methods for qualitative cases studies (e. g., Rosenbaum and Binder 1997), while reports of high-level commissions resting on a thin base of impressionistic evidence and speculative assumptions have long been a staple of the policy discourse providing indirect impetus for the academic research (e. g., U.S. Department of Labor. Secretary’s Commission on Achieving Necessary Skills 1991). No systematic portrait of U.S. jobs had been produced since the final Quality of Employment Survey in 1977 (Quinn and Staines 1978). In addition, survey questions on job skill requirements and other characteristics tended to use overly general wording and subjective scales (e. g., rating scales, vague quantifiers), which are less interpretable than more behaviourally specific measures and subject to significant measurement error (Handel 2000, 2008). In many ways O*NET maintains some of these limitations (see Handel, this issue).Footnote 2 Likewise, almost no survey, including O*NET, has equally strong coverage of (1) job skill requirements, (2) technology use, and (3) employee involvement  (EI) practices despite their presumed importance and interrelationships. Consequently, researchers have only a cloudy sense of the levels and kinds of job skill requirements, rates of change, the dimensions along which job skills are changing, and the interrelationships between skills, technology, and EI. If current concerns are to be addressed with any degree of specificity, measures of job requirements need to be more precise, concrete, and comparable to person characteristics covering all three of the key content areas, so that researchers and users of research have some notion of the absolute levels of job demands, rather than just a score on a rating scale that has no clear meaning outside the framework of a particular survey. With these goals in mind, the survey of Skills, Technology, and Management Practices (STAMP) was developed to collect direct information on job skill requirements, technology use, employee involvement practices, and other job characteristics that have been subjects of broad interest for many years. In particular, STAMP was designed to address the following questions: What is the distribution of jobs by level of skills, computer useFootnote 3, and participation in employee involvement practices? In other words, what is the skill profile of the American job structure? What are the functional and causal relationships between skill requirements, computer use, and employee involvement? What are the effects of skill requirements, computer use, and EI on wages, working conditions, and other job characteristics (e. g., work intensity, promotions, layoffs, outsourcing, unionization, job satisfaction)? What are the trends in ... skill requirements, technology, and EI practices? their functional and causal interrelationships? their relationships to the other outcomes noted in (3) above? One of the most active research programs on job skill requirements using individual-level data that pre-dates STAMP is based on the UK Skills and Employment Surveys (see Felstead et al. 2007 and Green et al. 2016). The past decade has seen a significant increase in awareness regarding the critical importance of measuring job characteristics effectively for research, which has stimulated studies using the German Qualification and Career Surveys (see Spitz-Oener 2006 and Rohrbach-Schmidt and Tiemann 2016). This movement has culminated in the recent multi-country Survey of Adult Skills, coordinated by the OECD (OECD 2012), whose section on job requirements draws from both the UK Skills and Employment Surveys and STAMP. The World Bank’s multi-country Skills Toward Employment and Productivity (STEP) survey relies even more heavily on STAMP (see Handel et al. 2016). This paper is an overview of STAMP results that provide a systematic profile of the American job structure that can serve as a basis for discussions of the skill requirements of American jobs. The goal is primarily descriptive, with tentative implications for other issues noted as they arise. The next section describes the STAMP approach to improving upon existing measurers of job content. The following section describes the sample and potential implications for estimates of job requirements in the U.S. The remaining sections presents results on skill requirements, technology use, employee involvement, and other management practices, respectively. A final section concludes.",42
49,3,Journal for Labour Market Research,19 August 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12651-016-0205-1,Accounting for total work in labour statistics,November 2016,Andrea Brandolini,Eliana Viviano,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Many activities carried out daily by individuals, such as housekeeping and care for dependent family members, are often defined as home production, as opposed to employment. Whereas employment is aimed at the production of goods and services which are sold in the market, home production is carried out for own consumption. The distinction does not depend on the intrinsic nature of the goods or services produced, but rather on their destination: sale in the market vs. own use by the person, or some other individuals linked to him/her by family ties or friendship. The quantity of labour typically measured by official statistics for a market economy misses the time worked in home production. The importance of accounting for the aggregate value of home production has been long recognised (e. g. Nordhaus and Tobin 1973; Weinrobe 1974; see also references in Chaudeau 1985), whereas the consideration of how total time is allocated among market work, non-market work, and leisure has been central to the modelling of household economic behaviour since the seminal article by Becker (1965). Somewhat less attention has been paid to the implications for the assessment of employment levels and more generally the analysis of labour markets. The standard definition of the employment rate refers to a social arrangement that values certain activities only if they are carried out in the market, i. e. if they contribute to gross domestic product. Thus, childcare counts for the employment rate when performed by a paid nanny, but not when performed by a grandparent, although the services provided and the effects on child well-being might be similar. In the face of the unanimously recognised value of household work for both output and welfare aggregate estimates, the persistence of such a distinction may reflect the lack of reliable data and the need to use imputation procedures. Substantial improvements on both sides allow us to move forward, but standard labour market statistics need to be reconsidered to account for household work. In particular, headcount ratios may not be very revealing: during the week, an overwhelming majority of people engages in household activities, when broadly defined. Focusing on the “intensity” of this engagement provides a possible solution: what matters is, then, how much time is spent in working at home vis-à-vis the time spent in paid work, on one side, and leisure and remaining activities, on the other. In this paper, we propose a general framework to account for household work by extending the notion of generalized employment rate discussed by Brandolini and Viviano (2016a, 2016b). Brandolini and Viviano’s class of generalised indices embodies a richer characterisation of the employment status, which considers work intensity, as measured by actual hours of work, rather than the simple dichotomous variable employed/non-employed. An aggregation of the employment status based on hours lends itself quite naturally to be developed to accommodate the time spent in non-market activities. As in Brandolini and Viviano (2016a, 2016b), we continue distinguishing headcount from intensity-weighted rates of work participation. Unlike those papers, however, we focus solely on measures of work engagement at the individual level and ignore the implications for household-level measures. This important issue faces significant data limitations and is left for future research. The paper is organised as follows. First, we discuss the implications of accounting for home production from a labour market perspective. Second, we introduce our measure of total work for individuals. Next, we briefly describe the data. Our empirical analysis uses time use data drawn from the Multinational Time Use Study (MTUS) database for years 1995–2005 (Gershuny and Fisher 2013). We then study the distribution of employment, household work and total work in a selected group of advanced countries (France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States). In the final section, we summarize the main conclusions of the paper.",

Abou Hamia,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"In this study, we empirically use Okun’s Law to examine whether growth has been jobless in a sample of Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries. Okun’s Law measures the responsiveness of unemployment to output growth rate. Okun suggested that a one percent increase in the unemployment rate is associated with three percent loss in real GDP. This change in output relative to change in the unemployment rate is known as Okun’s Law Coefficient (OLC). Okun’s finding was interesting since a reduction in unemployment is associated with a larger than the proportionate effect on output implying that considerable output gains can be realized by: “induced increases in the size of the labor force; longer average weekly hours; and greater productivity” (Okun 1962). After the 1970s’ oil shock and the persistent high unemployment and low growth rates, it was clear that the US economy experienced structural changes that led some scholars to doubt the stability and the robustness of Okun’s 3:1 estimation (Clark 1983; Friedman 1988; Prachowny 1993; Attfield and Silverstone 1998; and Freeman 2001). A reduction in output was believed to be associated with more loss in jobs than originally estimated by Okun. Mankiw (1994) revised Okun’s 3:1 original rule of thumb to 2:1. Okun’s Law can answer a number of questions important to implement and design macroeconomic policies. Policy makers are interested to know the cost of cyclical unemployment rate (when the unemployment rate is above its natural rate) in terms of aggregate output. In other instances, they are interested to know the growth rate needed to lower the unemployment rate to some desirable level or the rate at which unemployment rate is growing when output growth is zero. In addition, “the effectiveness of disinflation policy depends on the responsiveness of unemployment on the output growth rate (sacrifice ratio)” (Soegner and Stiassny 2002). It is important to note that Okun’s Law represents a net effect of several structural mechanisms governing the labor market (Perman and Tavera 2005); it is a statistical relationship that varies with the changes in the examined country’s macro economy. Several studies in the Okun’s Law literature, including Okun’s original work itself, confused between using two kinds of regressions: regressing the unemployment rates on the GDP growth rates and regressing the GDP growth rates on the unemployment rates. The reciprocal of the first regression coefficient is used instead of estimating the coefficient of the second regression. This would work only if the relationship between the two variables in the first regression is consistent and stable. If not, then the prediction of the mean value of the GDP growth rate given the known values of the unemployment rates is not reliable and amiss, especially when using it for policy recommendations. Estimating one of the two regressions would depend on the type of prediction one needs to conduct. If what is needed is to predict the mean value of the unemployment rate given the known values of the GDP growth rates, we need to regress the unemployment rates on the GDP growth rates. However, if what is needed is to predict the mean value of the GDP growth rate given the known values of the unemployment rates, we need to regress the GDP growth rates on the unemployment rates. In this study, we are interested in predicting the mean value of the unemployment rate given the known values of the GDP growth rates in the MENA region. The literature adequately estimated Okun’s Law for developed countries. To name a few, Moosa (1997) estimated Okun’s Law for the G7 Countries, Apel and Jansson (1999) for Canada, the UK and the US, Lee (2000) for 16 OECD countries, and Moazzami and Dadgostar (2009) for OECD countries. Few studies on the subject are found for developing countries; one possible reason is the lack of unemployment data and the lack of a unified methodology on how to measure unemployment rate across countries and over time. Bhalotra (1998) investigates Okun’s Law in India, Marinkov and Geldenhuys (2007) for South Africa, Lal et al. (2010) for five Asian countries, and Hanusch (2012) for eight East Asian countries. As for the MENA region, a limited number of studies have been conducted on Okun’s Law to systematically investigate the relationship between growth and unemployment in the region. According to our search of the literature, Moosa (2008) was among the very few studies that estimated and explored the validity of Okun’s Law for a number of MENA countries: Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia. He found that Okun’s Law is invalid in the four countries attributing this result to three reasons. First, unemployment in these countries is not cyclical but rather structural and/or frictional. Second, hiring in these countries was done primarily by the public sector that contributed to the rigidity of their labor markets. Third, these economies are dominated by sectors that are not labor-intensive, which explains why unemployment rate is not associated with growth. Estimating Okun’s Law for the MENA region is an interesting case study. The economies of the region have failed to create enough jobs for its growing population, especially the youth sector (Keller and Nabli 2002). The frustrated youth marched down the Arab streets demanding more political participation, respect for human rights, and decent jobs and living conditions. According to the UN World Youth Report (2011), “there is no doubt that one of the contributing factors to the recent Arab Spring uprisings is the disturbingly high level of youth unemployment in the MENA region”. Table 1 shows that the total and the youth unemployment rates in the MENA region are the highest among other world developing regions in 2013. Also, Table 1 shows that the region has the lowest labor participation rate compared to other world developing regions. Such dismal labor market outlook and the scarcity of research on Okun’s Law in the region motivate us to systematically investigate the relationship between growth and unemployment rates and whether growth has created enough jobs in the region. Our sample includes seventeen MENA countries, namely Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Yemen. Depending on the data availability, the study covers the period from 1980 to 2013. Table 1 shows that in 2013, Yemen recorded the highest total unemployment rates, Egypt recorded the highest youth unemployment rate and Jordan recorded the lowest labor participation rate among the seventeen MENA countries in our sample. In the late 2010 and 2011, turmoil triggered regime changes in Tunisia and Egypt, major political and socioeconomic instabilities in Syria and Yemen and key constitutional reforms in Algeria, Morocco and Jordan. The study will try to answer four main questions: In which of the seventeen MENA countries is Okun’s Law valid, and hence job creation is associated with growth? Are our individual estimations robust with different estimation models and methods? Are our estimations for individual countries stable throughout the periods considered in this study? Finally, is Okun’s Law valid and robust in the entire MENA region? The paper will proceed as follows: we present the methodology used in section two, we analyze the data used in the study in section three, we present the empirical results in section four, and we conclude this study in section five.",6

Human capital captures the aggregate amount of skills and knowledge inherent in an economy’s workforce. It is one of the main pillars of the European strategy for economic growth to promote human capital formation (EU2020). One related target is that a share of 40 % of the population aged 30–34 will hold a tertiary degree by the year 2020 (European Commission 2010). However, human capital per se does not facilitate growth. In order to increase output, the stock of skills and knowledge has to be deployed by workers in the execution of tasks. Reaping the benefits of human capital investments requires that workers hold adequate jobs that make efficient use of their skills. Otherwise, imbalances between employer needs and skills of the workforce can lead to an underutilisation of the available human capital hampering economic growth. According to assignment theory, high-skilled workers holding jobs with low skill requirements underutilise their human capital and do not reach their individual production capacity (Sattinger 1993). In the literature, such vertical mismatches are commonly identified in terms of overqualification arising if individuals’ current qualification exceeds the educational requirement of their job. Overqualification entails productivity-related implications for both economies and individuals. At the aggregate level, reallocating mismatched workers to appropriate jobs could increase productivity and GDP (Gautier and Teulings 2015; McGowan and Andrews 2015). Thus, overqualification implies a potential waste and misallocation of scarce public resources, in particular those public funds invested into education (Chevalier 2003). At the individual level, mainly productivity-related outcomes, such as job satisfaction or wages, have been analysed (Hartog 2000). These studies commonly find that overqualified workers are less satisfied with their job which could reduce workers’ motivation and effort leading to lower productivity (Hersch 1991; Korpi and Tåhlin 2009). Concerning the effects on wages, overqualified workers are found to earn more than their well-matched co-workers because surplus schooling is rewarded (Duncan and Hoffman 1981). However, the return on surplus schooling is commonly found to be lower than the return on years of schooling required for a job (Hartog 2000). Therefore, overqualified workers are found to earn less than equally educated workers holding a matching job (Büchel and Mertens 2004; Daly et al. 2000). Further studies also indicate that overqualification comes along with significant wage penalties for the subgroup of graduates (Chevalier 2003; Diem and Wolter 2014). As discussed by Tsai (2010) and others, negative wage effects might partly arise from a selection of less able individuals into overqualification because individuals holding the same qualification might differ in (innate) ability. In this case, overqualification would not represent an underutilisation of available skills. Recent studies controlling for the skill-heterogeneity between equally educated individuals produced mixed results concerning the causal interpretation of the wage penalty for overqualification. In some studies the negative wage effect of overqualification vanishes once skill-heterogeneity is accounted for (Bauer 2002; Tsai 2010), while other studies find robust wage penalties (Kleibrink 2015; Korpi and Tåhlin 2009). Since previous findings suggest that overqualification is detrimental at the macro and the micro level, understanding the causes for the occurrence of mismatches is highly relevant from a policy perspective. This study explores which factors are relevant determinants of overqualification among university graduates. Concentrating on the subgroup of graduates is meaningful from a policy perspective since increasing the share of high-skilled workers is an important strategy to promote economic growth. A further aim of policies that improve the access to higher education is to increase intergenerational social mobility. A higher social mobility might in turn enhance growth through a better allocation of human capital resources inherent in individuals from disadvantaged family backgrounds (OECD 2010). In order to promote growth through social mobility, these human capital resources have to be put into productive use in the labour market. It is a special focus of this study to assess the importance of family background as a potential determinant of overqualification. In this context, the outcome variable of overqualification can be interpreted in two ways that are closely related. First, from a growth perspective, overqualification can be interpreted as an indication for putting the skills and knowledge acquired during tertiary education into productive use in the job. This interpretation depicts whether graduates from disadvantaged family backgrounds utilise their human capital efficiently in order to promote economic growth. Second, overqualification can be interpreted as an alternative indicator for individual labour market success since it is related to lower job satisfaction and lower wages. This interpretation is relevant from a social mobility perspective in order to assess whether graduates from disadvantaged family backgrounds reap the benefits of higher education to the same extent as graduates from high status families. This study contributes to the literature on the determinants of overqualification. Family background has been included in few studies on overqualification determinants, however only as additional control variable (Boll and Leppin 2013; Fehse and Kerst 2007). In the present study, this relationship is the focal point of the analysis. The main aim is to uncover potential transmission channels mediating the link between family background and overqualification. Depending on the family background, graduates might differ in various characteristics that are potential determinants of overqualification. For instance, (innate) ability and cognitive skills are transmitted within families (Black et al. 2009) and decrease the probability of being overqualified (Büchel and Pollmann-Schult 2004). Similarly, the choice of field of study is affected by family background (Jonsson et al. 2009) and is a crucial determinant of overqualification (Dolton and Vignoles 2000). Using data of the HIS-Graduate Panel 1997, I include a set of proxy variables which account for potential factors mediating the link between social origin and overqualification. These factors include ability and skills, study characteristics, financial capital, social capital, and aspiration. Employing a Blinder–Oaxaca decomposition approach, I then analyse which share of the social overqualification gap can be attributed to differences in these factors. The relative importance of the mediating factors is evaluated by conducting a detailed decomposition of the overqualification gap. The empirical analysis shows that the risk of overqualification depends on the family background of graduates. Based on parental education (PE), graduates are divided into two groups: They either originate from a family with at least one parent holding a tertiary degree (high PE) or from a family with neither of the parents holding a tertiary degree (low PE). As compared to graduates from low PE families, graduates from high PE families are found to be less likely to hold a job that does not require a tertiary degree, i.e. to be overqualified. The unconditional overqualification gap between graduates from low PE families and graduates from high PE families amounts to 7.4 percentage points. The effect of family background is reduced but remains highly significant if the potential pathways are accounted for in a probit regression. Blinder–Oaxaca decompositions show that roughly 60 % of the social overqualification gap can be attributed to the fact that graduates differ in observable characteristics, i.e. the endowments effect. I find that differences in ability and skills, study characteristics, and social capital are significant mediators of the link between family background and overqualification. The most important pathway is the social difference in the choice of university type and subject pointing to the importance of the horizontal dimension of higher education. In contrast, I find little evidence that financial support or aspiration mediate family background effects on overqualification. However, this result might be influenced by the imprecise measures for these factors. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the related literature and elaborates on potential pathways for family background affecting the risk of overqualification. In Sect. 3 the data are introduced and in Sect. 4 the econometric methodology is described. In Sect. 5 the results are presented and the conclusion is provided in Sect. 6.",15

Kendzia,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In recent political discourse, the marginalization and precariousness of a part of the workforce is discussed either as a menacing phenomenon that looms large over the past decades (Vosko 2000; Kalleberg 2009; Ross 2009) or as a much needed mechanism to increase a firm’s flexibility (Saint-Paul 1996; Kalleberg 2001). However, research on employment indicates that the workforce has always been subjected to some sort of segmentation (Blossfeld and Mayer 1988; Pollert 1988) and that, from a historic perspective, the discourse on the use of a core and a peripheral workforce appears exaggerated (Gallie et al. 1998). Against this backdrop, this article seeks to examine the factors contributing to the emergence and change in the demarcation of a core workforce and its counterpart since the founding era (Gründerzeit), beginning with the establishment of the German Reich in 1871, to the present time in Germany. The core workforce can be defined as workforce, including a longer duration of employment and significant firm-specific skills. In this article, these conditions serve as criteria to differ between the core and the peripheral workforce. In doing so, the authors further specify that a longer duration of employment comprises at least two years of employment for the same company. The main reason for this is that a fixed term contract within the industrial sector in Germany today is not allowed to last longer than two years. Plus, firm-specific skills are understood as specific capabilities, knowledge, and experiences within a strictly defined field of application – often comprising only a certain section, production facility or part of the production process (Lutz 1987, p. 2–49). The investigation of the workforce is carried out according to two basic segmentation theories which will be presented in the next section. The investigation focuses primarily on workers and employees of industrial companies. Only in the end of this analysis, the service sector is addressed, as the structural change within the German economy led to a strong increase of service-related workplaces. Thereby, a workplace is understood as the overall sum of all tasks assigned to an individual worker or employee (Lutz 1987, p. 55). Ever since the industrialization, the chemical, electrical, metal and steel industry as well as the machine and automobile construction have occupied the largest amount of workers and thus served as flagship industries. For this reason, the survey focuses on these branches across Germany.",5

Subsequent research, however, has advanced a considerably more nuanced interpretation of human capital. While the original model treated the portability of worker skills between employers as an all-or-nothing proposition, Shaw (1984) established that skill transferability between jobs is instead proportional on the basis of their shared occupational demands, giving rise to the concept of “occupation-specific” human capital (OSHC). To verify this proposed component of the human capital model, Shaw (1984) empirically demonstrated that occupation-specific human capital was a superior predictor of worker earnings than general experience. Kambourov and Manovskii (2009) extended these findings, with estimated returns on occupational tenure substantially outpacing returns on industry- and firm-specific tenure. Taken together, these two studies indicate that occupation-specific human capital represents the predominant human capital influence on individual workers’ earnings. Given the significance of the conclusion, a growing research agenda has confirmed and expanded upon the predictive power of occupational specificity in the determination of worker earnings (e. g., Ingram and Neumann 2006; Poletaev and Robinson 2008; Gathmann and Schönberg 2010; Geel et al. 2011; Ormiston 2014; Nawakitphaitoon 2014; Nawakitphaitoon and Ormiston 2015). However, a lack of consensus over the best approach to estimate occupation-specific human capital represents a potential hindrance to the advancement of research. In Shaw’s (1984) seminal work on occupation-specific human capital, she advanced the concept of “transferability,” or the proportion of OSHC utilized in one profession that would be applicable in a second vocation. Two competing methods of estimating OSHC transferability have been developed to date: a “market” approach (Shaw 1984) and a “skills” approach (Ormiston 2014). As will be demonstrated in this study, there are vast differences – both theoretically and empirically – between these two methodologies, with considerable implications for how future research on OSHC is developed and interpreted. The current paper, therefore, attempts to advance research on occupation-specific human capital by critically evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of these two methodologies – as offered by Shaw (1984) and Ormiston (2014) – and comparing them to alternative measures of occupational commonality discussed in the broader labor economics research. To start, this paper estimates Shaw’s (1984) measure of transferability by analyzing occupational mobility in a data set derived from the March Current Population Survey (CPS). The Ormiston (2014) transferability metric is then estimated using O*NET – the U.S. Department of Labor’s occupational database – to compute the ratio of shared, standardized knowledge, skill and ability categories across occupations. Finally, to demonstrate how these two approaches produce disparate outcomes, both transferability measures are linked to post-displacement earnings among displaced workers as identified in the 2004–2010 Displaced Worker Survey (DWS). This paper is structured as follows. The next section describes the estimation of occupational skills transferability applying Shaw’s (1984) and Ormiston’s (2014) approaches. Sect. 3 discusses the theoretical strengths and weaknesses of these two approaches. Sect. 4 describes the data and empirical estimation of earnings losses of displaced workers. Sect. 5 presents the estimation results and empirical comparison of these two approaches, and the last section concludes and discusses some of the implications for future research.",5

Heywood,Uwe Jirjahn,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Studies on older workers often focus on the incentives to retire. Typically the roles of working conditions, health problems and institutional factors (specifically early retirement possibilities) are considered (e.g., Coppola and Wilke 2014; Ebbinghaus and Hofaecker 2013; Roberts and Jones 2014; Schnalzenberger et al. 2014). However a deeper understanding of the labor market for older workers can only be obtained if we also take into account the personnel policy of firms and the resulting employment and hiring strategies. In what follows, we highlight the labor market situation of older workers in Germany. We argue that while institutional reforms have improved their labor force participation, serious problems remain. The market is simply not dynamic and older workers once out of work are likely to remain so for a long time and may well exit not into employment but into retirement. Moreover, when they do re-enter to find jobs, they are often not able to get career jobs or full time jobs. We follow this demonstration with a series of potential explanations for the limited employment opportunities for older workers. We first consider that older workers are poor hires because their productivity is substantially lower on average. We next consider that biases or poor information causes employers to simply discriminate against older job seekers. While we do not rule these out as partial explanations, we do suggest that the evidence is not overwhelming and that it seems unlikely these are complete explanations. We highlight the importance of life-cycle motivational models which involve employers deferring compensation. These models imply tenure earnings slopes that are steeper than productivity increases as firms cause workers to post a quasi-bond that is repaid only later in tenure and dependent upon sufficient effort. In essence, the bond increases the cost of job loss and so creates effort incentives. The fact that workers are paid far more than their productivity late in their tenure makes mandatory retirement a frequent feature of deferred compensation. While this might create life-cycle efficiencies by increasing motivation, it creates difficulties for those older workers trying to re-enter employment. They cannot be motivated by life-cycle profiles and they cannot be paid the same as others with their experience receiving wages above productivity because of such profiles. The consequence seems often to simply not hire older workers or to relegate them to non-career and part time jobs. We imagine potential policy responses both in the abstract, using Japan as an example, and within the constraints of German institutions. We remain modestly pessimistic that substantial improvements can be achieved without harming the efficiencies associated with deferred compensation but try to outline possible avenues. We emphasize that the current use of deferred compensation is integrated into an interlocking set of German institutions that appear to add to productivity and this would be at risk if deferred compensation were reduced or eliminated.",10

In particular, long-term unemployment and early retirement of older workers have been one of the more problematic features of the German market. However, in the wake of the severe economic recession in 2009, the performance of the German labor market improved significantly with increasing employment and decreasing unemployment rates. An important feature of the “German employment miracle” has been the substantial improvement of the labor market situation of older workers, which is the topic of the present study. Between 2000 and 2014 the overall German employment rate for the age group 25–65 years, as measured from survey data on an individual’s labor force status, has increased by about 10 percentage points from 70% to 80%. Furthermore, starting around 2005 the average unemployment rate has been steadily declining from about 10% in 2005 to about 6% in 2014. Especially after the economic and financial crises in 2009/10, the labor market has, on average, developed more favorably in Germany than in most other EU countries. As shown by Fig. 1, the favorable labor market developments in Germany after the crises are driven by strongly increasing employment rates and declining unemployment rates of older workers. Starting from a very low level in the early 2000’s, the employment rate of people in the age group 60–65 years doubled and reached more than 50% by 2014. The employment rate of people aged between 55 and 59 years also increased substantially, especially after 2009, while the employment rate of younger people stabilized at a relatively high level of about 80% since then.Footnote 1 Starting at a double-digit level, the unemployment rate of people aged 60 years or older decreased more or less steadily since the early 2000’s and converged to the average rate of about 6% by 2014. For the total working-age population, the unemployment rate increased until 2005 to a level of about 10% and then declined more or less steadily with only a slight increase in the wake of the economic recession in 2009. By 2014, the average unemployment rate of 6% has reached the same level as at the beginning of the observation period. Employment, unemployment, and retirement in Germany, 2000–2014. (Notes: Employment rates refer to answers of people aged 25 to 65 years to their current labor force status. Retirement rates refer to people aged 55 to 65 years. Data are weighted using SOEP weighting factors. Source: SOEP 2000–2014, own calculations) Another important feature of labor market developments in Germany is the evolution of real hourly wages which have, on average, changed little since 2000 (Fig. 2). Except for the oldest age group, average real wages declined for several years before the recession in 2009 and increased slightly since then. For employees in the oldest age group real wages increased between 2005 and 2010 but declined in recent years. Given that the employment rate of older people has changed substantially in the observation period, it seems likely that the observed wage changes for this group are driven by selection effects: The average wage could have been driven down by older people with a relatively low level of productivity who remained long-term unemployment or retired early in previous periods and now remain employed until the statutory retirement age. Real hourly wages in Germany, 2000–2014. (Notes: Real hourly wages are derived using SOEP generated information on individual annual earnings and actual working hours. Real hourly wages smaller than 1.5 and larger than 150 € are not included. The self-employed are excluded. Data are weighted using SOEP weighting factors. Source: SOEP 2000–2014, own calculations) The factors which might have contributed to the described labor market development remain controversial. As discussed by Dietz and Walwei (2011), labor market reforms as well as a series of pension reforms enacted in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s (see Chap. 2) may have been of particular importance for explaining to higher employment and lower unemployment rates of older people in Germany. As in other EU member states (see, e. g., Toft and Whitehouse 2016), the pension reforms were clearly targeted at increasing the effective early retirement age. The reform of the unemployment compensation system was mainly intended to increase work incentives in general, and not especially targeted at older workers, but may still have had relatively strong effects on them. The same can be said about the extension of earnings subsidies for so-called “marginal jobs” that are completely or partially exempted from social security contributions on the part of workers. Other labor market reforms were targeted at increasing employment opportunities of older people with little earnings potential. A couple of studies have estimated the partial effects of some of these reforms.Footnote 2 Taken together, these studies seem to suggest that recent labor market and pension reforms may have contributed to the increase in employment and the reduction in unemployment of older workers. Although there seems to be no quantitative assessment on the overall economic effects of these reforms on older workers, their overall direct contribution to the substantial employment increase of older workers is likely to have been relatively small. Although potential wage determinants have been empirically analyzed for Germany in various recent studies (see Möller and Hutter 2011), there seems to be little empirical research yet on the effects of policy reforms on wages and, in particular, their indirect effects on employment and unemployment among older workers.Footnote 3
 This paper aims at establishing important stylized facts about the development of the labor market for older workers in Germany in recent years. The focus of this descriptive analysis is on identifying age effects in changes of various labor market outcome variables between 2000 and 2014. These include various employment and unemployment indicators as well as the real hourly wage, all measured at the individual level using data from the Socioeconomic Panel (SOEP) for the period 2000–2014. To identify age effects, I estimate statistical models for the various labor market outcome indicators at the individual level conditional on the set of usual control variables. To account for the importance of gender and the still existing large differences in most of these indicators between east and west Germany, the estimations are differentiated by gender and region. Estimation results are best interpreted as descriptive, as it is generally not possible to distinguish the “causal” effects of the labor market and pension reforms described above, demographic changes unrelated to these reforms, and age specific labor market effects of the business cycle and the crises of 2009/2010. Still, it seems useful to provide a brief summyry of the most important changes in labor market and pension policies in the observation period that might have contributed to these developments (Sect. 2). Chap. 3 presents estimation results on age effects in employment and unemployment changes, while Sect. 4 looks at early retirement and Sect. 5 on the development of real hourly wages by age group. Based on this empirical analysis, some implications for labor market policies are discussed in the concluding Chap. 6.",10

Malo,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Following the widespread diffusion of temporary employment (TE) in European countries, a large concern has been growing about direct and side negative effects of increasing flexibility of labour markets. The recent flexibility reforms had been introduced with the aim of removing labour market rigidities, which in the supply-side thinking (see e. g., OECD 1999, 2003; IMF 2007) were seen as the main cause of stagnant labour markets, under the implicit assumption that more flexible conditions for workers would not affect innovative capacity and productivity growth (Vergeer and Kleinknecht 2014). In this regard, however, most recent papers studying the role of TE in different European countries, and employing different empirical approach, find a negative and significant impact of TE on innovation and productivity (Ortega and Marchante 2010; Cappellari et al. 2012; Lisi 2013; Kleinknecht et al. 2014). Furthermore, the recent macro stylized-facts and, principally, the growthless job creation condition have drawn even more attention on the impact of flexibility reforms on productivity (Boeri and Garibaldi 2007; OECD 2007). The main objective of this paper consists in studying the impact of the share of TE on productivity, explicitly considering the differential effect in skilled and unskilled economic sectors. From this perspective, we go beyond to the current literature arguing that there are good reasons to suspect that the impact of TE could differ significantly according to sectors’ skill intensity. For this purpose, we build an industry-level panel of European countries that allows to divide sectors according to the skill intensity. This research connects with the wide spreading concern about cost-saving flexibility reforms in general and, in particular, temporary contracts. In fact, the debate both in the literature and in public institutions has been moving from promoting all types of flexibilization of labour markets to fight ‘Euroesclerosis’ (OECD 1994), toward criticizing TE as a form of flexibility at the margin (Boeri and Garibaldi 2009), especially because temporary contracts are found to damage the career prospects for young people (Cazes and Tonin 2010; OECD 2015), decrease the provision of on-the-job training by firms (Albert et al. 2005, 2010), reduce workers’ earnings (Booth et al. 2002; Garz 2013) and, as a side effect, negatively affect aggregate labour productivity (Kleinknecht 1998; Vergeer and Kleinknecht 2011, 2014). In this perspective, it seems highly relevant to study the role of sectors’ skill intensity behind the impact of TE, as the different channels of transmission through which TE affects productivity, which we discuss below, could have a different role according to skills’ intensity by industry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that attempts to investigate the impact of TE differentiated according to sectors’ skill intensity. Our main result is that TE is even more damaging in skilled sectors, with a negative effect significantly heavier than in unskilled sectors, and this would seem robust to little changes in the skill intensity index and in the sample used, as well as to different productivity measures. In particular, an increase of 10 percentage points of the share of TE in skilled sectors would lead to a decrease of about 1–1.5% in labour productivity growth, whereas in unskilled ones the reduction would be of 0.5–0.8%. To some extent, this result might support the idea that TE is currently used more as a cheaper form of job, instead of as a least-cost way of screening new workers (Booth et al. 2002; Güell and Petrongolo 2007; Autor and Housman 2010; Garz 2013). The paper proceeds as follows. Sect. 2 provides the background for the empirical analysis, with the previous literature on TE, flexibilization and productivity. In Sect. 3 we present the empirical analysis, focusing on the strategy to disentangle the impact of TE across sectors. Then, Sect. 4 describes the characteristics of our dataset and main variables. In Sect. 5 we present our estimates and provide different robustness checks. Finally, Sect. 6 collects the main conclusions of this study.",30

In Germany, sociologists and economists are increasingly painting a gloomy picture about the consequences of macroeconomic changes (Grabka and Frick 2008; Bertelsmann Stiftung 2013; Bosch and Kalina 2015). It is believed that while the older generations witnessed an improvement in job opportunities during the times of the German economic miracle since the 1950s and the expansion of the welfare state in the 1960s and 1970s, recent cohorts not only suffer from declining job entry opportunities but also from more downward mobility, fewer upward job moves, and generally flatter career lines. Based on these changes, it is assumed that the rising middle class is declining again (Herbert-Quandt-Stiftung 2007; Bertelsmann Stiftung 2013; Bosch and Kalina 2015; Nachtwey 2016). Whether this diagnosis is indeed valid or not (see the critique by Groh-Samberg and Hertel 2010; Institut für Sozialforschung und Gesellschaftspolitik 2011; Niehues 2014; Mayer 2016) is still unclear, given that most of the claims and counterclaims are based on relatively short-term (and mostly cross-sectional) empirical evidence contrasting the current labour market situation with what is believed to be true about the changing macrostructure and its effects on job histories in the distant past. The goal of this study is, therefore, to describe the long-term modernisation process and the changes in the labour market conditions affected by the ups and downs of the business cycle.Footnote 1 Further, this study aims to analyse the effects of these macro processes on the entry of men into the labour market in West Germany and their career mobility. Using combined data from the German Life History Study (GLHS) and longitudinal study ‘Working and Learning in a Changing World’ (ALWA: Arbeiten und Lernen im Wandel), we reconstruct the career histories of men born between 1929 and 1976, and analyse how their careers were shaped by macroeconomic changes between 1945 and 2008. As a measure of men’s “goodness of jobs” at entry into the labour market and across the job career we do not use wages but the broader sociological concept of magnitude prestige scale (MPS) suggested by Wegener (1988, 1992). Taking into account the job entry and career processes of men over a long observation window allows us to distinguish between the effects of age (A), period (P) and cohort (C) on the career processes in a more detailed manner. Compared to conventional APC analyses, which often apply methodological constraints to identify APC effects (Glenn 1977; Mayer and Huinink 1990), we suggest a more substantially grounded approach in this study (Sørensen 1986). We propose to measure cohort and period effects using theoretically derived indicators (Blossfeld 1986). Utilising time series data obtained from official statistics we first identify the most relevant macroeconomic changes and their impact on the labour market by performing confirmatory factor analysis. We then apply these macro indicators in a multi-level regression model to assess the historical macro conditions under which the successive cohorts entering the labour market started their job careers in West Germany (cohort effect). Based on men’s further careers, we then examine how the continuously changing macrostructure influences the men’s upward, lateral and downward career mobility (period effect) using a multi-level transition rate model and controlling for the men’s individual resources, such as educational attainment and changing labour force experience (life-course or age effect). This fully dynamic analysis allows us to gain a better understanding of the effect of long-term macroeconomic trends on social inequality – among other trends, such as educational expansion and qualification upgrading of the labour force, as well as demographic trends and their consequences, such as change of manpower and inter-cohort competition at the time of labour market entry and across the work history (Mayer and Huinink 1990) in Germany and across several generations. Our paper is organised as follows: based on economic and sociological labour market theories we develop hypotheses for our dynamic analysis of cohort, period, and life-course effects on career mobility. Then, we describe the data and methods used to identify cohort, period, and life-course effects. Thereafter, we present empirical evidence for the job trajectories of men in West Germany, and finally we draw conclusions about the development of opportunities at the time of entry into the labour market, career mobility and the long-term trend of social inequality across generations.",31

To resolve the puzzle, scholars have sought to identify the relative contribution of different factors to the gender gap. Whereas research on work-family compatibility, overwork, and the motherhood penalty (Waldfogel 1997; Gangl and Ziefle 2009; Cha and Weeden 2014; Goldin 2014) suggests that the strongly gendered effect of family formation accounts for a substantial part of the gap, a highly-cited 2007 Sociology of Education article that scrutinized the contribution of educational factors relative to family formation among the college-educated concluded that “family formation has virtually no effect on the income gap” (Bobbitt-Zeher 2007, p. 13). It also found that “values appear to matter only modestly” (Ibid.). According to that study, gender differences in fields of study instead explain the lion’s share of the income gap. In this article, I assess the robustness of these results by way of replication. This is an endeavor worth undertaking given that the original findings have important policy implications, as they suggest that improvements in work-family compatibility would do nothing to reduce economic gender inequality. I first conduct a pure replication. Fitting statistical models that emulate those of the original study closely reproduce the original findings. However, I argue that these estimates are biased because Bobitt-Zeher restricts her sample to year-round full-time workers and thus conditions on labor force participation which, according to her own theoretical argument, mediates the effect of family formation on income. I show that her estimates for the importance of values are negatively biased for the same reason. Equally important, I also show that the original study misspecified and misallocated the hypothesized gendered effect of family formation in both relevant decompositions. The results from a series of models that subsequently correct for endogeneous sample selection and misspecification suggest the original study indeed severely underestimated the importance of family formation, and also that of values. According to my findings these two factors explain nearly a third of the gender income gap in the sample at hand, and thus about as much as the educational factors emphasized in the original article. My re-analysis corroborates Bobbitt-Zeher’s finding that education-related factors in absolute terms explain a sizeable share of the gender income gap. For the sake of brevity, I choose not to debate here Bobbitt-Zeher’s decision to analyze incomes rather than wages or the issue of omitted variable bias in testing the theorized devaluation of college majors. These issues have been discussed elsewhere (Petersen 1989; Morgan and Arthur 2005; Gerber and Cheung 2008; Ochsenfeld 2014). My intention is not to single out Bobbitt-Zeher’s analysis for criticism. In fact, studies published in the top U. S. and German sociology journals have drawn similar conclusions based on very similar designs before and after (Marini and Fan 1997; Leuze and Strauß 2009). The purpose of this replication is thus to critically reflect on this enduring research tradition rather than to fault an individual author.",1

This has expressed itself both in higher levels of educational achievement and in a continuously growing female employment rate (Helbig 2012; Wanger 2011). But even though the employment behaviour of men and women is converging, especially at the start of their employment careers, after childbirth, men and women still frequently return to a more traditional division of roles (Bühlmann et al. 2010; Dressel et al. 2005; Drobnič et al. 1999; Schulz and Blossfeld 2006). It seems that women, and in particular mothers, still feel a greater responsibility for domestic work and child-raising duties than men. Consequently, after a child is born they interrupt their career more frequently and for longer periods of time than men. However, these employment interruptions entail negative consequences for mothers’ careers: they have a destabilising impact on future career paths (Grunow et al. 2011) and a negative effect on further wage development (Boll 2009; Ondrich et al. 2002; Ziefle 2004, 2009). It is primarily the duration of the interruption that determines how severe these consequences are: the longer the interruption, the worse the career repercussions (Aisenbrey et al. 2009; Boll 2009; Ejrnæs and Kunze 2013; Ondrich et al. 2003; Ruhm 1998; Ziefle 2004). Previous studies have already identified various key factors that influence the duration of family-related employment interruptions, including the individual characteristics of the mother and contextual factors at the level of firms, institutions and the economy as a whole. However, prior research has largely neglected occupational characteristics. The decision not to include occupations is unfortunate, because occupations have lasting consequences for individuals’ entire employment careers, especially in Germany, and play a crucial role in creating and maintaining social stratification (Konietzka 1999; Solga and Konietzka 1999). They can thus be assumed to have a decisive impact on the duration of family-related employment interruptions. This particularly applies to one central and persistent characteristic of the German occupational structure, namely occupational sex segregation. This article studies the impact of occupational sex segregation and associated occupational characteristics on women’s family-related employment interruptions. Although previous studies included the proportion of women in an occupation as a control variable, they did not examine how it exerts its influence (e. g. Stuth and Hennig 2014; Ziefle 2009; Ziefle and Gangl 2014). This is what our study explores. To understand the influence of occupational sex segregation, we take the share of part-time employees and the occupational wage level into consideration and explore whether the ostensibly family-friendly working hour arrangements in female-dominated occupations allow mothers to return to work more quickly or whether the low wage levels in female-dominated occupations result in longer interruptions due to lower earning losses. Moreover, we examine the sole effect of the proportion of women on the duration of employment interruptions when controlling for the occupational part-time rate and wage level. To address these concerns, we analyse data of starting cohort 6 (adults) of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), which is supplemented with occupational information based on the Sample of Integrated Labour Market Biographies (SIAB) and the German Microcensus. The following section summarises the research on family-related employment interruptions and the determinants of their duration. The third section describes the role of occupations in the German labour market and outlines the theoretical framework. Sect. 4 describes the data, variables and methodological design followed by Sect. 5, which presents the results, and Sect. 6, which draws the final conclusion.",5

Recent evidence for the U.S. labor market indicates declining wages for college graduates in the aftermath of the tech bust in 2000, while post-college workers (i. e., those with postbaccalaureate degree) face continuously high employment and wage opportunities (Beaudry et al. 2014, 2016). If similar patterns had occurred in Germany, this would indicate, “declining fortunes of the young” (Beaudry et al. 2014) to be more than a phenomenon of the U.S. labor market. To investigate empirically, whether there has been a corresponding trend in Germany, we have selected a set of employment indicators to analyze the chances and performance of labor market entrants in Germany over time. We focus on young workers since general changes in the labor market are first apparent for them (Kambourov and Manovskii 2009). The empirical analysis uses long-run information of a comprehensive sample of registered employees in the German social security system for the years 1975 to 2010 with about 11.5 million observations. Besides consideration of education attainment and wages overall, we put a particular focus of our study on the developments of the task composition, the chances of receiving a top-paying job, entry wages and wage growth, and wage premia for job market entrants over three and a half decades. Moreover, to allow for a detailed picture we distinguish four different education levels in the analysis. These comprise two distinct types of higher qualification (university and university of applied sciences), medium qualification (persons with completed vocational training in the German apprenticeship system) and low qualification (persons lacking completed vocational education). The data allow conducting a detailed descriptive analysis comparing a large number of cohorts of job market entrants over time. Summarizing the empirical picture obtained from the indicators clearly indicates that there was a turning point of the labor market chances of young job market entrants around the year 2000: highly-educated workers have faced declining employment opportunities in top-paying jobs and, partly, in analytical jobs after 2000. Real entry wages have fallen for each new entry cohort since then until the end of the observation period. Moreover, wage growth after five years has substantially declined for cohorts entering the labor market in this period in Germany, too. In particular medium-skilled and higher-skilled labor market entrants have been affected by this development. Whereas the share of young high-skilled workers performing analytical jobs has declined only slightly after the tech bust (similar to the U.S.), our results indicate a general decline of wages for young workers. Falling wages are more profound for medium-skilled and low-skilled workers than for high-skilled workers. Wage premia for higher education slightly rose relative to medium-skilled and low-skilled workers. Moreover, the displacement effects, shrinking wages, and flattening wage growth for medium-skilled and low-skilled workers further signify the impacts of the increase in graduation rates in higher education. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section gives a more detailed discussion of the related literature for the analysis at hand. Sect. 3 introduces the data used for the empirical analysis. The empirical results of the considered aspects are presented in Sect. 4. The final section provides the conclusions.",9

It is expected that the group of approximately 890,000 newly arrived asylum seekers will stay for a considerable length of time in Germany. Measures to facilitate integration into society and the labour market have been discussed by a variety of bodies.Footnote 1 In this context it seems to be of particular interest to examine volunteer-run initiatives which intend to provide support for refugees. In Germany many such initiatives have emerged.Footnote 2 Although volunteer-based support is widespread, scientific studies on its scope and consequences are not yet widespread.Footnote 3
 In this study we concentrate on a specific small-scale project, an inclusive and multi-dimensional soccer project for male asylum seekers, intended to enhance social inclusion and labour market participation. The project is administered by a non-commercial, non-administrative association and run by non-professional soccer coaches.Footnote 4 The programme of this project consists of a comprehensive package of soccer training, mentoring and language classes,Footnote 5 recreational activities and job placements. Invitations to participate in the project were randomised over a pool of refugees living in the Rhine-Neckar area in Germany. Our study presents the results of a survey among refugees in the soccer project (treatment group) and two groups of refugees living in a comparable situation (control groups). Socioeconomic similarities and disparities among these groups of refugees are examined. Furthermore, we provide information on the cost of fleeing their home countries, their human capital and indicators of social labour market integration. Finally, exploiting the randomisation design, we provide some preliminary evidence on the short run effects of this volunteer-based project. Our main findings can be summarized as follows. On average, the 81 male respondents of the survey were 22.8 years old, had spent nearly 9 years in education and had already accumulated 5 years of work experience in their home countries or on their way to Germany. Our sample is not representative for the entire population of refugees living in Germany. It corresponds to the significant group of recently arrived young male refugees. 24% of the refugees who applied for asylum in 2016 were in the age group of 18–25 and most of them were males (BAMF 2017). Respondents report on average good health and are fairly optimistic about finding work in Germany. They had been living in Germany for 9 months at the time of the interview. 36% were searching for a job, and 14% report that they were working at the time of the survey. Thus, it seems that the surveyed refugees are equipped with good health, reasonable work experience and motivation, but a low level of education compared to Germans of the same age group. 28 survey participants take part in the soccer project. Most of them indicated that they would like to participate more frequently. Comparisons of means of key outcomes suggest that treatment participants visit German natives in their homes more often than the control group, which hints at some initial positive short-run integration effects. The study proceeds as follows. In the next section the treatment and institutional setting are introduced. Sect. 3 discusses the randomised experiment and explains how the survey was conducted. Sect. 4 summarizes our initial survey evidence on human capital, on the cost of fleeing their homeland, and on labour market integration. Additionally, we will discuss the potential short-run treatment effects of the soccer project. Sect. 5 concludes.",5

During the early career, such episodes are likely to be observed for three main reasons. Unemployment after the loss of a job is particularly frequent for young workers, as international data on unemployment rates show. Work absenteeism is also likely to occur because of parental leave related to childbirth; parental leave is traditionally taken by women. Family formation is started most often before age 30, which coincides with the early career. In many countries, young men face the risk of compulsory service in the military that also leads to periods of work absence. Given that the early career is an important phase of wage growth but the nature of work absences is quite heterogeneous, questions arise regarding whether work absences affect wages and whether effects vary across types of work absence. This paper investigates the impact of periods of work absence on wages for young skilled highly attached female and male workers using data for West Germany. The emphasis is on the estimation of the short- and long-term effects of different types of work absence. The data that we use allow us to distinguish different types of career absence: unemployment, maternity leave for female workers, compulsory service for male workers, and an additional residual group of other non-work spells. For the empirical analysis of the wage determination process, we adopt a panel wage regression building on the human capital model that segments the work history into work experience spells and non-work spells (Mincer and Polachek 1974). We present estimates separately for men and women that take into account heterogeneity in the type of work absence and the timing. The regressions control for how many years have lapsed since the event occurred. We allow for unobserved individual fixed effects. We focus on workers with apprenticeship training, whom we refer to as skilled workers. Our analysis excludes unskilled workers and those with technical college or university degrees. Typically, an apprenticeship is started after 9 or 10 years of schooling. While in training, apprentices have an apprenticeship employment contract. Training takes 2.5–3.5 years depending on the training occupation. Firms have to follow national training curricula, and apprentices attend vocational schools for 1–2 days a week. The apprentice is awarded a certificate after successful completion of regionally unified oral, written and practical examinations. Apprentices receive a low wage, of about 20–30% of the wage of a skilled worker. We restrict the sample to highly attached full-time workers in order to exclude workers who drop out of work during the early career. The data sample is extracted from the IABS 75-97. It is particularly suited for the analysis of the relation between episodes of work absence and wages in a human capital framework primarily for three reasons. First, the data allow us to observe for each individual complete wage and employment histories from first entry into employment. Hence, we can measure the human capital accumulation process very accurately. Second, start and end dates of employment and types of work absence throughout the year are available in the event history data set. This allows us to measure the duration of every spell and the type of work absence. Third, the IABS 75-97 allows us to follow a large sample of individuals for a period of up to 15 years or the entire early career. It contains very accurate information on daily wages for full-time workers, as well as detailed information on education that allows us to select workers with apprenticeship training. The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 summarizes previous findings on gender differences and wage effects of different types of work absence. Section 3 reviews the wage regression model that we employ in the empirical analysis. Section 4 presents the data and summary statistics. Section 5 presents the estimation results. Section 6 concludes.",

Mathä,Ladislav Wintr,Male,Male,Male,Male,"After a long period of sustained growth, Luxembourg was severely affected in the initial phase of the global economic and financial crisis in 2008–2009. During the recession, Luxembourg authorities introduced a broad range of labour market policies in order to cushion the effects of the recession on the labour market. The policy package included a mix of activation measures designed to increase job opportunities for the unemployed and improve the matching between labour supply and demand, passive income replacement measures for those who lost their jobs and other measures designed to support labour demand, such as loosening the eligibility criteria of short-time work arrangements (STWA) (see Table 6 in Appendix 1 for further details). During 2009–2014, the number of people involved in active labour market policies rose continuously from about 3100 to 5000 (ADEM 2015). The number of employees involved in short-time work rose very rapidly to unprecedented levels in 2008–2009 (nearly 10,000 people in spring 2009, i.e. 4.5% of total employees) and quickly receded, only to gain new momentum in 2011–2012 and remain at elevated levels compared to the pre-crisis period until 2015 (ADEM 2015; Comité de conjoncture). This paper studies short-time work (STW) in Luxembourg during the crisis and analyses their evolution, determinants and effects.Footnote 1 Short-time work is intended to address transitory shocks. Short-time work is designed to help firms limit costly redundancies, preserve firm-specific human capital and avoid hiring and training costs in the subsequent upswing. STW is normally of short duration (Arpaia et al. 2010) and was widely used in many EU countries, including Luxembourg, during the economic and financial crisis. In Luxembourg, the law sets a maximum limit to the reduction in hours worked per employee in order to share the burden of adjustment across a larger number of workers. To be able to participate in short-time work, firms and employees have to meet eligibility criteria. We exploit a firm survey conducted by the Central Bank of Luxembourg at the end of 2014. The survey asked human resources managers and/or CEOs in Luxembourg detailed questions about their companies’ characteristics, how they were affected by the crisis during 2008–2009 and 2010–2013 and how shocks and changes in the economic environment led them to adjust labour, wages and prices. The survey also included a set of questions on short-time work. We analyse which firms applied for and used short-time work and what effect this had on firm employment, or put differently how many jobs may have been saved through STW. The paper contributes to the literature by presenting the first analysis of STW in Luxembourg using micro data.Footnote 2 It employs a unique firm-level survey that allows us to study the impact of shocks on firms’ decision to apply for STW Furthermore, we compare our survey-based results to results derived from macro data for Luxembourg. Studying STW in Luxembourg is interesting as it shows the impact of STW in a country with specific labour market institutions, such as high degree of wage rigidity and a relatively high level of employment protection. The use of STW might be particularly useful for firms that find it difficult or costly to adjust their labour costs or employment. While short-time work is largely a sector-specific phenomenon, concentrated especially in the manufacturing sector, we find that the likelihood of a firm using short-time work generally increases with demand volatility, the share of workers with permanent contracts, the extent of firm-specific human capital, the degree of export orientation and with the inability to shift workers between establishments. Direct answers from human resources managers and and/or companies’ CEOs suggest that short-time work may have saved 20–25% of jobs involved corresponding to 2400 jobs in 2008–2009 and 921 jobs in 2010–2013 if extrapolated to the whole economy. This corresponds to 0.7% and 0.3% of employment in the respective sub-periods. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the STW literature. Section 3 reviews the rise of STW during the Great Recession in Luxembourg. Section 4 presents the dataset used for the empirical analysis.

Part of this labor earnings penalty has been attributed to the fact that a share of the skills acquired during tertiary education could be specific to occupations related to the chosen field of study, and those who are mismatched may be inefficiently using their skills (Robst 2007).Footnote 1
 As also emphasized by Robst (2007), the extent of the earnings losses associated with the occupation-field of study mismatch depends on the degree of transferability of skills. Knowledge acquired in a given field of study should be more or less valuable depending on how these skills are useful in an individual’s occupation. Estimates are usually consistent with this hypothesis, as partially mismatched individuals, that is, those who hold a job that is somewhat related to their fields, usually earn more than completely mismatched ones but less than those workers who are strongly matched to their jobs (Robst 2007; Nordin et al. 2010). The empirical approach usually adopted to estimate the labor earnings consequences of mismatches between occupation and field of study among graduates is based on binary variables to represent their statuses as matched, weakly matched, or mismatched. However, this approach does not seem to be able to appropriately represent disparities in the degree of similarity between occupations and fields of study. Even among workers classified as mismatched, there would be great heterogeneity in the way their occupations are related to their fields of study. A mismatched worker may have an occupation in which a substantial share of the skills acquired during tertiary education is still useful, whereas another mismatched worker who completed the same program may have an occupation that requires completely different skills from those associated with the type of tertiary program completed. The aim of this paper is to provide a continuous measure to represent the distance between skills acquired in tertiary education and those required in an individual’s occupation. As shown by Gathmann and Schonberg (2010), human capital is at least partially transferable across occupations with similar task requirements, and workers who move to a distant occupation suffer a larger wage loss than those who move to occupations with similar skill requirements to those of their former occupations. However, task specialization may already begin prior to labor market entry (Sloane 2003; Rocher 2011). The approach adopted in this paper is similar to the one proposed by Gathmann and Schönberg (2010) to measure transferability of skills across occupations using a task-based approach, in which workers apply their skills to tasks required in their occupations to produce output.Footnote 2 Nevertheless, the empirical analysis here investigates the portability of human capital from tertiary education to occupation. The distance measure presented in this paper intends to offer more information on the transferability of skills from tertiary education to labor market than the one provided by dummies for mismatch and weak match, helping to explain whether changes in labor earnings are related to differences in the level of the education-occupation mismatch. The empirical analysis in this paper uses data from the 2010 Brazilian census and the 2010 Brazilian Classification of Occupations (Classificação Brasileira de Ocupações 2010). Making use of information from the latter data source, each 4-digit level occupation is represented by a mix of tasks usually performed by workers. Then, the distance measure between field of study and occupation is computed based on the similarity between tasks representing an individual’s occupation and tasks representing the occupation most closely related to his or her field of study. The distance measure can be imputed to each employed individual in the 2010 census dataset. Census data reveal that about half of the Brazilian workers with tertiary education are classified as mismatched according to the classification based on binary variables. Evidence also indicates, however, there is a lot of heterogeneity in the way the occupations of those mismatched workers are associated with their corresponding areas of study. This can be illustrated by the fact that the proportion of mismatched workers in the lower tail of the distance measure distribution is almost the same as that of mismatched workers at the top of the distribution. The results show that hourly labor earnings penalties tend to increase as the distance measure between occupation and field and study enlarges. It seems that, even among mismatched individuals, those who have occupations with similar skill requirements in their fields of study are more able to transfer skills acquired during tertiary education than workers who have occupations unrelated to their fields of study. Thus, estimates suggest that the continuous measure of mismatch presented here helps to capture an important part of the heterogeneity in the labor earnings differences between mismatched and matched workers that is not accounted for by binary variables. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the data sources and describes the construction of the continuous distance measure between area of study and occupation. Section 3 presents the descriptive analysis of the data. Section 4 reports the empirical findings relating the distance measure to hourly labor earnings, whereas Sect. 5 has the main conclusions of the paper.",6
52,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,25 July 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-018-0242-z,The anatomy of job polarisation in the UK,December 2018,Andrea Salvatori,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The increasing ability of technology to replace workers in performing easier-to-codify “routine” tasks has been singled out in the literature as the main driver of “job polarisation”, i.e. the decline in the share of mid-pay mid-skill jobs observed in several developed countries (Autor 2014; Goos et al. 2014). Recent contributions, however, have highlighted that the occupational wage patterns observed in many countries do not fit the predictions of the so-called routine-biased technology change (RBTC) hypothesis, igniting a debate among scholars and policy makers on the importance of technology in driving changes in the occupational structure.Footnote 1
 This paper contributes to this debate by investigating the role of changes in the supply of different skill groups in explaining job polarisation in the UK over the past three decades. The focus on changes on the supply-side is clearly motivated by Fig. 1 which shows a dramatic increase in the shares of graduates and immigrants since the mid-1990s,Footnote 2 boosted respectively by a large expansion in higher education places in the early 1990s and the EU enlargement of 2004. Changes in shares of skill and demographic groups between 1979 and 2012 Goos and Manning (2007) used data for 1979–1999 and concluded that compositional changes could not explain the polarisation in the UK. This highly influential paper remains the only paper to have tackled this question [see McIntosh (2013) for a review]. This paper replicates and extends to more recent years the work of Goos and Manning (2007) and provides new insights on the polarisation process in the UK. In particular, the main contribution of this paper is to provide new evidence on the role of changes in the skill mix exploring for the first time the contribution of individual skill groups to the aggregate pattern of polarisation in general and to changes in the share of routine employment in particular. This new evidence provides a more nuanced picture of the implications of changes in the composition of labour supply for the occupational structure than in Goos and Manning (2007) and shows whether any particular feature of the polarisation process can be explained by changes in the relative size of particular skill groups. As widely recognised in both the labour and trade literature, changes in the skill mix of labour supply can lead to changes in the occupational structure as firms switch to production methods making a more intensive use of the more abundant factor. Dustmann and Glitz (2015) and Lewis (2011) exploit exogenous variation in the supply of immigrants to provide causal evidence that firms adjust production methods to changes in the supply of skills, but isolating exogenous variations in the supply of graduates has generally proven more difficult.Footnote 3 Recently, Blundell et al. (2016) argues that firms adjustment of their occupational structure to the largely exogenous increase in the supply of graduates over the same time period considered in this paper has led to stable educational premia in the UK. The literature on job polarisation has long acknowledged the potential role of changes in the skill mix as well. As mentioned above, Goos and Manning (2007) concluded that changes in the composition of the workforce cannot explain job polarisation in the UK between 1979 and 1999.Footnote 4 It is therefore clear from the existing literature that changes in the skill mix of the workforce are a plausible driver of changes in the occupational structure that deserve empirical consideration. The main evidence presented in this paper on the role of individual skill groups comes from a shift-share analysis which highlights the contribution to overall job polarisation of changes within and between gender-education-age-immigration cells from 1979 to 2009. Goos and Manning (2007) used a version of this approach to show that compositional changes could not explain the overall polarisation of the labour market between 1979 and 1999. They did not consider the role of immigrants (whose share had only increased marginally by 1999) and their results might not capture fully the cumulative effect of the strong growth in graduates that started a few years into the 1990s (Fig. 1). In addition, due to the data limitations of the time, Goos and Manning (2007) did not consider changes in routine employment within the UK at all.Footnote 5 I use several alternative measures of routiness (Autor 2013) to provide the first evidence on the extent to which compositional changes can account for the decline in routine employment specifically. Importantly, changes in the relative size of different groups could account for significant features of the polarisation process even if they do not explain the entire pattern as observed by Goos and Manning (2007). To investigate this hypothesis, I present a breakdown of the shift-share analysis which provides the first evidence for the UK on the contribution of different skill groups to changes in employment shares across the occupational skill distribution in each of the past three decades. The evidence on the contribution of different skill groups to polarisation is of interest for at least two reasons. First, in the absence of credible sources of exogenous variation on either side of the labour market, assessing the relative importance of within vs between group polarisation is crucial for a critical appraisal of the hypothesis that the process is driven by technology. This is why Goos and Manning (2007) use this method, and, more generally, evidence of pervasive polarisation within different skill groups is typically cited in support of a technology effect as it indicates that aggregate polarisation is not merely the result of changes in the relative size of groups specialising in different occupations (Spitz-Oener 2006; Acemoglu and Autor 2011). Second, the evidence on the contribution of individual groups to the aggregate polarisation enhances our understanding of the specific challenges faced by different skill groups in an increasingly polarising labour market.Footnote 6 Evidence on the contribution of individual skill groups to aggregate polarisation is currently very limited for countries other than the US as I discuss in Sect. 2. The key findings of the paper can be summarised as follows. The main feature of the polarisation process in the UK has been a shift of employment towards high-paid occupations, which have gained 80% of the employment shares lost by middling occupations. When occupations are ranked by education, it becomes apparent that it is those with the lowest initial level of education that have lost most employment shares. The results of the shift-share analysis suggest that the increase in the share of graduates has contributed significantly to this substantial reallocation of employment from middle-pay to high-pay occupations. The increase in immigrants, on the other hand, does not explain any particular feature of job polarisation in the UK. In addition, there is no clear indication of polarisation within all skill groups—a fact that previous literature has cited as evidence supporting the hypothesis that technology is the main driver of the process. Hence, this paper adds to the growing body of evidence from other countries (Autor 2015; Green and Sand 2015) that casts doubts on the extent to which technology can be seen as the primary driver of the polarisation process.",21

Shi,Christian Imdorf,Stefan Sacchi,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In recent years, a broad body of literature has shed light on how unemployment affects (re-)integration in the labour market and has investigated under what conditions the so-called scarring effects of unemployment may occur. The effects of unemployment on later employment chances vary from country to country and occupation to occupation (Grip and Wolbers 2006). They depend on factors such as cyclical changes in the overall economic condition and institutional school-work linkage (Breen 2005; Gangl 2002; Müller and Gangl 2003; Wolbers 2007). With regard to youth unemployment, it is important to ask in what contexts unemployment matters for individuals’ later labour-market outcomes. Demand-side studies have focused on recruiters’ perceptions of unemployment and how this can influence their hiring decisions. Applicants’ features, such as the duration of unemployment (Kroft et al. 2013; Oberholzer-Gee 2008), and characteristics of the vacancy, such as the skill level of the job (Bonoli 2014), have both been shown to have determinant influences on hiring outcomes. Country-specific classifications of education systems and labour markets are often too crude to capture recruiting dynamics that vary greatly across different types and levels of jobs within countries. Depending on their type and level, different occupations are connected to different educational tracks. The tightness of the school-work linkage varies accordingly, which in turn leads to varying recruitment strategies. In this article, we focus on the regional labour-market context of German-speaking Switzerland, which is characterised, like Germany, by a high degree of vocational specificity and standardisation in the school-to-work transition system (Imdorf et al. 2017; Shavit and Müller 1998; Müller and Gangl 2003; Stalder and Nägele 2011). Compared to other OECD countries, the youth unemployment rate is relatively low in Switzerland, and it was also at a comparably low level after the recent Great Recession. In the fourth quarter of 2015, 9.8% of young people between 15 and 24 were unemployed (OECD 2015; according to the ILO definition of unemployment). The proportion of skilled young workers at the entry level who have been unemployed long-term (0.1% in September 2012) is lower than that of skilled older workers (0.4% in September 2012) (Sacchi 2012: 9). This picture has remained stable since 2004, showing a low share of young workers remaining unemployed over 1 year (ibid.). We are thus analysing the contextual significance of unemployment scarring in a country with a stable economy and relatively low unemployment figures compared to many European countries. To understand the consequences of early unemployment, we draw on signalling theory (McCormick 1990; Spence 1973) and human capital theory (Becker 1964; Pissarides 1992). We argue that in contexts with a structural school-to-work transition such as in Switzerland, the detrimental effect of early unemployment depends on how well the applicant’s profile matches the requirements of the advertised position. By conducting a factorial survey experiment, we have aimed to overcome the challenge, addressed in recent recruitment studies, of simultaneously taking recruiters’ and applicants’ characteristics into account. Our methodological design enables us to account for applicants’ characteristics and the recruiters’ side by controlling for the match between the applicants’ profiles and the job requirements. The factorial experiment is built upon hypothetical applications tailored to real-world job vacancies, which are evaluated by the recruiters in charge of filling the selected vacant positions. This unique experimental design helps maximise external and internal validity. In the following, we first discuss the findings of previous recruitment studies on the scarring effects of unemployment (Sect. 2). In Sect. 3, we present the theoretical framework of our study, from which we derive our hypotheses. Section 4 describes the data and methods applied. The results are presented in Sect. 5, followed by their discussion in Sect. 6. A conclusion is given at the end.",22
52,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,28 May 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-018-0240-1,Transmission of vocational skills in the second part of careers: the effect of ICT and management changes,December 2018,Nathalie Greenan,Pierre-Jean Messe,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The rapid ageing of the population in most developed countries urges companies to find new Human Resource management strategies for a successful integration of a more age-diverse workforce. In this setting, European Union employers and trade unions have negotiated in March 2017 a framework agreement on active ageing as well as an inter-generational approach. This agreement has two main goals: improving the ability of workers of all ages to remain healthy and active in work until the legal retirement age and facilitating transfers of knowledge and experience between generations. However, recent studies that have examined the question of intergenerational knowledge transmission, mainly in terms of mentoring, highlight a striking fact: the under-representation of workers aged over 45 among mentors (Masingue 2009; Molinié and Volkoff 2013). This leads us to investigate the role of older workers in the process of knowledge transfer within organisations. The goal of this paper is first to understand why the participation to knowledge transfer strongly declines in the second part of careers and to address which are the main factors behind it. In what follows, we put forward the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT hereafter) and management changes. Some empirical evidence show that these innovations accelerated the obsolescence of specific skills acquired by senior workers (De Grip and Van Loo 2002) and affected them negatively through adaptability requirements (Aubert et al. 2006; Bartel and Sicherman 1993; Greenan et al. 2014). New management practices that have often accompanied the introduction of ICT over the past three decades signalled a move towards multi-skilling, greater autonomy and a constant redefinition of tasks to be performed (Greenan and Mairesse 1999). This may suggest that workers in the second part of their career progressively lost their role of knowledge and experience transmission in the dynamic work environment of the most technology advanced firms. We test this assumption using a French matched employer–employee survey on organisational changes and computerisation (COI) conducted in 2006. Interviewed workers declare how frequently they show work practices to other colleagues or help them when they encounter problems. Even though respondents do not directly report whether they are mentors or not, we can identify the workers who transmit their skills informally within the firm.Footnote 1
 In addition, interviewed firm representatives report about the introduction of modern management tools and ICT equipment in their organisation, at the time of the survey and 3 years before from retrospective questions. This allows us to control for changes that occurred within the work environment. To make the workers employed in changing and non-changing firms comparable in terms of observable characteristics, we rely on propensity score matching techniques (Rosenbaum and Rubin 1983). As matched employer–employee survey have a complex sampling design, we rely on the recent literature regarding the application of propensity score matching to complex surveys (Austin et al. 2016; DuGoff et al. 2014; Zanutto 2006). We show that ICT and management changes have a negative and significant effect on the probability of transmitting vocational skills among more experienced worker. In a second part of the paper, we examine whether training mitigates this negative effect. Indeed, as the underlying mechanism is the acceleration of skill obsolescence in changing firms, training may contribute to updating older workers’ skills. However, one could wonder why this may increase their probability of transmitting their knowledge. In other words, since ICT and management changes have depreciated their skills, workers in the second part of their careers would not have any valid knowledge to transmit. We rely here on the task-based approach literature,Footnote 2 which relates the tasks performed on the jobs to the skills needed to carry them out. A job is synthetized by a bundle of tasks and required skills. As noted by Green (2012), the frontier between tasks and skills affected by the development of ICTs and those who are not remains difficult to draw. Jobs redesigns depend on how management decides to take advantage of the new opportunities that come with technological progress. In the concomitant tasks reconfiguration, part of the skills accumulated by experienced workers may become obsolete while others remain valid and valuable for the organisation. Hence, training older workers to update their obsolete skills is a way to maintain access to those skills that still contribute to the knowledge base of production. In doing so, these older workers remain integrated to the process of knowledge transmission within the organisation. Our empirical results support this theory: using propensity score matching techniques and controlling for unobserved individual ability by a proxy, we show a positive effect of older workers’ participation in a training program regarding the use of new ICT tools on their probability of transmitting their skills to other colleagues. This effect is stronger in firms with ICT and management changes. The remainder of our paper is organised as follows. In the next section, we briefly summarize the existing literature on intergenerational skills transmission. We present data and descriptive statistics in Sect. 3 and we discuss our empirical strategy in Sect. 4. We describe our results in Sect. 5 looking first at effects of technological and organisational changes on the probability of transmitting knowledge and then assessing how training may interact with this effect. Section 6 concludes.",2
52,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,22 May 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-018-0241-0,Do the labour market returns to university degrees differ between high and low achieving youth? Evidence from Australia,December 2018,Gary N. Marks,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"One of the most dramatic changes in the last half-century in developed countries has been the expansion of university education, from elite to mass participation. Between the 1960 and 2005, the proportion of US high school graduates enrolling at college increased from 45% to between 65 and 70% (Alon 2009, p. 788). For Canada, McIntosh (2010, p. 458) observes that post-secondary education increased by a factor of six between 1961 and 1997. Arum et al. (2006, pp. 15, 16) show a doubling of higher education participation across developed countries from 20% in the 1960s to 40% in the 1990s. In most countries graduation from university—what the OECD (2009, p. 62) refers to as tertiary type A education—has increased to around an average of 40% in OECD countries with substantial increases in many countries over the relatively brief period, 2000–2007. According to the European social survey the proportion of graduates in youth cohorts in European countries increased, on average, from about 12% in 1950–1960 to over 40% in 2001–2010 (Koucký et al. 2010, p. 10). Participation rates are highest in Ireland, Denmark, Spain and Norway at around 60% or more. For Australia, less than 5% of cohorts born before World War II attended university. For the 1970–1981 cohort, the figure was close to 20% (Marks and McMillan 2007, p. 362). In 2012 of those aged 25–35, 39% have a bachelor degree or higher university degree compared to 25% of those aged 55–64 and 15% of those aged 65 or more (Wilkins 2015, p. 70). For youth cohorts born in the early 1980s, 30–35% completed a university degree (Hérault and Zakirova 2015, p. 86). According to Jerrim and Vignoles (2015), 39% of the youths enroll at university by age 20, a rate similar to that for other Anglophone countries. There is a broad political consensus to further expand university education by political parties, universities and stakeholders (Universities Australia 2013). For example, the Australian Labour Party’s platform has a target of 40% of 25–34 year-olds holding bachelor level degree or higher by 2025. The justifications for further expansion are: universities’ role in facilitating innovation and the knowledge economy, the superior labour market outcomes of university graduates and satisfying the increased demand for university education. There is also a, albeit smaller, consensus that youth unemployment and other labour market problems in the school-to-work transition are best addressed by further investments in education and training rather than politically sensitive reforms to the labour market. It is argued that vocational education and training strongly facilitates young people in the school-to-work transition and expanding it would provide substantial economic benefits in productivity, labour market participation and GDP growth (e.g. Rudd et al. 2007). For Australia, the OECD (2010) advocates both an expansion of vocational education and increased labour market flexibility. During the last decade there have been several substantial changes to the provision of vocational education (see Dempsey 2013) aiming to enhance the work skills of non-university bound youth. There are concerns that the expansion of the university sector has gone too far. It is logical to suppose that with expansion, university degrees become devalued in the labour market. The expansion has occurred mainly by formerly non-university institutions—Centres of Advanced Education, technical, teacher and nursing colleges—being transformed into universities. Of the 25–35-year-old cohort, only 23% received their highest university qualification from one of the high status ‘group of eight’ universities. For those aged 65 and older, the comparable figure was 45% (Wilkins 2015, p. 70). Increased university participation means there are more academically weaker students at university than in comparable older cohorts. There is concern that there is already an oversupply of university graduates that cannot find appropriate employment especially in particular disciplines (Vogel 2013; Papadopoulos 2014). The labour market outcomes of recent graduates have continued to worsen (marginally) following their deterioration in the aftermath of Global Financial Crisis (Guthrie 2015). This concern may be misplaced. Analyzing youth cohort data, Hérault and Zakirova (2015) found premiums for earnings of between 8 and 11% for completed bachelor degrees in the years following graduation. They also identified enrolment premiums of a similar magnitude which increase with time since dropping out of university. There were no completion premiums for vocational education although there were sizable enrolment effects, especially in the first year after completing a spell of post-school education. In subsequent years, the labour force benefits of enrolment in vocational education were smaller and often not statistically significant. A recent analysis of Australian youth data from several cohorts noted slightly lower unemployment rates for university degrees for both males (2.0%) and females (2.1%) compared to males (2.6%) and females (2.2%) overall (Hérault et al. 2012). The purpose of this study is to compare the benefits (or otherwise) of university degrees and vocational qualifications for a wider range of labour market outcomes and to examine if the labour market benefits associated with university degrees also apply to low achievers whom without the expansion of university education would not have had the opportunity to obtain a university degree. The data analyzed is from a younger Australian youth cohort than analyzed in the studies cited above. The labour market outcomes investigated are: occupational status, hourly earnings, weekly earnings, employment, unemployment, and full-time employment. Hourly earnings allow comparison of the returns to qualifications per hour worked. Among Australian young people there is considerable part-time and casual employment. Weekly earnings are a much better indicator of the standard of living. Simply having a job is a positive labour market outcome whereas unemployment is the most undesirable outcome. A full-time job indicates a strong attachment to the labour market and is often the first step in a career. There are a variety of other influences on youth labour market outcomes that must be considered in any analysis of the school-to-work transition. These include gender, socioeconomic background, achievement or test scores, school completion and labour force experience. Gender, qualifications and labour force experience are standard variables to include in labour force analyses. They are also important in studies of the youth labour market (Ryan 2001). Typically, separate analyses are conducted for young men and young women since there are important gender differences, notably in earnings, labour force participation and full-time work. The OECD (2010) emphasizes the importance of a ‘good start’, generally defined as appropriate full-time employment, for young people’s subsequent labour market experiences. Similarly, there is much evidence for the scarring effects of unemployment (Arulampalam et al. 2000; Gangl 2004; Gregg 2001; OECD 2010). Test scores taken at adolescence, a proxy for ability, have effects on (adult) occupational status, earnings, unemployment and other labour market outcomes (Marks 2014, pp. 91–112; Warren et al. 2002). Analyses of labour market outcomes in Australian youth cohorts typically find effects for gender, socioeconomic background, test scores and labour force experience on earnings, unemployment and occupational group, net of educational qualifications (Huq 2014; Hérault et al. 2012; Marks and Fleming 1998a, b; Buchler and Dockery 2015; Marks 2005). Increasing school completion (that is completing year 12) has long been a policy goal and recent work suggests that school completion is beneficial (Ryan 2011). The question of whether the effects of educational qualifications on labour market outcomes differ by student achievement is examined using students’ test scores from the OECD’s Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) tests conducted when they were 15 years of age.",3

A significant part of the sociological and economic literature concentrates on explaining the gender differences in wages, sometimes referred to as the gender pay gap (GPG). These differences vary over countries, cohorts and time spans, but are found almost everywhere and almost all the time (Gartner and Hinz 2009: 566; Mandel and Semyonov 2005: 957; Weinberger and Kuhn 2010: 389; Triventi 2013: 571; Kassenboehmer and Sinning 2014: 339). There are several theories and models which account for a substantial part of the gender pay gap, e.g. by including differences in human capital endowments. One aspect of the gender pay gap that has been neglected thus far in the German context are the potential gender-specificities in job mobility, the characteristics and effects of which have been explored in several previous studies. However, most of these studies were based on data from Anglophone countries with flexible labor markets and they have produced mixed results. For example, there is evidence that moving directly from one job to another has a beneficial effect on incomes (Keith and McWilliams 1999), but another study suggested that indirect job transition also has positive effects (Antel 1991). One factor that probably influences these mechanisms is the labor market structure as described in the varieties of capitalism literature. One would therefore expect analyses of German data to yield different results since Germany is usually classed as having a coordinated market economy (Hall and Soskice 2001: 21 f.) and there is currently less evidence on the mechanisms underpinning the gender pay gap in such economies. The main features of the German labor market include a high segmentation on the basis of qualifications and skills, low mobility between segments (Scherer 2004: 373) and high employment protection (Hall and Soskice 2001: 19). These factors probably affect the frequency of job changes and their outcomes which makes it important to analyze coordinated market economies as well. Given the rising number of university graduates and the importance of the early years of an individual’s employment—when wage growth is especially strong (Fuller 2008: 158) but the influence of family not yet very pronounced (Triventi et al. 2015: 26)—the population analyzed in this study has particular importance. The issues on which this study focused were the frequency with which individuals change employer during their early career, the nature of the relationship between gender and changes of employer and how changes of employer affect wages and the gender pay gap in Germany. Thus the results can be compared with those of other studies to provide an analysis of the effects of labor market structure.",3

Research review by Fric (2017) indicates that gay peopleFootnote 1 face barriers when accessing employment. Recent surveys among gays and lesbians in Europe show that a considerable amount of respondents experienced discrimination or harassment in the workplace (Eurofound 2016). However, sexual orientation discrimination is rarely reported and scarcely results in court cases in Europe (van Balen et al. 2011). The lack of official cases may lead to the conclusion that discrimination against sexual minorities is not a common problem in the labour market. Such interpretation has implications for policies on this issue. It is desirable to understand what the relationships are between (perceived) discrimination, the employment status and reporting of discrimination in gay people. Is perceived discrimination related to employment status? How does the perception of being discriminated at work relate to the reporting of discrimination incidents? How do disclosure of sexual orientation and sexual prejudice in the workplace influence these outcomes? In this article I try to answer these questions. I formulate several hypotheses that I empirically test using the European Union Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (EU LGBT) surveyFootnote 2 data. I applied structural equation model and verified the results with the logistic regression model. I am not aware of any study that would empirically test the relationship between my concepts of interest. The research has concentrated on the antecedents of disclosure of sexual orientation in the workplace (such as company policies, extent of disclosure in other contexts) and the effects of disclosure (for example on employees’ commitment, job satisfaction or stress levels). I identified only limited research that would link the extent of disclosure of sexual orientation in the workplace to perceived discrimination. For example, Ragins and Cornwell (2001) found that gay employees were more likely to conceal their sexual orientation at work (and to have turnover intentions) if they perceived greater workplace discrimination than those who reported less discrimination. According to Ragins et al. (2007), perceptions of past discrimination positively predicted fears about disclosure of sexual orientation. Surprisingly, perceptions of past discrimination were positively related to the extent of disclosure of sexual orientation in current positions. Schneider (1986) observed that prior job loss due to disclosure of sexual identity impacted subsequent decisions and concerns about revealing one’s sexuality to co-workers.",13

Latin America has not been an exception: about 70 million women entered the labor market during the second half of the 20th century, reflecting the increasingly important role of women in the region (Chioda 2011). However, since the early 2000s the growth of female LFP has slowed down significantly in most Latin American countries and it has even come to a halt in some of them. While the growth of female LFP was on average 0.91 percentage points a year between 1992 and 2002, it slowed down to 0.35 points a year between 2002 and 2014. This deceleration has occurred despite both a large increase in the level of schooling of women and a decline in fertility levels, two factors that should favor the increase in female labor supply (Gasparini and Marchionni 2015; Beccaria et al. 2015). The recent slowdown in the growth rate of women’s labor supply may affect their prospects for empowerment in society (World Bank 2012), postpone the reduction of gender gaps in the labor market, and even undermine the goals of reducing poverty and income inequality in the region (Parada et al. 2017). It could also imply a stagnation of the global labor supply, given the absence of significant changes in male labor force participation (Beccaria et al. 2015). The strong and rather unexpected economic expansion that Latin America experienced in the 2000s, well above the long-term trend, has been pointed out as one of the likely driving factors of the slowdown in female LFP (Gasparini and Marchionni 2017). Better macroeconomic conditions can affect the entry of women into the labor market at least in two different ways, with effects in opposite directions. On the one hand, a better economic context can encourage women to enter the labor market, as they face more favorable labor conditions and higher wages (substitution effect). On the other hand, a better economic scenario may imply lower unemployment and higher earnings of male partners and the expansion of social safety nets, two factors that alleviate the pressure on other family members, especially female spouses, to look for a job, and hence negatively affect their LFP (income effect). This latter channel, a version of the typical added-worker effect, could have been more relevant for women in vulnerable households in Latin America, since (i) their labor supply is more elastic to income shocks, either coming from earned or unearned income, and (ii) their households were the most benefitted by the economic changes in the 2000s. In this paper we use a large dataset of microdata from harmonized household surveys of all Latin American countries to provide evidence on the empirical links between labor force participation and the cycle and trend components of GDP, and use the results to argue about the likely driving factors behind the observed deceleration in female LFP in the region. In particular, and unlike Gasparini and Marchionni (2017) that carry out an analysis based on observations at the country level, we estimate fixed effects models of LFP based on a panel that follows groups of individuals defined according to their level of schooling and age in each Latin American country over the period 1987–2014. Working at a population-group level allows us to incorporate a broad set of regressors, combining variables linked to the macroeconomic context (cyclical and trend components of GDP) with others related to demographic characteristics and public policies. We find that whereas female LFP is positively associated with the trend component of GDP, it has a countercyclical behavior: large short-term expansions of GDP, beyond its long-term increasing trend, are associated with a reduction in female labor supply. The evidence is consistent with an inverse added-worker effect: better economic conditions for primary workers cause a delay in secondary workers’ entrance into the labor market. This relationship is stronger for married women (either in formal or consensual unions) with young children, who often act as secondary workers in their households, especially those with low educational attainment, living in rural areas, and from low-income families. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the exceptionally high economic growth in Latin America in the 2000s is a relevant factor behind the deceleration in female LFP, which was particularly intense among vulnerable married women. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We begin in Sect. 2 by briefly reviewing the literature on the determinants of female LFP in Latin America. Section 3 describes the data sources that are used in the study. In Sect. 4 we present preliminary evidence on the association between the economic cycle and the recent deceleration of female LFP in the region. Section 5 describes the empirical strategy and Sect. 6 reports and discusses the results. In Sect. 7 we conclude with some final remarks.",6

Mathä,Ladislav Wintr,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The main goal of active labour market policies (ALMPs) is to increase the employment opportunities for jobseekers and to improve matching between jobs (vacancies) and unemployed.Footnote 1 In general, ALMPs include job search assistance measures, training programs and subsidised jobs. Unemployment benefits, youth apprenticeships and adult education measures are excluded. During the Great Recession unemployment in many European countries substantially increased and governments resorted to ALMPs to cushion the labour market outcomes of individuals out of work. In Luxembourg, the Great Recession led to a sharp decline in real GDP in the initial phase (− 4.4% in 2009). Unemployment rose from 4.0% in early 2008 to 5.7% by the end of 2009 and further to 7.1% in mid-2014. Thereafter, it receded slowly to 5.2% at the end of 2018. A broad range of labour market policies were introduced in Luxembourg to cushion the effects of the recession on the labour market. The government, for example, extended and scaled up short-time work (STW) provisions to encourage job retention for those firms experiencing temporary loss of demand. At its peak in spring 2009, 4.5% of employees used STW.Footnote 2 Efstathiou et al. (2018, in this journal) study STW during the Great Recession in Luxembourg. In this paper, we focus on the remaining active labour market policy (ALMP) measures managed by the Luxembourg employment agency ADEM (Agence pour le Development de l’Emploi). During 2009–2014, the number of people involved in these ALMP measures rose continuously from about 3100 to 5000 (ADEM 2015), representing a rise of 0.4 percentage points to 1.3% of total employment. The aim of this paper is to analyse the use of ADEM administered ALMP measures by Luxembourg firms during and after the Great Recession and their determinants using direct survey answers from CEOs and/or human resource managers. Hence, we analyse ALMPs from the firm perspective rather than the employee perspective. Despite their relevance, firm-level analyses on ALMPs are far less common in the economics literature. This paper is also the first ALMP study using firm-level data for Luxembourg. Zanardelli (2006) studied the effectiveness of Luxembourg ALMPs using employee data. More recently, Bia et al. (2018) evaluated the effect of language training programs for the unemployed in Luxembourg. Our analysis is closely related to Bellmann and Stephan (2014, in this journal) who use German establishment data to study the association between firm-specific variables and the probability that a firm uses targeted wage subsidies. We extend their analysis and explicitly control for the effect of several different demand (both in level and volatility), supply and finance related shocks that firms may have experienced, as well as concerns about the costs and availability of labour with the required skills when hiring under permanent contract, the domestic orientation of firms and the share of cross-border workers. Owing to the large degree of internationalisation of the Luxembourg economy, immigrants and cross-border workers combined make up almost 75% of total employment. Our main findings are as follows. About 34% of Luxembourg firms used ALMPs to hire new employees in 2008–2013. On aggregate, ALMP use increased both on the extensive margin (more firms) and on the intensive margin (more measures per firm). The likelihood of using ALMPs is higher among firms that enjoy strong demand, are larger in size, domestically-oriented, face high competition and are concerned about high labour costs when hiring permanent employees. These results corroborate the main conclusions reported by Bellmann and Stephan (2014) for Germany. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature. Section 3 provides details on ALMPs administered by the public employment agency in Luxembourg. Section 4 presents the dataset. Sections 5 and 6 present the econometric estimation strategy and discuss the results. Section 7 concludes.",

Over the last few decades, there has been a vast amount of international empirical research on its effects (for reviews of this research, see, e.g., Belman and Wolfson 2014; Neumark and Wascher 2008). Prior to Card and Krueger’s (1994) seminal work on minimum wages in the fast food industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, there was a consensus among economists that a binding minimum wage set higher than the market-clearing competitive level would in general have adverse employment effects (Brown et al. 1982). Since then, the so-called new minimum wage research (Card and Krueger 1995) has challenged this view. While most studies have focused on employment effects and still continue to do so, recent research also highlights the importance of other adjustment channels, such as working hours, productivity, profits and prices (Metcalf 2008; Schmitt 2015; Hirsch et al. 2015; Low Pay Commission 2015). Germany only established a general statutory minimum wage on January 1, 2015. It offers a rare, yet prominent example of a wage threshold being introduced nationwide in a large developed country. This article provides a comprehensive survey of the existing empirical evidence on the effects of what is regarded as the most important labour market reform in Germany since the Schröder government’s Agenda 2010 program in the early 2000s. It attempts to provide a rather non-technical access to the findings available so far (for a more technical economics perspective, see Caliendo et al. 2019) and goes beyond Bruttel et al. (2018), who could only present descriptive findings that were available at that time. Our article draws on a wide range of evidence from both descriptive statistics and causal impact analyses. The article focuses on those issues that have generally attracted the most attention of international researchers. We will cluster these topics into four areas: First, we present evidence on the effects on wages. In this context, we will also discuss compliance issues arising from the implementation of the new minimum wage. Second, we will discuss whether increases in wages have led to decreases in welfare dependency and risk of poverty. Third, we will turn to the effects on employment. Finally, we focus on the impact on businesses, including changes in working hours, consumer prices, productivity, profits and competition. Set at an initial level of €8.50 per hour, the minimum wage directly affected the wages of around 4.0 million employees who earned less than €8.50 before the introduction of the minimum wage. This corresponds to about 11.3 percent of the dependent workforce—with significant regional differences. While in Western Germany 9.3 percent of employees had earned less than €8.50, this figure was 20.7 percent in Eastern Germany. Measured by the Kaitz index, which defines the relationship between the minimum and median wage, the new German minimum in 2015 (48 percent) was currently roughly equal to that of the UK (49 percent) and the Netherlands (46 percent). With respect to OECD countries, at the top, France had an index of 62 percent; at the bottom, Spain’s was 37 percent (OECD 2017). The minimum wage was increased twice since its introduction. By January 2017, it had increased to €8.84 per hour; by January 2019 to €9.19. By January 2020 there will be another increase, to €9.35. The new statutory minimum wage covers all employees, with few exceptions (youths under 18 years of age, apprentices, certain categories of trainees and interns, the long-term unemployed in their first 6 months after starting a new job and non-profit and/or voluntary workers).Footnote 1 In addition, in a transition period that lasted until the end of 2017, wages below the statutory minimum wage were allowed in sectors with collectively agreed-upon minimum wages that are made generally binding by government decree. This applied to meat processing, hairdressing, agriculture, temporary agency work, textiles and clothing and industrial laundries (Mindestlohnkommission 2018, p. 167). The minimum wage for newspaper delivery staff was also set below the statutory level until the end of 2017. Approximately 195,000 employees in these sectors earned less than the statutory minimum wage in 2015 (Mindestlohnkommission 2018, p. 20). This corresponds to about 0.5 percent of the total workforce, or 5 percent of the 4.0 million employees who earned less than €8.50 per hour before the introduction of the minimum wage in 2015. A number of sectors also have sector-specific minimum wages that are higher than the statutory minimum wage. The first sectoral minimum wages were introduced in the late 1990s and were made generally binding by government decrees. In June 2018, eleven sectors had sectoral minimum wages ranging from € 9.27 to € 16.53 per hour (Mindestlohnkommission 2018, p. 168). The workers that fall under the sectoral minimum wages cannot be numbered accurately as the scope of application is difficult to map in statistical data. With this limitation in mind, the available data suggests that the largest sector is the construction and subconstruction sector with around 1.9 million employees that work in these industries, many of course earning higher wages than the sectoral minimum wage, respectively. The next largest sectors are the commercial cleaning sector with around 1.1 million workers, the caring sector with around 900,000 workers, and temporary agency work with around 800,000 workers (Mindestlohnkommission 2018, p. 69).",10

Evidence from previous refugee migration indicates that integration into the host economy and society often requires many years—although the overall impact on host countries seems to depend on a number of specific factors and the evidence is far from conclusive.Footnote 1 One factor determining social costs and benefits is the selection of immigrants. The term ‘selection’ refers to a non-random group of persons emigrating from their home country. Do only the better educated or most able individuals flee from political terror and human rights abuse to distant countries, in order to find a better life? Or, is the recent cohort of refugees that arrived in Germany unaffected by this type of selectivity often found for labour market migrantsFootnote 2 and other refugees?Footnote 3
 This study uses survey and administrative data from a sample of male asylum seekersFootnote 4 from Middle Eastern and African countries that recently arrived in Germany, in order to shed light on this question. We analyse the selection of a sample of 203 asylum seekers by assessing their relative position—and in addition, the position of their parents—in the distribution of human capital from the country of origin. By comparing individual years of schooling as an indicator of human capital to age-gender specific country of origin averages, we seek to deduce whether the asylum seekers in our sample are, on average, a positively or negatively selected group of the home country’s population. In addition, we analyse the relevance of parental education to the selection of the asylum seekers—which is potentially particularly important for young emigrants. Parental education may indicate wealth and the degree of social ties, among other factors, and thus broaden the understanding of international migration and integration outcomes (Abramitzky et al. 2012; Borjas, 1993; Dustmann et al. 2012, among others). Our contribution to the literature on the selection of asylum seekers is threefold. First, our study provides new evidence on the self-selection of international migrants by focusing on a group of recent young male humanitarian migrants, who dedicated months and a considerable amount of money to reach a safe country (see also Brücker et al. 2016; Buber-Ennser et al. 2016; Lange et al. 2017). Until now, studies which look at the self-selection of this group are rare. Data at the individual level in the home countries of asylum seekers is restricted, as humanitarian emigration is often the result of conflict or turmoil in the home country; where institutions providing data become deadlocked. In addition, economic considerations might not be the main driver of recent refugee emigration (among others, see Hatton 2016; Chin and Cortes 2015; or Docquier et al. 2017), which should reduce self-selection based on economic reasoning. However, there still seems to be a rather limited understanding on how these factors determine migration when it is not directed to neighbouring countries but to countries far away. Our second contribution is the inclusion of parental background when studying selection among refugees for a sample of young males coming to Germany. The education of fathers and mothers contains complementary information on the socioeconomic background of asylum seekers and their socialisation. Parents likely play a role in migration decisions, particularly when refugees are relatively young, inexperienced, or have no savings. Parental background may also exert influences on integration in the host country. On the one hand, refugees who have better educated parents might have stronger ties to their home country, and therefore stronger motives for returning more promptly. In such cases their incentive to invest in host country specific skills may be lower. On the other hand, better educated parents could push their children to invest in integration within the host countries. Our analysis shows that asylum seekers in our sample are, on average, positively selected with respect to our indicator of human capital; confirming Chiswick’s (1999) hypothesis of a general positive selection of migrants, and the literature investigating earlier refugee waves. However, going beyond the average, we show that selection varies substantially among asylum seekers. There are considerable proportions of positively and negatively selected asylum seekers. We analyse Borjas’ (1987) theory for the selection of international migrants to find an economic explanation for this observation. According to Borjas (1987), immigrants in destination countries with higher income inequality relative to their home country are positively selected, because they expect to profit from a higher income dispersion. Immigrants in destination countries with lower income inequality are negatively selected, because they aim to insure themselves against low incomes in the wage distribution. Preliminary findings indicate mixed evidence for this explanation. While Borjas’ (1987) predictions do not explain the pattern observed in the distribution of individuals’ education, it seems to be consistent with the observed pattern of parental years of schooling. Thus, depending on the indicator of human capital used, results differ. Finally, we estimate the relevance of schooling acquired in the country of origin for short-term integration outcomes in Germany. Chiswick and Miller (2003) and Chiswick et al. (2005), among others, show that pre-immigration schooling, work experience and skills are significant positive factors influencing earnings in the host country. Hartog and Zorlu (2009), however, present evidence that higher education of asylum seekers in their home countries does not translate into returns in the Dutch labour market (see also Sanromá et al. 2015; Fortin et al. 2016). We provide an empirical analysis of this question using data on host country language proficiency and employment. Results suggest that those asylum seekers in the sample who acquired more years of schooling perform better on a German language test, and in finding employment. For every additional year of home country schooling, the number of words increases by 0.62 and the probability of being employed by 13%. Parental education does not seem to influence language acquisition or the probability of finding employment. For a third measure of human capital—work experience in the country of origin—we find no statistically significant effect on integration outcomes. The study continues as follows. The next section introduces the data on newly arrived young male asylum seekers and presents descriptive statistics on the indicators of human capital. In Sect. 3, we analyse how the asylum seekers are selected in terms of individual and parental education, and discuss the relevance of socioeconomic explanations to better understand these findings. We then investigate the relevance of asylum seekers’ schooling and their parents’ educational background for integration outcomes in Germany in Sect. 4, and conclude in Sect. 5.",6

Across the globe, national and regional governments are investing large sums in broadband expansion, notably to rural areas. Germany, the empirical focus of this paper, is no exception. According to one estimate, the German federal government’s goal to provide download rates of at least 50 Mbit/s to all households in Germany by 2018 requires investments of at least € 20 billion.Footnote 1 One of the declared goals of broadband expansion is job creation, particularly in knowledge-intensive industries. As yet, however, empirical evidence concerning firms’ job creation is sparse and ambiguous. Theoretically, broadband may affect the labor market through various channels and in various directions. For instance, broadband might increase the demand for products sold via the internet (cf. Brynjolfsson et al. 2009; Goolsbee 2000; Ellison and Ellison 2009; Goolsbee et al. 2010; Einav et al. 2014), with theoretically ambiguous implications for employment in online retail and stationary retail. Another channel could be labor supply and matching effects working through a more efficient job search (e.g., Autor 2001; Kuhn and Skuterud 2004). In contrast, this study seeks to isolate the employment growth effects of broadband expansion at the establishment level. Furthermore, the study addresses effect heterogeneity between sectors and on knowledge-intensive industries in particular, to obtain a clearer impression of the channels through which broadband may affect establishments’ employment growth. The analysis focuses on the years 2005–2010, when broadband was introduced in the rural parts of Western Germany and large parts of Eastern Germany. For the Western German subsample, in order to identify the causal relationship between broadband availability and employment growth, the analysis uses exogenous differences in local broadband availability arising from historically determined technical frictions. For Eastern Germany, a similar identification approach is potentially available, but it turns out inadequate in the current setting. With regard to the data and identification approaches, two major limitations of this study should be stated clearly. First, the analysis is based on first-generation broadband, i.e., the technological standard of the early 2000s, which enabled relatively simple applications such as e-mail and lower-resolution video streaming. Today, the term “broadband” may refer to much higher bandwidths and much more demanding applications, the labor market effects of which may differ from those found in this paper. Second, the main identification strategy applies only to rural Western Germany, and therefore does not capture the bulk of economic activity in the country. However, rural regions are often the focus of public debates and policies on infrastructure improvement. In this sense, this study might still contribute policy-relevant insights. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 sketches potential labor market effects of information and communication technology (ICT) and broadband internet and reviews previous empirical evidence. Section 3 describes the broadband data and discusses the identification strategy. Section 4 presents the estimated model of employment growth, the employment data, and descriptive statistics. Section 5 presents the estimation results. Section 6 concludes.",7

Low growth and economic downturns are contributing to an increasing unemployment rate globally. According to the International Labor Organization, the youth unemployment rate rose sharply from 2007 to 2010, reaching 13% between 2012 and 2017 (ILO 2017). The problem has progressed such that the term generation jobless has been coined to refer to unemployed young people (Vogel 2015). The youth unemployment problem is thus a global phenomenon that erodes economic growth, and must be addressed to achieve social integration and resolve the generational divide. According to Statistics Korea (2018), Korea’s youth unemployment rate is 10%, the highest since records began in 1999. Although the government has implemented policies and designated funds to resolve youth unemployment, these initiatives have produced no visible outcome. This is not a temporary issue caused by a cyclical economic downturn, but rather a complex issue with various structural problems such as prolonged low economic growth; a mismatch between the supply of and demand for college graduates in the labor market, exacerbated by the increase in Korea’s overall education level; college graduates’ selective job-seeking activities and their reluctance to lower expectations; and mandatory military service for young Korean men. Delaying graduation to search for a job while remaining a student has become a typical practice for many young people in Korea. As a result, it now takes 5 or 6 years to graduate. Furthermore, young people are delaying graduation to build up their qualifications, hoping to find a better job when they do graduate. However, critics have argued that this practice does not necessarily guarantee them a better job. Indeed, taking a semester off or postponing graduation can further delay their entry into the labor market (Schmid 2013). As a result, graduates take 11 months on average to find their first job (Statistics Korea 2015) and employment quality is declining every year (ILO 2013). Delaying graduation stops young people contributing as members of society and living independently from their parents. This, in turn, delays marriage, resulting in young people deciding not to have children, creating a low birth rate problem. These issues will cost the country in the long term, as the population begins to age and reduce in size. Indeed, these social problems have become sufficiently severe that young people are now considered to be the generation that has given up seven things, namely romantic relationships, marriage, children, social relationships, a house, dreams, and hope. Since youth unemployment has a significant ripple effect across a country’s economy and society, many studies have examined this problem. Most either focus on young people’s private education and employment preparation behavior or analyze factors that affect their employment (Finnie 2004; Van der Klaauw et al. 2004; Wu 2011). Other studies examine labor market outcomes such as wages and employment type (Lee et al. 2005), while some identify the amount of time or other factors needed to enter the labour market successfully (Salas-Velasco 2007). However, their findings vary depending on the data and analysis techniques used, which makes it difficult to develop effective policy. More importantly, most of these studies focus on young people who graduated before the mid-2000s, which means they are somewhat outdated since youth unemployment became particularly entrenched after 2010. Based on the above-described gaps in the literature, this study examines the employment preparation behavior and unemployment exit duration of those who graduated college in 2012 to identify the factors that facilitated their employment. By doing so, it explores various employment support measures that aim to reduce the time it takes college graduates to search for and find a job. Specifically, this study attempts to answer the following research questions: How does unemployment exit duration vary with college graduates’ characteristics? Which factors affect college graduates’ escape from unemployment?",7

The Great Recession of 2008 and the euro debt crisis have had an important effect on the evolution of unemployment in Europe, although there are large cross-country differences. While in some countries the unemployment increased and peaked shortly after, in other countries the unemployment rate increased steadily and has remained very high. Differences are also very important in quantitative terms. While countries such as Germany and the Netherlands show very low unemployment rates, Mediterranean countries still show very high unemployment rates in spite of large decreases in recent years. These differences across countries have led us to analyse whether the inclusion of the degree of agreement in consumers’ expectations can help improve unemployment rate forecasts in a set of eight long-term member states that comprises this diversity (Austria, Germany, France, Italy, Greece, Portugal, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom). While several authors have addressed the effect of online job searches on unemployment forecasts (Askitas and Zimmermann 2009; D’Amuri and Marcucci 2017; Vicente et al. 2015), unemployment expectations have been overlooked. This study aims to fill this gap by incorporating information coming from qualitative surveys. In recent years, evidence has been found that consumer expectations contain valuable information in order to improve predictions of employment (Abberger 2007; Claveria et al. 2007; Hutter and Weber 2015; Lehmann and Wohlrabe 2017). These studies focus on a single country, more specifically in Germany, and compare the role of different employment indicators. Other studies, such as that of Lehmann and Weyh (2016), focus on the role of survey expectations aggregated in balances. Direct measures of economic expectations can only be derived from economic tendency surveys, in which respondents are asked if they expect a certain variable to increase, to decrease or to remain constant. Survey results are usually presented in the form of balances, which are obtained as a subtraction between the percentage of respondents who expect an increase and that of those who expect a decrease. In this study we aim to refine forecasts of the unemployment rate by including survey expectations through a new aggregation procedure. The approach is based on a positional metric of consensus proposed by Claveria (2019) that gives the percentage of agreement in expectations for questions with five response categories. This measure presents several advantages over the balance, as it is directly interpretable and allows to incorporate the information coming from the respondents that do not expect any major change in the variable. On the one hand, we adapt the statistic for questions with three response options. On the other hand, we compute the indicator in eight European countries and evaluate whether it helps to improve the accuracy of unemployment rate forecasts, comparing its performance to Bachmann et al.’s (2013) disagreement indicator. With this aim, we select the optimal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model for each country. Then, we design two independent out-of-sample recursive forecasting experiments. In the first one, we generate univariate predictions of the unemployment rates which are used as a benchmark. In the second, we extend the model so as to include the consensus-based indicator as a predictor in a dynamic regression model in order to test if there is an improvement in forecast accuracy. The study proceeds as follows. In Sect. 2, we present the methodology. In Sect. 3, data are described. In the next section, results of the out-of-sample forecasting experiments are discussed. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes.",16

China is no exception (Knight and Song 1991; Li et al. 2017). As pointed out by the human capital theory of Becker (1964) and Mincer (1974), people are ready to understand and tolerate the existence of income inequality if it results from differentials in personal capability and/or efforts. However, if income inequality is due to highly unreasonable causes, for example discrimination, the inequality is likely to cause anger. In this sense, the gender wage gap, as suggested by the employer prejudice hypothesis (Becker 1957), is likely to serve as a hotbed of social dissatisfaction.Footnote 1 It is, however, difficult to measure such unreasonable economic disparities through a simple comparison of male–female wage levels. Thus, economists conduct various econometric analyses aimed at testing whether a gender wage gap exists after controlling for a number of individual characteristics such as educational attainment, work experience, skill level, and health status, as well as employment conditions such as job types, industry sectors, and work locations. As a result, today we are able to refer to significant empirical evidence for developed countries (de la Sara et al. 2008; Blau and Khan 2017; Hara 2018), developing countries (Ahmed and McGillivray 2015; Hallward-Driemeier et al. 2017; Deshpande et al. 2018), and former socialist transition countries (Brainerd 2000; Majchrowska and Strawiński 2018). From the above perspectives, numerous researchers have attempted to investigate wage inequality in China focusing on the gender aspect (Meng 1998b; Gustafsson and Li 2000; Liu et al. 2000; Maurer-Fazio and Hughes 2002; Rozelle et al. 2002; Shu et al. 2007; Song et al. 2011; Ren and Miller 2012; Ma 2018a; Sun and Hung 2018; Hare 2019; Zhao et al. 2019). This may be caused by the fact that, since 1978, when the planned economic period ended, income inequality including wage gap in China has increased remarkably as the transition to a market economy has progressed. It is considered that the increase of income inequality may contribute to the growth of the gender wage gap. In addition, most other previous studies also have provided estimates of the effects of gender as one wage determinant. However, taking an overview of these research results, some unresolved issues emerge: First, as we will report later in referring to Table 1 and Fig. 1, although the vast majority of the extant literature suggests that the gender wage gap, by which the wage level is disadvantageous to women, does exist in China, contrary results have also been reported. Second, although labor market segmentation by the Hukou (population registration) system is a major issue in the Chinese economy, research on wages in China strongly tends to limit the subject of analysis to either urban regions or rural regions (Ma and Iwasaki 2020). As a result, gender wage gap differences between urban and rural regions are not sufficiently investigated. Third, a similar issue can be applied to gender wage gap differences between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and privately-owned enterprises (POEs) as well. Fourth, since, due to restrictions in available data, the overwhelming majority of the published literature employs empirical analysis based on a cross-section data at either a single point or a number of points in time, few cases consider the dynamics of the gender wage gap from a long-term perspective. Accordingly, even though we can ascertain an unreasonable gender wage gap, which can serve as the soil of dissatisfaction in society and is an extremely important research issue not only for developed countries that are facing severe issues of inequality as well as China, which needs to secure the political and social stability of market-oriented reforms and economic growth, the disparities of the gender wage gap among regions and corporate sectors and dynamic time-series changes have been not analyzed in the majority of previous works regarding wage determinants in China. Source: See Table 1 for the number of observations and descriptive statistics Kernel density estimation of collected estimates. The vertical axis is the kernel density. The horizontal axis is the variable value.  A meta-analysis enabling the synthesis and comparison of empirical results reported in the extant literature can make it possible to obtain findings regarding issues and problems that are difficult to examine in just one study through standard empirical analysis. In this paper, we perform a large-scale meta-analysis to measure the gender wage gap in China, comprehending not only the empirical works of this subject but also a wide range of other Chinese wage studies concerning disparities of the gender wage gap among different regions and corporate sectors as well as changes over time, presenting “review-generated evidence” (Nakagawa et al. 2017). Furthermore, we also test publication selection bias and examine the presence of genuine empirical evidence of the wage effect of gender in the literature as a unique mission of meta-analysis. Other examples of meta-analysis of the gender wage gap include Stanley and Jarrell (1998), Jarrell and Stanley (2004), and Weichselbaumer and Winter-Ebmer (2005); however, each of these is an international comparison focused chiefly on developed countries. What's more, they were published at least 10 years ago. In addition, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis in the world on the gender wage gap in China. Therefore, this paper contributes to the literature of Chinese economic studies and meta-analysis of the gender wage gap.Footnote 2 The results of meta-analysis using 1472 estimates extracted from 199 previous studies show that, although the gender wage gap in China during the transition periodFootnote 3 has an impact that statistically significant and economically meaningful, it remains at a low level. It is also revealed that the wage gap between men and women is more severe in rural regions and the private sector than those in urban regions and the public sector. Furthermore, we found that, in China, the gender wage gap has been increasing rapidly in recent years. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: The next section presents hypotheses to be tested by meta-analysis. Section 3 describes the procedures used in searching and selecting the literature subject to the meta-analysis and overviews the selected studies. Section 4 conducts a meta-synthesis of the collected estimates. Section 5 performs a meta-regression analysis (MRA) of heterogeneity among studies. Section 6 tests for publication selection bias. Lastly Sect. 7 summarizes the major findings from the meta-analysis and concludes the paper.",24

The paper also investigates the role of labour mobility as an adjustment mechanism to asymmetric shocks. Economic shocks are defined simply as unexpected events that have either a positive or a negative impact on macroeconomic variables in the economy. These shocks are frequently beyond the scope of normal economic transactions. They cause recessions and business cycles in countries. Shocks can be symmetric or asymmetric. They are asymmetric when they affect countries in a region differently. Symmetric shocks occur when the effect of an unexpected event is uniform. This paper focuses on four types of shocks: external supply shocks, domestic supply shocks, domestic demand shocks, and monetary shocks. The study is based on the optimum currency area theory developed by Mundell (1961) and elaborated by McKinnon (1963) and Kenen (1969), in which mobility of labour and other factors of production are considered as the main conditions for smooth adjustment to asymmetric shocks. This theory was further elaborated by De Grauwe (2005), Krugman (1993) and Frankel and Rose (1996) with a focus on labour and factor mobility, openness and intra-regional trade, and symmetric macroeconomic shocks across countries. The theory postulates that balancing the costs and benefits of regional economic integration depends largely on the synchronisation of shocks that occur in the region. In other words, if shocks are distributed symmetrically across countries of a region, the shocks are correlated, and therefore a single policy response is sufficient to counteract the negative effects across the countries. Visegrad is a sub-regional bloc in the European Union (EU) consisting of four countries: the Czech Republic (Czechia), Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia. The countries are heterogeneous with different economic structures. For instance, the structure of production and the level of income per capita vary across these countries even though there is a degree of convergence. The presence of a certain degree of heterogeneity makes the region vulnerable to shocks. The four countries joined the EU in 2004, and of the four, only Slovakia joined the Economic and Monetary Union. Therefore, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland still maintain national currencies while Slovakia has replaced the national monetary policy with the common and independent policy managed by the European Central Bank. The implication of this is that the exchange rate, which is used frequently as an adjustment mechanism in the face of asymmetric shocks in countries, cannot be used in Slovakia but can be used in the other three countries. In the event of shocks, several options are available for countries to adjust their economies to recovery. This study focuses on labour mobility across the region since the countries are highly integrated in terms of trade openness and interregional trade. This paper focuses on the role of labour mobility as an adjustment mechanism in the Visegrad region, which has been emphasised as one of the methods that counteracts the effects of asymmetric shocks. As it is difficult to measure labour mobility, the paper uses migration as a proxy, which is also used in the studies conducted by Arpaia et al. (2016), Dao et al. (2014) and Beyer and Smets (2015). Globalisation has accelerated the movement of labour and capital as well as goods and services across countries. Moreover, it has become easier to travel and work in other countries. Consequently, international labour mobility has increased significantly and has become a topic of growing policy importance. Piracha and Vickerman (2002) found that labour mobility in Europe as a percentage of the total population was lower than that in the United States (US). Martin and Taylor (1996) found that there was lower migration among European countries than expected. Obstfeld and Peri (1998) obtained similar results and concluded that labour mobility across European countries was lower than that within countries. Similarly, De Grauwe and Vanhaverbeke (1991) investigated regional and national labour mobility across several Western European countries and found that the yearly flow of migrants among the investigated countries was less when compared to interregional migration. The information above shows that labour mobility in Visegrad countries is low, implying the low capacity of labour mobility as an adjustment mechanism. However, as concluded by Puhani (1999), if the lack of economic incentives to migrate is the cause of the low labour mobility, the conclusion about labour mobility having low capacity to counteract the effects of asymmetric shocks is wrong. A large body of literature on symmetric and asymmetric shocks in Europe focuses on Western European countries. The case of Visegrad as a regional economic bloc is rarely studied. This study therefore seeks to fill this gap. The aim of the paper is twofold. First, the paper applies SVAR models to determine the nature and correlation of shocks across the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Second, the paper uses cointegrated panel ARDL models to assess the role of labour mobility in counteracting the impact of asymmetric shocks across the region. The paper makes unique contributions to theory and development in that rather than using the conventional two-variable modelling approach consisting of only supply and demand shocks, the paper uses a four-variable SVAR model to capture the correlation of external shocks including the global financial crisis and the correlation of domestic monetary shocks among the countries, which has been given minimal attention in previous research. The other contribution of the paper is the use of cointegrated panel ARDL models to assess the impact of migration and technological progress on employment during periods of asymmetric shocks. The structure of the paper is as follows. The first chapter introduces the concept of macroeconomic shocks, labour mobility and its related terms. It also provides a brief overview of the motivation for and contribution of the paper. The second chapter reviews the literature. The third chapter outlines the methodology used in the study. The fourth chapter presents and discusses the results. The fifth chapter presents the conclusions.",1
54,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,29 October 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-020-00281-x,Do ethnicity and sex of employers affect applicants’ job interest? An experimental exploration,December 2020,Mark Granberg,Niklas Ottosson,Ali Ahmed,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Discrimination based on ethnicity or sex is a violation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948, and is prohibited by law in most modern societies. However, research shows that sex and ethnic discrimination remains persistent and prevalent in most, if not all, societies. Ethnic discrimination, for example, is perceived as the greatest barrier to the integration of immigrants across the EU according to an IZA Expert Opinion Survey (Zimmermann et al. 2008). Ethnic discrimination can lead to income disparities (Rubinstein and Brenner 2014), mental health issues (Elias and Paradies 2016), and residential segregation (Dawkins 2004), which incur high societal and individual costs. Similarly, sex discrimination hinders the empowerment of women and economic development generally (Duflo 2012). Research has documented large aggregate disparities among ethnic groups in the labor market and a skewed distribution of earnings between men and women (Blau and Kahn 2017; Blau and Kahn 2000; Altonji and Blank 1999). Labor market disadvantages of ethnic minorities have been found as early as in the initial stages of the hiring process (Baert 2018; Bertrand and Duflo 2017). Explaining differences in earnings between the sexes has proven to be more complicated. Studies have shown inconsistent experimental results, from female applicants not being at a clear disadvantage in the hiring process (Bertrand and Duflo 2017) to being directly discriminated against (Goldin and Rouse 2000). Because of these inconsistent results of hiring discrimination, the wage differential is instead often attributed to the “glass ceiling” (Albrecht et al. 2003), and the fact that women’s early careers are more likely to be interrupted by, for example, child rearing (Bertrand et al. 2010; Wood et al. 1993). In the field of economics, employment discrimination has been explained by two sets of theories: theories of taste-based discrimination, where employers are hostile to a certain group (Becker 1957), and theories of statistical discrimination, where employers use the perceived average group productivity as a proxy when drawing conclusions about an applicant’s productivity (Arrow 1973; Phelps 1972). Research on labor market discrimination has focused much on employment discrimination by employers against workers. We suggest that discrimination may also occur through the decisions made by applicants during their job search. It is possible that job applicants condition their decisions of whether to apply for a job based on the perceived characteristics of employers, such as ethnicity and sex. This reversed perspective on discrimination, where job applicants discriminate against certain prospective employers, may have notable implications for the success of entrepreneurs who belong to a disadvantaged group. Differences related to ethnicity and sex among self-employed people in the probability of hiring employees as well as in the composition of their employees do exist (Clark et al. 2017; Fairlie and Miranda 2017; Hammarstedt and Miao 2020; Henley 2005). In this study we, therefore, explored whether part of such differences can be attributed to how workers direct their search in the labor market and whether workers make their decisions to apply contingent on the characteristics of potential employers. To test our conjecture, we performed an experimental study on 889 university students. We asked the students to state their willingness to apply to 10 fictitious and hypothetical job vacancies in the restaurant sector. We tested for sex and ethnic discrimination, signaling the sex and ethnicity of an employer by using typical male and female names and typical Swedish- and Arabic-sounding names. We chose Arabic-sounding names because previous studies have found that people of Middle Eastern and North African origin have been discriminated against in the Swedish labor market (Bursell 2014; Carlsson and Rooth 2007). Additionally, Andersson and Hammarstedt (2011) show that there is a rather high rate of entrepreneurship among immigrants of Middle Eastern background in the Swedish restaurant sector, but that their businesses tend to be less profitable than comparable Swedish-owned businesses. The main idea is that the hiring process and job matching involves both workers and employers, and that both parties affect the outcome. The aim of this study was, therefore, to test for ethnic and sex discrimination by workers against employers in need of manpower with an online experiment. The question we intended to answer was, do job-seekers discriminate against prospective employers?",

Queuing at the bank is no longer necessary, and consequently, many bank branches have closed their doors. But not all markets are alike. As pointed out by Kuhn and Mansour (2014), “studies of the Internet’s effects on labour market matching have been few in number and, on balance, find little or no evidence of a friction-reducing effect.” This seems surprising: as communication costs have declined dramatically and online search has become a part of our everyday lives, we should in theory also see an increase in successful matches between jobseekers and vacancies. More efficient online job search would then decrease the need for traditional face-to-face counselling by the Public Employment Services, creating potential cost savings for the Government. However, the labour market is in many ways different from the other markets. It may well be that personal communication and face-to-face counselling about labour market legislation, rules, and conventions are often needed, especially by newcomers. Nevertheless, regarding the causal effects of counselling and the effects of online job search, the empirical evidence is far from clear-cut on both counts. In the meta-analysis of Whiston et al. (2003), the importance of counsellorFootnote 1 involvement in career interventions received substantial support. Their results indicate that counsellor-free interventions are not as effective as other career treatment modalities and that effective career interventions need to include a counselling component (Whiston et al. 2003, 406). According to Brown and Roche (2016, 27), there is consistent meta-analytic evidence that career interventions, irrespective of modality, are demonstrably effective when compared to no-treatment or delayed-treatment controls. Intensive counselling schemes were found effective in reducing unemployment duration and recurrence in a duration analysis by Crépon et al. (2005). On the other hand, Breunig et al. (2003) found out in a randomised trial that intensive counselling of the long-term unemployed was not effective in increasing employment. Van den Berg and Van der Klaauw (2006) also used data from a randomised trial and concluded that counselling and monitoring of unemployment insurance recipients did not affect their exit rate to work. In their study, the counselling meetings were implemented immediately at the beginning of an unemployment spell. More recently, the counselling style, productivity, and cooperativeness of employment counsellors have been studied in counterfactual settings. Exploiting detailed Swiss data sets, Behncke et al. (2010a) found that the chance of re-employment increases if the counsellor and his client belong to the same social group. Behncke et al. (2010b), and later Huber et al. (2017) showed that “tough” caseworkers, who are less cooperative, are able to produce better employment results. Schiprowski (2017) used unplanned caseworker absences to investigate the effect of caseworker meetings. She found that missing one appointment increases the unemployment spell length by 10 days on average. The effect doubles if the caseworker belongs to the highest productivity tercile. Stevenson (2008) concluded that increasing Internet penetration has increased the variety of job search methods and that job search behaviour has become more extensive. She also speculated that the Internet’s ability to reduce the cost of on-the-job search may have changed the likelihood that a worker ends up unemployed. Kuhn and Mansour (2014), using longitudinal youth survey data, found positive effects for Internet job search. According to their estimates, using the Internet reduced individual unemployment durations on average by 25%. This is in contrast with an earlier study by Kuhn and Skuterud (2004), which found that Internet job search was associated with longer unemployment durations in 1998–2000, most likely due to adverse selection of the searchers. In a recent study, Kroft and Pope (2014) found no evidence that the rapid expansion of online service Craigslist as a job search tool has affected city-level unemployment rates. They used changes in city-level Craigslist job postings as an independent variable and used various OLS and IV regression specifications to estimate the effect on changes in the city-level unemployment rates. However, there are unresolved endogeneity issues in Kroft and Pope (2014) arising from their use of lagged dependent variables as confounders in their panel data models.Footnote 2 Likewise changes in city populations—another confounder—could depend on changing unemployment levels, i.e. the dependent variable. Hence, earlier studies have found contradictory evidence for the effectiveness of personal counselling and Internet job search. The aim of this study is to estimate the aggregate effects of face-to-face counselling on unemployment rate and duration. Our research agenda is based on a Public Employment Service (PES) office reform implemented in Finland at the beginning of the year 2013. In the reform, over 60 Finnish municipalities experienced an involuntary employment office closure. Employment office clients in the affected municipalities, having no choice in the matter, were forced to use the Internet, unless they were willing to travel to the nearest municipality with an existing employment office. To our best knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the aggregate effects of PES office closures. A related earlier research is Schiprowski (2017), which estimated the effect of missing a counselling appointment. Specifically, we measure the municipality-level unemployment effects of dispensing with face-to-face counselling and replacing it with online and telephone counselling. In essence, we ask whether it is possible to substitute traditional employment counselling with modern online counselling and achieve cost savings at the same time. Using municipality-level unemployment data and various panel data estimators, we find that while the reform did not have a large effect on unemployment rates, it increased average unemployment durations by 2–3 weeks. Our estimate is robust to various sensitivity checks. We also find that the effect depends positively on the driving times from the affected municipalities to the nearest municipality with an available PES office. Therefore, our results suggest that online counselling and face-to-face counselling are not perfect substitutes.",3

This allows researchers to analyze the full labor market biographies of a large number of individuals with daily precision. At the same time, the sample size also permits aggregate analyses at the level of regions, industries, and occupations. The SIAB is an extremely versatile dataset that can be used to answer a virtually unlimited number of research questions. It is also one of the most important data products that the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) provides for the scientific community. Almost 60% of the over 500 projects currently supervised by the Research Data Centre (FDZ) of the German Federal Employment Agency (BA) at the IAB are based either on the SIAB or the closely related Linked Employer-Employee Data of the IAB (LIAB).Footnote 1 Scholars analyze the SIAB in numerous contexts. A prominent topic is employment polarization. In their influential paper, Goos et al. (2014) use the SIAB to explain employment polarization as a result of routine-based technological change and offshoring of tasks. Other examples are Antonczyk et al. (2018) and Rendall and Weiss (2016), who stress the importance of cohort effects and the apprenticeship system when investigating polarization in Germany. In another research field, Sanchez and Wellschmied (2020) used the SIAB to examine how nonpredictable earning shocks vary by age. They find that positive earning shocks are typical for young workers, whereas negative shocks are common among workers above 50. Furthermore, Riphahn and Schnitzlein (2016) study long-run wage mobility in Germany and identify structural shifts as the major explanation for declining wage mobility after 1990. The SIAB data are also used to analyze the effects of international trade on individuals. For instance, Dauth et al. (2014) show that the rise of China and Eastern Europe caused job losses for workers in import-competing industries, whereas exports had a stabilizing effect on employment relationships. Overall, the positive effects dominate, and Germany gained substantially in employment terms from the rise of the East. Further research based on the SIAB includes Kohlbrecher et al. (2016), who examine the consequences of vacancy free-entry conditions and idiosyncratic productivity shocks on labor market matching functions, and Gehrke and Weber (2018), who show that the short-term benefits of structural labor market reforms are weaker when initialized during recessions than during economic expansions. As these studies illustrate, the SIAB allows high-quality research in numerous areas. Usually, individual-level datasets differ from macro data in one particular regard: They have a rather complicated structure. The SIAB is certainly no exception. In principle, each row in the SIAB stems from either an employer’s notification to the social security system or a process in unemployment insurance. Individual biographies often do not follow a linear path: Individuals change jobs, hold several jobs at the same time, become unemployed, participate in active labor market policy measures, etc. A dataset that covers all those different biographies is necessarily more complicated than the example datasets familiar from econometric textbooks. This means that the researcher must first put in substantial effort to prepare the data before beginning the actual empirical analysis. Due to its versatility, researchers use the SIAB in many different contexts and each context requires a different preparation of the raw data. Hence, practices that have proven useful in one project might not be applicable to another. At the end of the day, it is not feasible to develop a linear set of guidelines to prepare the SIAB that accommodates all possible needs for all potential projects. However, we are aware that preparing the SIAB is costly and error-prone, especially for researchers who are inexperienced in working with large administrative datasets. In this paper, we therefore provide a detailed explanation of the best practices that we have found useful in preparing the SIAB for our own research. We additionally provide extensively commented Stata do-files to replicate our data preparation. The goal of this paper and the supplementary collection of do-files is to provide researchers with a step-by-step guideline on how the SIAB can be prepared for individual-level analyses. We point out the purpose of each step and provide an intuitive explanation of how it is implemented. All technical details can be found in the do-files that accompany this paper. Although this paper provides the first complete set of guidelines on how to prepare the SIAB for scientific analysis, several other reports exist that give guidance on some specific parts of the data preparation process for German social security data. A popular example is Eberle and Schmucker (2017). In their report, the authors explain how to generate biographical variables such as work experience or the duration of unemployment benefit receipts. Another example is Jaenichen (2018), who demonstrates how to measure employment duration. There are also suggestions for identifying unemployment periods (Kruppe et al. 2008) or maternity leaves (Müller et al. 2017; Schönberg 2009). Additionally, several articles propose methods for improving the data quality of German social security data. There are different processes for improving information on educational attainment (Fitzenberger et al. 2006; Hutter et al. 2015; Thomsen et al. 2018), imputing top-coded wages (Dustmann et al. 2009; Card et al. 2013; Gartner 2005), generating time-consistent industry codes Eberle et al. (2011), and correcting part-time/full-time information provided before a structural break in the reporting procedure in 2011 (Fitzenberger and Seidlitz 2020; Ludsteck and Thomsen 2016). The procedures of Fitzenberger et al. (2006) to improve information on education, of Eberle et al. (2011) to generate time-consistent industry codes, and of Ludsteck and Thomsen (2016) to correct information on part-time work are already implemented in the latest version of the SIAB. This paper and the collection of do-files are based on the weakly anonymous version of the SIAB (years 1975–2017, DOI:10.5164/IAB.SIAB7517.de.en.v1). Access to this dataset is provided to the scientific community by the Research Data Centre (FDZ) of the German Federal Employment Agency (BA) at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). The usual way to access these data is via on-site use at the FDZ in Nuremberg, Germany, or one of several other locations in Germany, France, the USA, Canada, or the United Kingdom. This allows users to develop their programs while working with the data interactively. Subsequently, users can continue their projects via remote data access using the web interface JoSuA. The FDZ requires users working in the secure on-site environment and via JoSuA to follow certain conventions in writing their programs and managing their files. Our guidelines follow these conventions and our do-files have been tested to run in the JoSuA environment.Footnote 2 The SIAB is a derivative of the Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB). Due to this relatedness our codes can, with some minor adaptations, also be used to prepare the IEB. In particular, it is necessary to rename variables and account for the fact that some variables have already been preprocessed in the SIAB (for example, while the SIAB already has an indicator variable female, the IEB has a variable sex_id, which takes the value 1 for men and 2 for women). We strongly encourage all users of this collection to check our code for mistakes and adjust it to suit the requirements of each specific project. We provide this as a service to the scientific community, but we do not assume responsibility for any problems that result from using our code. We complement our preparation of the SIAB with a case study on the long-term employment effects after an involuntary job loss due to a plant closure, using an event study approach. This kind of analysis is currently very popular in applied labor economics. The goal of this case study is to demonstrate how our prepared version of the SIAB can be used to carry out such an analysis. Our results corroborate the findings of earlier papers from the US and Germany that involuntary job loss leaves large and persistent scars in individual employment biographies.",8

Nevertheless, the 2017 and 2018 investment reports for Mexico were not very optimistic (UNCTAD 2017, 2018), since FDI inflows in 2016 and 2017 reached $30 billion dollars each year, which is 15% below the amount received in 2015. Such contraction was mainly explained by the uncertainty that existed at that time about the future of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), now called United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA). Waldkirch (2010) states that Mexico has been actively trying to attract FDI since the 1980s by relaxing investment restrictions on different economic sectors. In addition, since 1994, NAFTA benefited Mexico as it substantially and permanently increased FDI inflows into the country. As a result, abundant FDI came into the country seeking to exploit Mexico’s comparative advantage (Waldkirch 2011). Given the relevance of FDI in the economy since the implementation of NAFTA, abundant literature has emerged analyzing the effects of FDI on different economic variables, such as wages, labor productivity, and employment. Diverse literature has also emerged analyzing the impact of NAFTA on economic sectors, such as manufacturing, maquiladora industry, and the impact on different economic regions in the country. Nevertheless, the existing literature about Mexico has paid limited attention to analyze the effect of FDI on employment and wages in the manufacturing and service sectors, even though those two economic sectors have received together around 75% of total FDI inflows that had come into the country since 2005. The scarcity of studies in the field is more noticeable if it is analyzed by the effect of FDI inflows on employment and wages when separating employment in the two categories (low-skilled and high-skilled). Such studies could be of relevance and interest for policy makers, since the design of policies can be focused on the groups that are considered a priority for a country or a government. The study helps fill the gap in the literature by analyzing employment and wages of low- and high-skilled employees in the manufacturing and service sectors, which according to the number of employees and FDI inflows received in the country, are the two most relevant sectors in the economy. This study is performed using data for each of the 32 states in Mexico, covering the period from 2005 to 2018 at the sub-national level in Mexico. The econometric model implemented in this study is similar to the one used by Hanson (2001), but with a small variation to examine the impact of FDI on low-skilled and high-skilled employment and wages. To obtain the coefficient estimates, a Fixed-Effects model (FE) and a Panel Corrected Standard Errors (PCSE) model are developed and estimated. Results indicate that, in most scenarios, FDI inflows have different effects on low-skilled and high-skilled employment in manufacturing and service sectors. The remainder of this study is organized as follows: Section 2 provides important background on FDI inflows and their effects on employment and wages. Section 3 describes the econometric model implemented in this study. Section 4 introduces the dataset and explains the distribution of FDI and employment in manufacturing and service sectors around the country. Section 5 discusses the results of the estimated regression, and the last section presents the conclusion of this study.",11
54,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,06 July 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-020-00269-7,Does occupational licensing impact incomes? A replication study for the German crafts case,December 2020,Kaja Fredriksen,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Occupational licensing (i.e. requiring minimum levels of human capital investment by professionals) is the strictest form of regulation to access professions, which blocks market access for individuals without the necessary credentials. National occupational licensing schemes have been steadily on the rise since the Second World War, in both Europe and the US (see Kleiner, 2006; Kleiner and Krueger 2010). In the German crafts as the sector of interest in this paper, the German regulator liberalized the traditional occupation licensing scheme in 2004. With the aim of fostering labor market flexibility and employment,Footnote 1 the rule stipulating that only craftsmen holding a Meister title (an advanced vocational training certificate) could found a company was removed or alleviated for a number of trades. The reform was in line with European institutions’ efforts to create a common market area that also includes the free flow of labor. National labor market regulations, and licensing in particular, have been found to disproportionately negatively affect the labor market prospects of minorities (see Dorsey 1983; Federman et al. 2006; Gomez et al. 2015; and McDonald et al. 2015). Indeed, Runst (2018) shows that the liberalization of the crafts regulation in 2004 has increased the proportion of self-employed migrants as well as migrants employed in the crafts sector. It should here be mentioned that while the traditional licensing scheme in the crafts sector discouraged foreigners from settling in Germany, it encouraged them to use the freedom of establishment lied down in the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEC). Indeed, the Monopolies CommissionFootnote 2 pointed out in 2001 that domestic crafts companies were penalized as foreign non-Meister companies could supply crafts services in Germany without the costs accompanying the qualification. Hence, removing the occupational licensing scheme actually alleviated two forms of discrimination embedded in the pre-reform regulatory framework. Nonetheless, the 2004 reform has had its opponents. Studies have pointed out that removing the Meister obligation has caused a decline in the level of vocational training (Runst and Thomä 2019). It may have also caused a decline in quality (Runst et al. 2018a) in the presence of information asymmetries that may (Fredriksen et al. 2019) or may not (Rupieper and Proeger 2019) be resolved through market endogenous mechanisms. Importantly for this paper, already in its 2001 report, the Monopolies Commission pointed out that removing the Meister obligation in the German crafts could reduce prices and incomes. Should this be the case, there is a strong incentive to lobby for perpetuating licensing requirements (see Rottenberg 1962). Therefore, it is worth striving for an informed policy debate on how the Meister obligation (and its suspension) actually affect incomes, which is the aim of the present paper. There is already a large body of literature exploring the link between occupational licensing and incomes. One may therefore appropriately question whether another study on the topic is necessary. This main contribution of this study is its replicative character. The value of replication studies has long been subject to discussion and it is not difficult to find evidence of their usefulness (see e.g. Leimer and Lesnoy 1982; Dewald et al. 1986; Antonovics and Goldberger 2005). I thereby consider that replications do not exclusively serve to overturn or confirm existing findings, but that they are also useful to add new aspects to discussions in the economic literature. The studies reviewed for this paper mostly examine licensing practices in the US and Germany (see summary in tabular format in Appendix). Kleiner (2006) notes that there are considerable variations in the findings and according to Redbird (2017) the estimated wage premium varies from 0 to 35%. For the German crafts case, the literature finds a noticeable income difference of 13% between regulated and deregulated trades [see Bol (2014)] using qualified professions economy-wide as a control group, and negative yet small effects of the deregulation in 2004 on earnings [see Damelang et al. (2018), Lergetporer et al. (2018)]. An important limitation of empirical studies on occupational licensing is that it is difficult for researchers to construct a suitable comparison group. In most cases, being subject to occupational licensing is not random, meaning that effect estimates will be biased unless all other factors influencing individual income are controlled for. However, it is difficult to perfectly control for individual human-level characteristics and differences in occupation-level productivity. Empirical studies on the effects of occupational vary in their methodological approach to this challenge. Some estimate differences in national cross-section incomes between licensed and unlicensed professions (e.g. Bol and Weeden 2015; Redbird 2017), whereas others focus on a specific occupation and exploit geographical differences in licensing practices (e.g. Kleiner and Kudrle 2000; Timmons and Thornton 2008, 2013). The latter approach is less vulnerable to unobserved heterogeneity arising from occupation specificities, yet unobserved heterogeneity may still be present due to state effects or other individual-specific effects. In a few cases, researchers have tried to improve the counterfactual at hand. Ingram (2018) uses matching and Lergetporer et al. (2018) use entropy balancing to achieve a treatment and control group with similar characteristics. As a result, the size of their estimates is reduced, which could indicate that some unobserved heterogeneity biasing the results was thus removed. Bol (2014) tries to solve the problem of unobserved heterogeneity by constructing three occupational-level indicators of skill requirements (physical abilities, technical skills, and complex mental processing skills), which are based on a workforce survey conducted by the Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training and the Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. It is difficult to judge whether this correction is successful. It is also worth noting that only differences in productivity between occupations are thus captured, leaving differences between individuals unaddressed. The German crafts reform appears particularly well suited to studying the effects of occupational licensing, since the deregulation in 2004 resembles a natural experiment. Since the reform, market entry in certain tradesFootnote 3 has been open. However, in the remaining trades, the licensing requirement remains fullyFootnote 4 or partiallyFootnote 5 intact,Footnote 6 which in theory makes for the perfect control group. Hence, difference-in-differences estimation can be used, which eliminates the problem of unobserved heterogeneity, given a key assumption that is discussed in part 2.3 of this paper. One study to adopt this approach is Damelang et al. (2018), focusing on the indirect effects of removing the occupational licensing criteria for the self-employed on the wages of employees. The underlying theory is that economic rents that might arise with occupational licensing will (given certain conditions) be shared between employers and employees. The authors estimate a two-way fixed effect model using official survey data comprising a two per cent random sample of all employees subject to social security contributions in Germany (the SIAB). According to their findings, employees in the deregulated trades experienced an average wage loss of 0.65%Footnote 7 as a result of the deregulation. As the authors hypothesized, they find that this effect is concentrated among older and unskilled workers who they claim to have worse labor market prospects and hence lower bargaining power against their employer. The authors explain the low magnitude of the estimate compared with e.g. Bol (2014) by the fact that they investigate effects on the income of employees and not the self-employed, while they also only study within-subject changes. Lergetporer et al. (2018) also examine the reform effects with difference-in-differences estimation on the wages of employed craftsmen using the SIAB dataset. They find that over the period from 2004 to 2014, workers in deregulated occupations experienced a negative average effect on their earnings of approximately 2.3% as a result of the deregulation. The authors note that the reform effect appears with a lag. Despite being stronger than the effects found in Damelang et al. (2018), the authors still characterize the size of their estimates as “rather modest”. This is confirmed when the authors use official survey data (microcensus) to gage the effects on both self-employed and employed. In this case, the estimated reform effect on the incomes of employees is even slightly positive, whereas that for the self-employed is negative but insignificant. Lergetporer et al. (2018) offer several explications for the weak reform effect. Two general theses stand out, namely that the new firms that entered as the market barrier in the crafts market declined did not pose a real threat to incumbents, and German labor market institutions (minimum wage and collective bargaining agreement) both reduce and delay reductions in wages. Finally, inspired by existing studies on the income effects of the 2004 deregulation on employees and the self-employed, Sonntag and Lutter investigate the following three hypotheses about the effects of the reform through difference-in-differences estimates using microcensus data from 2002 to 2007: (1) the reform caused a more pronounced decline in the incomes of deregulated self-employed craftsmen compared with their employees; (2) it negatively affected the income development of employees with a Meister title in deregulated crafts; whereas (3) it positively affected it for employees without a Meister title in the same crafts. However, their results are not in line with their prior expectations. The reform appears to have neither affected the incomes of the self-employed nor employees. In terms of different effects among employees, their models do not show consistent findings, and hence the authors are hesitant to draw clear conclusions. In this study, I again exploit the natural experiment provided by the German craft sector to shed light on the link between occupational licensing and incomes using difference-in-differences estimation. Hamermesh (2007) distinguishes between two types of replications: ‘pure replications’ as duplicates of an existing scientific experiment, and ‘scientific replications’ that may use a different sample, different population, and perhaps a similar but not identical model to examine the same question. Since Lergetporer et al. (2018), Damelang et al. (2018) and Sonntag and Lutter (2018) analyze the link between occupational licensing and incomes in the German crafts, this study clearly has a scientific replicative character. Whether one can speak of a pure replication is debatable. In contrast to Damelang et al. (2018), who explore the effects of the 2004 reform on the incomes of employees, I focus solely on the incomes of the self-employed. As such, this study deepens the second part in Lergetporer et al. (2018) as well as Sonntag and Lutter (2018), who also looks at income effects on the self-employed. However, some differences between these studies and mine still exist. For identifying the crafts, I use the same method as Sonntag and Lutter (2018),Footnote 8 which is somewhat different from Lergetporer et al. (2018). The time span considered also varies between my study and the existing literature (as well as between existing studies). Finally, although all studies use difference-in-differences, they consider slightly different specifications. Particularly notable is the choice of covariates, which implicitly affects the interpretation of the reform effect obtained. Whereas I focus on incomes pocketed, other studies examine the reform’s effects on incomes for a given work effort. The subsequent section outlines the methodology that I employ to study the income effects of removing occupational licensing in the German crafts and details the respective strengths and weaknesses of the data analysis. The final section of the paper reveals the results of the estimation and discusses possible explanations for the empirical findings.",

It is a graphical representation of the relation between job vacancies and unemployment. During booms, vacancy rates typically go up and unemployment rates go down the curve, whereas during recessions, vacancy rates go down and unemployment rates go up. Movements along the curve are often driven by cyclical factors. Shifts in the Beveridge curve, however, are often associated with structural changes in the labour market. In recent years, shifts in the Beveridge curve have been extensively studied; however, there is limited data on the reasons behind those shifts. In addition, policymakers should give more importance to know the reasons for adopting adequate policies to tackle rising unemployment. Dow and Dicks-Mireaux (1958) argue that if the Beveridge curve shifts due to changes in matching efficiency, then the aggregate stabilisation policies are likely to fail. The unemployment rate will probably not fall again to the levels that prevailed before the recession, since the labour market is presumed to be structurally less efficient in creating successful matches. Researchers, but especially policy makers relate such outward shifts itself as an indication of a sustained rise in structural unemployment. However, from a theoretical point of view, it is not clear whether this shift is truly related to efficiency problems, because also supply shocks can cause outward shifts in the Beveridge curve. E. g. Diamond and Şahin (2015) argue that the outward shifts of the US Beveridge curve were not predictors of the levels of unemployment rate which were attained at the end of the following expansions. The Austrian labour market was only slightly hit by the Great Recession of 2008/2009 compared to other European countries. The unemployment rate rose from about 4% to 5.5% during the crises years, but a shift in the Beveridge curve was only visible after 2014. The unemployment rate rose from 5% in 2014 to a record high of 6.2% in 2016, whereas the vacancy rate almost doubled from 0.6% to more than 1%.Footnote 1 While some scholars argue that the shift in the Beveridge curve was driven by a labour supply shock related to the opening of the labour market for Eastern European countries, others argue that the shift was due to a decrease in matching efficiency. Furthermore, there is a lack of clear empirical evidence on the determinants that affected the shift of the Austrian Beveridge curve, which we intend to focus in this study. In addition, the strong economic and regional connection of Austria to many Eastern European countries makes it an interesting case to assess the impact of labour market liberalisation on a small, open economy. With a unique micro-data on worker flows on the Austrian labour market, we trace the changes between unemployment, employment and inactivity. This data has a rotating panel structure which allows us to follow workers for five consecutive quarters on the labour market between 2004 and 2016. We analyse the changes in the labour market flows by using a newly established decomposition method proposed by Barnichon and Figura (2010). This methodology allows us to separate unemployment rate movements into labour supply, demand, separation and matching factors. Identifying the factors which drive the unemployment rate is crucial for policy recommendations. Job creation subsidies, firing taxes, employment tax credits to curb labour market entry or other policies to tackle problems on the labour market might be more effective, depending on the reasons for the shifts in the Beveridge curve. While Schiman (2018) suggests in a macro framework that a supply shock caused a Beveridge curve shift in Austria, our analysis based on microdata highlights a rising mismatch problem, which can potentially stem from the enlargement of the European Union (EU), but has completely different policy implications. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a short literature overview. Section 3 will introduce the data used in the analysis. Section 4 describes the decomposition model. Section 5 presents the results, and Section 6 concludes the paper.",3

In the European Union, for example, the crude divorce rate stood at 0.8 in 1965. This figure soared to 1.5 in 1980, to 1.8 in 2000 and 1.9 in 2015 (Eurostat 2018). In response to this development, a large body of work has amassed that examines the impact of separation or divorce on either economic well-being or on changes in labor market activities (Hauser et al. 2016; Bröckel and Andreß 2015; Tamborini et al. 2015; DiPrete and McManus 2000; van Damme et al. 2009; Jenkins 2008; Mueller 2005; Raz-Yurovich 2011; Tach and Eads 2015; McKeever and Wolfinger 2001). Research by Hauser et al. (2016) for Germany for the period between 1990 and 2006 has shown that women experience a dramatic short-term drop in equalized household income of approximately 26% in the year following the dissolution of a marital or cohabiting union. Government taxes and transfers reduce this decline to 17%. While there is a significant drop for women, the equalized household income before taxes and transfers of men increases by 4% after separation and it only drops by 4% from the pre-divorce income once taxes and transfers are taken into account (Hauser et al. 2016). In this paper, I add to the previous literature by using administrative data to examine the causal consequence of divorce on individual labor income and employment participation of women in West Germany. Previous research for Germany was regularly constrained by the low number of events available in social science surveys that were used to study the economic ramifications of divorce and separation. Thus, scholars often combined multiple survey years or even decades for their investigations (Hauser et al. 2016; Bröckel and Andreß 2015; DiPrete and McManus 2000). In this paper, I overcome some of these limitations by focusing the analysis on women with a divorce file opening in the calendar year 2002 using administrative data of the German pension insurance. Apart from the overall employment rate (which is defined as being marginally and/or regularly employed) and the rate for regular employment, I also examine changes in marginal employment. In the context of the German system, a transition from marginal to regular employment is a significant process. Marginally employed persons face lower wages, are exempt from unemployment benefits, do not contribute to the statutory health insurance and, until 2013, were only voluntarily covered in the statutory pension system. As many married women are working marginally in Germany, it is important to understand whether divorce increases regular employment. As a method, I primarily rely on propensity score matching (kernel matching). Matching techniques have become widely used to unravel causal effects. In a setting like divorce where the selection into divorce is not random, the “divorce effects” in conventional models are very likely biased. The matching approach is one possibility to address the selection bias. It removes selection into divorce by finding similar individuals in the treatment and control group (conditional on observed pre-treatment characteristics). Thus, based on observed covariates it mimics a randomized controlled trial. As to the structure of the analysis, I first examine the employment effects for marginalFootnote 1 employment, regularFootnote 2 employment and then I estimate the overall employment rate as a combination of both. Since the plausibility of estimates relies heavily on the assumption of conditional independence (no hidden bias), I scrutinize the employment effects with respect to hidden bias from unobserved confounders (Mantel–Haenszel bounds) (Mantel and Haenszel 1959). In a second step I analyze the impact of divorce on daily gross earnings (for regular employment only) by principal stratification (Zhang and Rubin 2003; Zhang et al. 2008; Lee 2009; Huber and Mellace 2015). I decided on principal stratification because in the presence of sample selection (non-random selection into employment) naïve treatment-minus-control differences cannot be interpreted as impact estimates (Lee 2009).",3
54,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,30 June 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-020-00274-w,A new indicator for nowcasting employment subject to social security contributions in Germany,December 2020,Christian Hutter,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Obtaining information on important macroeconomic variables as early as possible is important for forecasters, especially if they conduct short-term predictions. Among the main consumers of these predictions are policymakers who need regularly updated and reliable data as basis for their decisions, particularly in times of economic turmoil. This is also true for the labour market, where the focus often is on employment and unemployment development. However, while the number of unemployed in Germany is published with almost no delay and not revised in later months, the number of employees subject to social security contributions (SSC) is not published until after a time lag of 2 months. In addition, one has to wait 6 months to know the final data that are not subject to regular revisions any more. Thus, data without publication lag and/or uncertainty about the current and past employment development are highly valuable. Especially during times of economic crisis such as the great recession of 2008/2009 or the Corona pandemic of 2020, questions of how fast and how severely the employment figures are affected become highly relevant. This paper aims to close this gap by investigating an auxiliary variable that has been rather neglected so far: employees subject to compulsory health insurance (CHI). This variable is published by the Federal Ministry of Health on a monthly basis and with almost no delay. Furthermore, it covers 97% of employees subject to SSC so that both variables are closely linked. These are promising prerequisites for improving nowcasts of employees subject to SSC. In order to assess the usefulness of the potential auxiliary variable, I conduct out-of-sample nowcast tests based on real-time vintages. Hence, the paper takes account of the real-time, revised nature of the data (Clark and McCracken 2009). Consequently, I only calculate nowcasts using information that would have been available at the time. Nowcasts based on the best purely autoregressive benchmark model are compared to those stemming from a model enhanced by current and past values of the auxiliary variable. Statistical tests à la Clark and West (2007) that take into account the nested model environment show that employees subject to CHI indeed help to significantly outperform the purely autoregressive benchmark. Beyond statistical significance, the results are also economically relevant: The mean squared prediction error for both nowcast horizons (\(t_{-1}\) and \(t_{0}\)) can be reduced by approximately 20%. The value added of CHI is emphasized by the fact that it also outperforms other variables such as unemployment, vacancies or industrial production. The paper proceeds as follows: The subsequent data section introduces the main target variable and the potential for improving its nowcast accuracy.

The present work builds upon an important piece of this literature that examines the survival and hazard rates of new plants that are affiliated with pre-established firms. While some previous research takes for granted that the affiliation to an existing firm brings increased and easier access to knowledge, in this paper we extend the study of the channels by which the parent firm (or other units in the same group) can transfer knowledge to the newly opened branch. Our research contributes to the literature by focusing on a specific mechanism of within-firm transfer of knowledge that has been relatively neglected so far—the transfer of workers from pre-existing to newly-created establishments of the same firm. The novelty in our work lies in the use of a large matched employer-employee data set to focus on the role that intra-firm mobility plays as a channel for transferring knowledge and expertise to the new unit and to analyze the impact of this internal recruitment strategy in the new unit’s survival. These internal movements not only strengthen personal ties between different plants but they are also a direct channel for knowledge transfer that has been scarcely addressed in previous literature. The objectives of this paper are twofold. Our first objective is to characterize the recruitment policy of new establishments affiliated with multi-establishment firms, analyzing the importance of internal and external hires at different hierarchical levels. Our hypothesis is that, in the new unit, internal transfers will increase for higher hierarchical levels (Doeringer and Piore 1971; Lazear and Oyer 2004). The second objective of this paper is to asses if internal hires, specially at higher hierarchical levels, affect the survival of new establishments. This is an indirect way to test if intra-firm mobility is motivated by the need to transfer firm-specific knowledge to the new unit. Our main hypothesis is that the share of internal hires positively affects survival because it works as a channel for knowledge transfer. We believe this channel can work in two ways: first, a higher proportion of internally hired employees can increase personal contacts and acquaintances between the new plant and the other units of the group improving and smoothing communication. Second, a higher proportion of internal hiring will be particularly important in top-level jobs, where strategic decision-making occurs. As firm-specific human capital is embodied in the workers, it may be supplied to the new unit by internally transferring workers. Implementing other effective strategies to transfer knowledge to the new unit may be particularly challenging for tacit knowledge that is hard to codify. Our findings show that external hires seem to prevail for occupations that are closer to the bottom of the hierarchy, which sustains the existence of ports of entry, while internal hires prevail at the top. We also conclude that the share of internal hires, particularly for higher-rank jobs, has a positive impact on survival and that internal transfers are likely to be one important channel to transfer firm-specific knowledge to new establishments. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Sect. 2 we present relevant previous research; in Sect. 3 we detail our sample design and characterize the data; Sect. 4 discusses the empirical strategy and presents the main results and Sect. 5 concludes.",1

Beyond this indicator, there is no information about hours of work. The reporting procedure for the part-time indicator changed in 2011 with dramatic consequences on the share of reported part-time workers. This paper develops a correction procedure for this break and investigates the robustness of previous findings on the evolution of wage inequality in Germany. Relying on the part-time indicator, the literature on long-term trends in wage inequality in Germany using SIAB data focuses on the subsample of full-time employees because of the lack of information on hours of work (see the studies cited in footnote 1). This assumes that differences in hours of work among full-time employees are negligible for the analysis of long-term trends in wage inequality thus that daily wages (earnings) provide a good approximation of the price of labor.Footnote 2 Most studies do not analyze wages for part-time employees, among whom wage differences are likely to mostly reflect differences in hours of work. In 2011, there was a change in the reporting procedure employers had to apply for social security records (Ganzer et al. 2017; Ludsteck and Thomsen 2016; Möller 2016). Before this change, the part-time indicator was part of the occupational status variable (German: Stellung im Beruf), comprising various job characteristics. In 2011, a separate variable reporting working-time status was added (Bertat et al. 2013).Footnote 3 The change both forced employers to reassess and update their reporting routines and made the need for employers to report part-time employment more salient. Thus, the reported part-time information after the change is likely to be more reliable. The change in the reporting procedure was not implemented at the start of 2011 for all employers. There was a grace period until the end of 2011. While some employers started to use the new procedure early in 2011, others kept using the old procedure until the end of 2011. During this transition, the quality of the reported data severely deteriorated as indicated by a large number of missing values for a number of variables, including the part-time indicator. The large increase in missing values is likely to be an effect of the reporting changes. While the share of missing values in the part-time indicator is below 1% in other years, it lies above 30% in the raw data in 2011. All this suggests that the new reporting procedure only started to operate fully in 2012. In this year, the number of missings in the raw data returned to normal levels. For preparation of the most recent version of the SIAB, from 1975 to 2014 (henceforth SIAB7514), researchers at the IAB implemented an imputation for the part-time indicator in 2011 (Ganzer et al. 2017; Ludsteck and Thomsen 2016) in order to both account for the missing data and update the full data for 2011 to the new reporting procedure. Figure 1 shows that this imputation is successful insofar that the share of 2011 fits a smooth backward extrapolation of the trend for the years after 2011. At the same time, after this imputation, the change in the reporting procedure for the part-time indicator in 2011 results in a sizeable increase (fall) in the reported share of part-time (full-time) workers in 2011 as shown in Fig. 1. This structural break is larger in size for female workers (2010 to 2011 increase in part-time share by 7 percentage points, henceforth ppt), but it also affects male workers in a sizeable way (2010 to 2011 increase in part-time share by 2 ppt). Part-time shares by gender. Part-time shares among employees in SIAB7514, raw data, weighted by the length of employment spells, only former West-Germany (without Berlin), only employees aged 25 to 55, without marginally employed and apprentices The jump in the level of the part-time share before and after the change in the reporting scheme is striking. We cannot think of a plausible reason such as a policy change, an economic shock or a mistake in the data collection from 2011 onward which could explain the sizeable increase in the part-time share. Similar in spirit to the imputation procedures applied by Ludsteck and Thomsen (2016) and Möller (2016), we argue that the higher part-time share since 2011 seems correct and therefore the lower part-time share before 2010 is likely to be the result of misreporting true part-time employment as full-time employment. Further, there was an upward bias in reported full-time work because employers tend to reuse the record on previous employment spells by the same employees (Ludsteck and Thomsen 2016) and workers are more likely to switch from full-time work to part-time work within the same job.Footnote 4 The need to update the working time status in such a case seems more salient for employers under the new reporting procedure introduced in 2011. 
Möller (2016) pointed out that before 2011 full-time spells with low daily wages in the raw data are disproportionately likely to be in fact part-time spells and therefore the raw SIAB data is likely to overstate the level of wage inequality among full-timers until 2010.Footnote 5 Further, this bears the risk that the increase in wage inequality until 2010 among reported full-timers (as discussed in the literature) may also have overstated the true increase. This is an important issue because Möller’s (2016) evidence based on the SIAB7514 suggests a trend reversal in wage inequality trends among full-timers in West Germany from 2011 onward, i.e. at the time of the break in the part-time indicator, such that inequality increased until 2010 and has then stopped to grow further. Figures 2 and 3 indeed show remarkably increasing trends for different percentiles of the full-time-log-earning distribution for women and men in 2011. As expected, the increase is much stronger for women which can be explained by the larger increase in the part-time share shown in Fig. 1. For both genders, the increase is also stronger at the bottom of the distribution. In the male distribution, one needs to consider a quite low percentile such as the 2.5th percentile to see a large kink. This is not surprising given the low share of part-time employees among men (below 10%). Still, the effect of the change in the reporting procedure is also visible for men—and our evidence suggests to correct employment spells up to the 25th percentile of the male full-time wage distribution. For women, a discontinuous increase from 2010 to 2011 can even be detected in the upper half of the distribution. Cumulative real wage growth for women, full-time, raw.

Möller (2016) corrects full-time employment before 2011 using a simple imputation correction, which shares some similarities with our approach.Footnote 6 He first estimates a non-linear trend for total part-time employment for the time period until 2010 and uses this estimate to predict part-time employment in 2011. As to be expected, this provides evidence for underreporting of part-time employment before 2011. He then fits a logit model for the incidence of part-time employment for the sample until 2010, using age, industry, wage, region among others as predictors. In the pre-2011 sample, he then corrects those reported full-time spells with the highest predicted part-time probability to part-time. This correction is continued until the break in the time trend in part-time employment, as calculated in the first step, disappears. The underlying assumption for this correction is that the relative amount of underreporting part-time employment was basically constant in the pre-2011 period. The goal of our paper is to develop a correction based on estimating the probability of being reported as a part-time worker before and after the break in 2011. Our paper extends upon Möller (2016) in three dimensions. First, we use the year 2012 as benchmark year assuming that part-time is reported correctly in that year and we also correct wages in 2011. Second, we use an inverse probability weighting approach to reweight reported full-time spells instead of a binary prediction as to whether a spell is full-time or part-time. Using a discrete prediction entails the danger that the correction is too strong in the bottom part of the distribution and not strong enough further up the distribution. Third, we use graphical evidence on the evolution of the wage percentiles among full-time employment to determine the position in the wage distribution below which a correction of wages is necessary. Our approach involves estimating the probability for a part-time spell being reported among all employees (full-timers and part-timers) as a function of employee and job characteristics both for the year 2012 and the years before 2012. The regression is estimated based on those observations with wages below the upper bound, above which graphical evidence suggests that there is no need for correction. The rank difference in the wage distribution between the upper bound and the individual’s wage is used as key covariate. Based on the regression estimates, the full-time employment data before 2012 is then reweighted using inverse probability reweighting based on the estimated propensity scores. This way, reported full-time employment spell before 2011 are corrected. We identify and downweight observations which are likely to be misreported as full-time, which results in a continuous upward correction of low wage percentiles among full-timers. This correction is smooth and we also correct the data in 2011 because our graphical evidence on wage trends suggests that the data in 2011 suffers from misreporting of low wage spells as involving full-time employment. Using our correction, the paper confirms Möller’s (2016) finding that the rise in wage inequality among full-time working women in West Germany until 2010 is not a spurious consequence of the misreporting of working time. Furthermore, based on our corrected data, we find that the fall in real wages among full-timers during the 2000s was strongest among young workers [similar to the findings in Antonczyk et al. (2018) for the time period until 2004] and there is in fact a trend reversal after 2010. While real wages increase slightly after 2010 for low-wage earners among women, they stagnate at low levels or even fall further for low-wage earners among men. Wage trends between 2010 and 2014 have contributed little to reverse the strong increase in wage inequality until 2010, a findings which holds in particular for low-wage earners among men. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Our correction approach is developed in Sect. 3. Section 4 revisits the analysis of wage inequality based on the corrected data. Section 5 concludes.",10

The first one includes training programs that aim to improve employee’s skills. The second encompasses job search assistance and job-matching schemes. The last one relates to wage subsidies, both those provided to employees to reduce inactivity traps and those provided to employers to reduce the costs of hiring. These subsidies, which are based on long-standing theoretical arguments (Kaldor 1936), have been used extensively by developed countries since the 1980s, before they were popularized in developing countries (Auer et al. 2005). The aftermath of the last financial crisis, the persistence of mass unemployment and the inevitable process of labour automation are all recent trends that have given new impetus to wage subsidies as a primary tool of ALMP (Banerji et al. 2014). However, the available literature about their effectiveness provides mixed evidence. The recent meta-analysis show positive effects (Yeyati et al. 2019), but the unconditional average magnitude of these effects remains low (Kluve et al. 2019).The assessment is even more pessimistic according to other meta-analysis that reveal a negative impact, at best zero, on beneficiaries' employment and income (Card et al. 2018).For developing countries, the evidence on the effectiveness of ALMP programs still sketchy (Grimm and Paffhausen 2014), due to the limited numberFootnote 1 of rigorous impact evaluations (McKenzie 2017). For example, in the very influential meta-analysis of Betcherman et al. (2004), which covers 159 studies, there are only 39 evaluations from developing and transition countries, of which only 4 drew on randomized experiments.Footnote 2 Moreover, the findings of the few existing evaluations should be taken with caution, as the found effects vary across intervention’ type and depending on the group of beneficiaries and country context (Cho and Honorati 2013). Therefore, additional studies assessing the effectiveness of wage subsidies in developing countries are of crucial importance. The case of Morocco, where the available labour factor seems to be strongly under-used and inefficiently allocated, is an excellent example in this perspective. The unemployment rate has exceeded 10% on average over the last 20 years, with 70% are long-term unemployed, 60% are first-time job seekers, and the employment rate is now only 40%. The high weight of graduate unemployment, which is five times higher than that of without diploma people, as well as that of informal employment, unpaid employment and underemployment, which represent respectively 27%, 18% and 10% of the total employment, reveal, moreover, the suboptimal use of the available labour force (Haut-commissariat au plan & World Bank 2017).This situation has occurred despite the implementation, particularly since the beginning of the 1990s, of an ambitious ALMP, which includes, among other governmental programs, a wage subsidy scheme, called ""Idmaj"". Unfortunately, none of these public programs has been evaluated,Footnote 3 and our knowledge about their effectiveness is still very limited. Therefore, this paper seeks to fill this gap by estimating the causal effect impact of the ""Idmaj"" Program using the propensity score matching method. It contributes to the available literature on subsidized employment in four ways. First, as counterfactual evaluations outside the OECD are quite limited, it provides evidence on the experience of developing countries. Second, while the available literature focuses more on schemes acting on either the demand or the supply side of the labour market and targeting low-skilled individuals, this paper examines one particular program that affects the both sides of the labour market and targets, as many countries in the MENA region (Groh et al. 2012, 2014; Broecke 2013; Premand et al. 2016; Souag 2020), higher degree graduates. Third, it goes beyond the program's direct impacts on employment to capture its effects on beneficiaries' wages and their working conditions. Finally, it highlights the heterogeneous effects of the program. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. “2” presents a review of the literature. Section “3” presents the ""Idmaj"" program. Propensity score matching estimation methodology and empirical implementation are discussed in Sect. “4”. Section “5” provides details on the data used. Section “6” presents and discusses the empirical results. The final section presents the conclusions, policy implications and limitations of this paper.",

Health status is the main driver of the ability of workers to be employed (Ferlie et al. 2016). Often, poor health conditions lead to a disability pension (Robroek et al. 2013), unemployment (Cardano et al. 2004 and Schuring et al. 2007) or early retirement (van Berg et al. 2010). In the current economic condition in western societies with low unemployment and an aging society, governments have strong incentives to implement policies to reintegrate workers with a disability as soon as possible. For the US the economic estimated lifetime savings for removing an additional one percent of the beneficiaries from the rolls of the disability insurance and the supplemental security income programs each year are several billion USD (U.S. General Accounting Office 1997). In the US alone, there are over eight million disability insurance beneficiaries with average yearly payments of more than USD 6000 (Social Security Administration 2013) with rising expenditures for the government (Segelken 2014). Several return-to-work interventions have been started by the OECD countries (see Clayton et al. 2012 for a systematic review as well as Burkhauser et al. 2016, for trends in government disability programs). For the person with a disability, employment itself is positive in several dimensions. It positively impacts the general social status and professional skills. The sense of engagement, social identification, social interactions with other employees as well as mental stimulation support the general well-being (Noh et al. 2015 or Waddell and Bruton 2006). In case of (temporary) disability reintegration improves the health (Schuring et al. 2011). Individual support of professionals, specialized in rehabilitation methods with a supportive attitude, does improve the chance of reintegration into the workforce (see Liukko and Kuuva 2016; or Hansen 2006 for a study using German data). Improvements to the work environment by the employer is an important factor for reintegration (Wheeler et al. 2001). Whether a person has been successfully reintegrated into the labor market can be viewed differently by the different stakeholders (Young et al. 2005). For the insurance company the reintegration has been successful if the benefit payments can be stopped. An employer sees successful reintegration when the person is fully able to work again. The employee feels successfully reintegrated if she can continue her employment permanently and for the same salary. In our analysis a person has a disability when she cannot work at least 40% for 1 year. Accordingly, the reintegration is successful if the person is more than 60% fit for work again (measured by the comparison of income with and without disability). Claims for both physical and psychological reasons are covered. The definition corresponds to Swiss practice and legal principles (see Swiss Federal Law on Disability Insurance, Article 28). To analyze the effectiveness of case management we use exclusive data. The data is unique in several respects. It is based on more than 42,000 cases of incapacity for work in the Swiss labor market and provides information on personal characteristics such as gender, age, salaries, date, and cause of the disability. It is known that personal characteristics are more relevant to reintegration than employer characteristics (see Galizzi et al. 2019). The Swiss labor market, in contrast to most other economies is particularly interesting for such an analysis. In Switzerland, employers or associated pension funds to be exact must cover incapacity to work, as well as death and old age, at a high level. This makes it possible to consider not only a selective group of privileged employees in large corporations, but the entire working population. Due to the high obligatory coverage, the disability benefits within all workers are comparable at about 60% of the initial wage. There are no large differences in disability benefits between workers (relative to the income). Opposed to other countries, in Switzerland there are no low-paid workers losing most of their income in case of disability. The risk of incapacity to work is borne by independent pension funds or insurance companies. We obtain the data from the largest semi-autonomous insurer in Switzerland.Footnote 1 Government reintegration measures are often moderately recorded and less financially monitored. Due to financial incentives the statistics of private insurance companies are more reliable. The insurance companies have an interest in knowing and managing their portfolio comprehensively to determine annual premiums. If an insured person becomes unable to work, the insurer may offer the person a so-called case manager for support. The offer from the insurer as well as the acceptance from the insured is on a voluntary basis. Participation in case management has no effect on benefit payments and no additional costs for the insured person. The case manager provides emotional, legal, and medical support to give the insured person the best possible chances for reintegration into the labor market. Based on the unique dataset, we analyze the effectiveness of case management, on the probability of reintegration into the labor market. Our results show that if employees, who are not able to work, receive support at an early stage of their disability, the chance of reintegration into the labor market can be significantly increased by about 18.9%. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. After a detailed explanation of case management, we discuss the data and present the methods used. The results and robustness checks are given in section five. Section six summarizes our findings and concludes.",

In general, job titles are defined in terms of educational requirements that coincide with the levels of formal education. Of particular interest is to analyze whether the tasks assigned to different positions can be performed effectively with the qualifications provided by the education system or, on the contrary, there is no connection between the contents of the educational curriculum and the contents of the jobs.Footnote 1 The (mis)match between the level of formal education and the level required for the job has been, indeed, the focus of substantial research in the labor and education economics literature since the appearance of Freeman's (1976) book The overeducated American. See, for surveys of the literature, Leuven and Oosterbeek (2011), McGuinnes (2006), and Sloane (2003); for a meta-analysis, Groot and Maassen van den Brink (2000). In this article, we focus on the labor market for university graduates. The paper contributes to the understanding of the mismatch between professional (academic) degrees and labor market positions. Most theoretical and empirical studies of education-job mismatch have focused predominantly on graduate over-education (e.g., Dolton and Vignoles 2000). Over-education (or vertical mismatch) appears when graduates work in non-graduate jobs. However, this article focuses on another type of education-job mismatch that has received less attention in the literature: the unrelatedness of a worker’s field of study to his or her occupation at their formal qualification level, also referred to as horizontal mismatch. Relative to vertical mismatch, there are much fewer published studies of horizontal mismatch—see Somers et al. (2019) for a recent systematic literature review. In the latter paper, it is evidenced that, unlike vertical mismatch, there are still no theoretical models that explain the phenomenon. Nonetheless, the empirical evidence suggests that the likelihood of horizontal mismatch is among other things determined by the extent to which employees possess general skills as opposed to occupation-specific skills (Somers et al. 2019). In the labor market for university graduates, the issue of horizontal mismatch is considerably less studied than vertical mismatch (or over-education) mainly due to the lack of relevant data on fields of studies of university graduates. Horizontal mismatch (or field-of-study mismatch) occurs when graduates, trained in a particular field, work in another field at their formal qualification level. For example, a person earning a degree in Mathematics working as a computer-aided design technician. Robst (2007) was one of the first papers devoted to the horizontal mismatch. In this study, some of the majors with the highest prevalence rates of mismatch between work and degree fields included English and foreign languages, social sciences, and liberal arts. “Typically, these majors provide more general skills than occupation specific skills” (Robst 2007, p. 402). On the contrary, computer science, health professions, and engineering had low prevalence rates. “Most of these majors focus on skills that apply to relatively specific occupations” (Robst 2007, p. 402). The specific human capital cannot be easily transferred to other sectors, and graduates in these fields are less likely to search for a job in other sectors. They are more likely to work in a job that is directly related to their field of study in order to use specific human capital, which was accumulated during university studies. Graduates of these fields are therefore less likely to be horizontally mismatched. Because the number of empirical studies on horizontal mismatch among university graduates is limited, this paper contributes thus to the scarce existing literature on the topic by providing the taxonomy of educational mismatch in the labor market for university graduates and investigating its incidence among Spanish higher education graduates based on self-assessments. In addition, the map of degrees done in this article according to the education-job (mis)match is important for the educational policy given that higher education is highly subsidized in Spain. The article is also novel in the sense that it incorporates methodological improvements that we comment below. Two well-cited papers by Robst (2007) and Nordin et al. (2010), published in the same journal, already addressed the mismatch between the individual’s field of education and his/her occupation (horizontal mismatch). Robst’s (2007) match/mismatch measure was based on subjective answers to the question of whether the job the college graduate held was closely related, not related, or somewhat related to his/her highest degree field. In Nordin et al. (2010), the authors crossed 34 occupations with 29 different fields of education in a table and made the same classification. Nonetheless, both papers present drawbacks. In Robst (2007), the author used an ordered logit model which indicated whether a major had a higher or lower likelihood of being horizontally mismatched, but the author did not distinguish whether the undergraduates were occupying college-level occupations or they were filling typical high school graduate positions.Footnote 2 The implications for educational policy and the labor market are different. In the case of Nordin et al. (2010), the authors only presented a table with the fields of education and the shares of matched, weakly matched, and mismatched individuals (there is no econometric model). In their percentages, they did not distinguish either whether the graduates were in positions typical of graduates or lower-level positions. Some results were striking. For example, 80% of men and 75% of women with a degree in Biology were mismatched. In this last classification, among other occupations, the authors included teachers of upper secondary education. However, according to the proposal we make in this paper, they would be well-matched because they are occupying university positions in a related field, i.e., teaching Biology. Our paper contributes thus to improving the deficiencies of those publications by focusing on the Spanish labor market for recent university graduates. In particular, the article aimed to determine which degree fields (narrow fields of education) were associated with being horizontally mismatched in the labor market for higher education graduates in Spain: when graduates are employed in a graduate job that is not related to their field of study. By estimating the likelihood of being horizontally mismatched (field-of-study mismatch), we also simultaneously estimate the probability of being vertically mismatched (over-education), and full job mismatched (i.e., field-of-study mismatch and over-education). The taxonomy that we propose allows us to better identify situations of educational mismatch in the graduate labor market. Besides, the multinomial logit model of the probability of education-employment matching that we suggest allowed us to draw a map of university degrees according to the type of (mis)match. This is also a novelty. Additionally, our article aimed to study external labor mobility that takes place in the early stages of graduates' working lives. A good match between graduates' degrees and their jobs will likely happen after job turnover. For the analysis carried out in this paper, we used individual-level data from the first survey of labor insertion of university graduates in Spain. The Encuesta de Inserción Laboral de titulados Universitarios (EILU 2014) is a nationally representative random sample of Spanish universities and university graduates. A total of 30,379 graduates from the class of 2010 were surveyed 4 years after graduation.Footnote 3 The survey asked workers directly whether their particular qualification was appropriate for the work that they did. Many Spanish university graduates were employed in jobs that neither required a degree nor made use of expert knowledge learned at the university. The degree of fit between the qualifications obtained by graduates and their job characteristics can be considered one important performance indicator in higher education. This latter is an expensive investment—it is highly subsidized in Spain—and the highest return for society is obtained when individuals are well-matched to employers such that the knowledge and skills that were acquired through higher education are optimally utilized on the labor market. Therefore, research on the study of the labor market for graduates and their educational (mis)match is justified. In the discussion section of this article, the reader will find more arguments. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the empirical framework behind the measurement of vertical and horizontal education-job mismatch in the graduate labor market. In Sect. 3, we describe the data set drawn from the National Statistics Institute of Spain. We also identify four types of education-job mismatch according to the most appropriate level of formal education and study area to perform a job, and we provide summary statistics on the incidence of mismatch among Spanish higher education graduates. In Sect. 4, we introduce the econometric models of the probability of being (mis)matched in the first and current job, on the one hand, and the probability of being well-matched after external job turnover, on the other hand. Section 5 shows the results of the econometric analysis. Section 6 provides a discussion and some policy implications. Section 7 concludes the paper.",11
55,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,28 April 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-021-00296-y,The association of economic and cultural capital with the NEET rate: differential geographical and temporal patterns,December 2021,Enrico Ripamonti,Stefano Barberis,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The individual trajectories of adolescent development, including educational attainment and participation in the labor market, should be studied in conjunction with the role of macro-level determinants, which may play a top-down effect on teenagers’ behavior and interact with micro-level variables. This paper specifically investigates the role of economic and cultural capital on young people who are neither in employment nor in education or training (NEET)s. While being NEET reflects a multifactorial phenomenon, whose main determinants have been partially highlighted, the literature has paid less attention to the role of the economic capital and of the cultural wherewithal offered by a geographical area, as originally operationalized by Di Maggio and Mohr (1985). Herein we will investigate these issues using national retrospective data. Contemporary European societies are, in general, characterized by advanced and knowledge-based economies, as well as by strong welfare systems and social services. However, there is also high heterogeneity across and within countries (Mayer 2004), which makes important the study of macro-level variables for a deep understanding of social change and of youth transition to adulthood (Buchmann and Kriesi 2011). It is particularly worth placing the study of NEET in this high-level framework, since this may provide policy makers with a comprehensive view on the risk factors involved in this phenomenon. Indeed, governmental and international agencies, in particular the EU and its institutions, have long targeted this group of young people for intervention and monitoring. Such interest reflects the general objectives of the Lisbon strategy, ratified in 2000 by all Member States. However, on current state of research, there is large heterogeneity in methods and models followed in such interventions, without a clear and long-term strategy.  The concept of NEET refers to young people who, since are not working and, at the same time, are not enrolled in school or other formative activities, are not accumulating human capital (Eurofound 2012). Thus, while correlated to the construct of school dropout (Ripamonti 2018), NEETs reflect a more radical and extended form of vulnerability and social exclusion. The acronym NEET was firstly used in the United Kingdom in the 1980s, but became popular worldwide starting from 2010, when the European Union (EU) adopted the NEET rate as an official indicator to assess the youth conditions across EU countries. In Fig. 1 we show the time series of the NEET indicator for the 27 EU countries, and, specifically, for Italy, Spain, France, and Germany. Further graphs and illustrations are presented in Additional file 1. Time series indicators of the NEET rate in the 27 EU countries, and, nationally, in France, Italy, Germany, and Spain The youth unemployment rate (u \(\text{\%}\)) can be defined (e.g., in the Labor Force Survey) as the ratio between the number of unemployed young people (#U e.g., in the age range 15–24) and the total number of people in the same age range that make up the labor force (\(\#\) L = #U + #E, where E indicates the employed), namely (Blanchard et al. 2017): To be included in the definition of \(\#\text{U}\) a person must not have a job, but, at the same time should be actively searching for a job (otherwise he/she would be classified as out of L). While simple in principle, there is debate in the literature on the measurement of the labor force (Battistin et al. 2007) and of the unemployment rate (Jones and Riddell 1999). The NEET rate has a slightly more complicated definition. According to international institutions (e.g., the International Labor Organization or Eurostat), the NEET rate (n%) can be defined as the percentage of the population of a given age, group or sex who is not employed and not involved in further education or training (Elder 2015): 
where \(\#\text{Y}\) indicates the number of youths, \(\#\text{YE}\) the number of youths in employment, \(\#\text{YT}\) the number of youths not in employment, but who are in education or training.Footnote 1 It is worth placing the discussion on NEET and unemployed youth in the larger framework of the theory of human capital (Becker 1962). Educational achievement is indeed a proxy of human capital, which affects the economic capital and the economic development (Barro 1991). In the 2000s the economic theory underlined the importance of non-cognitive skills (e.g., motivation, leadership, initiative, goal-oriented attitude) in the development of human capital (Heckman and Rubinstein 2001). To increasing levels of human capital correspond increased salaries, and the differential in real wages between skilled and unskilled workers, at least in the US, has enlarged from 1970 to 2005 (Autor et al. 2008). In addition, a past history of absence of high educational level and unemployment may also protect teenagers with respect to the probability of future unemployment and transition through the NEET status (Narendranathan and Elias 1993). Young people with low levels of education have relevant difficulties to entry in the labor market (Martin 2009). In Southern Europe, young people of all educational levels may experience difficulties in finding a job and career instability (Brzinsky-Fay 2007). In general, NEETs constitute a very heterogeneous group of individuals, who, however, share an increased risk of social and labor market exclusion. The very concept of NEET has long been criticized, since it would denote a too general as well as fragmented category, not adequate to represent the problems of young people in transition to adulthood (Furlong 2006). Heterogeneity refers to the fact that this category could virtually include, at the same time, young people who are not employed and not at school but are proactively searching for an occupation, as well as people virtually stable in their status, without putting in action proper efforts to ameliorate their condition. In the former group there are NEETs looking for their first job (having completed or not the school with a certificate), and long-term unemployed young people. In the latter group there are those who, as being long-term unemployed people, have been discouraged to search for an occupation, as well as young people who are temporarily in the NEET condition (e.g., to take care of children or parents). While, in general, the label “NEET” may capture young people at risk of marginalization in contemporary societies, there does not exist a shared operational definition underpinning this concept. In fact, scholars have defined the NEET phenomenon in very different ways and with reference to young people of different ages (Yates and Payne 2006). If we consider NEETs as young people aged 15–29, such definition would cover three quite different developmental phases, namely late adolescence (15–17), emerging adulthood (18–24), early adulthood (25–29) (Arnett 2006). NEETs may reflect the impossibility for young people to attain the requirements of normative adult models. In this regard, there are gender specificities as well as personal characteristics to be kept into account. Young girls show a more rapid transition to adulthood than young men (Malmberg and Trempała 1997). In addition, while for young men the consequences of becoming NEET may be mainly related to difficulties in the labor market, young women would also experience negative psychological outcomes (Bynner and Parsons 2002). Education is a second relevant factor associated with NEET. Using data from the British Cohort Study, it was found that low instruction levels are likely to be associated with the NEET rate (Bynner and Parsons 2002). In the same cohort of young people it was shown how uncertain occupational aspirations would be related to NEET (Yates et al. 2011). Health and mental health conditions may also be associated with the NEET status. For instance, actively searching for a job could be hampered by chronic disorders such as suffering from chronic stress and fatigue (Lim et al. 2016). In terms of mental health, long-term unemployment and loss of interest may lead NEETs to a perception of generalized reduced self-efficacy, which implies resignation and inactivity (Jerusalem and Mittag 1995). At the same time NEETs may experience adverse psychological outcomes, like decreasing of self-estimate or self-efficacy (Heckhausen 2006), and the very impossibility of actively choosing a different direction in life. If prolonged, the NEET state could also determine in the young generations a condition of protracted inertia and social disengagement (Maguire 2015). Many psychological factors have to be discussed in relation to NEET. First of all, motivation (Dietrich and Salmela-Aro 2013), which is a key factor to favor the transition from school to work (Symonds et al. 2019). Motivation is strictly related to young people’s educational aspirations (Hegna 2014), future expectations (Iovu et al. 2018), and investing in active efforts in goal pursuit (Lechner et al. 2016), which are important determinant of educational choices and outcomes. The motivational factor is a determinant of job search intensity, which is a very important variable in terms of the possibility of changing the NEET status (Vanoverberghe et al. 2008). Motivation is a primary psychological dimension but should be studied in conjunction with other components that, if activated, may protect the individual from becoming NEET. In this regard, three important factors documented in the literature are given by goal attainability, i.e., the ability of self-monitoring one own’s objectives (Nurmi et al. 2002), the capacity of attributing priorities (Brannen and Nilsen 2002), and intrapersonal agency (Graaf and Zenderen 2013). Two classical concepts of general psychology, which have to be considered in connection to NEET and youth unemployment are coping styles and the locus of control. The coping style and the ability to cope with stress are a protective factor in terms of completing education and starting a job (Ngai et al. 2014). The internal locus of control is the capacity of the individual to attribute internally the effect of behavior/conduct, which may play a role in relation to NEET and other developmental tasks of adolescence and of the emerging adulthood (Sharon 2016). Career preparation, a factor related to the locus of control, predicts adolescents’ satisfaction and career success (Hirschi 2010). However, having an internal locus of control seems a not sufficient condition for protecting young people against becoming NEET for those living in disadvantaged socio-economic conditions (Ng-Knight and Schoon 2017; Vancea and Utzet 2018). At a micro level, parental educational level as well as parents’ support may have a protective effect on the risk of becoming NEET, for both male and female teenagers (Alfieri et al. 2015). NEETs are likely to live in a family with one parent, and where parents are not working (Barham et al. 2009). The literature has shown how being NEET is associated with presence of poor or inadequate familial models and backgrounds (Robson and Team 2008), or to intergenerational influences (Bynner and Parsons 2002). At a macro level, being NEET is more frequent in Southern than in Northern European countries, with the former being characterized by a familialistic protective welfare (Esping-Andersen 1990). As concerns the role of the group of peers, it is certainly a fundamental component of socialization in adolescent development, whose effect can go beyond familial factor (Harris 1995). There is also recent literature linking the role of the group of peers with high school dropout (Ripamonti 2018). The role of the peer group and a constellation of negative behaviors, like crime and violence, has been recently highlighted in Canadian NEETs (Henderson et al. 2017), while in Europe this specific issue, to our knowledge, has been less studied. There are some factors associated with the NEET status that are related to the organizational and work environment. As to the school environment, recent research from Nordic countries indicates that the excess risk for NEET can be attributed to teenagers’ poor performance at school (Berlin et al. 2020). While becoming NEET does not coincide with dropping out from high school, non-completion of school and entering the labor market without qualifications is a strong determinant of transitioning through the NEET condition, especially for women (Salvà-Mut et al. 2016). Basic school achievements, in terms of literacy and numeracy skills, are a consistent protective factor with respect to the possibility of becoming NEET (Barth et al. 2019; Kelly et al. 2012). School is not only a matter of contents or competence, but should actively help teenagers in finding their vocational specificity, which is an important factor in terms of job placement (Vogtenhuber 2014). There is a large amount of studies documenting the important role of internships, extra-curricular activities, investment on soft skills, and experiences like the “gap year” in helping teenagers in the phase of transition from school to work (Aguilar et al. 2018; Sortheix et al. 2013; Stehlik 2010; Vanoverberghe et al. 2008). The literature has underlined the importance of the psychological dimension of these paths, which should be perceived by the individual as an opportunity to ameliorate his/her own outcome in the labor market (Taylor et al. 2015). Important macro-level variables should be kept into account, since, at least in the EU countries, there is a certain variation in the real possibilities for young people to invest in apprenticeships and internships (Lehmann et al. 2015). A possible solution to contrast the NEET phenomenon is given by starting a self-employed activity. While, as documented in a large study involving 11 EU countries, this may protect young people from social exclusion and unemployment (Dvoulety et al. 2018), it could be not achievable or realistic for the most frail and inactive segment of NEETs. In fact, given the personal and psychological vulnerability of NEETs, it may be not easy for them, even with the help of formative programs or mentors, to develop a specific business idea (Nabi et al. 2015). The level of poverty measured at community level has been proposed as a key variable to understand the mechanism of social exclusion, indirectly favoring outcomes like becoming NEET or school dropout (Harding 2003). However, while associated with low socio-economic status, the NEET condition is not exclusive of young people living in poverty or homeless (Thompson 2011). Indeed, being NEET may not be per se a matter of economic disadvantage, but a signal of a developmental difficulty of these teenagers in terms of adjusting their life trajectory in the direction of adulthood (Chen 2011). A role of the geographical context (living in rural and provincial territories vs. cities and metropolises) has also been suggested, at least in terms of school completion (Swanson 2004). Becoming NEET could be a consequence of the increasing complexity of the EU labor market system (Raffo and Reeves 2000). The presence and prevalence of NEETs in the EU may also be linked to the special needs of the local economy (e.g., request of low-skilled, low-paid workers) (Simmons 2008). At a local level, in an analysis conducted in the Austrian federal states, Bacher et al. reported that expenditures for active labor market policy and other contextual factors can explain the geographical difference in the NEETing rate (Bacher et al. 2017).  Rarely, and for a very low percentage of the young population, becoming NEET has been described as a choice, on a temporary or voluntary basis. These conditions include, for instance, the situation of temporary NEET in which are teenage parents taking care of their children (Contini et al. 2019), which should not be automatically deemed as negative (Simmons and Thompson 2011). Hence, not all NEETs would be at the same risk of social exclusion (Yates and Payne 2006). We remark that voluntary NEETs are counted in the official definition of NEET and contribute to the uncertainty and heterogeneity of the description of this phenomenon. In Italy the rate of NEETs, considering the age range 15–29 years, was at 23.4% in 2018, with huge regional differences (ISTAT 2019): 15.6% in Northern provinces, 19.6% in Central provinces, and 33.8% in Southern provinces (see the Additional file 1). It is worth putting the investigation of the effect of economic/cultural capital on NEET in the Italian context, which is characterized by relevant geographical differences across the country in terms of both economic performance and welfare state. While the ISTAT has long highlighted the different NEET rate between Northern and Southern provinces, there is not extensive literature addressing the possible determinants of this gap, which is generally and primarily attributed to the territorial differences in the economic performance. In addition, Italian provinces have different history, cultural practices, and civic traditions (Putnam et al. 1994). Italy, like France and other Southern European countries (Ferrera 1996), is characterized by a strong welfare system provided by the State. However, with the regionalization process following the 2001 Constitutional reform, a rather marked variability in welfare regimes across Italian regions did emerge, especially as concerns the organization of vocational training. Italy is also a country with a highly regulated labor market and, at least until 1997 (the first time-point for the assessment of economic capital in the present investigation) with scarce development of innovative policies connecting formative tracks with the possibility of finding a job, which may have reflected in high unemployment rates in the young generations (Breen 2005). Three labor market reforms (Treu in 1997; Biagi in 2003; Poletti in 2014) have been approved in order to liberalize temporary jobs and to encourage companies hiring new employees. However, the side effect of these Jobs Acts is that the labor market has been made precarious, especially for young people (Barbieri and Scherer 2009). As a consequence, enterprises have been discouraged from investing in permanent training and specialization (Blanchard et al. 2017). This may have led to the high NEET rate that has been described in Italy in the last 10–15 years. The dynamics underpinning a complex phenomenon like NEET, reflecting scarce accumulation of human capital, should be investigated also keeping into account the putative role of macro-level variables, such as the economic capital, the social capital, and the cultural capital, as well as their interaction with the micro level (Billari 2004). To provide an example, not being employed or in a formative track could also be related to high-level variables like living in familialistic cultures typical of Southern Europe, which in general provide strong support and protection to teenagers when they are not participating in the labor market (Kalmijn and Saraceno 2008). Following the Weberian tradition, individuals do not only belong to a certain social class (mainly reflecting their position in the labor market), but also have a certain status in the society, which reflects participation to a collectivity and is not just a constrained function of social class. In this context, the construct of cultural capital (Bourdieu 1986, 1984, 1970) refers to intellectual and educational factors that could foster social mobility, beyond mere financial security or economic assets (economic capital), and beyond relation, group membership, support (social capital). In this paper we adopt the construct of cultural capital on a larger scale than that originally proposed by Bourdieu, i.e., we measure the cultural capital developed in a certain geographical region at an aggregated level (DiMaggio 1982). Indeed cultural capital can be conceived at a macro-system level (Ford and Lerner 1992), in terms of the possibility offered to the population to participate and being involved in the society and in cultural activities (DiMaggio and Mohr 1985). Bourdieu primarily described cultural capital at an individual or familiar level, as a factor contributing to the social reproduction at a macro-level, in terms, for instance, of intraclass difference; this has been operationalized also in the recent literature on educational outcomes (Tramonte and Willms 2010). There is justification in the sociological literature to embrace a larger view of cultural capital from a multilevel perspective (Reay 2004). This line of thinking can be attributed to Bourdieu himself (Brubaker 1985), who differentiated between embodied, objectified, and institutionalized cultural capital (Bourdieu 1984), and to the sociologist Paul DiMaggio, who clearly distinguished between cultural capital at an individual level, and cultural capital at a macro level, in terms, for instance, of cultural goods produced by a society (DiMaggio 1991). Other authors have already adopted the construct of cultural capital at an aggregate level and from a systemic perspective, for instance in the ecological literature (Berkes and Folke 1994), or in the economic literature in terms of cultural assets (Throsby 1999). In order to put cultural capital in the context of the present investigation, it is worth remarking that it has been shown how, in Italy, this would be very heterogeneous across provinces (Ripamonti and Barberis 2018). Central provinces would attain the highest levels of cultural capital, followed by Northern and Southern provinces. The economic capital, at different levels of aggregation, is an important predictor of educational attainment. Classical studies of developmental psychology and economics of education have documented that, in children, poverty and family income are associated with cognitive development and behavioral patterns (Duncan et al. 1994). The human capital (Becker 1962) of parents, which is a proxy of the economic opportunities for the family members, has been described as a protective factor for pupils in terms of school achievement and better social outcomes (Brooks-Gunn et al. 2006; Janosz et al. 1997). Quality of home and of day care environments, which are strongly correlated to the economic capital at an aggregate level, have also been described to be associated with cognitive abilities and language development (Broberg et al. 1997; Burchinal et al. 1996). Together, these findings highlight the importance of assessing an adverse outcome such as becoming NEET, keeping into account the specific background of the place where teenagers live, especially in terms of the economic performance. Indeed, the literature has shown that the NEET phenomenon is intrinsically related to the structural economic and labor market characteristics. In a study conducted in Ireland, it was clearly demonstrated the connection of the economic recession of 2008 with the NEET rate, despite the general characteristics of this population were basically the same of the pre-crisis society (Kelly and McGuinness 2015). In this line, European statistical institutes have long underlined that the NEET rate is higher in countries with difficulties in the economic performance (e.g., Italy, Greece or Spain) than Germany or Nordic countries. Moreover, in Southern European countries, like Italy, there is an inter-regional gradient with Northern regions outperforming Southern regions in terms of both the economic performance and the NEET rate (ISTAT 2019). While the association between the economic capital and the NEET rate has been reported at a descriptive level, the structural mechanisms underlying these phenomena are far from being clarified. This paper aims to study putative protective factors on the NEET rate through a large-scale and place-based approach, analyzing the role of macro level variables. We pointed to clarify, at a detailed geographical level, the impact of both economic and cultural capital on becoming NEET. A diachronic perspective was employed, assessing cultural capital, economic capital and the NEET rate at three different time points. First, we hypothesized that to high levels of cultural capital in a certain geographical area may correspond valuable cultural opportunities offered to teenagers, and this might promote the development of their cognitive and non-cognitive skills (Heckman and Rubinstein 2001), thus protecting them from becoming NEETs. This prediction also follows from Ripamonti and Barberis (2018), who reported a protective effect of cultural capital on high school dropout, but with relevant differences across Italian provinces. Second, we assumed that living in areas characterized by strong economic performance could have a protective effect on the NEET rate, and we aim to clarify whether such putative effect is of direct type or may be mediated by cultural capital. Third, we aimed to investigate possible mediation effects of cultural/economic capital on the NEET phenomenon.",2

55,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,06 April 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-021-00293-1,Spatial matching on the urban labor market: estimates with unique micro data,December 2021,Marcin Wozniak,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Labor markets are spatial in their nature. In metropolitan areas, people commute to achieve a better-paid or more satisfactory job. Large cities are surrounded by minor counties the function of which is often to provide shelter and basic services to people who work in the city and spend there most of their daytime. However, these surrounding counties are not homogenous, and may strongly differ in their socio-economic development and functions. They formed more or less self-sufficient enclaves that are somehow dependent on its large metropolitan neighbor. The aim of this paper is to investigate spatial relationships on the urban labor market with two concepts: spatial panel matching function models and in-depth spatial correlation analysis. In the research we employed unique data on job vacancies derived directly from the most substantial Polish internet job portals. We focus on the Poznań agglomeration (Poland)—one of the largest metropolitan areas in Poland that consists of 18 counties (LAU level 2). LAU2 (formerly NUTS5) is the smallest administrative unit to divide the territory of the European Union. It includes municipalities, agglomerations or communes (Eurostat). The Poznań agglomeration is one of the largest metropolitan areas in Poland and lies in the east–west line in central west Poland. It is also a workhorse of a regional economy with the dominant industries of construction, services, trade, and logistics. The Poznań agglomeration is also a highly international place with the Amazon distribution warehouse, Volkswagen Factory, Carlsberg, Bertelsmann, among many others. Poznań has a record-breaking low-level of the unemployment rate that dropped to 1.1% in December 2019. As a result, one of the major problems of local employers was worker shortages (Manpower Group 2020). The distance from the central city to the boundaries of the agglomeration does not exceed 25 km. The metropolitan area is connected with the surrounding counties through an extensive railway and bus network. This situation is beneficial to commuters which can travel relatively easy to their workplaces (Bul 2014). It is also worth noting that despite the undoubtful economic domination of the core unit, some small but strong local economic centers can also be pointed out. This is because many large enterprises are located outside the metropolitan area (e.g. in Tarnowo Podgórne, Suchy Las, Kostrzyn, Swarzędz, Czerwonak, Komorniki). Figure 1 presents the geographical location of Poznań and the surrounding counties (Poznań agglomeration). (Source: own elaborations on a basis of OpenStreetMap) Poznań agglomeration (the city of Poznań and 17 neighboring counties) The general theoretical foundations of equilibrium models of spatial labor market matching were laid by Rouwedall (1998) who exceeded the standard sequential job search model (Mortensen 1986) by commuting behavior patterns between residential and employment locations. In the model, an urbanized region with several employment centers was developed. The author proved that spatial relationships affect the behavior of job seekers in terms of excess commuting. Among the most recent papers some general but wide insight into spatial labor market matching was done by Brancaccio et al. (2019) or Wong (2015) in a more modest version. The authors provide some general guidelines to estimating matching functions in several spatial contexts excluding the labor market (e.g. taxis, bike-sharing schemes or shipping). They focus on theoretical assumptions, parametrization and estimation procedures in the case of a Cobb–Douglas matching function with constant returns to scale. The authors underline the universality of the approach and briefly discuss the applications of the mechanism. Some of the more specific works on labor market matching center on Germany and consider various levels of spatial aggregation. Among the most influential research is the paper by Kosfeld (2007). The author focused on German regions and proved that matching function coefficients estimations are not stable over space. In that case, the larger coefficient of a spatial lag in a given region is connected with higher mobility. Among later studies, the paper by Lottmann (2012) needs to be mentioned. The author applies the spatial matching function to the German labor market, makes use of data from 176 labor offices, and provides evidence for spatial dependencies that affect the matching process on German labor markets. The results suggest significant spatial spillovers. This means that regional policy activities have consequences on a wider scale. Other comprehensive study of the German labor markets was done by Haller and Heuermann (2016). They estimate a regional matching function on NUTS3 geographical units and prove positive and significant effects of vacancies on matching. Other similar works that investigate the spatial process on the labor market are those by Fahr and Sunde (2006) for West Germany or Hujer et al. (2009) for the estimation of the effects of labor market programs. Among other countries of focus, one of the most interesting research is that of Manning and Petrolongo (2017). They provide a framework for job search behavior across the markets with a very large number of segments. In fact, the authors used census data on unemployment and vacancies to estimate the matching function across over 8000 wards of UK and Wales. They found that the cost connected with the distance of vacancy was relatively high. They also observed that workers were discouraged from applying for a job if they expected strong competition. Moreover, local policies stimulate the outflow from unemployment but, due to overlapping effects these programs seem ineffective. It is worth mentioning some papers that focus on central and eastern Europe and investigate spatial matching on labor markets. The first is Burda and Profit (1996) who estimate the matching function with a spatial component. Their major finding is that the matching process in a given spatial unit is affected by neighborhoods. The closer the neighborhood the more significant the impact. Among later papers, Dmitrijeva (2008) estimates three specifications of the matching function: a stock-stock matching function, a stock-flow matching function and a spatially augmented stock-flow matching function. The author uses a data on Latvian, Slovenian and Estonian regions to study the search and match process on labor markets. Spatial spillovers exist and are statistically significant in the case of Latvia and Slovenia (estimations for Estonia were not possible due to the structure of available data. As for Poland, the only paper is Antczak et al. (2018). The study provides the comprehensive analysis of labor markets at the LAU-1 (NUTS4) level. The authors developed models of spatial econometrics based on three different specifications of a matching function to investigate how spatial interactions affect the process of matching. They found the evidence of heterogeneity as well as clustering and polarization processes. The authors argue that the role of spatial dependencies in creating an outflow to employment is significant and underline the role of policy measures at regional level. To our best knowledge, the paper presented is the first that deals with the spatial matching function estimation using internet data on vacancies. In addition, we did not find studies on spatial correlation at the low level of spatial aggregation (LAU2) within the EU countries. It is worth mentioning that numerous studies investigate the problem of spatial correlation and the matching process on the labor market. However, the first papers focused mainly on NUTS2 and NUTS4 areas within the EU countries. As the repercussion of this research, the general relevance of spatial interaction was confirmed for several countries, e.g. Spain (López-Tamayo et al. 2000), Finland (Ahtonen 2005), UK, Japan (Kano and Ohta 2005) or USA (Brueckner and Zenou 2003 among many others). The contribution of the paper is therefore twofold. Firstly, we provide a supplementary insight into the research on urban labor markets at the low level of spatial aggregation (LAU2). Such studies are ultimately rare (excluding the paper by Manning and Petrolongo (2017), we did not find any contributions). Secondly, we used a unique microdata set extracted with the developed Web Application Programming InterfaceFootnote 1 (API) script from popular internet job portals and Public Employment Service statistics (PES). The approach is in contrast to the majority of studies that utilize only PES that is highly underestimated in terms of vacancies (e.g. Feng and Hu 2013, Gałecka-Burdziak 2017). Therefore, our data provide a reliable insight into the supply and demand of the local labor market in each of its spatial units and constitute the basis for the analysis. As a result, we extend the knowledge in these fields by adding the in-depth analysis of the urban labor market.",1

Most activities in modern knowledge economies require a certain set of skills, supposedly making the acquisition of the relevant skills a prerequisite for a successful participation in the labor market. In the present paper, I assess the empirical content of this hypothesis by investigating to what extent the skills of a country’s labor force foster employment and prevent unemployment. Human capital is a complex construct. Since the seminal contributions to the human-capital literature by Becker (1964) and by Mincer (1974), years of schooling has remained the predominant measure of human capital. However, conceptual and qualitative differences in educational systems make international comparisons challenging. The contribution of an additional year of schooling to the skills of the students in one country may very well differ from that in another country. Furthermore, while an important role of formal education is to add to the productivity of the students through the formation of skills, some scholars stress the role of education as a signaling device for the productive capacities of applicants or as a rationing device for high-status jobs (Spence 1973; Collins 1979). Achievement tests as a measure of human capital are gaining popularity due to improvements in testing techniques and a broader availability. My analysis is based on the Survey of Adult Skills of the Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), which is an international survey that directly assesses the cognitive skills of the adult population in a growing number of countries. Therefore, I have highly internationally comparable data on key skills in addition to the traditional measures of human capital, e.g., years spent in education. Across the 30 advanced and skill-abundant countries in the sample, I document that skills have a pronounced unconditional correlation with the log-risk-ratio of exiting to entering unemployment irrespective of the specific domain: 0.65 for literacy and 0.68 for numeracy. In contrast, formal education as measured by years of schooling has a modest unconditional correlation with the log-risk-ratio of 0.26. In the multivariate analysis with various country characteristics, cognitive skills remain a key source of the international differences in unemployment flows. The instrumental-variable estimates do not suggest that reverse causality leads to a first-order upward bias. I do not find evidence that the positive relation between skills and the log-risk-ratio of exiting to entering unemployment extends to the seven relatively less advanced and less skill-abundant countries in the sample: Peru, Ecuador, Indonesia, Mexico, Chile, Turkey and Kazakhstan. This paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, I review the related literature. I introduce the data and the econometric model in Sect. 3. This paper’s main findings on international differences in skills and unemployment flows are in Sect. 4. The individual-level analysis of the relation between skills and the risks of entering and exiting unemployment is in Sect. 5. Section 6 draws some conclusions.

According to Eurostat, in 2016 alone around 750,000 refugees relocated to Germany.Footnote 1 Such a significant influx of people has renewed public concerns about the integration of immigrants into society, even influencing voting outcomes in favour of anti-immigration parties (e.g. Dustman et al. 2017; Bratti et al. 2020). Apprehensions regarding refugees and migrants partly stem from cultural differences between migrants and the society of the host country, and partly from the economic burden they may impose on the host country population (Dustmann and Frattini 2014; Fuest 2016, among others). This latter issue is particularly relevant to refugees, since they may begin contributing only in the medium or long term after their assimilation into the labour market is complete; and are often net beneficiaries for a period following their arrival.Footnote 2 In addition, the inflow of migrants may adversely affect the labour market opportunities of directly competing residents in the receiving countries (e.g. Borjas and Monras 2017). Reasoning in the economics of migration literature suggests that migrants are a group of self-selected individuals. Self-selection influences the causes and economic consequences of migration, in particular the labour market achievements of migrants (Borjas 1985; Chiswick 1978). All else equal, higher skilled individuals may assimilate faster into the host country’s society compared to lower skilled individuals. Hereby, the definition of skills is comprised of observable characteristics, such as education, as well as unobserved traits, such as grit, motivation, perseverance or risk preferences.Footnote 3 The Roy-Model of income maximisation predicts that countries with more generous social insurance and benefit systems might attract negatively selected migrants who need more time to assimilate into the host country’s labour market (Borjas 1987, 1999). However, since refugees may differ from economic migrants in several ways, which in turn may affect their economic assimilation, it remains an open question whether and how these considerations apply to refugees. The scant existing international evidence shows contrasting results. Refugees in Sweden and the US have been shown to assimilate faster than other migrants (Luik et al. 2018; Cortes 2004), while the evidence in Norway points to a slower rate of assimilation for refugees (Bratsberg et al. 2014). As a consequence, a lack of information about the relative skill level of current refugees makes it difficult to forecast their economic assimilation prospects within the destination countries (Dustmann et al. 2017). Due to the nature of their displacement–reasons for its occurrence are mostly war, human rights violations or other fatal, unforeseen events–the migration decisions of refugees are presumably less based on economic considerations such as income maximisation. Hence, the selection pattern of refugees may work in two directions; refugees might be more positively or more negatively selected than other migrants from comparable countries of origin. This study contributes to broaden our knowledge on the skill selection of recently arrived refugees, taking advantage of novel survey data for asylum seekers living near the city of Heidelberg (see Lange and Pfeiffer 2019). The survey includes information on the refugees’ own education background and retrospective questions about their parents’ education. Lange and Pfeiffer (2019) showed that, on average, the young male asylum seekers in this sample and their parents received more years of schooling compared to same-aged males from their country of origin. They thus seem to be a positively selected group (relative to their country of origin) with respect to their amount of time in education. Guichard (2020) confirms these findings for asylum seekers in Germany originating from Iraq and Syria based on a representative survey, and finds a neutral pattern of selection for those that fled from Afghanistan. In this analysis our aim is to focus on the unobserved skills of the sample of young male asylum seekers from Lange and Pfeiffer (2019) and propose a novel way to measure them. First, we estimate the degree of intergenerational mobility of the refugees in our sample, specifically their educational improvement in comparison to their parents’ level of education. Then, we compare our estimates with cross-country estimates on the level of educational mobility of similar-aged males in the refugees’ regions of origin. In doing so we are able to disentangle the structural component of educational mobility caused by country level characteristics, such as the expansion of schooling or cultural factors. At the same time we are able to keep the largely unobserved component influencing the relative improvement of individuals with respect to their parents. This unobserved component depends mainly on the transmission of personality traits such as motivation, grit, perseverance or the willingness to take risk in the family (see Dohmen et al. 2012; Kosse and Pfeiffer 2012, among others). Hence, the novel idea is that the difference in the degree of intergenerational mobility should indicate the pattern of self-selection on unobserved skills. Our results show that the refugees in our sample display higher than average relative rates of intergenerational mobility, measured by the association between their own years of schooling and the years of schooling achieved by their parents. Additionally, we estimate the average degree of educational upward mobility, assessed by the probability of refugees to achieve more years of schooling than their parents. We find that refugees from Afghanistan, Iraq, and Sub-Saharan Africa also display higher rates of absolute upward mobility when compared to the same-aged male population in their respective home region. Given our interpretation this finding should be a sign of positive selection on unobservable skills for our sample of refugees. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 briefly summarises the literature on the intergenerational persistence of education. Section 3 provides a detailed description of the data. Section 4 presents and discusses our results. Section 5 concludes.",1

Experimental evidence,December 2021,Christian Koch,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A long-standing question in economics is why wages do not fall in recessions (Fehr and Goette 2005; Bauer et al. 2007; Dickens et al. 2007). Understanding this phenomenon of (downward) wage rigidity is important as it has been shown empirically to be associated with unfavorable labor market outcomes, in particular unemployment (Barwell and Schweitzer 2007; Devicienti et al. 2007; Elsby et al. 2016). A number of explanations of why firms pay wages that are above the market clearing wage and that cannot be easily adjusted downward has been put forward, including e.g. insider-outsider theories (Lindbeck and Snower 1988, Calmfors and Driffill 1988) or (disciplining versions of) the efficiency wage hypothesis (Gintis 1976; Shapiro and Stiglitz 1984).Footnote 1 This study’s focus will be on a fairness explanation of the wage rigidity puzzle that has found support by questionnaire studies interviewing managers (e.g. Blinder and Choi 1990; Campbell and Kamlani 1997; Bewley 1999): When contracts are incomplete, firms partly have to rely on workers’ intrinsic motivation and their fairness concerns. Wage cuts are, however, perceived as unfair by workers and lead to a decrease in work morale. In anticipation, firms do not cut wages. But why do workers perceive wage cuts as unfair even though a recession seems to provide an appropriate reason to cut wages since it limits firms’ abilities to pay high wages? Even standard outcome-based fairness models (e.g. Fehr and Schmidt 1999; Charness and Rabin 2002) predict moderate wage cuts since they enable fair-minded workers to share the recession’s burden that otherwise only the firm would have to bear. Already Akerlof (1982) and Akerlof and Yellen (1990) have suggested, however, that what workers perceive as a “fair wage” might depend—among other thingsFootnote 2—on the wage they previously received, their reference point (Goette et al. 2007; Shafir et al. 1997). While this seems very plausible under stable conditions, it is less clear whether it is also true in a recession. In this study, I experimentally manipulate whether (previous) out-of-recession wages can serve as a reference point, influence what workers perceive as a “fair wage” in recession and, thereby, provide an explanation for rigid wages. In an informative field experiment, Kube et al. (2013) have already shown that exogenous wage cuts have a negative impact on participants’ work morale. Crucially, the authors deliberately cut wages without providing a “good reason” (e.g. recession), and Chen and Horton (2014)—although using a fairly different setting—do not find a negative effect when providing such an explanation. Since significant company-wide wage cuts are rarely observed, empirical evidence is scarce. For the airline industry, Lee and Rupp (2007) find only limited support that wage cuts lower employee effort. A potential explanation is that most of the wage cuts they observe occur under the threat of bankruptcy, providing a justification for the cut. Finally, Bracha et al. (2015, p. 312) have experimentally shown that making a given wage high (or low) relative to past or other wages increases (decreases) labor supply. Crucially, the authors find that providing “even a flimsy rationale” for these differences make the effect disappear.Footnote 3 Although there is, thus, evidence that previous wages can serve as reference points, precisely this evidence cast doubts on whether this is actually true under all circumstances, questioning whether a fairness explanation of wage rigidty is valid for the recession case. Questionnaire and survey studies (Kahneman et al. 1986; Charness and Levine 2002; Kaur 2018) might be consistent with this idea but cannot—due to a lack of control treatments—rule out that wage cuts are rejected for reasons unrelated to reference points: If workers believe that it is the firm that mostly benefits from a boom, they might be generally unwilling to share the burden of the bust because they might perceive the recession as part of the firm’s entrepreneurial risk, completely independent of reference points. Utilizing the strength of the experimental analysis, I test, under tightly controlled conditions, whether one particular explanation of wage rigidity—a fairness explanation (potentially in combination with reference points)—is valid even in times of recession. This is my paper’s core contribution. The main innovation of my design is to manipulate whether out-of-recession wages can serve as reference points inspired by the idea of Hart and Moore (2008) that contracts serve as reference points (see also Herweg and Schmidt 2015). In “real-world” labor markets, contractual arrangements often have to be revised before wage cuts can be implemented. In such a revision, existing contract conditions might be salient and, thus, serve as reference points. I model the labor market as a simple gift-exchange (Fehr et al. 1993). Firms sometimes face a ‘recession’—in terms of a negative profit shock—that ceteris paribus only reduces their profits. Two different treatments manipulate whether (previous) out-of-recession wages can serve as reference points. In the Contracts as Reference Points (CasRP) treatment, workers and firms first conclude a contract before they are informed about whether a recession has occurred in this period. In the recession case, the concluded contract can be revised. Otherwise, initial contract conditions determine payoffs. In this treatment, the initial contract’s wage—which workers explicitly agreed to when accepting a contract offer—potentially serves as a reference point for the revision stage. Implementing such a contract-revision structure deviates from much of the prior literature but provides out-of-recession wages with a realistic shot at serving as reference points. This is not possible in the Baseline (BASE) treatment. Here, firms and workers are first informed about whether a recession has occurred and only afterwards have the ability to conclude a contract. Hence, firms’ contract offers can already take the state of the world into account and no initial contracts exist. The data suggests that wages are neither completely rigidFootnote 4 in CasRP nor in BASE. Wage cuts\(^{4}\) are, however, significantly higher in BASE than in CasRP. Compared to the out-of-recession case, the average wage is reduced by 13.1 points (or 21 percent) in recession in BASE but less than half this amount (6.0 points or 10 percent) in CasRP. In the latter treatment, there is evidence of a reference-point effect: Controlling for the wage level, workers’ effort is lower for wages below the reference wage compared to those at or above this level. This, reference-point effect leads to significant treatment differences: In case wages are cut in CasRP, workers do not share the recession’s burden (as much) as they do in BASE, explaining why firms pay more rigid wages in CasRP. On the basis of these results, I implemented two control treatments. First, the Wages as Reference Points (WasRP) treatment shows that an “objective” justification for feelings of entitlement—an explicit contract agreement—is surprisingly not necessary to induce more rigid wages, highlighting a strength of reference points that has not been observed in previous studies. Second, the Contract as Reference Points treatment with Feedback (CasRP-F) manipulates the firm’s information condition by providing better feedback but does not lead to significant differences, at least on average. Overall, this study provides evidence that is consistent with the idea that reference points shape what workers perceive as a “fair” recession wage in a controlled experimental labor market, providing one explanation for more rigid wages in this setting. My paper may also help to reconcile conflicting results in the experimental literature linked to wage rigidity. As noted before, my study focuses on the revision of contractual arrangements that make reference points salient. In contrast, the earlier literature was primarily concerned with reactions to wage changes relative to earlier periods, where every period featured a “new contract”. In the latter setting, earlier contracts seemed not serve as reference points and Burda et al. (2005), Kocher and Strasser (2011), and Gerhards and Heinz (2017) find that wages are flexible. In contrast, Hannan (2005) uses a setting in which initial wages are revised in recession and workers at least partly seem to punish wage cuts. Notably, since her study does not focus on wage rigidity, it misses control treatments, and it is even unclear how rigid wages overall are in her setting. Finally, Buchanan and Houser (2020) investigate wage rigidity in a setting in which contracts can serve as reference points but do not provide a control treatment in which this is not the case as they focus on employers’ beliefs about workers’ work morale and the distinction between nominal and real wage cuts. My study, thus, complements their research. This study also informs the literature about contracts as reference points, starting with Hart and Moore (2008). Unrelated to wage rigidity, their model mainly analyzes why people write long-term employment contracts by looking at the implications of reference points for different contract types. Fehr et al. (2009, 2011, 2015) experimentally test these implications comparing the performance of different contract types. Bartling and Schmidt (2014) are the first that analyze how initially concluded contracts affect renegotiation via reference-point formation in a buyer-seller relationship. While reference points in their setting constrain sellers to be fair and not to exploit buyers, they have a converse effect in my setting: they encourage workers not to share a part of the recession’s burden by refusing to accept wage cuts and, thus, actually behave less fair-minded than otherwise",1
55,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,28 February 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-021-00287-z,Who and how many can work from home? Evidence from task descriptions,December 2021,Henning Holgersen,Zhiyang Jia,Simen Svenkerud,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Covid-19 pandemic hit the world hard and unprepared. In a study of the Spanish flu, Hatchett et al.(2007) show that non-pharmaceutical interventions known as “social distancing” during a pandemic can significantly reduce the disease transmission and lower both the peak and cumulative excess mortality. Learning from the historical lessons, many countries implemented measures to limit physical contact between people. Encouraging working from home is an important part of such measures. Not all jobs can be performed away from offices. Workers with non-WFH friendly jobsFootnote 1 will be hit harder by such policies, since they are forced into a situation where they have to choose between two unfortunate options: increased risk of infection or substantial economic loss due to lost work opportunities. Similarly, firms and regions with few WFH workers may be more severely impacted than others. Thus, the potential impact of “social distancing” policy and the Covid-19 crisis could be highly unequal. Identifying non-WFH workers would be essential for designing effective economic austerity packages. However, there is rather limited knowledge of the prevalence and characteristics of non-WFH workers. In this paper, we propose a method to answer the question: who and how many can work from home in an economy. For this purpose, we evaluate the WFH feasibility for the 426 occupations listed in the ISCO-08 (International Labor Organization 2012). In particular, respondents from an on-line labor marketplace, Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) (Amazon 2020), are asked to evaluate whether they think occupations can likely be performed from home using the detailed descriptions of tasks to be performed. Based on the responses, we establish a WFH friendly measure for each occupation. Combing these measures with occupational employment statistics, we can obtain information on the prevalence of jobs that can be worked from home. If in addition employment information on individual level is available, we can link workers, jobs and occupations together and identify what type of workers are less likely to have WFH friendly jobs. This method can be easily applied to other economies of interest. In current paper, we focus on Norway and use it as illustrative example. The patterns we find based on Norwegian data may be informative for other industrial countries since the occupational structures in these economies are often similar. We find that approximately 38% of Norwegian jobs can be performed at home. WFH-friendly jobs typically pay better than non-WFH friendly jobs. The prevalence of such jobs varies a lot across geographical areas. There is a larger share of WFH friendly jobs in urban than in rural areas. More importantly, as many worried, workers who are already disadvantaged in the labor market, such as young workers, workers with migrant background, low educated and lone parents, are often less likely to have WFH friendly jobs. We have also combined our WFH friendly measures with country specific employment data from Eurostat and estimated the prevalence of WFH friendly jobs in other European countries. We find that rich and more developed countries have larger shares of jobs that can be performed from home than poor and less developed ones. The rapid development of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has revolutionized the way that work is organized. Many workers can now perform their tasks and connect with their colleagues from any place. The implications of this new way to organize work have been studied extensively. Among them, many studies try to estimate the share of workers that actually work from home. They find that there are relative large differences across different countries, sectors and firms. See for example, studies by Gschwind and Vargas (2019), Lister and Harnish (2019) for an review. Almost all these studies, including the most recent ones (Alipour et al. 2020; Barbieri et al. 2020; Mongey et al. 2020), are based on existing surveys. One exception is a study using US data by Dingel and Neiman (2020). While their main analysis is based on the Occupational Information Network (O*net) surveys with questions covering “work context” and “generalized work activities, they have also tried to manually evaluate WFH feasibility for each occupation themselves. Existing surveys are often designed for other purposes so that information obtained may not directly answer our question of interest. What we are interested in this paper is whether a given job can be potentially worked from home, which in principal depends on only the nature of tasks that need to be performed. These surveys typically provide information on actual incidences of home office, which in addition depend on many contextual factors, such as regulations, working cultures, attitudes of workers and managers and etc. Moreover, the surveys are often implemented some years back which may lead to concerns of timeliness. Considering the rapid technological progress in information technology, this concern may be particularly relevant. On the other hand, new surveys on a representative sample of the working population are costly in term of both time and resource, which makes it not a practical alternative for our purpose. The method we used in this paper is similar to the manual evaluation method applied by Dingel and Neiman (2020). However, we don’t do evaluations ourselves but rely on respondents from MTurk. While we acknowledge that well-designed surveys are still the most reliable source, our study suggests an unconventional data source where reliable information can be easily obtained timely with much less cost. There are clear limitations with our method. For example, the respondents from MTurk are most likely not expert in the field of interest. Or the description of tasks may not be entirely clear. These issues will lead to potential bias in our measure. Although we cannot directly test the reliability of our WFH friendly measures, we have done several consistency checks and we did not find evidence of large bias. We first compare our results with that of Dingel and Neiman (2020). We find that these two measures are very similar on the ISCO-08 major group occupation level (correlation 0.96), although they differ somewhat on the unit group occupation level (correlation 0.65). Dingel and Neiman (2020)’s results also predict a higher share of jobs which can be done from home than ours, but the difference is small (43% vs 38%). In the second attempt to check the consistency of our measures, we compare our results with observed WFH incidence from previous surveys in Norway. There have been two surveys in Norway that include questions on whether the respondents actually work from home: The Norwegian labor force survey in 2017 and a recent survey by the Norwegian Institute of Transport Economics (TØI). Although the actual WFH incidence is not the same as the potential capacity of WFH, their results and ours are are broadly similar. Finally, we use Norwegian job advertisements data published by the Norwegian welfare administration (NAV) between January 2012 and March 2019. Some of these advertisements mentioned possibilities of WFH to attract more candidates. We identify those advertisements and construct the relative frequencies of remote-friendly jobs across 9 major ISCO-08 occupational groups. A comparisons between the observed frequencies and those predicted using our results could be a crude way for quality check. We find that the NAV job ads data provide supports to our WFH friendly measures. While none of these checks can directly prove the reliability of our measure, they do suggest that our measures are consistent with several observable empirical patterns and help relieve the concern on the quality of our measure.",22

Undeniably, corporate revenues can find their way back home via profit repatriation and transfer pricing, and many MNEs enjoy a generous initial tax holiday. However, MNE workers’ wage premium over similar domestic-sector employees in comparable firms directly benefits society, especially if the underlying excess productivity is portable and exerts positive spillover effects. Unlike the returns to capital investment and part of the profit, the wage surplus predominantly remains and is spent in the host country. The literature provides ample evidence to call into question the general validity of such an optimistic scenario. The foreign-domestic wage gap is negligible in countries close to the productivity frontier (Balsvik 2011; Heyman et al. 2007; Andrews et al. 2007; Malchow-Moller et al. 2007). An adverse competition effect often offsets the positive direct impact of FDI on productivity and wages even in relatively undeveloped economies (Aitken and Harrison 1999; Djankov and Hoekman 2000; Konings 2001; Barry et al. 2005). The positive spillovers are often restricted to specific sectors (Keller and Yeaple 2009; Suyanto and Bloch 2014; Fons-Rosen et al. 2017). Still, the existence of a vast MNE premium in the emerging and transition economies (Lipsey and Sjöholm 2004; OECD 2008a; Chen et al. 2017), and the findings of positive spillovers (Smarzynska-Javorcik 2004; Görg and Strobl 2005; Kosová 2010; Poole 2013; Gorodnichenko et al. 2014) encourage us to seek evidence for a ‘knowledge flows’ scenario.Footnote 1 To assess the magnitude of the potentially beneficial impact of FDI, we study the direct and indirect wage effects of work experience in multinational enterprises (MNEs) using linked employer–employee data on skilled workers in Hungary, 2003–2011. We contribute to the literature by empirically showing in a single study that (i) MNEs pay markedly higher wages than similar domestic firms. (ii) MNE employees lose a part of their wage advantage upon leaving the foreign-owned sector. (iii) Even so, they earn more than their colleagues in domestic enterprises. (iv) Domestic firm employees benefit from having ex-MNE peers. We interpret the coincidence of the MNE premium, partial wage loss from separation, lagged returns to MNE experience, and wage spillovers as a signal of knowledge transfer from MNEs to domestic firms. While alternative explanations exist for each of the presented symptoms,Footnote 2 in the last section of the paper we argue that a ‘knowledge flows’ scenario has the best chance to produce all of the four outcomes. Regarding methodology, we draw attention to the difficulties of identification coming from the non-random selection of firms into foreign ownership and of differently skilled workers into foreign enterprises. We find trade-offs between model quality and unbiasedness of the samples on which the first-best models can be estimated. The analysis is based on a big administrative panel data set covering half of the Hungarian population and their employers in 2003–2011. We restrict the analysis to skilled workers for three reasons.Footnote 3 First, the traces of knowledge transfer are easier to find in the skilled labor market. Second, data discussed later suggest that a part of the MNE premium compensates unskilled workers for non-wage disamenities like shift work, weekend work, and a higher probability of becoming unemployed. The data does not indicate ownership-specific differences of this kind among highly skilled workers. Third, repeating the estimations for middling and unskilled workers would triple the statistics to be presented, with minimal added content. Estimation on a pooled sample would only attenuate the relevant parameters. We start by estimating the foreign-domestic wage gap using panel regressions. By gradually removing the effects of observed and unobserved worker and firm characteristics, we get from a substantial raw gap of 0.75 log points to 0.24 points after controlling for worker fixed effects and a mere 0.03 points’ pure ownership-specific wage differential estimated with both worker and firm fixed effects (2FE henceforth). While a 2FE model can answer how an existing firm’s wage level changes in response to a change in ownership, the effect it identifies is unsuitable for out-of-sample prediction. Only 5.3 percent of the observed firms changed the majority owner during the observation period in our sample. These companies paid significantly higher wages than ‘always domestic’ firms (when they were domestic) and significantly lower wages than ‘always foreign’ companies (when they were foreign-owned): this is how the 2FE model arrives at a close-to-zero estimate of the ownership-specific wage gap. These firms’ experience can hardly predict how big MNEs like Mercedes-Benz or IBM would pay their employees in the unlikely event of takeover by a local business person. It also tells nothing about the potential wage gains from greenfield investments, which played a significant role in the 1990s (Calderon et al. 2004).Footnote 4 We utilize a difference-in-difference estimation of wage gains from joining a new MNE over joining a new domestic firm to learn about the ownership-specific wage gap between ‘always foreign’ and ‘always domestic’ companies. This approach suggests that the employees of new MNEs earn 15 percent more than their domestic counterparts. Turning to the MNE premium’s portability, we have to deal with endogeneity and ability biases, as worker mobility is not random. If a worker is fired from an MNE, it may be because her marginal product is lower than average. If a domestic employer attracts a worker, it may be because she has a higher-than-average marginal product irrespective of the sector of employment. To address the first problem, we compare domestic firm employees with recent MNE experience to their peers who had outside experience in the domestic sector. We focus on workers losing or leaving their jobs in times of mass dismissals when separations are more likely to be exogenous to the individual worker’s productivity. The model controls for heterogeneity of the sending firms via observable controls and use fixed effects for the receiving ones. We find that former MNE employees earn more by 13 percent than similar workers coming from collapsing domestic enterprises. Workers separating from their employers for reasons other than mass dismissals acquire a significantly lower (5 percent) lagged MNE premium. Satisfactory model quality comes at the cost of distortions in the sample and a significant loss of observations in this case, too. Only about 7 percent of the person-months in our data makes it to the estimation sample of a model in which work histories and characteristics of the sending and receiving firms are adequately controlled. The problem would be further aggravated by the inclusion of worker fixed effects to reduce ability bias.Footnote 5 To avoid this issue while utilizing more data and still controlling for the potential bias, we rely on a less demanding ‘overlapping cohorts’ model that compares domestic firm employees with future and past experience in foreign versus domestic firms. This model can utilize a much broader sample, as workers with only two observed spells can contribute to the estimation if any of those is at a foreign-owned employer. The estimated return to prior MNE experience amounts to 0.07 log points.Footnote 6 Finally, we estimate spillover effects for incumbent domestic firm employees, controlling for observed and unobserved worker and firm characteristics. We deviate from a similar attempt by Poole (2013) in two ways. First, we also study how skilled incumbents’ wages respond to the presence of less qualified ex-MNE peers. Second, and more importantly, we address the selection problem that arises when the analysis is restricted to incumbents (domestic workers with no experience outside their firms). Incumbents in our data account for only 22 percent of the workers ever employed in the domestic sector. Their exposure to peers with MNE experience differs substantially from that of the average worker. In an alternative specification, we ensure the identification of within-firm spillovers using a 2FE model. We find that a one-standard-deviation difference in the share of high skilled ex-MNE peers shifts peers’ wages with no MNE past up by slightly more than one percent. Having qualified peers with outside experience in the domestic sector and having low-skilled peers with MNE experience do not affect wages. Section 2 discusses previous findings on the paper’s topic and prewarns the reader of our estimates. Section 3 introduces the data and the local context. Section 4 is devoted to the study of the foreign-domestic wage gap. Sections 5 and 6 present the results on lagged returns and spillover effects, respectively. Section 7 briefly comments on differences by skill levels and industries. Section 8 sums up the results and argues that the empirical findings, taken together, yield support to a ‘skills diffusion’ scenario.",4

Yet the medium-term future of skilled employment has become especially uncertain. After the global massification of higher education participation (Marginson 2016), the proportion of tertiary-educated labour in the world’s labour forces has been rising inexorably. Graduate underemployment—also termed ‘overeducation’, and first posed as a risk in the United States during the 1970s (Freeman 1976)—has become a world-wide issue, especially in those many countries where governments in the 1990s and 2000s allowed higher education enrolments to expand rapidly, unconnected institutionally or economically to the more steady demands of their country’s labour markets (Habibi 2019). In the twenty-first century, even without an acceleration in tertiary enrolments, some have detected renewed risk in a deceleration in the demand for high-skilled labour along with the apparent maturity of ICT as a general purpose technology (Beaudry et al. 2016); others portray this maturity of ICT as a world in which managers are able to re-organise labour processes through ‘digital Taylorism’, deskilling and intensification of graduate labour, except for that of a minority of elite graduates trained in globally-oriented universities (Brown et al. 2004). Still others envisage a future for work dominated by Artificial Intelligence (AI) (British Academy and the Royal Society 2018). The assumption that the large majority of tertiary graduates are guaranteed high-skilled jobs appears to be no longer valid in many countries. Already, by 2011, roughly one in three university graduates of all ages were working in non-graduate jobs in many OECD countries (Green and Henseke 2016b). In these circumstances, while many universities and colleges have come to focus on their employability teachings, and their careers and related services, their graduates’ prospects for utilising their qualifications and skills rest to a considerable extent on the uncertain trajectory of national graduate labour markets. We ask in this paper: is gaining a tertiary degree becoming, over the medium term, a less fruitful channel to success in the labour market? Unfortunately, evidence for a sufficiently broad coverage of countries to form an overview tends to be scarce. Excess supply over demand, potentially of concern to a whole generation of students, may vary sharply between countries. Our focus is on Europe in the decade leading up to 2015, in part owing to the availability of recent data suitable for studying graduate underemployment trends in a significant number of disparate countries with distinctive education systems and labour markets. Europe is also of interest because of the EU’s expressed objective of ‘upward convergence’ in several socio-economic domains, including tertiary education. Thus, an important supplementary question is whether there is evidence of convergence between national graduate labour markets: if there is convergence, a future is suggested for laggard countries; if there is persistent variation or cumulative divergence, the analysis may indicate scope for beneficial policy-learning in low-performing countries, but also provides a warning signal that the important objective of social cohesion across the European Union (Eurofound 2019) is not being achieved in this domain. At the outset, we recognise that a graduate labour market is not expected to swiftly reach an equilibrium. The possibility that supply can diverge significantly from demand, and for long durations without significant behavioural adjustments, necessitates an examination of both graduate wages and indicators of demand alongside supply. We study the growing supplies of tertiary graduates, the evolution of high-skilled jobs and graduate underemployment (where graduates work in non-graduate jobs), and key trends in graduate wages: the average real wage, the wage premium of graduates over non-graduates, and the wage penalty suffered by graduates who become underemployed.",18
55,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,23 January 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-020-00283-9,Cyclicality of labour market search: a new big data approach,December 2021,Christian Hutter,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Standard search and matching theory (e.g. [21]) states that labour market matches are formed using unemployed and vacancies, and an efficiency parameter describing how well unemployed and open positions form matches. In this context, the efficiency parameter covers a range of factors such as mismatch [11, 22] or information and institutions. A key ingredient of matching efficiency, however, is the behaviour of the relevant agents: Whether people get into work, for example, depends crucially on how intensively unemployed look for jobs and how much effort employers make when trying to fill an open position. This behaviour can be described as search intensity. A further crucial factor of matching efficiency is flexibility and the willingness to make some compromise during the search for a job or a suitable candidate. Beyond job seekers and employers, a further agent is present in the labour market: the employment service (see e.g. [10]). The activities of the intermediary between the two sides can have an impact on how quickly unemployed and vacancies come together. In many countries, the public employment service is the central point of contact for unemployed and firms as it provides support to form matches between both market sides. However, while there are some studies on search intensity of unemployed [5, 20] and firms [2, 3], there are no empirical measures of placement intensity of employment agencies so far, despite its importance. In Germany, for instance, the relevance of this intermediary showed itself during the COVID-19 crisis, when it was impossible for employment agencies and job centers to pursue their usual placement activities under corona conditions due to other priorities such as massively increasing short-time work. This paper contributes to the literature by measuring search intensity using a source of big data that directly captures online activity: It evaluates how often the job exchange website of the German Federal Employment Agency (FEA) and its placement platform have been accessed by job seekers and firms for search activities. In this context, “big data” refers to the millions of visits per month on the FEA’s online job exchange that are processed and transformed into aggregate search measures in this paper. Furthermore, it takes a closer look on the average search perimeter from the job seekers’ search profiles which they can submit on the online job exchange platform. The idea is that a higher search radius could signal a higher willingness to make some compromise so that it can serve as a potential proxy for the job seeker’s flexibility. As a counterpart to search intensity, the notion of placement intensity of the labour market intermediary is introduced. The data at hand allow—for the first time—measuring placement activity of employment agencies. For this purpose, online activity at VerBIS, the FEA’s internal placement software, is exploited. With this software, employment agents perform genuine placement activities. For instance, they screen the labour market to find suitable candidates for job openings (or vice versa) and generate a placement proposal. To my knowledge, the placement activities of employment services have not yet been investigated. Consequently, having a measure of the central matching process on the labour market is all the more valuable. A central contribution is to empirically analyse important time variation properties of the novel search activity measures. This extends previous literature: While [1], for instance, find matching efficiency as a whole to be procyclical, this paper aims to investigate the cyclical behaviour of several key factors of matching efficiency: firms’ and job seekers search intensity, placement intensity, as well as job seekers’ search perimeter. Several studies analyse job seekers’ search intensity (e.g. [5, 20]). Moreover, [3] consider recruiting intensity of firms and find procyclical recruitment intensity. Employers increase their hiring efforts in stronger, and thus tighter, labour markets in order to fill their positions. In contrast, search intensity of the unemployed is often found to be countercyclical. While lower chances to receive a job offer in times of labour market slackness should discourage search, the fact that search must be intensified in downturns to compensate for lower job arrival rates works in the opposite direction [19]. Furthermore, if average characteristics worsen during economic booms, countercyclicality could be reinforced [20]. While there is at least some ambiguity in the literature on the cyclical behaviour of search intensity, the intermediary’s behaviour in the course of a business or labour market cycle has not been investigated so far. One could think of several mechanisms at work here. If a tighter labour market requires employment agents to more intensively support firms in their search for suitable candidates, placement intensity could behave procyclically. By contrast, the agency might intensify support for unemployed and placement activities in times of economic downturn. Characteristics of the unemployed could play a role, too. If, for example, there are more unemployed with low job opportunities, the agency might intensify support, especially for difficult cases. However, this could then come at the expense of support for “easier” cases, given a limited working time of the employment agents. In the end, the cyclical behaviour of the search and placement activities is an empirical question that will be investigated in this paper. In a comprehensive explorative investigation using correlation and regression analysis, the study contrasts search and placement activities with GDP and labour market tightness. The results show that firms and employment agencies display pro-cyclical search patterns. By contrast, job seekers’ search intensity and search perimeter increases during times of weaker economy and labour market. In general, the cyclical behaviour is confirmed also when a broad set of control variables is included in the regressions. Beyond the cyclical movements, the paper also analyses the seasonal patterns of the search and placement activities. They might provide explanations for seasonal patterns in aggregate unemployment or employment. The results show that the seasonal patterns closely align with the main holiday seasons in winter and (to a less pronounced extent) in summer, and with the vocational training cycle. The paper is structured as follows: The next section focuses on how the novel data are obtained. Section 3 discusses theoretical considerations. Section 4 presents the results on cyclicality and seasonality. Section 5 focuses on search and placement during the COVID-19 pandemic. The final section concludes.",4

In 2017, they accounted for about 6% of university enrolments across the OECD, but their share was as high as 47% in Luxembourg and about 20% in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom (OECD 2019a – Figure B6.1). In the same year, international students enrolled in large numbers in several non-OECD countries too, including China (1.1%) and India (0.8%) (OECD 2019b ibid). This ‘migration for education’ phenomenon is noteworthy (Tani and Piracha 2022): on the one side, it has propelled the tertiary sector into becoming a major generator of export revenues. On the other, it has influenced the international transfer of human capital between countries of origin and destination, and the skill composition of migration flows. Foreign students contribute to the rapid increase of tertiary-educated migrants (Freeman 2010; Docquier and Rapoport 2012), besides adding to patenting activity, entrepreneurship (Hunt and Gauthier-Loiselle 2010; Hunt 2011; Roach et al. 2019), international collaborations (Jonkers and Cruz-Castro 2013; Scellato et al. 2015; Carillo et al. 2013; Freeman et al. 2014), and economic activity at large (Ackers 2005). The economic effects of foreign students are the subject of broad analyses of skilled migration (OECD 2001, 2008 and 2018) and higher education (OECD 2019b; Zhou et al. 2008; Crawford and Wang 2016). However, little is known about the graduates staying on in the country of education as skilled migrants, and how they fare relative to comparably educated natives. This particular flow of highly trained individuals is worth studying not only for its association with desirable economic outcomes but also for shedding light on fundamental questions about the potential role of host country education in reducing the loss of human capital typically experienced by migrants (Chiswick and Miller 2009). An apparent contradiction characterises the economic outcomes of highly educated migrants. Several studies show that emigrants are positively selected. In other words, they are better motivated (Borjas 1987 and 1991; Grogger and Hanson 2011) and educated than those left behind (Carrington and Detragiache 1998 and 1999; Docquier and Marfouk 2004; Docquier et al. 2005) and those returning to the country of origin (DaVanzo 1983; Gibson and McKenzie 2009; Dustmann and Kirchkamp 2002). They are also more educated and motivated than the natives of their respective host countries (Docquier et al. 2014). However, they are more likely to experience ‘over-education’ (Hartog 2000; Groot and van der Brink 2000; Leuven and Oosterbeek 2011): they earn lower wages and work in jobs requiring less education than what is consistent with their qualifications, especially if they are highly educated (Piracha et al. 2012; Tani 2020). Such poor labour market outcomes have been attributed to employers’ possible distaste for foreigners (Becker 2010) or their unawareness about the signal value of education completed abroad (Altonji and Pierret 2001; Tani 2017). While adding a formal recognition of foreign qualifications helps migrants improve their labour market prospects (Friedberg 2000), it remains unclear whether graduating and working in the host country puts them at par with natives in terms of wages and job quality: is this the case? This paper helps to fill this knowledge gap by comparing the labour market outcomes of native and foreign students graduating from doctoral (PhD) programmes. Addressing this question is relevant for understanding the determinants of the returns to the most intensive investment in education, and the main source of labour supply for research-intensive employers in academia, government, and parts of the business sector (Hayter and Parker 2019; Garcia-Quevedo et al. 2012; Sauermann and Roach 2012). There are several reasons to restrict the analysis to graduates with PhDs only rather than including other tertiary-educated graduates. The main one is that the characteristics of students, study programme, and job opportunities for PhD graduates are less heterogeneous than that experienced at lower levels of education. This may limit the bias arising from unobserved heterogeneity—i.e. the set of factors that influence the outcome of interest but cannot be, or are not, measured. In a PhD programme, students tend to develop specialist skills and knowledge that appeal to a relatively limited range of types of people: namely those with interest, motivation, and predisposition for research and detailed work (Wächter 2004; Schneider 2013). This differs from the case of lower levels of education, like Masters and Bachelor degrees, where the variety of student types is wider and the skills developed tend to be generic and suitable for an extensive range of occupations (Beertsen 2006; Cumming 2010). Notwithstanding the self-selection occurring in the choice of doctoral studies, the narrow set of student types and job opportunities lends support to the prior that the determinants of labour market outcomes at PhD level, and any emerging differences between natives and foreigners, are less influenced by unobserved heterogeneity and corresponding estimates less affected by bias. Other reasons to focus on PhDs is a labour market with effectively full employment (e.g. OECD 2019b—Table B7.5), and a market where the signal value of education is well understood: for instance, an employer gauging the potential productivity of two identical candidates aside from their nationality is unlikely to value differently the PhDs if they are awarded in the same discipline by the same institution. If the employer offered different salaries then other reasons, which could be precisely identified depending on the availability of data, would be at play. This paper contributes to verifying this possibility. In focusing on PhD graduates this paper contributes to the relatively small literature that links foreign graduates and migrationFootnote 1—notwithstanding the general interest in PhD graduates’ mobility (Auriol 2007; Solimano 2008; Freeman 2010). Existing literature traditionally studies doctoral programmes from an educational standpoint namely, as formative training for subsequent employment (Mangematin and Mangran 1998; Mangematin 2000; Lissoni 2012) in a global labour market (Auriol et al. 2013; De Grip et al. 2010). PhD graduates’ outcomes are the focus of more recent work, which views the emergence of temporary and casual post-doctoral positions (Stephan and Ma 2005) as the result of an over-supplyFootnote 2 of PhD students (Cyranoski et al. 2011). This stream of research also highlights that more competitive conditions in the academic labour market may have prompted many PhDs to find employment outside the university sectorFootnote 3 (Su 2013). Overall, foreign-born PhD graduates experience the worst outcomes in terms of job quality and salary. While situated at the intersection of education, migration, and labour market research this paper studies the returns to a PhD degree using the case of Australia, adding to a limited literature (Harman 2002; Neumann et al. 2008). Australia is one of the most popular destinations for international PhD students (40% of PhD graduates are foreigners versus 25% across the OECD). Australia also uses migration policy to openly attract applicants with tertiary and higher education, and this raises valid reasons to compare outcomes between natives and foreigners completing identical degrees in the country. The empirical analysis is based on data sourced from the Graduate Destination Survey (GDS). This is a comprehensive educational and employment survey carried out by each university. The GDS has a set of universal questions, which are commonly asked across universities (e.g. student profile, occupational outcomes), and a set of optional questions, which are chosen by each university and cannot be compared across the sector. The data used cover the universal questions for the period 1999–2015, a time of significant developments in the tertiary sector and the overall economy in Australia (Ranasinghe 2015): they include the years of rapid increase in the enrolment of international students (early 2000s), eased by favourable legislative changes that enabled the use of schooling in lieu of local employment to apply for permanent residence (subsequent changes in the next decade restricted this migration pathway). The period also includes the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), which negatively affected hiring decisions and wage growth since 2008. One distinctive feature of the empirical analysis is the classification of native and foreign students into those with an English-Speaking Background (ESB) and those with a Non-English Speaking Background (NESB), respectively. This distinction captures the multicultural nature of Australia’s population, as identified by answer to what language is mostly spoken at home (https://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/1289.0), and the fact that people often identify with and maintain the language and culture of their places of origin even if they are ‘natives’ overall.Footnote 4 The ESB/NESB distinction is common in Australian statistics, but in the context of this paper doing so offers novel insights on the returns to education between various sub-groups of the student population. As Australia allows dual citizenship, it is not possible to rely on indicators of nationality or country of birth to clearly distinguish natives from foreigners. This problem is overcome by using university fees, where the categories for domestic and international students do not overlap. Combined with information about each student’s cultural background, as recorded by the GDS using the question on language spoken at home, this approach yields a well-defined taxonomy of mutually exclusive categories of PhD graduates in Australia:: (i) native ESB, (ii) native NESB; (iii) foreign ESB, and (iv) foreign NESB. The GDS unfortunately neither includes indicators of personality or individual preferences, nor schooling performance (e.g. grades, publications during the PhD), duration of the PhD, or whether any prior education was completed in Australia. This potential source of bias is formally tested using the methodology developed by Oster (2019). This test suggests that the results are robust to omitted variable bias. The empirical analysis is based on PhD graduates in the age group 25–45 in line with international practice (e.g. OECD 2019 – Table B7.2). The initial focus is on the difference in starting wages between the control (native ESB) and the other three groups (native NESB, foreign ESB and NESB, respectively) using the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition (Jann 2008). Regression analysis is then applied to estimate the influence of individual and institutional characteristics on an expanded set of labour market outcomes that includes hours of work, over-education, and the probability of working in a full-time job. The results reveal that there is no difference in the average starting salary of native and foreign PhD graduates, but this masks substantive differences in the contribution of observed and unobserved components. Native ESB are always paid less than any other sub-group on the basis of the observed characteristics (between 2.2 and 6.3%). This occurs because of a higher share of women and part-time workers in this group. The native ESB’s wage penalty is completely offset when the unobserved component is added up—that is when one takes into account features that are not included in the regressions (see Sect. 4) such as the structure of the labour market, pay rates across industries, and employers’ preferences. These factors can nevertheless result in identical people being paid differently across sectors. Further analysis reveals that the offsetting influence of unobserved variables, which the literature typically refer to as ‘discrimination’ (e.g. Oaxaca and Ransom 1994), varies by field of study: it is prevalent among graduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), while there is no effect for ESB native graduates in other fields of study. No wage penalty is detected in the case of Medicine, Dentistry and Health except for the comparison of ESB-NESB natives, where ESB natives enjoy a 7.2% premium entirely due to the unobserved component. This result occurs almost exclusively at the higher end of the wage distribution, suggesting that unobservable characteristics become more relevant determinants of pay once standard requirements have been met. ESB natives do not have such an advantage in average- and low-paying jobs. The regression analysis also shows that NESB foreign PhDs have the worst labour market outcomes among the four groups of graduates: they work fewer hours, are less likely to work in a full time occupation, and have the highest probability for looking for another job. This sub-group is the most likely to work in the university sector. These results highlight the apparent contradiction between benefiting from international PhD students and being unable or unwilling to offer these graduates alternative career opportunities. While both universities and foreign PhDs may find this arrangement suitable, it is unclear whether the status quo may negatively affect the learning experience of students at a lower level of tertiary education (who are commonly taught or tutored by seasonal PhD graduates). More data are required to provide an answer. Overall, acquiring education in the host country is far from putting foreigners and natives on equal pay, even when students complete the same, and highest possible, degree of formal education. There are reasons to question whether this situation is sustainable in the long-term without compromising universities’ reputation and their ability to keep attracting high quality international students. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 discusses the methodology. Section 4 presents the results. Section 5 concludes.",
56,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,13 November 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-022-00325-4,"COVID-19, normative attitudes and pluralistic ignorance in employer-employee relationships",December 2022,Martin Abraham,Matthias Collischon,Tobias Wolbring,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Employment relationships are not only economic exchange relationships, they are also embedded in society and thus shaped by the normative attitudes of employees, employers and other actors (Granovetter 1985). These attitudes encompass, among others, concerns about fairness, reciprocity or authority, and they influence behaviour beyond the direct costs/benefit of an exchange relationship (Akerlof 1982; Fehr et al. 1998). At the aggregate level, normative attitudes manifest themselves in social norms (Bicchieri 2006) and shared ideas about how to behave, which people feel obliged to obey (Bicchieri 2006, 2017). Usually, social norms are enforced by means of positive or negative sanctions such as social recognition or disapproval (Posner and Rasmusen 1999). However, the internalization of social norms can also create incentives for norm compliance, as the violation of internalized norms can lead to negative feelings, such as shame, regret and a bad conscience (Maibom 2010). Labour market research has neglected this normative embeddedness of employment relationships to some extent. Experimental studies have clearly documented the power of social norms such as fairness and reciprocity for human behaviour in general (e.g., Fehr and Schmidt 2006) and have also demonstrated their relevance in labour market contexts (e.g., Charness 2004). There is, however, little empirical research on how such general normative principles translate into more specific, local normative expectations regarding behaviour in the workplace. Likewise, little is known about how they change over time. In times of an economic or social crisis, when social norms often adjust to changing circumstances, existing conflicts may intensify or new conflicts might arise. For example, the COVID-19 crisis has very likely led to a temporary or even permanent rearrangement of social norms concerning core topics at the workplace, such as working at home, short-time work, and the sharing of private information. Based on the general theoretical argument that social norms can contribute to solve collective problems (Coleman 1990; North 1991), it can be argued that the pandemic led to a specific demand for social norms at the workplace. However, the pandemic also raised tensions between different interests, such as maintaining productive workflows, ensuring employees’ health, and considering private responsibilities. Thus it is unclear whether norms supporting the interests of one group will be rejected by those who have to bear the costs for this solution. Taking advantage of this rather rapid shift in attention towards workplace-related norms, our study examines normative attitudes towards a selected set of behaviours that received particular public attention in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. To our knowledge, this is the first study to address this topic. Specifically, we look at attitudes towards the assignment and compensation of short-time work, the opportunity to work from home, and the sharing of private information on employees’ vacation destination with the employer. All four examples are specifically interesting because they are dealing with behaviour that has the potential to buffer the effects of the pandemic on employees and/or employers. At the same time, the four norms address conflicting interests since the behaviour imposes either costs on the employer or the employee (by reducing privacy). Due to these conflicting interests of employers and employees, these examples enable us to investigate if those asymmetric interests lead to different normative attitudes. Therefore, we distinguish between employees with and without supervisory functions, assuming that the latter group represents the interests of employers, at least to a certain extent. First, we ask whether there are consistent patterns for a majority of respondents, indicating that there exist social norms on this subject (RQ1). Second, we explore whether and to what extent there is a misalignment of normative attitudes between employees and supervisors (RQ2). If supervisors support a norm less often than employees do, this is a source of potential conflict in the employment relationship (Görges and Nosenzo 2020). Third, we look at differences between respondents’ average attitudes and the attitudes they expect to exist in the population (RQ3). This will allow us to identify whether and to what degree people overestimate support for a social norm. This is important because under such circumstances, people may contribute to the upholding of the norm even if they do not support the norm itself. This behaviour is also known as pluralistic ignorance (Shamir and Shamir 1997). We examine whether and to what degree such pluralistic ignorance occurs in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. By answering these questions, we shed light on the role of norms for employment relationships. Norms guide what is adequate behaviour and, thus, have the potential to regulate conflicts. However, this requires that not only a sufficient number of people support a norm (RQ1), but that the relevant type of actors also agree on the norm (RQ2). Finally, if individuals overestimate the support of a norm (RQ3), this can help to uphold the norm in the short run, but may lead to problems in the long run in case people learn about that fact. Based on the empirical results from a large-scale, representative sample of labour market participants in Germany, we show that most respondents hold similar normative attitudes regarding the obligations of employers and employees in times of the COVID-19 crisis. Depending on the specific question (see Appendix  for the original questions), 60 to 80 percent of the respondents agree or somewhat agree with the following statements: i) Companies should avoid introducing short-term work as long as their financial resources allow them to avoid doing so; ii) If they utilize short-time work, they should top up the short-time allowance that employees receive from unemployment insurance; iii) Employers should give employees (especially those with children) the opportunity to work from home even if not all tasks can be completed there; and iv) Employees should disclose the location of their last vacation to their employer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, regarding short-time work and private information about the last vacation, the results suggest that there is a tendency for pluralistic ignorance in favour of employee rights. Many respondents, also supervisors, seem to overestimate the extent of agreement in the population with attitudes that strengthen the position of the employee. These results support the idea that employment relationships are regulated by social norms. This regulation is particularly important in times of crisis since it reduces tensions, conflicts and insecurities. The next section provides a short review of the literature dealing with the role of norms in employment relationships, which is the basis for our theoretical and empirical analysis.",

Sakshaug,Stefan Zins,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the world and not only changed the lives of many individuals, but also forced establishments to adjust their behavior. Establishments were severely affected by lockdowns, containment regulations, home office recommendations, and unprecedented supply and demand shocks. All of these aspects led to changes in operational activities, the introduction of new organizational routines, or the (temporal) closure of entire establishments (e.g. Brinca et al. 2020; Donthu and Gustafsson 2020). Especially in these dynamic times, establishment survey data are used to form the basis for policy decisions and are heavily used in scientific research. The IAB-Job Vacancy Survey (IAB-JVS) is one example of an ongoing establishment survey that was fielded and analyzed for policy briefing publications during the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Gürtzgen and Kubis 2021). This voluntary and nationwide establishment survey captures the number and structure of job vacancies, as well as detailed information about recruiting processes from up to 14,000 respondents in Germany each year (Bossler et al. 2020). In 2020, it also covered various items on COVID-19 including layoffs due to the pandemic and receipt of government subsidies. It is reasonable to expect that the COVID-19 pandemic not only affected substantive measures, but also participation in voluntary establishment surveys. For instance, closure of entire establishments or reduced working hours might negatively affect the ability of establishments to take part in a survey. Some establishments had to develop new processes for handling survey requests as their pre-pandemic routines couldn’t be executed. However, there are also reasons to expect that the pandemic might have had a positive impact on survey participation, for example, establishments which are dealing with smaller workloads may have more availability to respond to survey requests. There may also be greater motivation to express their opinions about the crisis and the government-imposed regulations. In addition, establishments receiving government benefits (e.g. short-time work subsidies) might feel more obligated to participate in a government-sponsored survey. If the pandemic affected the survey participation behaviour of establishments, then nonresponse bias might also be affected, perhaps more so compared to previous years. Nonresponse bias adversely impacts data quality and, hence, threatens the validity of substantive analyses of economic indicators and substantive phenomena derived from the collected data (e.g. Lineback and Thompson 2010; Thompson and Oliver 2012). For this reason, investigations of nonresponse bias are important for assessing the quality of establishment survey data (e.g. Lineback and Thompson 2010; Earp et al. 2018; König et al. 2021; Küfner et al. 2022).Footnote 1 This study analyzes survey participation and nonresponse bias in the IAB-JVS during the COVID-19 pandemic by accomplishing four research objectives. First, we analyze fieldwork effort and survey participation outcomes (response rates, contact rates, cooperation rates) in the three quarterly reinterviews of the IAB-JVS that were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 compared to the two preceding (non-pandemic) years of 2019 and 2018. Second, we examine the magnitude of nonresponse bias in 2020 compared to the preceding years of 2019 and 2018. Nonresponse bias is assessed for multiple variables, including the COVID-19 short-time work subsidy (or “Kurzarbeit”)Footnote 2. Third, we examine whether COVID-19 related measures, such as short-time work, containment regulations, regional information about COVID-19 incidence rates, and mobility reduction were strong predictors of establishment survey participation, and whether general predictors of survey participation changed in 2020 compared to previous years. Fourth, we evaluate the performance of the current IAB-JVS weighting adjustment scheme relative to a new weighting adjustment scheme based on extensive administrative data for reducing nonresponse bias during the pandemic year of 2020 compared to previous years. Additionally, we test whether nonresponse bias adjustments in 2020 could be improved by including COVID-19 related auxiliary variables in the weighting procedure. In summary, this study addresses the following research questions: RQ1: Did fieldwork and participation outcomes in the IAB-Job Vacancy Survey differ in 2020 (i.e. the COVID-19 year) compared to previous years? RQ2: Did nonresponse bias differ in 2020 (i.e. the COVID-19 year) compared to previous years? Was the key survey variable, receipt of short-time work benefits, affected by nonresponse bias? RQ3: To what extent did survey participation patterns differ during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous years? Are COVID-19 related variables strong predictors of establishment survey participation in 2020? RQ4: To what extent do nonresponse adjustment weights reduce nonresponse bias in 2020 (i.e. the COVID-19 year) compared to previous years? Does the performance of the weights improve by incorporating additional administrative and COVID-19 related variables into the weighting scheme? Answers to these questions are not only important for the IAB-JVS, but also for establishment surveys in general. With this analysis, we contribute to the literature by providing evidence on whether establishment survey participation and the composition of respondents changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study also provides indications on whether establishment surveys may benefit from revising their weighting scheme to include additional auxiliary variables (e.g. COVID-19 specific) to counteract the risk of nonresponse bias. In addition, the proposed analysis may serve as a blueprint for other establishment surveys on how to evaluate and address nonresponse bias during the COVID-19 pandemic. The balance of this article is structured as follows. In Sect. 2 , we briefly review the relevant literature related to the research aims. Section 3 describes the used data sources and proposed methods. The results are presented in Sect. 4 . In Sect. 5 the findings of the study and their practical implications for survey researchers are discussed and the results are summarized in Sect. 6.",

The most common destination for departing Venezuelan migrants is Colombia. According to official statistics, there were nearly 1.8 million of Venezuelans living in Colombia in 2019, as a consequence of the Venezuelan economic and political crisis, which represents an increase in the share of Venezuelans living in Colombia relative to the national population from 0.07% in 2015 to 3.6% approximately in 2019. This significant episode of migration represents a challenge to policymakers who seek to understand and quantify the potential economic and social effects of such a massive inflow of immigrants, especially for host countries like Colombia. In this paper, I exploit the Venezuelan exodus in order to understand the migratory episode’s effect on the Colombian labor market. I implement a differences-in-differences methodology and conduct my analysis by considering the level of exposure across Colombian departments to this exogenous labor supply shock, before and after 2016 (i.e. 2013-2019). In 2016 a significant and unexpected migratory influx of Venezuelans to Colombia took place when the borders between the two countries were reopened after nearly a year of closure. My estimates suggest that the intensification of the migratory flow of Venezuelans beginning in mid-2016 generated a significant drop in aggregate wages and in the employment rate of low-skilled workers in Colombia. An increase in 1 percentage point (p.p.) of the labor force due to the inflow of Venezuelans generated a 0.4% decrease in wages and a 0.1 p.p. decrease in employment for low-skilled workers; this effect on employment represent a decrease of 0.18% relative to the average employment rate of low-skilled Colombian workers in 2015, before the Venezuelan exodus. When I estimate these effects for Colombian departments located on the border with Venezuela (La Guajira and Norte de Santander), results illustrate that the declines in wages and employment for all workers were approximately 10% and 3.4 p.p. (a decrease of 5.6% on employment relative to 2015 average employment), respectively, after the border was re-opened. In order to estimate the effect of migration on these two border departments, I construct a control group using three departments of Colombia that were not strongly affected by immigration and displayed, on average, similar trends in terms of labor market variables and had similar socio-demographic characteristics prior to the border re-opening. To provide robustness to these results, I implement a Synthetic Control Method and calculate the same differences-in-differences estimations considering different combinations of departments of Colombia as control groups. I also estimate heterogeneous effects by sex, level of qualification, labor formality and considering whether the individuals were natives or not. I find that, in aggregate, the deterioration in wages was higher for men compared to women and much stronger for low-skilled workers. Moreover, the decline in wages was greater for informal workers but there are not important differences between natives and non-natives; the only exception is that I find a statistically significant increase in the informality rate among non-natives in Colombia. This paper contributes to a growing literature on massive flows of forced migration, mainly refugees, that take place between developing countries. In general, most of the papers that have taken up this topic have analyzed the flow of migrants from developing countries to developed countries (see, for example Card 1990; Hunt 1992; Borjas 2003, 2017; Foged and Peri 2016, among others). In cases of developing-developed migration, immigrants that enter the labor market in the receiving country are often quite different from the workforce already settled there, and the impact that immigrants have on receiving labor markets is related to the differences (or similarities) in characteristics between migrants and natives and the capacity of the economy to absorb the new labor force.Footnote 2 In this paper, however, I analyze the impact of a migratory flow between two developing countries (Colombia and Venezuela) that, due to their history, are very similar in social and demographic terms. Given this, a greater substitutability between migrant labor and native workers would be expected, resulting in a deterioration of the labor market conditions in the host country. In the literature on migration between developing countries, one of the most recent episodes of massive forced migration is the one spurred by the Syrian conflict. Some papers have analyzed this massive migration and the effects on the bordering countries’ labor market, especially in Jordan and Turkey. Results show a negative effect of migration on wages, an increase in informality, and a decrease in hours worked in Jordan for economic immigrants (Malaeb et al. 2018). On the other hand, evidence also indicates an increase in the unemployment rate, informal employment and a drop in the labor force participation in Turkey mainly concentrated on non-native workers due to the Syrian exodus (Cengiz and Tekgüç 2018; Tumen 2016). The work most closely related to this paper is Caruso et al. (2019). In their paper, the authors analyze the 2013-2017 period and implement an instrumental variable strategy in order to estimate the effect of the Venezuelan exodus on the Colombian labor market. They find that a 1 p.p. increase in immigration from Venezuela generated a decrease in wages of about 7.6%, which represents a significantly high labor demand elasticity. They also find that the effect was stronger for informal workers in urban areas. Finally, according to their estimates, a 1 p.p. increase in the share of Venezuelan immigration reduced the employment rate for Colombian workers in urban areas by 2.3 p.p. In contrast to findings in Caruso et al. (2019), my estimates suggest that the negative effects of immigration on wages and employment were significantly lower than their estimates. Results presented in this paper are more consistent with earlier papers that have estimated the effects of refugee waves on the labor market.Footnote 3 Three main points distinguish this work from Caruso et al. (2019): First, while Caruso et al. (2019) use household surveys to estimate the inflow of immigrants from Venezuela, I use administrative information from the Migration Unit in Colombia (UAEMC). This dataset indicates a higher value of the labor supply shock and, thus, a significantly lower labor demand elasticity. According to their estimates, migrant working-age population (those between 15-64 years old), represents a 0.6% of the native working-age population in 2017 (the last year of their sample with the highest number of Venezuelan immigrants), which is the main reason explaining why their results are significantly large. Specifically, according to the same administrative information from UAEMC and data from DANE in which my estimates are based, in 2017-2019 the share of immigrants relative to the labor force in Colombia was 1.7%-5.4%. Second, another advantage of this paper compared to that of Caruso et al. (2019), refers to the fact that, since they use an IV approach, according to Lozano and Steinberger (2012) the effect when using instrumental variables is more a Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) which requires stronger assumptions of the instrumental variable to ensure external validity of the estimates. Therefore, the estimated effects in this work using a difference-in-differences methodology allow for an interpretation of the average treatment effect for the entire sample under study. Finally, while Caruso et al. (2019) estimate the effect of Venezuelan migration on the labor market in Colombia for the period 2013-2017, I analyze the period from 2013-2019. This is very important considering that, according to UAEMC, the number of Venezuelans in Colombia in 2017 was 22.8% of the number settled there by 2019. In fact, UAEMC official statistics indicate that during the period after 2017 until 2019 —not taken into consideration in Caruso et al. (2019)— the number of Venezuelans in Colombia increased by 339% from 403,702 in 2017 to 1,771,237 in 2019. As the migratory episode under study is one of forced migration, an analysis of a longer time period like the one carried out in this paper is crucial to estimating the effect of the Venezuelan exodus on the Colombian labor market. My estimates reveal that the effects found by Caruso et al. (2019) were consolidated in the Colombian labor market over time and were not explained by a labor market overreaction in the very short-term. Another paper related to this one is the work of Bahar et al. (2020). In that paper, the authors analyze the effect of a massive regularization program implemented by the Colombian government in 2018 that granted work permits to about half a million undocumented Venezuelan immigrants. By implementing a difference-in-difference methodology, they find that the regularization program had a slightly negative effect on formal employment for Colombian workers, especially of high-skilled and female workers. Moreover, Bahar et al. (2020) also find that the regularization program had a positive effect on the formal employment rate of Venezuelan workers in Colombia. The estimates of Bahar et al. (2020) and those presented in this paper are different in the sense that they analyze the effect of a regularization program and not the Venezuelan exodus per se. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 discusses background information regarding previous internal migratory episodes in Colombia and the Venezuelan exodus. Section 3 introduces the data and some descriptive statistics. In Sect. 4, the identification strategy and methodology are outlined, then the aggregate and heterogeneous estimates are presented. Section 5 presents robustness exercises and, additionally, discusses several potential threats to the identification strategy. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes.",2
56,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,01 September 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-022-00317-4,The labour market effects of the polish educational reform of 1999,December 2022,Luca Flóra Drucker,Dániel Horn,Maciej Jakubowski,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In this study, we look at the Polish education reform of 1999 that, among others, has increased general education for all students, introduced a national core curriculum, standardised examinations at the end of each education stage, introduced new teacher qualification requirements, and adopted a transparent financing scheme. Previous results on the effect of education reforms on labour market outcomes are mixed. Comprehensive education reforms in Scandinavia are usually hailed for their positive effects on labour market outcomes. Sweden carried out a major education reform in the 1950s, increasing compulsory education from 7/8 to 9 years, abolishing tracking (i.e. sorting students into general and vocational tracks) based on academic achievement after the sixth grade, and introducing a national curriculum. Meghir and Palme (2005) showed that this reform increased educational attainment and the future earnings of children with low educated parents. At the same time, the earnings of those with highly educated parents decreased, but the average effect was positive. The reform in Finland in the 1970s delayed the tracking of students from age 11 to 16 by extending comprehensive education from 4 to 9 years. Pekkarinen, Uusitalo, and Kerr tested the effects of this reform on the income elasticity (Pekkarinen et al., 2009) and the average test scores (Kerr et al., 2013) and concluded that it had only a small but overall positive effect on both dimensions. In Norway, a school reform implemented between 1960 and 1972 increased compulsory education from 7 to 9 years. The 9 years of comprehensive education consisted of 6 years of primary school and a 3 year lower secondary school. Lower secondary schools existed before the reform, too, but attending them was voluntary and they were only available in some municipalities. This reform also improved the quality of education by standardising the curriculum. Aakvik et al. (2010) find that the reform increased the level of education in the country, and it also increased the returns to upper secondary and tertiary qualifications. However, some papers find no-returns to extending compulsory education in Germany (Pischke and von Wachter 2008) or France (Grenet 2013), and the story is similar if we look at education reforms that increased the time of education particularly for vocational students: no (substantial) effects were found for the Netherlands (Oosterbeek and Webbink 2007). These differences in the results might stem from the differences in the type of education extended. While in Germany and France, the increase in education was after tracking, in the Anglo-Saxon (Grenet 2013) and Scandinavian countries, where a positive effect of additional years of schooling was found, it was before tracking.Footnote 1 We argue that the reason for this is that “before tracking reforms” not only extended education but also improved the quality of inputs, such as the curriculum,Footnote 2 teachers, or peers, as these are crucial in the education production function (e.g. Chetty et al. 2014; Rivkin et al. 2005; Sacerdote 2011). When additional years of education are ""inserted"" before students are selected into tracks, the effect is different from when they are already selected into academic or vocational tracks. Offering increased general training to vocational students does not affect teachers and peers, as these inputs are unlikely to change due to the increased length of vocational education or increased general content.Footnote 3 However, if the system is 'de-tracked', i.e. the age of selection is increased, the composition of teachers and peer groups will remain as they were before selection in that “inserted” year, and thus–at least for the later vocational track students–a higher peer and teacher effect might improve their long term outcomes. The 1999 reform of Poland, which we analyse in this study, was a comprehensive one like the Scandinavian reforms. However, it was unique in the sense that besides extending comprehensive education, it altered all of the above-mentioned essential inputs in the education production function. This reform replaced the former 8 year general primary school with a 6 year general primary and a 3 year general lower secondary school. Therefore, the age of first selection was postponed from age 15 to 16. The length of tracked upper-secondary education was shortened by one year so that the overall length of primary and secondary education remained 12 years, except in the basic vocational track, which was 3 years before the reform and remained 3 years. Besides these structural changes, the reform changed other major parts of the education system: Poland introduced a national core curriculum, standardised examinations at the end of each education stage, introduced new teacher qualification requirements, and adopted a transparent financing scheme. Using PISA data, Jakubowski (2015) showed that the between-school variance of test scores decreased after the reform. Jakubowski et al. (2016) also showed, using difference-in-differences approach adjusted with propensity score matching, that the fast increase in Polish students' PISA test scores was driven by potential vocational students, who after the 1999 reform were in the comprehensive lower secondary school instead of already having been tracked into the low-tier vocational schools. They argue that the increased resources of an additional year of better teachers, peers, and general curriculum have improved these students' test scores. They also show that the improvements in student achievement at the age of 15 are still substantial at the age of 16 or 17 when students are already tracked to different secondary school programs. These results confirm our expectation that improved inputs result not only in better achievement but provide a stronger basis for further development of foundational skills among students who continue education in vocational tracks. Additional years of education translate into higher wages (Psacharopoulos, Patrinos, 2018). This effect is partly explained by the human capital theory, which assumes that better education translates into skills that increase our productivity (Becker, 1975). An alternative explanation is that by passing through the education system, one signals its innate ability and employers reward it with higher wages (see Page, 2010, for a review). I our case, both theories imply that the Polish reform should increase wages as it improved skills but also educational attainment. Research also shows that at the country level the improvement of cognitive skills translates into higher economic growth (Hanushek, Woessmann, 2012). Moreover, better skills bring non-economic benefits (Heckman et al., 2018). The empirical research documents well that the Polish reform was beneficial for students' school performance, but we are aware of only a couple of attempts to assess its long-term impacts on labour market outcomes. Liwiński (2020) applies a regression discontinuity design (RDD) focusing on the differences in employment probability and wages among adults with basic vocational degrees. He found that the reform improved hourly wages by 13%. However, as the reform has also changed patterns of selection into different upper secondary tracks, with a decreasing number of students attracted to basic vocational schools, the results comparing just adults with basic vocational training might provide a biased picture of the overall effect of the reform. Strawinski and Broniatowska (2021) applied a similar RDD approach to the Polish LFS data, but limiting their sample to people with secondary education degree only. Their result suggests a rather small but positive overall impact of the reform. They provide additional results showing larger benefits for vocational school graduates in rural areas. However, these results might be biased for the same reasons as the analysis of Liwiński (2020) as a larger number of students in the post-reform cohorts continued education into tertiary level. These papers use RDD and rely on the assumption that cohorts before and after the reform are as if they were randomly allocated. This is a strong assumption. Typically, RDD studies use high-density data around the cut-off, for these studies, this is clearly not the case (but see Grenet 2013 for a similar approach). Thus, using a quasi-DID identification strategy could offer a strong robustness check to the RDD results. This study aims at filling this gap by adding more evidence on the labour market outcomes of the reform. We show that the reform had a significant positive effect on the earnings and employment chances of the post-reform cohorts. We argue that these results come from the comprehensive nature of the reform, i.e. general education was extended, and its quality was improved before students were tracked to upper secondary schools. Unlike the Scandinavian reforms, the Polish reform did not have a pilot stage; instead, it was introduced simultaneously in the whole country. Thus, our estimations cannot exploit any time or spatial variation. Due to the lack of high-frequency micro-data before and after the reform, it is impossible to use a regression discontinuity design. However, by pooling several years of cross-sectional surveys, we can generate a quasi-panel of year-of-survey and age brackets, which we will use to estimate difference-in-differences models. Unlike in the Scandinavian studies, the variance does not come from the time of implementation but from the time (year) of observation. This way, we will directly compare the employment chances and real earnings of pre-reform (control) and post-reform (treatment) cohorts. In Sect. 2, we discuss the 1999 reform in more detail. Section 3 presents the data and descriptive analyses. In Sect. 4, we present our estimation methodology and baseline results. Section 6 shows robustness checks, and Sect. 7 concludes. The 1999 educational reform was one of the four reforms—social security, healthcare, public administration, and education—implemented by the government elected in 1997. The three main goals of the education reform were to increase the level of education in society, provide equal educational opportunities to everyone, and improve the quality of education (Bialecki et al. 2002). While the other three reforms were implemented simultaneously, they similarly affected all students and all adults in the population. The education reform was rolled out so that the older cohorts followed the old system, while only the younger cohorts, born from 1986, followed the new system with the new structure, curricula, and standardised national exams. The reform consisted of many distinct parts, of which we concentrate mainly on the structural changes but briefly discuss all parts here (see Jakubowski, 2021, for a more detailed discussion of the reform components). In sum, the 1999 reform (1) extended comprehensive general education by one year, and (2) changed the structure of general education by dividing the previous 8 year primary school into 6 years of primary and 3 years of general lower secondary school. It also (3) shortened academic and technical upper secondary education by one year, but the basic vocational school remained 3-years-long. Besides these structural changes, the reform (4) introduced a core curriculum, which guided teachers in determining their syllabi, giving them more autonomy, and it (5) introduced the teacher professional attainment ladder with four levels and strong incentives for professional development and obtaining master degrees for all teachers. The third line of changes concerned the testing and admission system: (6) new, standardised tests were introduced at the end of each education stage (primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary), and parallel to that, (7) the admission system to each stage shifted from entrance examinations to using the results of these end-of-stage standardised exams. Finally, (8) the reform also transferred ownership of nearly all schools to local governments and introduced a new per pupil formula-based financing system. Figure 1 shows the structural changes in the Polish education system. Most importantly, the newly established comprehensive lower secondary schools (gimnazjum in Polish) had to follow the same general curriculum and admit all students from their catchment area without any additional requirements. They could accept additional applicants from other areas to the remaining places. Lower secondary schools were larger, and there were fewer of them than primary schools. They opened in larger settlements, which was especially important in rural areas, where one gimnazjum collected the children from neighbouring villages who previously attended different local primary schools. So, students spent their last 3 years of general education in a comprehensive institution intended to give the same high-quality education for students all over the country. Pre- and post-reform structure of the Polish education system. The figure shows the structure of the Polish education system before and after the reform. The width of the specific upper-secondary level tracks approximates the ratio of students attending these tracks in 2000 (pre-reform) and 2004 (post-reform). Source of data: Polish Statistical Office Before the reform, there were three upper secondary tracks: a 4 year academic secondary school (liceum), a 5 year technical secondary school (technikum), and a 3 year basic vocational school. Only liceum and technikum ended with a maturity exam, which did not change with the reform. After the reform, academic and technical secondary schools became one year shorter, but the basic vocational schools remained 3 years long. Therefore, lower secondary graduates and those who chose the vocational track received one additional year of comprehensive education. A new institution was operating for a short time, the so-called profiled academic secondary school, but it was abolished after a few years. In general, the upper secondary education curricula and programs were not changed substantially. In academic and technical upper secondary schools the curricula were adjusted where necessary as parts of the material taught in first grades were now moved to general lower secondary schools. Before 1999, education was compulsory until age 17 with the possibility of part-time education after finishing the 8 year primary school. With the extension of comprehensive education, the end of compulsory education increased to age 18.Footnote 4 Finally, Poland introduced a new curriculum and standardised final exams to measure whether students achieve the curricular goals at the end of the 6th and 9th grades. The 6th-grade test was low-stakes and provided information on student and school performance. The 9th-grade tests were high-stakes and were used as an entrance exam to the upper secondary stage. These exams were first launched in 2002 for the first cohorts that followed the new curriculum in the new comprehensive lower secondary schools. For the same cohort, the new standardised maturity exams were introduced in 2005 and replaced higher education admission exams. The standardised examinations strengthened the impact of the extended general education as they were compulsory for all students. Overall, the reform revolutionised all parts of the school system. However, one can reasonably expect that these changes differently affected various groups of students and had different impacts over time. One can expect a delayed effect on student outcomes of changes in curriculum, professional teacher standards, or system governance structure. Even the reformers assumed that several years were needed to benefit from these changes. However, one year’s general education extension immediately provided students with one more year of the general curriculum. The new accountability system established by new standardised examinations provided additional incentives to students and teachers to cover the general curriculum. However, that made a difference only to students who would otherwise have gone to the basic vocational schools. Before the reform, the other groups had to follow the academic curriculum and pass secondary school entrance examinations. The evaluation of changes in student achievement confirms that the main group that the reform affected immediately was the students of basic vocational schools. Jakubowski et al. (2016) demonstrate that the immediate impact of the reform on 15-year-olds' achievement was close to one standard deviation for students whose socioeconomic background is identical to former students of basic vocational schools. Moreover, additional comparisons for 16- and 17-year-old students suggest that this effect is long-lasting. After 1–2 years of basic vocational education, students still show improved reading and mathematics outcomes close to an equivalent of one year of instruction. A similar achievement effect for students in the academic track was negligible even 6 years after the reform was implemented. As the new comprehensive lower secondary schools started to operate already in 1999/2000, the first cohort that started their 7th grade in the new system is the 1986 cohort. So, we categorise everyone born after 1986 as a member of the treated group.Footnote 5 We argue that structural changes immediately affected every cohort from 1986 onwards, while the other changes were beneficial in the long run, affecting both pre- and post-treatment cohorts, although to a slightly different extent.Footnote 6 So, if we compare a few cohorts before and after the reform, the potential differences in their labour market outcomes are most likely caused by the additional year of general education before the delayed tracking. We use the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) data between 2005 and 2013.Footnote 7 The EU-SILC contains detailed income and labour, education, and health status data at the personal and household level. The data consists of private households with all household members surveyed, but only above age 16 are interviewed personally for the income data. In this paper, we use the cross-sectional database of EU-SILC. To generate a balanced “quasi-panel”, we pool the cross-sectional datasets between 2005 and 2013 and restrict the sample to participants between ages 20 and 27. This allows us to compare the pre-reform and post-reform groups at the same age: in 2005, the youngest control group members were 20 years old, and in 2013, the oldest treatment group members were 27 (see Table 1 below). This means we have 16 cohorts in the sample, eight in the treatment (T86 to T93–where 86, 87, etc., signal the birth year of the cohort) and eight in the control group (C78 to C85). These people were born between 1978 and 1993 (see Tables 8 and 9 in the Appendix). There are around 48 500 observations in the sample, with 23 500 in the control group and 25 000 in the treatment group. In Poland, the school starting age is 7, and the threshold is January 1. In the sample, everyone born after January 1 1986 is considered to be treated—to have studied in the new system—and everyone born until December 31 1985, is considered to be in the control group. There is a scope for misclassification around the threshold because of grade retention or skipping a grade. However, grade repetition was always rare in Polish schools and was mainly limited to students with special needs. The earliest data on grade repetition are available for 2005, and they show that in primary schools, only 0.6% of students were repeating a grade (GUS, 2006). For educational attainment, we rely on the ISCED classificationFootnote 8: those with ISCED 2 (lower secondary) qualification or below are considered low-educated, those with ISCED 3 (upper secondary) or 4 (post-secondary non-tertiary) are at the medium level, and those with ISCED 5 (tertiary) are highly educated. We see the highest education level attained in the data and the year when it was achieved, but unfortunately, we do not observe the exact type of school the person graduated from. So, in the case of upper secondary education, we see how old the person was when she finished the upper secondary level, but we do not see whether it was a liceum, a technikum, or a basic vocational school. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the ages when each level of education was achieved, separately for the treatment and control group.Footnote 9 The distribution of finishing ages is different for all three education levels for the two groups. The most visible change is in the median finishing age of the lowest educated: the median age increased from 15 to 16, mainly because of the one additional year of comprehensive education. The difference for upper secondary graduates (ISCED 3) is not so salient, but we also see the distribution shift to the right, driven by the one extra year for vocational students. The distribution of tertiary (ISCED 5) graduation age became bimodal, as, in the Bologna system, a BA degree also counts as a tertiary qualification, while earlier only long-cycle programmes existed. Note that studying the differences between treated and non-treated cohorts in this dimension is not straightforward. Poland signed the Bologna Declaration in 1999 and 28 other European countries, which introduced the typical three-level system of tertiary education—bachelor, master, and doctorate. The three-cycle structure of higher education was implemented gradually. In 2003 Poland was already implementing the Bologna structure (Kwiek 2014). By the school year 2004/2005 10% of state higher education institutions had already adopted the 2-cycle model (Bachelor and Master) in all fields of study and 50% of the institutions in at least 50% of the fields of study (see European Commission 2005). In 2008 all tertiary students were enrolled in the Bologna system (see Kwiek 2014). Distribution of the age when the highest educational level was attained. The figures show the distributions of the age when the respondents finished their highest education level. Each figure corresponds to a subsample with a specific education level: those with at most lower secondary education (ISCED 2), upper secondary (ISCED 3), and tertiary education (ISCED 5) Consequently, the first bachelor-level graduates of the new system entered the labour market in around 2006. Therefore, the 1984 and 1985 cohorts also had the opportunity to study in the Bologna system, depending on their institution and field of study–however, the first full ""Bologna cohort"" was the 1989 cohort (who finished in 2011). This coincidence makes it hard for us to study the effect of the reform on the upper end of the education distribution. Appendix Table 11 expl or es the age of finishing education in a regression framework. Treated cohorts, on average, tend to stay just as long in education as the control cohorts, but this average zero effect masks a significant composition effect: the low educated stay about 0.9 years longer in school, while the average upper secondary graduate stays a little over 1 month (0.09 years) longer in school. This average effect for the medium educated is probably due to the ca. 15% of students in basic vocational tracks, who stay about one year longer in school. On the other hand, higher educated people finish education about 0.7 years earlier, which is probably due to the previously non-existent BA degree. When looking only at those who are currently not pursuing any education–which means that they have finished their educational career, at least for a while–the pattern is similar. However, effect sizes are slightly different: low educated stay in school 0.7 years longer, medium level educated over 2 months longer and higher educated about 0.8 years less. The two main outcome variables we are interested in are employment status and earnings. EU-SILC classifies activity status into four categories: at work, unemployed, in retirement or early retirement, and other inactive. The first category covers those who work either full-time or part-time or are self-employed full-time or part-time. When looking at employment chances, we compare employed people to unemployed, as we find that the share of the active population compared to the inactive did not change during the sample period. We drop those in retirement or in early retirement as there are only 55 of these people in our sample. Income data is collected as gross current monthly earnings before the deduction of taxes and social insurance contributions. Income is given in Euros and current prices, so we converted this data to Polish Złoty in 2005 prices. The database contains data on experience, expressed as the number of years spent as an employee or self-employed since the respondent first started a regular job. As low educated people studied for one more year after the reform, and this change was immediate, there was a year (2001) when, in theory, no one graduated from the lowest education level.Footnote 10 There is a similar gap year (2004) for vocational graduates because their studies also became longer by one year. This, and other differences in labour market characteristics make it very important to control for labour market entry in our estimations. There is data on the year of starting the first job, which, of course, is only available for those who have ever worked. To correct for this, we generated a variable called 'labour market entry year' that equals the year of starting the first job, or, when it is not available, the year when the respondent finished their highest education level (provided in the EU-SILC database). We corrected this variable so that the labour market entry age of respondents is at least 18, as this is the legal age when young people can start to work full time in Poland.Footnote 11 Table 2a–c show when each age group of pre- and post-reform cohorts started their first job. Since post-reform cohorts finished their education later, they started working later (at 20.47 vs 20.35 years, p < 0.01Footnote 12). The difference is significant for the younger cohorts and disappears in the older cohorts. Surprisingly, later job starting does not go together with less experience: treated people of the same age tend to have higher years of experience than the control group (2.87 vs 2.58 years on average, p < 0.01, see Table 3a–c for more detail). This could be due to different employment chances. If treated cohorts have higher employment chances than the control cohorts, then–on average–even if they start working later, they might secure more stable jobs and gain more experience over a shorter period. Table 4a–c seem to underline this assumption, as we see a higher share of employed people in younger cohorts among the treatment group than in the control group, and the differences are even higher within the lowest educated people. Across all age groups in the full sample the means are 79 percent vs 77 percent (p < 0.01). Figure 3 shows the real earnings distribution of the pre- and post-reform cohorts. Treated people tend to earn more on average (PLN 1664 vs PLN 1388), mainly because fewer people are at the bottom of the earnings distribution in the treatment group. That is, the earnings distribution is shifted to the right, moving those at the bottom of the distribution to the middle. This shift is apparent in the full sample and for the low educated. Distribution of real earnings of treatment and control group in 2005 PLN. The figures show the distribution of real earnings in the treatment and the control group in 2005 Polish zloty. The first figure presents data for the whole sample, the second for those who have at most lower secondary qualification (ISCED 2), and the third for those who have upper secondary qualification (ISCED 3) From the raw data and from the research before us, we assume that Poland's 1999 comprehensive education reform had a non-negligible and positive effect on the Polish labour market. We believe that it was especially young people (where the level of education and skills gained matter most) and those at the bottom of the education distribution, who stayed one more year in school, who benefited the most from the reform. We now turn to our causal estimates. Year of birth determined the assignment into treatment, which means that self-selection into the treatment or control group was impossible. However, there are cohort-specific differences, as the treatment and control group members were born in different years. To handle this issue, we control for age fixed-effects. There are also differences between the years each survey was taken, so we control for survey year fixed effects.Footnote 13 We assume that in the absence of the treatment, in both the treatment and the control group, changes in outcomes between two consecutive survey years would have been the same for all ages, and vice versa: changes between two consecutive ages would have been the same for all survey years (parallel trends assumption).Footnote 14 For this reason, as a baseline, we opted for a difference-in-differences method, where age and year-of-survey act as the two dimensions of the estimation (the first differences) and the treatment variable as the diff-in-diff (second difference) estimator.Footnote 15 The baseline specification of the multivariate model is the following: where Y is the outcome variable (current educational status, employment status, or earnings) for each individual (i). Treat is the treatment dummy, which can vary across ages (a) and year-of-survey (s). X are individual-level variables (gender and highest level of education, in some specifications), and γ, δ, and μ are age, year of survey, and region fixed effects. ε is the idiosyncratic error term, while α, β, and ρ are parameters to be estimated.Footnote 16 For a similar estimation framework, see, for instance, Pischke (2007). Table 5 shows the results of our baseline regression on labour market outcomes. In columns 1 and 2 we estimate linear probability models of the employment probability on the sample of the active population. Columns 3 and 4 show the results of regressions of log real earnings. We estimate all models with age and year-of-survey fixed effects as well as region fixed effects. While these should take out much of the unobserved heterogeneity across cohorts in educational outcomes, pre- and post-treatment cohorts differ in their year of labour market entry, too, which means they might have faced very different labour market conditions. This difference can easily bias the effect of the treatment on longer-run labour market outcomes. Consequently, in columns 2 and 4 we also include year-of labour-market-entry fixed effects.Footnote 17 On the one hand, controlling for the year when one enters the labour market seems to be essential as different demand-side factors can alter the entrants' employment probabilities and initial earnings. On the other hand, the year of labour market entry might be considered a 'bad control' (see Angrist and Pischke 2008) as it correlates well with years spent in schooling, which depend on the reform. Moreover, year of labour market entry correlates strongly with age and year-of-survey, which inflates the variance of the model. Nevertheless, substantial results of the models do not differ much with or without the year of labour market entry fixed effect. The results in Table 5 show that the treated group is about 3 percentage points more likely to be employed and earn 4 to 5% higher earnings.Footnote 18 Additional results presented in Fig. 4a and b show how these average treatment effects vary across age cohorts. The estimates are too imprecise for employment probability to detect any statistically significant and consistent age-related patterns. However, people closer to their twenties benefited from a 10 percentage points increase in their earnings after the reform compared to the pre-treatment people of similar age. This effect declines with age and disappears around age 24–26. These results can be explained by arguing that the reform improved labour market entrance, but the effects disappear with age as experience becomes more important than general skills learned at school. a The effect of the reform on employment probability and earnings by age groups. The figure shows the effects of the reform on each age cohort estimated by models 2 and 4 in Table 5, extended with treatment*age interactions. The left figure shows the treatment effect on the probability of being employed (interpreted as percentage points), while the right figure on the logarithm of earnings (interpreted as percentage change in the earnings). The controls include gender and age, year-of-survey, region, and year-of-labour-market-entry fixed effects. The bars show the average effects with 95% confidence intervals. b The effect of the reform on employment probability and earnings by age groups, without labour market entry fixed effects. The figure shows the effects of the reform on each age cohort estimated by models 1 and 3 in Table 5, extended with treatment*age interactions. The left figure shows the treatment effect on the probability of being employed (interpreted as percentage points), while the right figure on the logarithm of earnings (interpreted as percentage change in the earnings). The controls include gender and age, year-of-survey, and region fixed effects. The bars show the average effects with 95% confidence intervals In a robustness check, we simplify our models and compare only two cohorts–right before and right after the reform–with each other. This might decrease the power of our analysis substantially but also highlight the importance of the “inserted” year of education before tracking, as all other reform elements have impacted these two cohorts similarly. Table 6 presents the same models as in Table 5 regressed only on the 1985 and 1986 sample, so the cohorts born right before and right after the 1986 January 1 cut-off. The effects on the employment probabilities are not significant; the 1986 cohort earns 9–11% more than the 1985 cohort on average. In another robustness check, we test the mechanisms by using the reform as an instrument for the finishing age of schooling. Unfortunately, the database does not contain data on the years spent in education, but we know the age when the highest educational level was attained. As shown above, due mainly to the Bologna Process, we cannot compare the average finishing age for the full pre- and post-treatment sample. However, we can compare the lowest educated sub-population, as there was no compositional change regarding this education group. Appendix Fig. 5 shows the first stage of our IV: the age distribution for those with only ISCED 2 or less for each pair of cohorts. The median finishing age for this level was 15 until the 1985 cohort and became 16 with the 1986 cohort. Columns 1 and 2 in Appendix Table 12 show that the age when the highest degree was obtained for this population has zero effect in itself on log of earnings and employment probability. 1st stage estimates in columns 3 and 5 show that the reform can act as a strong instrument: treated cohorts are 0.4 or 0.6 years older than the pre-treatment cohorts when they finish their highest degree of schooling. In columns 4 and 6 we see that the 2SLS coefficients of finishing age on earnings and employment are high and positive, 13.6% and 12 percentage points, respectively. Unfortunately, they are insignificant, due most likely to the small power of our analysis, but they are of a very similar magnitude to the significant estimates of Table 6 in earnings.Footnote 19 Nevertheless, both estimations show that the lowest educated population would have been more likely to earn more had they attended comprehensive lower secondary schooling for an additional year.",

This situation is rapidly changing, however. Most progress so far has been on understanding the potential labor market implications of AI, in particular using the task-approach to labor markets (e.g., Autor (2013)). This approach has been used amongst others to evaluate fears that AI-automated job losses would cause mass unemployment.Footnote 1 Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018) incorporated the task-approach into an endogenous growth model, making further progress in modelling AI in economics. The Acemoglu-Restrepo (AR) model is a general automation-technology model - with AI being one of several automation technologies that can be used to analyse. Other automation technologies include robots, as for instance discussed in Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017) and Chiacchio et al. (2018). The AR-model thus does not focus on AI specifically. It also considers tasks and skills in automation, but not abilities. Abilities may, as several scholars recently argued, better characterize the nature of the services that AI provides (Hernández-Orallo 2017; Tolan et al. 2020). The contribution of this paper is to propose a partial equilibrium model wherein AI provides abilities that are combined with human skills to provide an aggregate intermediate service good. While our mathematical formulation (see section 3) makes explicitly clear what we mean by the difference between skills and abilities where AI is concerned, it is perhaps helpful that we also provide, at the outset, an intuitive explanation. Consider for instance that the visual recognition of objects is an  ability—the ability to see—and that this ability can be used to perform a task, for instance the task of driving a car, or the task of recognizing faces. Applying the ability of being able to see to either driving, or facial recognition, require skills, which requires human judgement. Thus, even though an AI model can drive a car because of its ability to “see"" we still need human skills to make the decision and judgement to apply the ability to the task of driving. No AI algorithms (yet) autonomously decide where and how to apply various abilities, which in the case of current AI, predominantly Machine Learning (ML), is based on big data. It is this combination of human skills, particularly ICT skills, that in combination with AI’s big-data-based abilities results in AI applications. In the model we present here, we provide a detailed description of this combination of AI abilities, data, and human ICT skills in our production function. The purpose of this paper is therefore to complement the task-approach and AR-model. By combining AI abilities with human skills to provide an aggregate intermediate service good, we can determine the efficient allocation of AI and labor in production in a manner that is comparable to the traditional notion of labor in efficiency units. The main take-away is that the extent of automation through AI technologies will be greater if (i) the economy is relatively abundant in sophisticated programs and machine abilities compared to human skills; (ii) the economy hosts a relatively large number of AI-providing businesses and experts; and (iii) the task-specific productivity of AI services is relatively high compared to the task-specific productivity of general labor and labor skills. Our model can be imported as a package into general equilibrium endogenous growth models to elaborate the economy-wide effects of AI—thus expanding the toolkit of economists. The paper will proceed as follows. In Sect. 2, we describe our background with reference to the basic mathematical set-up of the task-approach to labor markets, as well as by setting out the core of the AR model’s incorporation of the task-approach into an endogenous growth setting. This indicates that our model remains close to the spirit of the task-approach and the AR-model. In Sect. 3 we present our model. Section 4 contains a discussion of the results and implications of the model, while Sect. 5 concludes with a summary and indication of potential extensions.",3

Many countries have put in place numerous requirements such as mask mandates and distancing measures and have communicated recommendations for avoiding social contact to protect against infection and contain the virus. In the implementation of these containment measures, the so-called critical economic sectors and critical occupations have become the focus of political and public attention. Government institutions worldwide drew up lists of critical sectors and occupations that are very similar in their composition; workers in these sectors ensure, among other things, the maintenance of systemically relevant infrastructure and the provision of medical care and nursing services and the supply of essential goods (see, e.g., CISA (2020) for the US, CPNI (2021) for the UK, and BMI (2009) for Germany). Unlike other employees who were asked to isolate themselves, work from home, and reduce their social contact at work, essential employees were provided with support measures, such as emergency child care, so that they could continue to perform their jobs. Examining wages and physical proximity in critical occupations or industries, recent empirical research has indicated that the working conditions in critical jobs are less favourable than those in other jobs and have become even more hazardous during the pandemic. However, referring to theoretical approaches to segmented labour markets (Hendry 2003; Osterman 2011; Kaufman 2013) and research investigating the quality of work (Kalleberg 2011; Howell and Kalleberg 2019), we argue that it is necessary to investigate a broader range of working conditions since favourable and unfavourable working conditions are often found in a cumulative manner (ibid.). Beyond wages and physical proximity, working time patterns and physical working conditions are two additional crucial considerations. The former are important because working time arrangements influence everyday life (ILO 2018) and the organisation of work and family life (Howell and Kalleberg 2019). Both became even more significant when the measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic were in effect since parents, particularly women, had to engage in child care and home schooling to a much greater extent than before. Unfavourable working hours also adversely affect individuals’ health. Furthermore, a wide range of studies have found physical working conditions to be important for individuals’ working lives. Physically demanding labour negatively influences health outcomes and leads to health inequalities and health-related job loss. Against this backdrop, this paper raises the following research question: What are the working conditions in critical jobs? The study aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of working conditions in critical jobs and contributes to recent research in the following ways. First, we conceptually frame the public and academic discussion about working conditions in critical jobs by arguing that this debate can be linked to theoretical approaches to segmented labour markets. Second, we describe the sociodemographic characteristics of essential workers and structural determinants of critical jobs to enable policy decisions that protect and meet the needs of these workers. Third, we extend recent research on critical jobs by following Kalleberg’s (2011, p. 5) note that working conditions comprise multidimensional bundles of rewards and burdens. Therefore, we analyse wages, a classical dimension of inequality, and physical proximity to others at work, which we consider a new and emerging stressor due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as working time patterns and physical working conditions. Understanding which population strata are the most affected and gaining deeper insight into the working conditions in critical jobs is crucial for not only the persons concerned but also policymakers and stakeholders because research has examined the longer-term effects of past crises on labour market outcomes (Killewald and Zhuo 2019). Furthermore, employment-related exposure to SARS-CoV-2 endangers not only workers but also their household members (Selden and Berdahl 2020). The empirical analyses are based on the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA, for its German acronym) Working Time Survey 2019, conducted shortly before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and therefore unaffected by it. The Working Time Survey is a representative study that includes detailed information on approximately 9,500 individuals from all industries. It is a unique dataset since it contains individual-level information on wages, physical proximity to others, working time patterns and physical working conditions, as well as the sociodemographic, job-related and structural characteristics of workers and their jobs. With reference to this dataset, employees' jobs were categorised as critical or noncritical based on the classification of systemically relevant supply and care occupations compiled by Burstedde et al. (2020) during the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. The list is based on the “List of Critical Infrastructures” (KRITIS) developed jointly by German federal states and the federal government in 2009; additionally, the classification of systemically relevant supply and care occupations includes occupations not yet covered by the KRITIS list but of particular relevance in the COVID-19 pandemic. This empirical approach allows us to examine the specific occupational strains that already existed before the COVID-19 pandemic in occupations that became very important during the pandemic. To our knowledge, there are no alternative and longitudinal data to draw representative conclusions about changes in working conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The empirical investigation is conducted in three steps. First, we present a descriptive analysis of the data. Second, we perform binary logistic regressions to determine the likelihood of working in a critical job and, thus, identify the groups of employees concerned. Third, in various regression estimations, we investigate the relationships between critical jobs and working conditions to assess possible accumulation of risks. In doing so, we pursue an explorative approach and provide correlations since we cannot determine causal effects due to the cross-sectional data structure. The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the current state of research. Section 3 provides a theoretical rationale for the differences in working conditions between critical and noncritical jobs, while Sect. 4 presents the data and the methodological approach. Section 5 reports the empirical results, and Sect. 6 concludes.",3

Their use has been unprecedented, with take-up as a share of dependent employment in May 2020 about ten times as high as during the peak of the global financial crisis ... OECD (2021, p. 101) During the Covid-19 pandemic, the usage of short-time work (STW; in German: Kurzarbeit) reached unprecedented levels in Germany. At the peak, in the spring of 2020, roughly six million employees from 600.000 establishments were in STW and it took until August 2021 for the number of employees concerned to fall below one million (Federal Employment Agency 2021). STW, a program which has been in place in Germany for a long time, directly subsidizes hours not worked in times of temporary economic distress of a firm to promote job retention. During the crisis 2008/09 and during the Covid-19 crisis, Germany like many countries in the latter crisis increased the coverage of STW and increased the generosity of the scheme (OECD 2021). STW is the main support system to prevent a rise in unemployment and firm closures. STW allows for a lot of flexibility in actual usage by the firm after the approval of the maximum employment level, for which STW is granted for. Administrative records based on actual STW payments to the firm are available only a few months afterwards and it takes six months for the final records to be published by the Federal Employment Agency (Federal Employment Agency 2021; Fitzenberger et al. 2021). Since the number of employees on STW is an important crisis indicator, there was strong demand for real-time data (“now-casting”) of STW usage. This prompted the use of firm level surveys asking about the actual usage of STW in the survey month to provide such information, with the real-time estimates by the ifo-Institute receiving a lot of public attention during the first six months of the Covid-19 crisis (Link et al. 2020a). However, later on, based on administrative records being available six months afterwards, such firm-level survey estimates of STW usage in the survey month were shown to systematically over-report actual STW usage by a sizeable amount. This caused the ifo-Institute to use a downward adjustment of its real-time STW estimated starting in the fall of 2020 based on the over-reporting bias observed for a few months before. Thus, estimates based on firm-level surveys without further corrections do not provide a reliable real-time assessment of STW in times of a fast-moving crises (Link et al. 2020a; Fitzenberger et al. 2021). Figure 1 plots administrative counts of persons in STW by month and shows the comparison to unadjusted totals estimated by monthly firm surveys. The latter show a consistent upward bias relative to the official administrative figures, which are only available with a delay of six months. Employees on STW: Administrative Numbers and Unadjusted Estimates from Firm Surveys. Notes: The final administrative numbers from the Federal Employment Agency agency are published after a time delay of six months. Numbers from the ifo-Institute are taken from press releases (Link et al. 2020a; Link and Sauer 2020b). Design-based 95% confidence intervals are shown for BeCovid, an IAB firm level survey that started during the Covid-19 pandemic (Backhaus et al. 2021). Raw, unadjusted numbers for BeCovid are shown The purpose of this paper is to investigate the sources of and reasons for this discrepancy, combining evidence from two different establishment surveys administered by the Institute for Employment Research (IAB)—one with a monthly frequency (BeCovid) and one yearly survey, the Establishment Panel (BP)—which both can be linked to the final administrative records on STW usage by individual firms. Our analysis shows that a sizeable portion of the overreporting can be traced back to sample selection, such that establishments using STW are much more likely to participate in a survey that focuses on current business conditions. Yet, after reweighting observations to account for this, there still remains a significant difference. Our key novel finding is that this can be traced back to the way STW operates, allowing firms to decide flexibly about the actual use of STW and to claim reimbursement from the Federal Employment Agency with a delay of three months when settling the actual numbers of employees on STW. In fact, the firms’ survey responses become (more) accurate when they are asked about the use of STW in retrospect with a time delay of a few months. Furthermore, we document that establishments that are part of a larger firm containing multiple establishments exhibit less accuracy since one establishment can centrally claim STW for all of a firm’s establishments. Our results are relevant for the literature investigating the ramifications of STW on indivdual employees and employers and the policy debate on STW (Boeri and Bruecker 2011; OECD 2021), underscoring the importance of measurement error and suggesting some caution when one wants to evaluate STW based on survey data. Our study contributes to the broader literature on measurement error in surveys. For household surveys, this literature typically finds that the reporting error regarding past events increases with the time lag between the event time and the survey time (Bound et al. 2001). In contrast, we find that the error declines with a growing time gap after STW usage because firms know better when they submit the tally to ask for reimbursement by the Federal Employment Agency. Many business surveys ask about information recorded in the firm’s accounting system (Bavdaz 2010) and so a key aspect may be whether the respondent can query the desired accounting information or the interview situation allows forwarding specific questions to colleagues who know better. This paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 describes the institutional details of the German STW scheme (Kurzarbeit) that are relevant to our investigation. Section 3 analyses the STW differences in a monthly establishment survey, focusing on the potential confounding influences of sample selectivity, record linkage and establishment types which, however, cannot fully explain the observed differences. Section 4 extends the investigation to a yearly survey, comparing the pattern of differences between the two surveys and studying the role of retrospection. Section 5 investigates how accurate STW reporting varies with firm characteristics. Section 6 concludes.",2

The implementation of the so-called Bologna-Reform, with bachelor’s and master’s degrees, introduced a new aspect to the German education system, because until then an initial vocational qualification within approximately 3 years’ time could only be acquired in the (dual) vocational training system and not within higher education. Furthermore, the newly introduced short-track academic bachelor’s programmes are formally considered to impart the same level of competence as advanced further training programmes (such as master craftsman, technician or certified senior clerk) which mark the end of the vocational education path. Due to this constellation, the fear was expressed that employees trained in the prominent dual system could be substituted by persons with a bachelor’s degree (Drexel 2012) and the attractiveness of the vocational sector in Germany could be jeopardised (e.g. Deissinger 2015). Contrary to the substitution hypotheses, the first empirical studies highlighted the complementary aspects of the vocational and academic study programmes as they focus on different (practical versus theoretical) tasks (Hippach-Schneider et al. 2012; Bahl et al. 2011; Bott and Wünsche 2014). However, at the time the studies were conducted, there was little experience with bachelor’s graduates in the labour market, and the conclusions were rather preliminary, especially because a large proportion of bachelor’s graduates did not participate in the labour market but continued studying in a master’s programme (Briedis et al. 2011). Since then, we can observe a stagnation in the number of apprentices in the vocational sector and in advanced further training in Germany, whereas the amount of persons with bachelor’s degrees is continuously increasing (Ertl 2020). At the same time, employer surveys indicate, on the one hand, that persons with a bachelor’s degree have a high chance of being given responsibility for a project or even a business unit (Konegen-Grenier et al. 2015; Briedis et al. 2011). On the other hand, there are claims that bachelor’s graduates lack competencies due to their younger age and lack of experience and practical knowledge (DIHK 2015; Briedis et al. 2011). These diverse findings thus leave two important questions unanswered. First, it is still not clear whether employers regard bachelor’s graduates as substitutes for persons with advanced training degrees, especially if they have to choose between applicants with different qualification types. Second, it is unclear to what degree this decision-making process depends on the knowledge and experience of the decision makers with respect to bachelor’s graduates (Briedis et al. 2011). In this paper, I will address these two questions by introducing a choice experiment in an establishment survey,Footnote 1 in which human resources decision makers have to choose between three applicants for a project management position. According to the German Qualification Framework (GQF), the purpose of both bachelor’s degrees and advanced training programmes is to deliver competencies “for the planning, processing and evaluation of comprehensive technical tasks and problems.” In addition, persons holding such qualifications should be able to “assume responsibility when working within expert teams or demonstrate responsibility in leading groups or organisations”.Footnote 2 This makes it clear that employees with bachelor’s and advanced vocational education and training qualifications may well compete with one another within the company hierarchy to secure senior skilled worker positions or junior or middle management jobs. A project manager position represents the first rung on this career ladder. Choice experiments are methodologically designed for action and decision theories (Auspurg and Liebe 2011). They are therefore suitable for identifying decision-making behaviour in the recruitment process. It is assumed that the decision-makers make a rational choice (c.f. Lindenberg 1992) and select the applicant, who is most likely to have the skills required for the specified tasks and who incurs the lowest costs for the company, e.g. in terms of training time or wages. From an establishment perspective, it is therefore crucial to identify as many productivity-relevant characteristics of the applicants as possible in the recruitment process. However, in reality, decision-makers can only be boundedly rational utility maximisers because they have only limited knowledge of the market and on the productivity of the applicants. Furthermore, they have to consider the additional costs for obtaining missing information. In these situations of imperfect information, actors (can only) rely on existing knowledge gained in previous situations. Esser (1990, p. 236) argues that this preservation of previously successful “habits” and “frames” can be interpreted as a very rational matter. Due to differences in company experience and knowledge, it is therefore rational for companies to evaluate objectively identical personal attributes or signals of applicants (Spence 1973), such as educational qualifications, differently with regard to the tasks to be performed in the establishment (or the institutional context, see Di Stasio and Van de Werfhorst 2016). I argue that establishments have heterogeneous knowledge and experience of the rather newly introduced bachelor degrees and that this knowledge and experience influences the choice for applicants with this educational certificate. I differentiate between three ways in which establishments can obtain information about the actual skills and abilities that are certified in a training curriculum. First, they can infer the possible heterogeneity of skills among applicants with the same certificate from the degree of standardisation of the certificate (Damelang et al. 2018). Second, they can engage in the training process. And third, they can infer the skills from persons with an equal or similar degree who already work at the establishment. The majority of the German workforce is trained in nationally standardised training courses governed by the Vocational Training Act (BBiG) and Crafts and Trades Regulation Code (HwO).Footnote 3 Training courses governed by the BBiG/HwO are regulated on the federal state level and therefore comparable across Germany. Damelang et al. (2018) show that a standardisation of an occupation facilitates the matching process because information for both employers and job seekers is enhanced. Advanced further training programmes can only be accessed after a successful apprenticeship according to BBiG/HwO and are also, to some extent, nationally standardised (§ 53 BBiG/§ 42 HwO). But even if responsibility for the advanced training regulation is transferred to the competent bodies (§ 54 BBiG/§ 42 a HwO), advanced training, such as to become a master craftsman, technician or certified senior clerk, has a long tradition and is widely disseminated and known in the German labour market. It can thus be assumed that employers have less transaction costs (Williamson 1975) in assessing the expected productivity of applicants with an advanced further training degree as they should have some confidence in the quality of this educational signal (Breen 2005). Even though, it has to be admitted that one of the aims of the Bologna process was to standardise curricula for different degrees and to gain clarity over different degrees` skills, the degrees` standardisation within Germany is still less than in the vocational sector. This is because the design of the training curricula of bachelor programmes is the responsibility of the universities (of applied science). Furthermore, the rather new educational certificate is less rooted in the German labour market than advanced further training programmes. Without further information on the applicants, the following hypothesis should therefore apply: Applicants with advanced further training have a higher chance of being recruited for a project management position than persons with a bachelor’s degree when recruited from the external labour market. However, the degree of standardisation is not the only difference between advanced further training programmes and bachelor degrees. Training courses governed by BBiG/HWO impart rather specific skills, whereas academic programmes rather concentrate on generic skills. This is because in the German vocational sector, responsibility for training is shared between establishments and vocational schools, whereas in the academic sector, study programmes are organised by universities (of applied science) and concentrate rather on theoretical than practical knowledge. Without specifying the tasks of a project management position, it should remain unclear for establishments, which skill set of the applicants (specific or generic) is best suited for the position. However, the shared training responsibility in the vocational sector has the advantage that establishments get informed about the productivity of the apprentices during the apprenticeship (Acemoglu and Pischke 1998) and in the following advanced further training. Establishments have usually less screening possibilities of bachelor’s students (Neeß 2015). Dual courses of higher education study constitute a distinctive aspect in this context. They enable establishments to engage in the training process of bachelor’s degree students (Graf 2016; Ertl 2020). On the one hand, Practice-integrated programmes of study merely require students to complete longer practical placements at establishments. These practical phases are credited as academic achievements (Wissenschaftsrat 2013). Training-integrated programmes of study, on the other hand, provide a curriculum that combines nationally standardised training courses governed by BBiG/HwO and higher education study. Similar to advanced further training programmes, students in a dual course of study should acquire specific rather than generic skills. Furthermore, possible information asymmetries are reduced, if the establishment is actually engaged in the training of bachelor’s students in a dual course of study. Therefore, no preference for one of the two educational certificates should be apparent. Establishments, which train bachelor’s students in dual courses of study, do not prefer applicants with advanced further training to applicants with bachelor’s degrees for a project management position. The application of “habits” and “frames” in situations of imperfect situations as suggested by Esser (1990) signifies that human resources decision makers rely on knowledge and experiences gained from similar situations in the past. Instead of acquiring information while engaging in the training of students in dual courses of study, decision makers could also base their judgement on workers with bachelor degrees, who already work for the establishment. Furthermore, in case of insecurity this similar qualified “personal contacts” (Granovetter 1995) within the establishment could be asked to gain additional information on the quality of the educational signal. Establishments, which employ persons with bachelor’s degrees within their establishment, do not prefer applicants with advanced further training to applicants with bachelor’s degrees for a project management position.",
56,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,11 April 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-022-00308-5,The impact of the coronavirus on African American unemployment: lessons from history,December 2022,Ernst Coupet,Ehab Yamani,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The coronavirus is a rapidly evolving health pandemic that will have repercussions beyond individual health and the U.S. healthcare system. It has become clear that the outbreak of COVID-19 has disrupted the U.S. economy in general, and its economic impact on the labor market is unprecedented and highly uncertain making it more difficult for policymakers to formulate an appropriate policy response. Over decades, we find no other infectious disease outbreak that had more than a tiny effect on the U.S. labor market. It is notable that there will be a significant household and macroeconomic impact as this virus have generated large reductions in employment and earnings in the U.S. labor market and thus triggering an economic recession. This, however, is only a partial effect on the labor market. While the virus shock will affect household employment and income, we anticipate that the economic impact is not likely to be equal across different racial groups among U.S. workers who will experience these disruptions differently. The existing literature emphasizes unemployment differentials (Hellerstein et al., 2008; Boustan and Margo, 2009; Bond and Lehmann, 2018; Yu and Sun, 2019; Button and Walker, 2020; Couch et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2021; Macartney et al., 2021; Mandel and Semyonov, 2021) as well as income differentials (Tangentially, Ileanu, and Tanasoiu, 2008; Raymond, 2018; Abdul Khalid and Yang, 2021; Chantreuil et al., 2021; Contreras et al., 2021; Ren, 2022) among different racial groups of workers. In this article, we are motivated by such research on racial disparities and our goal is to examine the effect of the Coronavirus may have had on the state of racial disparities among the African American labor community. To better understand the possible racial disparities, we attempt to quantify the potential economic impact of COVID-19 on the African American labor market by controlling for two effects, namely, employment differentials and income differentials. First, employment differentials effect. Under this analysis, we classify COVID-19 as an external shock (i.e., an unplanned and unexpected event) that can have a substantial impact on the labor market. Using monthly and quarterly U.S. unemployment data defined by race, we analyze the short-run effect of an exogenous shock by testing for Granger causality using cointegration and error-correction models. For comparative measures, we predict the unemployment differentials effect by drawing comparisons to the two most recent economic recessions: the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001 (9/11) and the 2008 global financial crisis. The rationale for examining these two historic recessions is to learn how different racial groups might be impacted by exogenous shocks in two different scenarios, and therefore, we can predict how different racial groups might fare from a recession that may follow the COVID-19 pandemic.Footnote 1 Second, income differentials effect. We extend our analysis further and present a comparative income differential analysis across various racial groups in the City of Chicago. To this end, we use data for all 77 neighborhood areas of the City of Chicago, to better quantify the effect of the virus may have had on the black employment in the south and southeast sides of the city of Chicago, which are mostly populated by African Americans. We apply a traditional earnings function model to understand the net effect of the COVID-19 on the South and Southeast sides of the of City which are populated mostly by African Americans. Our main finding is that firms in the labor market appear to prefer white employees to African American and Hispanics, suggesting that firms do not treat these laborers from the two markets as homogeneous. This conclusion is attested by several interesting findings that emerge from our unemployment differentials and income differentials analyses. First, our unemployment differentials results show that the level of national African American unemployment is nearly twice that of the white unemployment over the entire full sample period. Furthermore, while the two examined recession episodes (i.e., the September 11 terrorist attack and the 2007–2008 recession) experienced exogenous shocks to the labor market and led to significant increases in the unemployment rates in all sectors, the increase in unemployment rate in the white sector paled to that of the African American sector. Along the same lines, we also find that white unemployment Granger-causes African American unemployment, indicating a long-run association between white unemployment and African American unemployment, in the sense that unemployment is first decreased in the white sector, followed by a lagged unemployment decrease in the African American labor market. This finding suggest that most of the unemployment in the white sector are of the structural and frictional forms, while the African American unemployment is largely cyclical in nature. Put differently, the African American labor market appears to serve as a secondary labor market to the white sector that fills in during expansionary times but suffers great losses during economic downturns. Second, our income differentials analysis results show that such observed racial disparities are even larger among the African American labor community in the City of Chicago. We find that African American workers in the Southeast and South sides of Chicago suffer from higher unemployment rates with higher volatility, lower median incomes, and they are more likely to work in the service sector, compared to their counterparts in other parts of the City. Our findings have important policy implications. While it is uncertain to know for sure what will be the effect of this purely healthy-related exogenous shock to the economy, the effect of the COVID-19 virus is certain to be deep and broad for the African Americans who suffer from higher unemployment rates and lower median incomes. To alleviate this expected hardship, targeted public policy should be introduced so that we must allocate funding and resources to where they are most needed, and policy recommendations must be reflective of this reality. A uniform policy approach will not address the varied needs of groups and communities. Hence, we propose two targeted policy recommendations. First, we recommend stimulating private fixed capital formation in African American communities by providing guaranteed heavily subsidized loans to those investing in African American communities. Our second recommendation is to enforce fair wages to ensure equitable wages across the labor markets. There is an abundance of evidence suggesting that the marginal product of labor is not compensated equitably across various sectors of the labor market. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature. Section 3 outlines the econometric methodology which we employ. Our data are presented in Sect. 4. Sections 5 reports and discusses our empirical results. Section 6 concludes.",1

Narayanan and Lai (2014) have found that immigrant workers have lower wages compared to their non-immigrant counterparts and that the flow of unskilled foreign workers reduced the pressure on firms to embark on industrial upgrading. Kaur (2008) has shown that the 1986 global economic recession has caused the government of Malaysia to realise that there has been an intensified competition between natives and immigrants in the job market. In response to this, in 1990, the Malaysian government has introduced migration reforms in an attempt to discourage and reduce migration flows (Blanca 2010). For example, some reforms  have aimed at increasing the cost of hiring immigrant workers and imposing a freeze on the recruitment of immigrant workers. Another set of reforms aimed at forcing immigrants to leave Malaysia (Gurowitz 2000). However, considering labour market demand pressures, the above restrictions have been relaxed in more recent years. New immigration policies have allowed immigrant workers to stay in Malaysia for a short period, with the option of applying for a permanent residency after a continuous stay of 5 years. The Immigration Department has issued various types of work permits, based on the sector of employment, duration of permits, costs, recruitment procedures, benefits, and protections (Del Carpio, Karupiah, Marouani, Ozden, Testaverde, Wagner, 2013). In addition, immigrant workers are allowed to work in most industries except employment in national security. As a result, there has been a significant increase in migration flows in Malaysia. The Department of Statistics Malaysia (2017) reported that in the year 2004, the number of immigrant workers was 993,235, about 9.4 percent of the total labour force. The number of immigrant workers has increased by 115 percent to 2,139,540 workers in 2015, and it amounts to 15 percent of the total workforce. In a recent study, Abdullah et al. (2020) explored the wage differentials between native and immigrant workers in the Malaysian labour market, and although differences in endowments explain a large part of immigrant-native wage differentials, the unexplained component (largely attributed to discrimination) also plays a significant role. Importantly, the above literature has predominantly focused on the supply side, with scarce attention paid to exploring the impact of demand side effects. This study considers both the labour supply and demand effects in explaining the immigrant and native wage determination and their respective wage differentials in Malaysia. It further assesses the relative importance of supply and demand factors in explaining these wage differentials. An important innovative aspect of this study is the use of a matched employee-employer dataset, that provides rich information on firm characteristics, thus capturing demand side effects that, as mentioned above, have been neglected in the existing literature. Human capital theory proposes that the level of wages is explained by worker characteristics. Thus, wage determination is driven by workers’ individual characteristics that are rewarded in the labour market. However, Krueger and Summers (1988) argue that different employees, although they may have similar characteristics and qualifications, may earn different wages since some firms pay higher wages because their objective is not only to maximise profit but also to serve other objectives. Thus, wage levels for similar individuals may vary across firms because firms are not identical, but differ in terms of their capacity, objectives, strategy, technology, and so on. Indeed, Wachtel and Betsey (1972) have shown that the demand side factors, firm structural characteristics or other firm characteristics, are crucial in determining the level of wages. In view of this, in studying wage determination, one should also consider factors other than individual characteristics that might influence wages (Sørensen and Vejlin 2013). Hartog (2000) developed a framework based on assignment theory that focuses predominantly on the demand side. Within this model, an optimal allocation of workers implies the assignment of highly skilled workers to complex jobs, whereas the lesser skilled workers are hired to perform simple job tasks (Allen and Velden 2001). The assignment of workers to jobs that require lower education than their actual qualifications is considered non-optimal because the workers do not fully use their skills and knowledge. As a result, this mismatch leads to lower productivity and subsequently lower wages, compared to workers of the same educational level who are adequately matched to the skill/education requirements of their job (Pietro and Urwin 2006). Hence, wages are determined not only by the human capital embodied in the workers, as predicted by the human capital theory, but also by the level of pay the particular job, to which the worker is matched, commands. Furthermore, evidence from the rent sharing literature, based on matched worker-firm data, suggests that the elasticity of wages with respect to worker productivity does not exceed 0.15. In addition, wage determination literature suggests that demand side factors explain 20 percent of the observed wage variation. Card et al. (2018) developed a static monopsony model to explain these findings and to provide a framework to explain the relationship between firm productivity and wages that is not explained by supply side characteristics. In summary, although there is a large and well-established body of literature demonstrating the effect of ‘supply side’ labour market factors on wage differentials there is still a paucity of studies that focus on the ‘demand side’ effects, especially with reference to the native and immigrant wage differentials. Therefore, the objectives of this study are first, to identify the demand side effect on the wage variation of native and immigrant workers; and second, to explore the relative importance of demand and supply factors in explaining these wage differentials in the Malaysian labour market.",

However, a core element of many welfare systems is the principle of rights and duties. This means that eligible individuals are provided with the necessary means by which to secure a minimum standard of living and receive additional support to achieve labor market integration. In return, benefit recipients must strive toward ending their need for support as soon as possible. Hence, benefit recipients are obliged, e.g., to search for a job and take up suitable job offers. Benefit sanctions can be imposed to ensure that benefit recipients comply with their duties. In Germany, the unemployment benefit system consists of two tiers. First, individuals can receive unemployment benefits I (UB I), which is comparable to unemployment insurance benefits schemes in other countries, for a limited amount of time if they fulfill the qualifying period among other requirements. The amount of UB I depends on previous wages. Individuals not fulfilling the eligibility criteria for UB I or who have exhausted their claim, can receive unemployment benefits II (UB II), which is the German scheme of (means-tested) welfare benefits. In contrast to UB I, the receipt of UB II is not time limited and depends on household composition.Footnote 1 This paper focuses on welfare benefits in the German benefit system, i.e. UB II. The existing empirical literature provides some evidence that benefit sanctions can have a positive impact on reemployment rates.Footnote 2 Busk (2016) compares the effect of sanctions for individuals receiving earnings-related unemployment benefits and individuals receiving welfare benefits in Finland and finds that effects of sanctions differ across benefit schemes. While sanctions increase employment rates for welfare benefit recipients, recipients of unemployment insurance benefits are more likely to leave the labor force following a sanction. The literature also provides evidence that benefit sanctions can have negative impacts on the quality of future employment, resulting in lower earnings, shorter job durations, switching to part-time employment or changing to lower occupational levels as well as withdrawal from the labor force.Footnote 3 Qualitative studies by Götz et al. (2010) and Schreyer et al. (2012) further illustrate how severe sanctions in particular can lead to negative effects for sanctioned welfare recipients in Germany; e.g., recipients face the risk of accumulating debt, losing their home, the (at least temporary) severance of contact with the job centerFootnote 4 or leaving the labor market and engaging in a shadow economy. In its ruling at the end of 2019, the German Constitutional Court declared that sanctions above 30% of the basic cash benefit of an individual are not in accordance with the requirements of the basic right to a guaranteed subsistence minimum (German Federal Constitutional Court 2019; Gantchev 2020). Since then, sanction amounts have been limited to 30% of the basic cash benefits. In its ruling, the German Constitutional Court criticized the fixed duration of the benefit sanctions independent of subsequent behavior, as well as the insufficient empirical evidence that more severe sanctions (above 30% of the basic cash benefits) further improve labor market integration. The Court also concludes that there seems to be inconsistences in the results of the existing empirical literature, which is partly due to the lack of suitable datasets (German Federal Constitutional Court 2019, sec. 61). Additional data can therefore help to shed more light on the effects of benefit sanctions, which is especially relevant in light of recent policy changes in the German welfare system. Thus, the aim of this paper is to analyze the research potential of combining data from the IT procedure used for processing unemployment benefit II claims (ALLEGRO; Department of Statistics of the Federal Employment Agency 2020a)Footnote 5 with already established administrative datasets about welfare receipt for future studies of benefit sanctions in the German welfare system. This paper illustrates exemplary findings and research potentials by shedding more light on the sanction process and on the distribution of sanction amounts across different subgroups. For this purpose, this paper uses a random sample of individuals with at least one imposed sanction between 2016 and 2018.Footnote 6 The paper contributes to the existing literature in three ways. First, the existing analyses on benefit sanctions in Germany focus on sanctions that were implemented and led to a reduction in unemployment benefits.Footnote 7 Combining data from the operational system and established datasets allows the identification of sanction periods that were imposed but could not be fully or only partially implemented. A possible explanation for this outcome is the observed time lag between the event that caused a sanction and the start of the corresponding sanction period. Thus, I am able to show that a large share of this group leaves the welfare system before or early during the sanction period and takes up employment in the meantime. Existing studies using the established datasets might therefore not completely capture the impact of unemployment benefit II sanctions in Germany. Second, most datasets that are used to analyze the effects of sanctions in the German welfare system on labor market outcomes only include the start and end dates of a sanction period. Thus, little is known about the time lag between different steps of the sanction process, e.g., between the event that caused a benefit sanction and the observed starting date of the sanction, and how such a time lag might affect the impact of a sanction.Footnote 8 This information is important for studies analyzing the effect of benefit sanctions which in general rely on individuals not anticipating a pending sanction. Otherwise individuals could increase their job-search activities resulting in them leaving welfare receipt before the implementation of a sanction. Using data from a random sample of sanctioned welfare recipients, this study provides a more detailed analysis of the time lag between different steps in the sanction process. In line with Wolff and Moczall (2012), I find that the decision process seems to be quicker for sanctions due to minor noncompliance actions, which are therefore implemented in closer proximity to the sanction event. However, I observe a larger time lag between sanction events and the start of sanction periods in comparison to Wolff and Moczall (2012). In addition, I analyze how much time passes between different sanction events for the same person. Again, I find substantial differences between sanction events due to minor noncompliance actions in comparison to severe infringements. Third, the Department of Statistics of the German Federal Employment Agency provides some basic information on the sanction amounts of welfare recipients (see Department of Statistics of the Federal Employment Agency 2020b). However, apart from that information, little is known about how sanction amounts differ across subgroups. Using detailed administrative data on sanction amounts and welfare benefit receipt, I analyze the sanction amounts for different subgroups, i.e., by gender, age and type of benefit unit, as well as level of education. In addition, the information on actual benefit cuts could be useful for future studies to disentangle the impact of different sanction amounts, which capture the severity of benefit sanctions, for an individual. This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 gives an overview of the institutional background. Section 3 introduces the datasets used for this analysis. Section 4 shows the results, and Section 5 concludes.",

While male careers are less life-course dependent, women more often withdraw from the labor market or reduce their working hours after giving birth to a child (Lundborg et al. 2017). Hence, policymakers advocate an expansion of publicly subsidized child care in order to strengthen the employment potential in ageing societies. Indeed, the female employment rate turns out to be higher in countries such as the Scandinavian states where child care is sufficiently provided (Morrissey 2017). However, empirical studies cannot unanimously support a positive causal relationship between subsidized child care and female employment outcomes. I address this issue by evaluating not only the effect of low-cost subsidized child care on the employment share and agreed weekly working hours, but I further inform these debates by also examining underlying working hour preferences. Working hour discrepancies are quite common in industrialized countries as previous studies suggest (Drago et al. 2005; Ehing 2014; Fagan 2001; Merz 2002; Pollmann-Schult 2009; Reynolds 2003, 2004). Hence, evaluating if the availability of subsidized child care can affect working hour discrepancies is important in ageing societies as fulfilling a preference for more or less hours has positive effects on the employment potential and on individual life, health or work measures (Ehing 2014; Matiaske et al. 2017). Examining working hour preferences in addition to agreed hours might be more informative as they tell more about the underlying reasons of labour supply. While short working hours are considered to be one of the main reasons for the gender wage gap (Goldin 2014), they can also be the voluntary wish of a mother who is more satisfied with reduced working hours. In 2008, the German government formulated a law for the expansion of subsidized child care for children aged one to three (Kinderförderungsgesetz KiföG) culminating in a legal claim for a child care slot from August 2013 onwards. I use the exogenous variation of the expansion of subsidized child care induced by the reform in 2013 to compare districts in which the coverage rate increased significantly (the treated or high-expansion group) with those for which the coverage rate changed only by a small amount (the control or low-expansion group). To be more concrete, I follow the approach of Bauernschuster et al. (2016), Felfe et al. (2015) and Havnes and Mogstad (2011) who exploit spatial variation of German districts, Spanish states and Norwegian districts respectively for which the child care coverage expanded differently after the legal framework had changed. The authors define control and treatment group by dividing the observational units at the median of the percentage point change in the coverage rate. Thus, the difference-in-differences (DiD) strategy compares labor market outcomes of mothers with children aged up to 3 years in treated districts with those where child care increases to a lesser extent before and after the legal claim came into force. In comparison to related studies in which the child care coverage rate is on similar levels close to zero in the treatment and control group before the reform (Bauernschuster et al. 2016; Felfe et al. 2015; Havnes and Mogstad 2011), child care is already established in both groups in this setting, but on a lower level in districts with a higher expansion up to the year 2015 (“catch-up effect”). While other articles evaluate earlier periods of the German child care expansion (Bauernschuster et al. 2016; Müller and Wrohlich 2020), this article sets 2013 as the target year when every child is entitled to a childcare slot.Footnote 1 I analyze the German labor market as an interesting example for the persistence of traditional employment patterns. About one quarter of part-time working women states the care for children or for people in need of care to be the reason for the employment status (Wanger 2015). Hence, the reform implemented in 2013 had a high potential to increase female employment both in terms of the extensive and intensive margin. Especially involuntarily underemployed mothers might have raised agreed hours. Instead of applying a linear OLS estimator, a two-stage semi-parametric DiD estimation procedure proposed by Abadie (2005) is used such that the linear form assumption in the outcome equation does not need to hold and observations without overlap of the control variables can be dropped. Moreover, the approach allows to infer heterogeneous treatment effects. I use a rich data set from the German Microcensus which is a 1% representative sample of German households (Research Data Centre 2011, 2015). The repeated cross-sections contain information on the household composition and its economic and social background and the data allows to examine over- and underemployment as well as individual working hour preferences. The resulting intention-to-treat estimates give a positive impact both on the extensive and intensive margin. Mothers of up to 3-year-olds in districts with a large increase of the child care coverage rate have a 5.7 percentage points higher employment rate after the reform than their counterparts in districts with a lower expansion of subsidized child care. Agreed and preferred working hours are on average about 5 h per week higher and change similarly such that their mismatch is not affected. I furthermore show that the estimates are higher for better educated mothers and that the adjustment mechanism of agreed and preferred working hours differs for cohabiting mothers. The paper proceeds as follows: The next section gives an overview on previous empirical studies. Section 3 explains the institutional background of the German child care system including its reform and how it is exploited for the estimation strategy. Furthermore, the data is presented. The estimation results can be found in Sect. 4. The last section concludes.",

While the unemployment rate has worsened with various crises from the past to the present, it has remained more stable in some periods. Although it seems to be a bigger problem for underdeveloped countries, it affects all countries in times of crisis. The economic crises and their social effects in recent years have increased the interest of economists and other social sciences, such as sociology and psychology. Unemployment has been shown to negatively affect individuals’ life satisfaction, access to economic resources and mental health (Pohlan 2019). It also affects food security (Haini et al. 2022) and has been found to increase the risk of social exclusion (Kieselbach 2003; Popîrlan et al. 2021). However, it can bring complex experiences in terms of social class position and cultural context (Ali et al. 2013). Weak demand in the economy leads to unemployment. Lower demand means less labour is needed, leading to reduced working hours or lay-offs. In countries with high unemployment, one of the most important policies is to ensure that the unemployed find work and receive social support. Failure to do so can lead to social instability, which affects the development of a country in all aspects. An increase in the unemployment rate reduces individual and social income, increases poverty and creates inequity in income distribution. Therefore, if the government can forecast the number and rate of unemployed workers, it can implement policies and measures that will ensure the welfare and development of the country according to these forecast data (Chakraborty et al. 2021). Therefore, accurate estimation of the unemployment rate is important for experts and policymakers in planning a country’s economic policies (Lai et al. 2021). Studies in the literature have drawn attention to the links between unemployment, gross domestic product (GDP), migration and social life (Fendel 2014; Krug et al. 2019; Ochsen and Welsch 2011; Iuga and Cioca 2013; Cazzola et al. 2016). The accuracy of predictions about the future has a direct impact on the success of the policies and decisions taken. For this reason, not only is the subject of forecasting important, but also the accuracy of the forecast is critical. In addition, the fact that decision-makers can make more successful decisions thanks to accurate forecasts increases the interest in forecasting studies. The unemployment rate has been a significant concern since the 1970s, when high inflation, high unemployment, and slow economic growth first emerged (Brunner et al. 1980). However, many statistical and econometric techniques have been used in the literature on unemployment estimation. Yet, in recent years, researchers have increasingly focused on using machine learning and deep learning models for this purpose. Sermpinis et al. (2014) used a hybrid method consisting of genetic algorithms and support vector regression in their study. The results showed better performance than other methods used for comparison in the study. Stasinakis et al. (2016) investigated the effectiveness of Radial Based Function Neural Networks (RBFNN) in predicting unemployment in the US. They also examined the usefulness of the Kalman filter and support vector regression as forecasting combination techniques. The results show that RBFNN statistically outperforms the individual performance of all models. Davidescu et al. (2021a) applied seasonal model autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR), Holt-Winters, ETS (error, trend, seasonal) and NNAR (neural network autoregression) to the unemployment rate in Romania. Lai et al. (2021) forecast unemployment for five developed and five developing countries in Asia. In the study, where ARIMA-ARNN, ARIMA-ANN, and ARIMA-SVM models were used, the hybrid ARIMA-ARNN model was found to perform well among all the hybrid models for the developed countries in Asia. Davidescu et al. (2021b) used univariate and multivariate methods to forecast the unemployment rate in Romania. The empirical results show that SETAR and VECM provide comparable results in terms of accuracy, accurately reflecting the pre-pandemic period. Chakraborty et al. (2021), using unemployment rate data from seven countries, found that the hybrid method used produced more meaningful results than the traditional methods. Another study using hybrid methods found that ARIMA-ARNN and ARIMA-SVM methods produced successful results (Ahmad et al. 2021). The study by Katris (2020) found that different methods were successful depending on the length of the forecast period. While fractional ARIMA (FARIMA) was successful for 1-step forecasts, neural network models were successful for 12-step forecasts. Google Trend indices were used by Simionescu and Cifuentes-Faura (2022) to forecast youth unemployment in Spain. Bayesian panel data models and fixed effects models were used to study regional data, while Bayesian vector autoregressive models and vector error correction models were used for national data. The Bayesian forecasting results provided the best forecasts for the nine regions. Gogas et al. (2022) used decision trees, random forests and support vector machines in their study of forecasting unemployment in the euro area. The Random Forest method achieved higher accuracy than other models. The aim of this study is to investigate how accurately the hybrid method developed using LSTM and GRU methodologies can predict unemployment rates. Hypothesis statements within the scope of the study are presented as follows. The hybrid method created with LSTM and GRU methodologies will provide high accuracy in estimating the unemployment rate. Different datasets used in the study will affect the unemployment rate estimation accuracy of the hybrid method. This study presents a new model for forecasting unemployment using univariate time series. Unemployment rate data for the years 1983(1)–2010(6) were used as the training set. The test set was used between 2010 (7) and 2022 (5). Although the unemployment rate has been predicted by various linear and non-linear methods in the literature, the presentation of a new hybrid model is the original aspect of the study. There is still a need for methods that offer better performance in forecasting the unemployment rate. The paper is structured as follows: In Part 2, the data and techniques are briefly reviewed, and in Part 3, empirical results are summarized. Finally, Chap. 4 concludes with conclusions and recommendations.",

In 2020, Latin American GDP shrank by 6.8%, representing the biggest regional economic crisis ever recorded since the early twentieth century (ECLAC 2021a). The pandemic broke out in a region already characterised by an economic slowdown or reversal of labour improvements achieved over the previous years, where labour informality and inequality were still high, and social welfare and health systems, very weak. Given this context, the crisis struck harder in employment than in economic activity and the impact was highly unequalizing because informal workers, low-skilled workers and women were disproportionately affected by it. This article analyses, from a dynamic and comparative perspective, short-term labour transitions triggered by the pandemic in six Latin American countries: Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay, and Peru. Special attention is paid to transits around labour informality. In particular, we analyse the transition matrices between different labour statuses, the entry and exit rates from and into formality and informality, and the probabilities of transition for different groups of people. The labour dynamics experienced by women and men are evaluated. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to evaluate the labour market effects of the pandemic in a wide set of Latin American countries from a dynamic perspective, particularly focusing on labour informality. Three aspects of the paper are worth highlighting. First, this study uses information on labour transitions besides the most traditional cross-sectional data. This dynamic approach contributes to deepening the knowledge of the impacts of the pandemic on Latin American labour markets, since it allows us to identify the intensity and direction of the labour flows during this crisis. This aspect becomes even more relevant given the high occupational turnover that characterises Latin America (Beccaria and Maurizio 2020). Second, this article deals with a relevant topic because informality is one of the most distinctive features of labour markets in this region. In the fourth quarter of 2019, almost 50% of workers held informal occupations (ILO 2021b). The informality rate was even higher in three out of the six countries under study: Mexico (55%), Paraguay (69%) and Peru (71%). Argentina (45%), Brazil (39%) and Costa Rica (43%) stood below the regional average, though these rates were also high. Informality, in turn, is an important source of occupational instability in Latin America (Beccaria and Maurizio 2020). Moreover, in this crisis, informality behaved differently when compared to previous crises because it did not play its typical counter-cyclical role. Therefore, the analysis of flows from and into labour informality enables us to characterise in greater detail the dynamic of this type of occupation throughout the period under analysis. Third, a comparative analysis is performed involving six Latin American countries. The selection of this set of countries provides a broad picture of the labour impacts of COVID-19 in Latin America, as it makes possible the consideration of cases with different occupational and income structures. At the same time, since the largest countries are included, this selection accounts for about 70% of the overall population in the region. However, given the high heterogeneity between these labour markets, the descriptive and econometric results are presented separately for each country and then a comparative analysis among them is carried out. This paper uses microdata from regular household surveys conducted by each country’s national institutes of statistics. Although these surveys are not longitudinal, their rotating panel schemes allow short-term flow data to be drawn from them. In addition to the descriptive analysis of transitions matrices, econometric regressions were run to estimate the probabilities of transitions between formal and informal occupations, unemployment and inactivity. Our results show that, in contrast to previous crises, the drop in informal occupations magnified the overall employment contraction. This was driven by a notable rise in exit rates from this job type, and to a lesser degree, by a drop in entry rates. In most of the countries studied, stability gaps between formal and informal occupations broadened. Most of the informal workers who lost their jobs, left the labour force. On the other side, transits from informal to formal jobs reduced significantly during the most critical point of this crisis. The evident greater job losses suffered by women during this period were not explained by a more intense increase in the probabilities of losing an informal job in comparison with men. Rather, the more precarious employment composition and increasing constraints on women's labour supply explain this result. Symmetrically, during the subsequent recovery phase—since mid-2020—the rise in total employment was led by a rise in informal jobs. The drop in the intensity of exit rates from these occupations mostly explained this behaviour, although a greater intensity in entry flows to informality from inactivity also accounted for this trend. The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 presents the literature review. Section 3 describes the sources of information and methodologies used. Section 4 details the definition and measurement of labour informality. Section 5 presents an overview of the labour crisis triggered by COVID-19 in the six countries under study. Section 6 analyses the labour exit and entry rates and labour destinations after leaving an informal job. Section 7 presents the assessment of attrition and its correction. Finally, Sect. 8 concludes.",
57,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,20 April 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-023-00337-8,How elastic is labor demand? A meta-analysis for the German labor market,December 2023,Martin Popp,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The own-wage elasticity of labor demand is a key determinant of the labor market, reflecting the responsiveness of firms’ employment decision to wage changes (i.e., the inverse slope of the labor demand curve). In general, the own-wage elasticity of labor demand determines the effectiveness of labor market policies that shape the incentives behind employers’ employment and hours decisions (Hamermesh 1993). If a minimum wage is set above the equilibrium wage rate, firms in competitive labor markets will reduce their labor demand, and, hence, unemployment arises (Stigler 1946). The resulting increase in unemployment is a function of the own-wage elasticity of labor demand (Lee and Saez 2012). Moreover, depending on this parameter, an increase in the statutory overtime premium will make firms substitute incumbent workers’ overtime hours by additional workers (Ehrenberg 1971; Trejo 1993). In collective bargaining, a higher own-wage elasticity of labor demand reduces the wage claims of unions (Dunlop 1944; Nickell and Andrews 1983). Other than that, an influx of migrants may have negative effects on native workers’ wage rates. Specifically, the decline in wages increases with the slope of the labor demand curve (Borjas 2003). Apart from labor economics, the own-wage elasticity of labor demand plays also a key role in many other subfields. Regarding public finance, wage elasticities of labor demand govern the incidence of payroll taxes (Harberger 1971; Brittain 1971). Specifically, increased responsiveness of firms to wage changes raises workers’ share in the deadweight loss from taxation. Hence, elasticities of labor demand constitute an important input for optimal taxation models (Jacquet et al. 2014). In international economics, globalization is supposed to flatten the demand curve (Rodrik 1997; Slaughter 2001). Consequently, wage elasticities serve as a key parameter in models of trade (Rauch and Trindade 2003). Finally, estimates of the own-wage elasticity of labor demand serve as inputs for the calibration of computable general equilibrium models (Boeters and Savard 2013) and microsimulation models of labor markets (Peichl and Siegloch 2012). Due to the wide range of applications, a vast number of studies has estimated own-wage elasticities of labor demand of various types. The elasticity depends on firms’ production technology as well the structure of underlying product and labor markets. Hence, variation in this elasticity reflects systematic differences across employers, workers, and time. In this paper, I perform an extensive meta-regression analysis to systematically explore the nature and heterogeneity of the own-wage elasticity of labor demand. To this end, I collect a total of 705 elasticity estimates from 105 different studies that refer to the German labor market. Specifically, I examine whether the reported elasticities support the implications from labor demand theory—relating to firms’ output decision and the time horizon. Another aim of this meta-analysis is to show whether the own-wage elasticity of labor demand is sensitive to the choice of the empirical specification, such as imposing theoretical structure on or using instrumental variables in the estimation. Finally, the meta-regressions will inspect potential heterogeneity of the own-wage elasticity of labor demand regarding different types of firms (e.g., by region or export status) and workers (e.g., by education or contract type). Several studies already provide meta-analytic evidence on labor demand for single non-European countries (Doucouliagos 1997; Mora and Muro 2019) and the international literature (Lichter et al. 2015). Despite this evidence, the German labor market deserves a meta-analysis on its own. On the one hand, the German economy—the world’s fourth largest by GDP with a total of 45 million workers—features several idiosyncrasies that may govern firms’ responsiveness to wage changes in a special way: namely strong labor market rigidities (Schneider and Rinne 2019), an economic divide between West and East German labor markets (Schnabel 2016), the importance of the dual vocational system (Rhein et al. 2013), an extraordinarily high export share (Lichter et al. 2017), and long-term demographic decline (Hamm et al. 2008). Given the specific nature of the German labor market, it is therefore likely that domestic peculiarities do not surface in the existing meta-analyses. In the course of this meta-study, I will therefore discuss all the above-mentioned German idiosyncrasies through the lens of the results, addressing East–West differences, various types of educational attainment, and international activities of firms explicitly as covariates in the meta-regression analysis. In doing so, this study expands early literature reviews on German labor demand that summarize merely a handful of studies (Riphahn et al. 1999; Sinn et al. 2006). On the other hand, in the recent past, the German labor market has been hallmarked by two events whose implications are largely determined by the wage elasticity of labor demand, thus prompting the need for a thorough examination of this parameter in the national context. To begin with, the first-time introduction of a nation-wide minimum wage in 2015 triggered heated debates among researchers and policy-makers about the magnitude of potential lay-offs. Based on labor demand elasticities from single studies or values deemed plausible, ex-ante simulations predicted negative employment effects ranging from 425,000 up to 1.4 million workers (Müller and Steiner 2013; Arni et al. 2014; Henzel and Engelhardt 2014; Knabe et al. 2014) which, however, did not materialize in the end (Bossler and Gerner 2020; Dustmann et al. 2022). In addition, migration into Germany accelerated over the past decade, resulting in a net migration inflow of around 4.6 million people between 2011 and 2020 (Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge 2022). The high levels of immigration raise some concerns about a decline in wages for native workers which, according to partial equilibrium theory, may occur through an expansion of labor supply along a finitely-elastic labor demand curve. While experimental research on earlier migration waves shows mixed results (Glitz 2012; Dustmann et al. 2017), the own-wage elasticity of labor demand can lead to a ballpark estimate for the wage decline in the absence of general equilibrium effects. Taken together, by synthesizing the entire literature rather than relying on singular studies, a separate meta-analysis for the German labor market can shed further light on these two important issues and may guide researchers in building models to assess minimum wage policies (e.g., Müller 2009) or migration flows (e.g., Felbermayr et al. 2010). This meta-analysis offers 12 main results for the German labor market. First, the average own-wage elasticity of labor demand is \(-\)0.43, which lies in the middle of the interval between \(-\)0.75 and \(-\)0.15 bracketed by Hamermesh (1993). This value is around 20% less elastic than the global average in the meta-study by Lichter et al. (2015), which may reflect Germany’s relatively high level of employment protection legislation. Second, reduced-form models frequently fail to deliver negative scale effects which is at odds with theory of labor demand. Third, empirical designs that explicitly address endogeneity of the wage rate feature significantly more negative estimates than naive OLS regressions, seemingly mitigating the confounding impact from uncontrolled-for labor demand shocks and unobserved firm heterogeneity. Fourth, all other things being equal, labor demand responds more elastically in the long than in the short run. Fifth, there is evidence that the own-wage elasticity of labor demand turns out more negative at the firm than at the aggregate level since the latter does not account for employment shifts within the aggregate (e.g., when firms lay off workers who take up a job in another firm in the same industry). Sixth, the analysis suggests that labor demand is not systematically more wage-elastic when relating to total hours worked rather than the number of workers. Seventh, systematic differences in the responsiveness of labor demand are not apparent between West and East German firms. Eighth, labor demand is more elastic in exporting or multinational firms than in firms that do not operate internationally. Ninth, there is an inverse U-shaped pattern between the own-wage elasticity of labor demand and workers’ skill levels: the demand for medium-skilled workers (i.e., workers who completed the dual vocational system) is less elastic than for low- and high-skilled workers. Tenth, conditional on output, demand for workers in atypical employment is more wage-elastic than for workers in typical (i.e., full-time regular) employment. Eleventh, labor demand has become less elastic over time which may reflect labour hoarding in the wake of long-term demographic decline in Germany. Twelfth, the German labor demand literature is apparently characterized by publication bias, favoring significant elasticities that comply with microeconomic theory. In the most far-reaching meta-study on labor demand, Lichter et al. (2015) perform meta-regressions of the own-wage elasticity of labor demand, building on 1334 elasticity estimates from 151 international studies (see Sect. 3). My meta-study differs in five important aspects from their work. First, while such an international meta-analysis on 40 countries is able to trace out systematic relationships across countries, national peculiarities remain hidden in unobserved country heterogeneity. To leverage intranational variation, this study focuses solely on evidence from the German labor market. Second, this meta-study constitutes the most comprehensive compilation of own-wage elasticities of labor demand for the German labor market. With 705 observations, this meta-study comprises more than twice as many observations as the subsample of 302 estimates for the German labor market in the international meta-study by Lichter et al. (2015).Footnote 1 Third, if wage changes make firms not only adjust the number of employees (i.e., the extensive margin) but also the number of working hours per employee (i.e., the intensive margin), the own-wage elasticity of labor demand becomes more negative. In this regard, this meta-analysis examines whether the own-wage elasticity of labor demand systematically varies by the underlying margin of adjustment. Fourth, trade theory implies that, due to increasing globalization, better substitution possibilities and greater price sensitivity of consumers render labor demand more wage-elastic. This meta-study is the first to examine whether the responsiveness of labor demand differs between internationally operating (i.e., exporting or multinational) firms and firms who are involved only in the national market. Fifth, in addition to marginal effects in the meta-regression analysis, this study also reports separate averages of the own-wage elasticity of labor demand by different dimensions of heterogeneity. Importantly, these values may guide researchers in calibrating their models of the labor market. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 briefly sketches the conceptual background in terms of labor demand theory and the estimation of the own-wage elasticity of labor demand. Section 3 summarizes key results about the elasticity of interest from available reviews or meta-analyses. Section 4 describes the properties of the meta-sample for the German labor market. Section 5 delivers the results from the meta-regression analysis. Section 6 inspects whether the German literature is characterized by publication bias. Finally, Section 7 concludes.",

Gender Pay Gaps (GPGs), for instance, while declining in many countries in the 1970s and 1980s, have shown a slowdown in convergence in the 1990s (e.g. Goldin 2014; Blau et al. 2017; Bruns 2019). Blau et al. (2017) attribute the 1990s slowdown in the GPG convergence to a relative persistent unexplained part. This part includes, inter alia, labour market selectivity, unmeasured characteristics and labour market discrimination. The related literature finds typically substantial differences in changes across the distribution (e.g. Antonczyk et al. 2010; Arellano and Bonhomme 2017; Gallego Granados and Wrohlich 2019; Maasoumi and Wang 2019). Applied research has also observed that women are ‘swimming upstream’ (Blau and Kahn 1997). The latter refers to the persistence of the GPG despite diminishing gaps in characteristics between men and women over time. These findings suggest that differences in skill prices between men and women play a major role for the slowing convergence of the GPG. The example shows that identifying the determinants (such as gender differences in skill prices) of changes in GPGs over time is pivotal for efficient policy measures and a major contribution of this paper. In this paper, we adapt the Oaxaca–Blinder (OB) decomposition (Blinder 1973; Oaxaca 1973) for estimating and decomposing changes in the West German GPG between two time periods or points in time. Similar to Gelbach (2016), we use the omitted variable bias formula for the adapted decomposition. Consequently, the approach relies on a single OLS regression and standard errors for the different components of the decomposition are easily obtained. That is, the approach allows us to draw inference on changes in pay gaps as well as on the different components between groups and across time. An advantage of our decomposition is its simplicity in terms of implementation. As our method follows the intuition of OB—by decomposing the change in the GPG in an explained and unexplained part—it relies on the intuitive and probably most used decomposition in the literature.Footnote 1
In addition, it allows for both aggregate and detailed decompositions. Further, we use linear unconditional quantile regressions or Recentered Influence Function (RIF) OLS (Firpo et al. 2009) in order to extend the decomposition beyond the mean. Using unconditional quantile regression decompositions is computationally easy, especially compared to conditional quantile decompositions, and permits us to calculate detailed OB-type decompositions of both the explained and unexplained part along the distribution. Moreover, changes in inequality, measured by inter-quantile gaps, can be easily derived.Footnote 2 Using data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), we analyse the GPG at two different and distant points in time: 1984 and 2020. The results show a substantial and statistically significant reduction in the GPG over the last 36 years for most parts of the wage distribution. At the top, however, the gap increased statistically significantly. This result implies that the gap evolves differently across the wage distribution. The catching-up of women in terms of educational attainment contributed only slightly to the convergence of the gap over time. A main driver of the change are differences in prices for labour market characteristics such as full-time experience and job tenure between men and women. Gallego Granados and Wrohlich (2019) provide a distributional analysis of the GPG in West Germany over the period 1990–2014 using the SOEP. The paper takes (changing) sample selection in full-time employment via wage imputation into account. Gallego Granados and Wrohlich (2019) find slight convergence of the GPG during the 1990s and stagnation thereafter for all points of the wage distribution. Biewen et al. (2018) using administrative data look at the rise of wage inequality in West Germany (1985–2000) taking changes in non- and part-time employment among full-time employees over time into account. Their paper looks separately at men and women and finds substantial differences across gender and over time. Bruns (2019) looks at the evolution of the West German GPG since the 1990s. Based on administrative linked-employer-employee data, the author identifies firm characteristics as main driver of the slowdown in convergence of the gap since the mid 1990s. The finding of slowing convergence in the West German GPG is in line with results of e.g. Blau et al. (2017) for the USA. In particular, the results from the literature suggest that gender wage inequality is far from being solved and that the gap differs substantially across the distribution. We contribute to this literature in the following ways. First, we propose an easy-to-use and easy-to-implement method that is based on the popular OB interpretation. Second, the approach allows to decompose the change in the GPG on aggregate and in detail. Third, the decomposition can be applied along the wage distribution. A further contribution of our paper is that it adds to the literature on changes in the GPG in West Germany. The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of two prominent traditional methods used to estimate changes in wage gaps over time. Section 3 outlines the proposed adaptation of the OB decomposition, while Sect. 4 discusses inference issues and the derivation of the detailed decomposition. Section 5 presents the empirical application and Sect. 6 concludes.",

Grabka,Daniel D. Schnitzlein,Male,Male,Male,Male,"For years, the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) has been the standard data set for analyzing income and wageFootnote 1 inequality in Germany (e.g., Steiner and Wagner 1998; Biewen 2000; Gernandt and Pfeiffer 2007; Biewen and Juhasz 2012; Sommerfeld 2013). However, research based on administrative data has recently gained importance, especially in labor economics (e.g., Card et al. 2013; Fitzenberger and de Lazzer 2022). Large sample sizes and the (expected) accuracy of the information included are considered advantages of this type of data. However, these data are designed for administrative purposes and may not contain all the information needed for research. At the same time, most large household surveys have begun to increase their samples, in part to include specific subpopulations.Footnote 2 Compared to administrative data, survey data contain much more information and cover more topics, but at the cost of much smaller sample sizes and perhaps less precision in certain quantitative variables.Footnote 3 Despite these developments, there is a paucity of work comparing survey and administrative data and examining whether these data sets produce comparable results.Footnote 4 In this article, we fill this gap for Germany by comparing trends and levels of wage inequality based on the SOEP (e.g., Goebel et al. 2019) with results based on the Sample of Integrated Labour Market Biographies (SIAB; e.g., Frodermann et al. 2021). Both data sets are widely used in empirical labor research and have been used extensively in past research on wage inequality. Based on the SOEP, Biewen and Juhasz (2012), e.g., analyze determinants of the rise in income inequality in the early 2000s and show that most of the increase is due to rising labor income inequality. Burauel et al. (2020) analyze the impact of the introduction of the minimum wage on wage inequality and find that this reform leads to a reduction in inequality.Footnote 5 In addition, the SOEP forms the basis of many social reporting statistics in Germany. Several German research institutes publish inequality statistics based on the SOEP at regular intervals (e.g., Stockhausen and Calderón 2020; Grabka 2021), which are incorporated into policy and governmental reports (e.g., Bundesregierung 2016, 2021; OECD 2018). Most studies on wage inequality in Germany based on administrative data have been conducted with data sets from the Research Data Center (FDZ) of the Federal Employment Agency (BA) at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB). Dustmann et al. (2009), e.g., use the IAB Employment Samples (IABS) to examine the West German wage structure. They show that wage inequality in West Germany has increased between 1975 and 2004. Klein et al. (2013) use the IAB’s Linked Employer-Employee Data (LIAB) to analyze the impact of export activity on wage inequality within and across skill groups. Card et al. (2013) use the Integrated Employment Biographies (IEB) and find that increasing heterogeneity at the establishment level and increasing assertiveness in assigning workersFootnote 6 to establishments mainly explain increasing wage inequality. Dustmann et al. (2014) use the SIAB and show that real wage growth is negative for the lower end of the wage distribution. Fitzenberger and de Lazzer (2022) also use SIAB data to examine whether changes in the selection into full-time employment among German men are a cause of the rise in wage inequality since the mid-1990s.Footnote 7 Recent results based on the SOEP show that (hourly) wage inequality—measured as the ratio between the 90th and 10th  percentiles—increased substantially in the early 2000s, remained relatively stable between 2006 and 2014, then declined until 2016, and continued to move horizontal until 2019, bringing the German labor market back to the inequality level of the early 2000s (Grabka 2021). Using the SIAB data through 2014, Fitzenberger and Seidlitz (2020) confirm the same upward trend in the early 2000s for full-time worker wage inequality, measured as the ratio between the  80th and 20th  percentiles. However, in their sample, inequality continued to increase for men and decrease for women through 2014. The disparate results based on different data sets underscore the need for a thorough comparative analysis.Footnote 8 The SOEP data have the advantage that information on individuals’ wages is embedded in the full set of information available in a large household survey. This allows researchers not only to calculate individual earnings or individual wages, but also to include the household level or to distinguish between measures of income before and after transfers and taxes. Administrative data are usually produced by government agencies in the course of implementing certain rules, regulations, and laws. Statistics are a byproduct of these activities. On the one hand, administrative data can be considered very accurate in terms of the information required for the administrative procedure from which the data originate, e.g., as there are legal sanctions in case of misreporting. On the other hand, some additional information collected as part of the administrative procedure, such as educational status or occupation, may be considered less reliable. There is no doubt that the set of potential control variables in the SIAB is much smaller compared to the SOEP. However, because survey costs are substantial, the coverage of surveys is usually limited (about 30,000 individuals in the last SOEP wave), while the administrative data cover almost the entire population of individuals participating in the labor market. The IEB covers, inter alia, all workers subject to social insurance contributions in Germany since 1975. The SIAB is a two-percent random sample of the IEB. This restriction is due to data protection purposes. Nevertheless, the SIAB covers labor market related information of around 1.78 million persons. Administrative data have the advantage that the characteristics essential to the underlying administrative process are usually of high quality and therefore have a low number of missings and a low measurement error. However, administrative data can be affected by, e.g., processing errors (e.g., duplicate reports, data entry error) (Kapteyn and Ypma 2007; Groen 2012; Lindner and Andreasch 2014) and/or coverage errors (e.g., administrative data lack information on the shadow economy). Whereas, survey data can be subject to various measurement errors (e.g., Bound et al. 2001). Basically, a distinction can be made between sampling errors and non-sampling errors. Sampling errors occur when only a non-representative subset of the population is actually surveyed. Non-sampling errors include coverage errors, framing errors, response/non-response errors, measurement errors, and processing errors (e.g., de Leeuw et al. 2008). In summary, both survey data and administrative data are subject to different types of measurement errors and therefore neither data source should be considered the only true one.Footnote 9 For Germany, this has been shown, e.g., by Oberski et al. (2017). They “found for official administrative data obtained from the German Federal Employment Agency that the reliability of both survey and administrative data was far from perfect.” (Oberski et al. 2017, p. 1486). Any comparison of survey and administrative data additionally faces differences in the definitions of the unit of analysis, divergent reference periods, or even censoring. As noted above, both the SOEP and the SIAB have been used to analyze wage inequality in the past, using different analytical methods that take advantage of the unique characteristics of the two data sets. To our knowledge, however, no attempt has ever been made to derive comparable inequality estimates from these data sources. In this article, we fill this gap by bringing in estimates of wage inequality trends for Germany based on (1) samples that exploit the strengths of each data set, (2) samples that are as comparable in composition as possible, and comparing our findings from these approaches.",
57,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,13 February 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-023-00335-w,"A guide to preparing the sample of integrated labour market biographies (SIAB, version 7519 v1) for scientific analysis",December 2023,Heiko Stüber,Wolfgang Dauth,Johann Eppelsheimer,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The Sample of Integrated Labour Market Biographies (SIAB) includes data on all registrations with the German social insurance system for a 2-percent sample of all persons who have ever been registered with the social insurance system since 1975. This enables day-by-day analyses of the (complete) labor market biographies of many individuals. At the same time, the sample size allows aggregated analyses at the level of regions, industries, or occupations. The SIAB is an extremely versatile data set and one of the most sought-after data products made available to the scientific community by the Research Data Centre (FDZ) of the Federal Employment Agency (BA) at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB).Footnote 1 Over 43% of the more than 650 projects currently managed by the FDZ use the SIAB.Footnote 2 Individual-level data sets—such as the SIAB—usually differ from macro data in one respect: they have a complicated structure. The SIAB is no exception: In principle, each line of the SIAB originates either from an employer’s notification to the social security system or from a process in the unemployment insurance system. Unfortunately, individual biographies often do not follow a linear path: people change jobs, have several jobs at the same time, become unemployed, participate in active labor market policy measures, etc. A data set covering all these different biographies is, as a result, more complex than a sample data set familiar from econometric textbooks. Therefore, researchers must first invest a lot of time and effort in preparing the data before they can start the actual empirical analysis. Because of its versatility, scholars analyze the SIAB in numerous contexts. In the first half of 2022 alone, several publications using the SIAB were reported to the FDZ. Examples are: “Why do some occupations offer more part-time work than others? Reciprocal dynamics in occupational gender segregation and occupational part-time work in West Germany” by Bächmann et al. (2022), “Changing selection into full-time work and its effect on wage inequality in Germany” by Fitzenberger and de Lazzer (2022), “The role of labor demand in the labor market effects of a pension reform” by Geyer et al. (2022), “Reservation wages and labor Supply” by Kesternich et al. (2022), “Task specialization and the native-foreign wage gap: Evidence from worker-level data” by Storm (2022), and “Early retirement of employees in demanding jobs: Evidence from a German pension reform” by Zwick et al. (2022). As these examples show, the SIAB enables high-quality research in numerous areas. Because researchers can use the SIAB in so many different contexts, data preparation methods naturally vary. Practices that have proven useful in one research project may not be applicable in another. Ultimately, it is not possible to develop a linear guide to SIAB preparation that addresses all requirements for all potential research questions. However, we recognize that the preparation of the SIAB is time-consuming and error-prone, especially for researchers who do not have experience working with larger administrative data sets. In this article we describe the best practices that we have found useful in our own research. We also provide extensively annotated Stata do-files to replicate our data preparation. The goal of this article and the supplemental collection of do-files is to provide researchers with step-by-step instructions on how to prepare the SIAB for individual-level analyses. We point out the purpose of each step and explain intuitively how to perform it. All technical details can be found in the do-files attached to this article. Although this article is the first complete guide to preparing the SIAB 7519 for scientific analysis, there are several papers that provide guidance on specific parts of the data preparation process for German social security data.Footnote 3 This article and the collection of do-files are based on the weakly anonymized version of the SIAB 7519 v1 (DOI: https://doi.org/10.5164/IAB.FDZ.2101.en.v1). Access to this data set is provided to the scientific community by the FDZ. The usual way to access the SIAB is to use it on-site at the FDZ in Nuremberg or at one of the other locations in Germany, France, Luxembourg, Poland, and Spain.Footnote 4 This allows users to develop their programs while working interactively with the data. Afterwards, users can continue their projects via remote data access through the JoSuA web interface. The FDZ requires users working in the secure on-site environment and through JoSuA to follow certain conventions when writing their programs and managing their files. Our guidelines follow these conventions, and our do-files have been tested in the JoSuA environment using Stata version 17. We urge all users of the Stata do-file collection to check our code for bugs and to adapt it to the requirements of the project at hand. We provide this as a service to the scientific community, but do not accept responsibility for any problems arising from the use of our code. We also strongly recommend reading the SIAB 7519 data report (Frodermann et al. 2021) to familiarize yourself with the SIAB, as well as data quality and issues.Footnote 5 This is a substantial update of the original guide to preparing the SIAB by Dauth and Eppelsheimer (2020) published in this journal. We decided to make this update for two reasons: First, the SIAB has been extended and updated.Footnote 6 Second, we received a variety of comments and suggestions on the original version regarding further enhancements and usability improvements that we wanted to share with the users of this guide. The following points have been revised, updated, or added compared to the original version: We tested the do-files in the JoSuA environment of the FDZ on the latest weakly anonymized version of the SIAB (SIAB 7519 v1) using Stata 17. We introduced global macros in 00_master_SIAB.do to enable/disable certain steps of data preparation. The global macro inspect allows to enable/disable certain outputs and the macro logfile allows to enable/disable the creation of log files. We changed the order of some of the do-files to reduce runtime and improve quality of the wage imputation of top-coded wages. We added a do-file to deal with spells that report a one-off payment (grund = 154). It adjusts daily wages of employment spells of individuals within establishments, when the individuals received one-off payments from the same establishment (see 02_grund154.do). We adjusted the definition of the dummy indicating whether an individual works in West or East Germany (see 06_wages_assessment_ceiling.do). Berlin is now treated as West German until 1991 and East German from 1992 onward.Footnote 7 We added the contribution assessment limit of the statutory pension insurance, the marginal earnings thresholds for part-time employees (see 06_wages_assessment_ceiling.do), and the consumer price index (see 07_wages_marginal.do) for all years through 2019. We added do-files to merge the following data to the SIAB: Further (non-)sensitive Establishment History Panel (BHP) variables (see 11_merge_BHP.do), the “worker flows” and “entry and exits” BHP extension files (see 11_merge_BHP.do), and person and establishment fixed effects as proposed by Abowd et al. (1999) (AKM effects, see 12_merge_AKM.do). We made minor revisions to all do-files: more efficient commands, expanded/revised comments, etc. The SIAB 7521 is scheduled for release in 2023. With the release, we will provide an updated and revised Stata do-file collection. The availability of the new do-file collection will be announced here in the journal and in the FDZ newsletter. Please note that our files have not been tested with the anonymized SIAB version available to users on-site in the US, Canada, and the UK. In this SIAB version, inter alia, the variables erwstat and grund are aggregated from 56 to 23 and 205 to 45 categories, respectively.Footnote 8 Since the additional anonymization is also project specific, users need to customize our do-file to their data set. Our files have also not been tested with the factually anonymous version of the SIAB (SIAB-R 7519). In the SIAB-R 7519, many of the variables from the weakly anonymized version of the SIAB 7519 have been grouped (see Frodermann et al. 2021). Therefore, users need to customize our do-file to this data set.",1
57,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,13 February 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-023-00332-z,On the measurement of tasks: does expert data get it right?,December 2023,Eduard Storm,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"A growing body of research has adopted the “task-approach” to labor markets (Autor 2013) that models the assignment of worker-specific skills to job tasks. This framework allows a more nuanced evaluation on the role of skills in the production function as worker’s skills are derived from comparative advantages in tasks. Most studies employing task data use information at the occupation-level, which is often based on external assessment by labor market experts. While widely used, this expert data may introduce measurement error attributed to (i) aggregated task data and (ii) misperception of experts on the importance of job tasks. The primary interest in the present paper is on the unit of dimension as expert data disregards heterogeneity within occupations. Indeed, using survey data on job activities of US workers at the workplace, Autor and Handel (2013) contrast variation in tasks at the individual- and occupation-level and find worker-level information on tasks to be informative about wage differences not only between occupations, but also within. Similarly, Autor and Handel (2013) point out that individual job tasks differ within education and demographic groups. Cassidy (2017) and Rohrbach-Schmidt (2019) provide similar evidence in the German context, Storm (2022b) shows differences in task specialization within occupations between natives and foreigners, and de la Rica et al. (2020) in a cross-country setting using PIAAC data, suggesting within-occupation heterogeneity in tasks is not country-specific. Related evidence on dispersion of tasks within occupations can be found in  Spitz-Oener (2006), Atalay et al. (2018), Atalay et al. (2020), Deming and Noray (2019), Modestino et al. (2019), and Stinebrickner et al. (2019). These papers highlight rich heterogeneity in tasks that is masked in conventional occupation-level data and rising dispersion of tasks within occupations over time. Importantly, the existing empirical literature echoes the well-known difference in the unit of interest between survey and expert data. While the former emphasizes tasks performed at the workplace, the latter describes occupational characteristics (Autor 2013, Dengler et al. 2014). By focusing on the occupational dimension, expert data implicitly assumes workers within an occupation perform a common set of tasks. These conventional task models therefore ignore individual heterogeneity, giving rise to omitted-variable bias in estimated task returns. While previous contributions on the heterogeneity of job tasks are convincing and important, neither of these studies explicitly measure the bias in task returns embedded in conventional task data. This information is important for practitioners, however, who often use task data on the grounds of theory of comparative advantage in tasks. In this paper I fill this gap by rigorously comparing the statistical properties of task models based on survey and expert data, respectively. This comparison allows me to test and quantify the presence of omitted-variable bias in task returns based on expert data. To this end, I make four contributions to the existing literature. First, I find worker-level information on tasks is predictive of wage differences in all specifications and thus in line with prior research. Relative to performing manual tasks, I find a 1 pp. increase in abstract task intensity raises wages by 36–53%. Employing a sizable cross-section of more than 27,000 workers in Germany from 2012-18 with self-reported information on job tasks represents an improvement over the existing literature that either uses much smaller samples (Autor and Handel 2013, Rohrbach-Schmidt 2019) or older data (Cassidy 2017). Idiosyncratic differences in tasks are especially pronounced in models conditional on occupational fixed effects (FE), providing direct evidence on task specialization within occupations. Second, I conduct formal tests of various task models. In this analysis, I compare the statistical performance of wage regressions comprising survey data and, respectively, expert data, provided by Dengler et al. (2014)—henceforth DMP.Footnote 1 Overall, baseline results suggest only minor statistical differences between survey- and expert task data. While goodness-of-fitness measures and information criteria favor models based on worker-level variation, expert data has more unique explanatory power. The broad statistical similarity likewise holds true for a comparison of occupation-level expert data with occupation-level task measures derived from survey data. Hence, assessment by labor market experts on the importance of job tasks does not appear to be fundamentally different from worker assessment. Further robustness checks reverse some of the perceived benefits of expert data in baseline specifications, however. Instead, a majority of robustness tests support statistical superiority of individual-level task measures from survey data, especially with respect to its unique explanatory power. The preferred model uses survey data and conditions worker-level tasks with occupational FE. This specification explains about 20% of the wage variation not accounted for in conventional (Mincerian) wage regressions. Third, I show the omitted-variable bias in task returns estimated with expert data ranges from 26 to 34%, depending on specification. In the baseline model, this bias is nearly 30% and most sensitive to assumptions in the construction of task measures. I conceptualize this omitted-variable bias in a theoretical framework in which wages are determined by an individual- and occupation-level task dimension. This model accounts for individual heterogeneity by highlighting the importance of task specialization within occupations. Since the best-performing specification does combine worker-level information on tasks with occupational FE, I view this theory supported by the data. These findings have important implications for the interpretation of conventional task models. Economists often conceptualize the association between job tasks and wages with a Roy model in which comparative advantage governs occupational choices (Boehm et al. 2021; Cavaglia and Etheridge 2020; Cortes 2016; Yamaguchi 2012). Subsequently, workers receive occupation-level task returns in their chosen occupation. My findings suggest, however, these task returns are substantially inflated due to confounding with underlying individual heterogeneity. In this context, survey data has the advantage that it allows the researcher to aggregate individual responses at the occupation-level. Therefore, the researcher can account for task variation at the individual and occupation-level, thereby mitigating omitted variable bias with respect to task information. Fourth, I present methodological guidance for practitioners seeking to work with task data. The robustness checks in this paper identify assumptions underlying the definition of tasks and occupations as key drivers of differences in statistical performance between survey and expert data. Researchers should therefore pay close attention to classification of tasks and occupations. Specifically, the bias in occupation-level task returns estimated with expert data is higher if (i) occupations are defined broadly (e.g., 2-digit level) and (ii) tasks are defined narrowly (e.g., five task groups). Moreover, specifications that use occupation-level task measures derived from aggregated survey responses display the worst statistical performance. The statistical discrepancies are overall negligible, but, compared to other specifications, these task measures lead to substantially larger point estimates for task returns. This finding warrants caution in the practice of linking aggregated task measures from survey data to other data sources.",1
57,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,13 February 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-023-00334-x,Population aggregates from administrative data samples–how good are they?,December 2023,Philipp vom Berge,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Many empirical studies in the social sciences require aggregated subgroup data from a population. Examples for such data are the number of workers per district, average wages per sector or the unemployment rate for people of different nationalities. However, suitable data based on the total population are not always available. When working with German labour market data, many researchers therefore resort to approximations based on administrative microdata samples. In doing so, they often apply the ""bigger-is-better"" principle: Choose the data product with the highest total number of observations, aggregate without further adjustments and hope for the best. In this paper, I review this frequently used strategy and provide some critical comments and suggestions. I do this, first, by reminding everyone of the obvious: Aggregating a sample inevitably leads to sampling error, and this error can quickly become significant, in the worst case calling into question any follow-up analysis. Second, I show that in many cases it is not advisable to rely on the intuition ""bigger-is-better"" and that the right choice of data source can significantly improve the performance of the approach. Third, I propose a simple data smoothing procedure that reduces the asymmetric approximation error in cases with many sparsely populated cells. Forth and finally, I discuss the impact that statistical disclosure control might have on the final aggregated data and suggest some ways to reduce bias resulting from censoring. The easiest way to get around problems induced by aggregating from samples would, of course, be for empirical researchers to always use the entire population under study. In many cases this will not be a problem. In Germany, the Federal Statistical Office provides a variety of official statistics divided into different subgroups, many of which are based on the entire population. For labour market research, the Statistics Department of the Federal Employment Agency provides many official statistics free of charge, and individualized data extracts are also available for a fee upon request. However, there are a number of reasons why researchers may not be able to use these data sources. A typical example is that the research question requires a long panel of aggregated subgroup data, but official statistics only provide a much shorter period. Another example is that researchers need to perform more complex initial data preparation steps before the final aggregation, but this service is not offered by the respective statistics department. In such cases, recourse on administrative micro-data samples might not be a second-best alternative only, but the only option available. When it comes to accessing administrative microdata on the German labour market, the most obvious first port of call is the Research Data Centre of the Federal Employment Agency at the Institute for Employment Research (IAB-FDZ) with its broad portfolio of administrative microdata, surveys and linked data products. Access is limited to a scientific research context and three ways of accessing data, namely on-site access, remote execution and the provision of Scientific Use Files, depending on the data product. In this paper, I will focus on experience from working with data users at the IAB-FDZ who use its data products.Footnote 1 I hope that some of my remarks can be transferred to other contexts. After several years as a staff member at the IAB-FDZ, I can confirm with some certainty that the demand for subgroup aggregates from administrative microdata samples is quite high. While many of these aggregations take place as intermediate steps of data preparation in a secure data processing environment, there are also frequent requests for the release and export of the resulting data, which then requires manual data disclosure control, a task that ties resources in a Research Data Centre (RDC). Sometimes, data users are not aware that there are ways to access similar or even better data from another source, in which case IAB-FDZ staff can help. In most cases, however, there are some good reasons why researchers decide to rely on microdata. The Establishment History Panel (BHP) is the most frequently requested data product for studies using aggregated microdata from IAB-FDZ. It is a 50 per cent random sample of establishments in Germany based on social security notifications, currently covering the years 1975 to 2020. It contains information on up to 1.5 million establishments annually and is thus a natural candidate for aggregations of detailed subgroups. Another IAB-FDZ data product that could be considered as a competitor, the Sample of Integrated Employment Biographies (SIAB) which focuses on individuals, is “only” a 2 per cent random sample and therefore seems much less attractive because ""Bigger-is-better"". In my experience—which may not be representative of the typical data user—many researchers then prefer to ignore the fact that their aggregated data is constructed from a sample, perhaps due to the fact that the BHP is such a large dataset and the intuition that this will lead to small approximation errors. In the following, I would like to provide data users of the IAB-FDZ—and users of data samples in general—with some descriptive analyses to help them get a feel for the data quality costs of aggregating administrative data samples at increasingly detailed levels. For example, using the BHP to aggregate employment at the district level results in a ratio of aggregate error to total employment of about 5 per cent. When aggregating at the district level in conjunction with 3-digit industries, this ratio increases to 32 per cent. Not only are these errors significant, but I also provide evidence that the BHP is likely to be inferior to the SIAB in approximating employment aggregates despite its bigger sample size. Switching to the SIAB can reduce error ratios by more than half in the examples I tested. Furthermore, I show that for many applications it is best to use the BHP add-on to the SIAB (the SIAB Basis Establishment File) rather than the BHP itself. Selecting a fine level of detail for subgroup aggregation not only increases the overall error ratio, but also leads to an asymmetric distribution of approximation errors for some aggregation methods when true cell sizes become really small and often contain only one observation. For example, when the sampling probability is small, not selecting this one observation leads to an error of -1, while selecting it leads to an error equal to the weighting factor minus one. I show that this asymmetry can be reduced by a simple data smoothing step and that this can also improve the overall performance of the approximation. Finally, I show how statistical disclosure control, which may require censoring of data before an aggregated dataset is released, can significantly worsen the approximation error. This poses a problem for data users who plan to export their aggregated data from the secure computing environment of an RDC for use in a later phase of their project or publication. I argue that the smoothing technique also proposed in the paper, or alternatively aggregation methods with random weighting factors, can mitigate this problem and reduce the need for censoring. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, I present the basic approximation variants and show that bigger is not necessarily better. In Sect. 3, I move to a finer level of aggregation and document and discuss the increase of approximation error. Sect. 4 presents the data smoothing procedure. In Sect. 5, I discuss the implications of statistical disclosure control. Sect. 6 provides a conclusion.",

This initial lockdown, which began on 27 March 2020 and lasted for 5 weeks, was relatively stringent by international standards (Bhorat et al. 2020a, b; Gustafsson 2020). The regulations prevented any non-essential activities outside the home, imposed restrictions on all public gatherings, led to the closure of all schools, the introduction of a curfew, a prohibition on the sale of tobacco products and liquor, and strict domestic and international travel controls. Research using anonymized mobile phone data shows a substantial reduction in population mobility in response to these regulations (Carlitz and Makhura 2021). In the labour market, only workers in occupations deemed essential for economic function and pandemic response were permitted to continue working at their usual place of work during this period. A lockdown of this type was always expected to have significant economic costs, and official estimates reveal a contraction of 2.2 million jobs (14%) in the second quarter of 2020 relative to the first—essentially erasing the last decade of job growth in the economy. Crucially, the job axe of this initial lockdown did not fall evenly. In line with the global literature, there was an unequal distribution of job loss by employment formality in South Africa (Benhura and Magejo 2020; Rogan and Skinner 2020; Köhler et al. 2021). Informal sector workers accounted for approximately 50% of all net jobs lost in the short-term, despite these workers representing just 25% of total pre-pandemic employment (Köhler et al. 2021). Such a disproportionate incidence of job loss has been observed across Sub-Saharan Africa (Balde et al. 2020; Schotte et al. 2021), and it has been argued that the characteristics of informal sector jobs—including a higher propensity of being in contact-intensive industries, lower propensities of being able to work remotely, and fewer legal protections such as paid leave and unemployment insurance—likely explain these adverse outcomes (Fox and Signe 2020; ILO 2020; Ngameni 2020). Whatever the mechanism, informal sector employment has served as a key predictor of job loss during South Africa’s initial lockdown period. Lockdown policy in South Africa and around the world was, however, not time-invariant. Indeed, governments continue to make policy decisions in a context of significant uncertainty and a swiftly changing epidemiological situation, resulting in varying levels of lockdown stringency. In South Africa, following the initial ‘hard’ lockdown described above, the government adopted a five-level strategy, with lockdown stringency varying according to the severity of contagion. It is plausible that such variation may have heterogenous effects both on aggregate and by employment formality. Although studies providing evidence on the labour market effects of the pandemic and lockdown policies exist in both developed countriesFootnote 1 and few developing countries,Footnote 2 there is a lack of causal evidence on how variation in lockdown stringency affects labour market outcomes, both on aggregate and by employment formality. From a policy perspective, evidence of such heterogeneity not only provides a useful retrospective analysis, but also has the potential to inform future decisions about lockdown regulations and the optimal targeting of government support. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of lockdown stringency on employment probabilities and examine effect heterogeneity by employment formality. We do so in the context of South Africa, which serves as a useful case study for two key reasons: (i) the timing of changes in the country’s lockdown levels coincide with labour forces survey periods, which allows us to accurately isolate the effect of varying levels of lockdown stringency, and (ii) as an upper-middle-income country with a relatively small informal sector employment share, our findings may be broadly useful to both developing countries (given South Africa’s level of economic development) as well as to more developed countries (given South Africa’s low informal sector employment shareFootnote 3). Our analysis uses representative, individual-level, panel labour force data, and adopts a quasi-experimental econometric design to exploit temporal variation in employment probabilities of adults who were and were not permitted to work. We consider several levels of lockdown stringency over time and explore effect heterogeneity by employment formality. Specifically, we cross-reference South Africa’s lockdown regulations to over 150 industry codes in the data, and make use of the coincidental timing of the onset of the lockdown and data collection periods to estimate a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) model. We further exploit the panel nature of the data to control for observable and unobservable time-invariant heterogeneity through individual fixed effects. We find that while South Africa’s lockdown policy significantly reduced employment probabilities for every level of lockdown stringency, these effects were driven by negative employment effects in the informal sector. Moreover, these effects were heterogeneous by lockdown stringency—where more stringent lockdown levels negatively affected informal sector employment but not formal sector employment, while the least stringent lockdown level negatively affected formal sector employment but not informal sector employment. Overall, we estimate that South Africa’s lockdown policy decreased the probability of employment for those not permitted to work by 3 percentage points, or 36.15% relative to the control group; however, this effect was driven by a negative effect in the informal sector (2.6 percentage points). We find no evidence of such an effect on formal sector employment. Considering lockdown stringency, we estimate significant negative effects of 3.4–3.5 percentage points on informal sector employment probabilities for the most stringent lockdown levels; however, we find no evidence of any such effects for the least stringent level. In contrast, we estimate a significant and negative 6.1 percentage point effect on the probability of formal sector employment for this least stringent lockdown level but find no evidence for such effects for more stringent lockdown levels. These results hold when subject to robustness tests relating to placebo outcomes, the possibly confounding effect of varying task content across occupations with respect to physical interaction, which we control for by merging in task content data from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET) and generating a physical interaction index, as well as varying treatment group assumptions. We hypothesize two potential reasons for the heterogeneous relationship between lockdown stringency and formality of employment. First, we posit that this finding may be related to between-sector variation in employment elasticities with respect to ‘abrupt’ versus ‘accumulated’ lockdown effects. Second, we discuss the plausibility that such heterogeneity may be explained by a combination of differential targeting and timing of two of the government’s core economic support policies during the beginning of the pandemic: a wage subsidy which temporarily targeted primarily formal sector workers but later included informal sector workers, and a new unconditional cash transfer which, in addition to supporting the unemployed, provided support to informal sector workers but which was only largely rolled out during the least stringent lockdown level assessed here. The differential timing and targeting of these policies, coupled with our findings, suggest that they may have mitigated the negative employment effects of the country’s lockdown policy. However, a detailed mediation analysis lies beyond the scope of this paper and as such we are unable to make conclusive statements in this regard, but an empirical analysis of these potential mechanisms serves as an important area for future research. Overall, our analysis highlights the differential effects of lockdown policies by level of stringency and employment formality. As the pandemic progresses and governments continue to consider lockdown restrictions as a policy response, policymakers ought to consider the existence of such heterogeneous effects by lockdown stringency and employment formality in their efforts to target support appropriately. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 first provides an overview of South Africa’s national lockdown policy and how policy stringency varied over the course of the pandemic, as well as an overview of the economic policy package the government introduced to provide support to vulnerable firms, workers, and households. Thereafter, we provide a description of the dataset and the balanced panel sample. In Sect. 3 we describe our identification strategy and model specification. We present our results in Sect. 4 and thereafter the robustness tests in Sect. 5. Finally, in Sect. 6 we conclude.",1
57,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,07 January 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-022-00328-1,Effects of mixing modes on nonresponse and measurement error in an economic panel survey,December 2023,Joseph W. Sakshaug,Jonas Beste,Mark Trappmann,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Panel surveys are indispensable tools for conducting labour market research and informing labour market policy. For example, the German Panel Study “Labour Market and Social Security” (PASS; Trappmann et al. 2019) has interviewed representative household samples of the general population and welfare recipients since 2006/07, generating insights into determinants of labour market participation (e.g. Abraham et al. 2019; Denzer et al. 2021; Lietzmann and Frodermann 2021) and the economic and social consequences of poverty and unemployment (e.g. Gundert and Hohendanner 2015; Krug et al. 2019; Pohlan 2019; Hetschko et al. 2020). Like many panel surveys in Germany and elsewhere, the PASS survey data are collected using a mix of data collection modes. Since Wave 5, the initial default mode for new samples has been computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) with nonresponse follow-ups carried out using computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI). In subsequent waves the successful mode of the previous wave then becomes the default mode and the other mode the follow-up mode. Numerous other panel studies implement sequential mixed-mode designs using a mix of CAPI and CATI, often alongside other modes (e.g. web), including the UK Next Steps cohort study (Calderwood et al. 2021), the US American Community Survey (US Census Bureau 2020), and The UK Household Longitudinal Study (University of Essex, Institute for Social and Economic Research 2021). There are multiple reasons that drive panel surveys to mix modes (De Leeuw 2005). First, it can reduce systematic selection error, including noncoverage and nonresponse, as certain population units may be unable or unwilling to participate in a given mode, but may be able and/or more willing if an alternative mode is offered to them. For example, persons who are busy and often away from the household (e.g. due to employment obligations) may not be reachable in a traditional CAPI survey but may be more reachable if a CATI follow-up mode is offered. Conversely, persons who are often at home (e.g. due to unemployment) and weary of unsolicited telephone calls may be more likely to participate in a CAPI follow-up mode as opposed to an exclusively CATI survey. A second reason for mixing modes is that it may lower per-respondent costs if a cheaper mode is offered and a large fraction of sample units participate in that mode, as opposed to exclusively using a more expensive single mode (e.g. CAPI). This is the main motivation for offering less expensive survey modes (e.g. web, CATI) as alternatives to CAPI, as this approach has shown to yield significant cost savings when the modes are implemented sequentially with the less expensive mode offered first (Bianchi et al. 2017; Carpenter and Burton 2018). However, mixing modes can also have undesirable effects on data quality. For example, it is well-established that modes have inherently different measurement error properties that, when mixed, can introduce measurement effectsFootnote 1 (de Leeuw 1992; 2005). In other words, measurement effects can arise when the same respondent answers the same question differently depending on the mode of data collection. Measurement effects are undesirable because they can bias comparisons between respondents who answer in different modes and comparisons with single-mode surveys. Such effects are more likely to occur when mixing interviewer- and self-administered modes which differ strongly in their communication channel (aural vs. visual) and level of interviewer presence (Klausch et al. 2017). These mode differences have been linked to cognitive response processes that differentially affect multiple types of measurement error in surveys, including social desirability bias (the tendency for respondents to provide answers that conform to social or societal norms; Tourangeau and Yan 2007), primacy effects (the tendency to select the first options presented in a visual list of response options), and recency effects (the tendency to select the last options presented in a spoken interview) (Schwarz et al. 1991; Krosnick and Alwin 1987). Although CAPI and CATI modes are both aural and interviewer-administered modes, CATI is thought to have greater “social distance” between respondent and interviewer than CAPI, which is generally viewed as one of the reasons for lower respondent engagement and larger social desirability effects in CATI surveys (Holbrook et al. 2003).Footnote 2 Panel surveys that implement a sequential mixed-mode design at each wave of data collection, such as the PASS survey, are particularly susceptible to measurement effects, not only because different respondents may answer the same questions in different modes, but also because the same respondents may answer in different modes in different waves. While most respondents tend to answer in the same mode at each wave, there is a non-trivial group of respondents who switch between modes over multiple waves (Cernat and Sakshaug 2021a). The ways in which respondents can answer in different modes within- and between-waves has the potential to exacerbate measurement effects over time, causing respondents to answer the same questions differently at different time points depending on the mode they use. In panel surveys, where the primary goal is to collect repeated measures and observe important events over the life course (e.g. education, marriage, births, employment and unemployment, welfare benefit receipt), measurement effects have the potential to misrepresent the prevalence of these key events and distort time trends (Cernat and Sakshaug 2021b,c). Another undesirable effect of mixing modes is differential selection, or composition effects of mode. Differential selection error may increase in sequential mixed-mode surveys if certain types of respondents are strongly overrepresented in the follow-up mode. For example, CATI surveys have been shown to overrepresent households with higher socio-economic status compared to CAPI surveys (Lipps 2016; Holbrook et al. 2003). Although the intention of mixed-mode surveys is to bring in different types of respondents to achieve a more balanced respondent pool, a strong overrepresentation in the follow-up mode (e.g. CATI) may actually produce a greater imbalance relative to the starting mode (CAPI). The problem can be further worsened by selective attrition where respondents with higher socioeconomic status who are overrepresented in one mode (CATI) are more likely to stay in the panel, while respondents with lower socioeconomic status and who are better represented in the alternative mode (CAPI) are more likely to drop-out of the panel. The implication here is that persons with higher socioeconomic status (SES) will be increasingly overrepresented, resulting in an overestimation of SES time trends. Coupled with measurement effects in the CATI mode, the overestimation may be amplified by the remaining respondents who are reluctant to report episodes of unemployment, benefit receipt, or other socially undesirable events. Given that mixing modes in a panel study can have both positive and negative effects on data quality, a key question is whether the net effect of offering a follow-up mode is beneficial from a total error (or mean-squared error) perspective, relative to a single-mode design, and whether the net effect changes over multiple waves of the panel. A reduction in total error would indicate that a sequential mixed-mode design is advantageous for data quality, whereas an increase in MSE would indicate that the mixed-mode design is not advantageous over a single-mode design. In this article, we address this question by utilizing gold standard measures from administrative data that are available for both respondents and nonrespondents of the PASS survey to assess the effect of implementing the secondary CATI mode on nonresponse bias, measurement error bias, and total bias, relative to the counterfactual single-mode CAPI design. The remainder of the article is as follows. In “Background” section we review the relevant literature, identify the specific research gaps that are addressed in the study, and outline our expectations of the results. “Data Sources” section describes the data sources used and “Methods” section presents the methodological framework for the study. The study results are presented in “Results” section and further discussed in “Discussion” section. The main study conclusions and their practical implications are summarized in “Conclusion” section.",
57,1,Journal for Labour Market Research,06 January 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12651-022-00326-3,The dynamics of wage dispersion between firms: the role of firm entry and exit,December 2023,Benedikt Schröpf,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Rising wage inequality as an important phenomenon across developed countries has attracted much attention in the economic and political debate of the last three decades. Apart from that, there is growing interest in the economic consequences of firm dynamics, particularly the entry of new firms and the exit of incumbent firms. Typically, their contribution to the creation and destruction of jobs and their role in fostering innovation and shaping structural change are at question (e.g. Haltiwanger et al. 2013; Schindele and Weyh 2011). However, the question of how firm entries and exits contribute to wage inequality has been largely neglected in scientific and public debates. Therefore, this paper examines the interaction between firm dynamics and wage inequality. The central question addressed here is how newly entering and exiting firms contribute to wage dispersion between establishments in West Germany. The analysis is further enriched by examining the evolution of wage dispersion within different entry cohorts as they grow older, the role of exiting firms in this process, and the relationship between a firm’s exit and its wage level. The dispersion of average wages between firms as an important factor in explaining trends in overall wage inequality has been studied by a large body of research (Davis and Haltiwanger 1991; Dunne et al. 2004; Barth et al. 2016; Card et al. 2018; Song et al. 2019). Also, for Germany, this phenomenon is well documented in the literature (Card et al. 2013; Baumgarten et al. 2020). In addition, a small strand of literature has developed around the question of how firm entry or entrepreneurship relates to inequality. Both empirical and theoretical approaches suggest that newly entering firms tend to increase wage inequality (Castellaneta et al. 2019; Lippmann et al. 2005; Atems and Shand 2018). Card et al. (2013) document an increasing heterogeneity between entering firms of different birth cohorts in Germany. Following the approach proposed by Abowd et al. (1999) (henceforth: AKM), they show that establishment-specific wage premiums became more dispersed, especially after 1995. In contrast, the specific question of how exiting firms contribute to wage dispersion has not been extensively studied even though the rich literature on the wage effects of plant closures and mass layoffs is closely related (e.g., Davis and Von Wachter 2011; Raposo et al. 2021). Malchow-Møller et al. (2011) conducted a noteworthy analysis examining how entering and exiting establishments contribute to the growth of average wages. They find that firm exits have a positive effect on the growth in average wages, suggesting that firms that exit are more likely to have previously operated in the low-wage sector. This paper aims to contribute to the literature in three ways: First, it presents the evolution of the dispersion of average wages between the groups of entering, exiting, and incumbent establishments in West Germany. Second, I study the wage dispersion between and within different entry cohorts and analyze how establishment exits shape the evolutions. In addition, the interrelation between establishment entry and exit dynamics is analyzed. Third, I examine the relationship between establishment exits and the wage level to deepen our understanding of how firm exits contribute to wage dispersion. It is important to note that this analysis is descriptive and should therefore be interpreted as such. Nonetheless, this research offers new insights, particularly with respect to policy implications. From a policy perspective, the entry of new firms is typically regarded as a desirable feature worthy of support. In contrast, the exit of incumbent firms tends to be seen as detrimental. While there is still a broad agreement on the former, the latter view has become controversial only in recent years, even though already Schumpeter (1942) emphasized the crucial role that exiting businesses play in the intrinsic functioning of capitalism. This shift in the public perception can likely be related to the popular zombification hypothesis that associates the low-interest-rate policy of the ECB with stalled firm exit. The inhibited exit of (unprofitable) firms is increasingly regarded as an adverse development as it decelerates structural change and impedes an effective allocation of resources (Banerjee and Hofmann 2018; Fackler et al. 2013). Against this background, this paper aims to contribute to a broader understanding of the consequences of firm entry and exit dynamics on the wage structure. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 synthesizes the related literature and derives the research questions. In Sect. 3, I introduce the dataset used in this study. Section 4 presents the results of the empirical analyses that aim to provide insights into the interrelations between establishment entry, establishment exit and the wage dispersion between establishments. Section 5 concludes.",
