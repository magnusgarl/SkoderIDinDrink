It is now widely agreed that this transformation entailed important lessons and provided valuable contributions to mainstream economics (e.g., Ellman 2012). One of the essential elements of the reform, which drew particular attention, has been the transformation of labor markets in transition countries (Svejnar 1999). Labor economics benefited not only from the broad reform agenda pursued by these countries (e.g., Gorodnichenko et al. 2009; Danzer 2012), but also from the interpretation of the entire transition process in terms of a natural experiment (Christev, Kupets, and Lehmann 2008; Muravyev 2008). The growing interest in labor markets in transition economies initially faced considerable data constraints. Individual and household surveys that were administered during the period of central planning and early transition years were inadequate to the needs of both policy-makers and researchers. As a response, several initiatives to collect data from the region were commenced both within government agencies and by independent research centers. Examples of data collection by independent research centers include the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS-HSE) for Russia (see RLMS-HSE 2012 for dataset description and Gibson et al. 2008 for example of analysis), the Rural-Urban Migration in China (RUMiC) panel data for China (see RUMiC 2008 for dataset description and Akay et al. 2012 for example of analysis) and the very recent “Life in Kyrgyzstan” panel survey for the Kyrgyz Republic (see Brück et al. 2012). While data collection projects started in earnest in the early 1990s, mostly in Central Europe, and in some CIS countries 1, Ukraine long remained a virtual terra incognita for students of labor markets. This is surprising in view of at least three facts. First, Ukraine is the second largest transition country having a territory larger than Metropolitan France and a population of 48.5 million (as of 2001 census) and is also bordering the European Union (since 2004). Second, the transition process in Ukraine was characterized by an extremely large initial shock and a fairly slow recovery. The country’s real GDP declined by more than 60% in the 1990s and has not reached the pre-transition level since then. Third, in addition to its large size in terms of territory and population, Ukraine is characterized by considerable regional diversity, including the well-known divide along ethnic and linguistic lines that became particularly pronounced since the 2004 Orange revolution. In order to have a sound data base for the study of labor market issues central to the transition from Communism to a market-oriented social democracy in the second largest transition economy of Central and Eastern Europe, the program area “Labor Markets in Emerging and Transition Economies” of the Institute for the Study of Labor (IZA) spearheaded an effort to establish a panel household survey in Ukraine. In the first phase of this project, leading to the first two waves of the survey in 2003 and 2004, IZA led a scientific consortium with the other members being the William Davidson Institute of the University of Michigan, the Centre for Economic Reform and Transformation (CERT) of Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, and the Rheinisch-Westfälisches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung in Essen (RWI–Essen). Data collection was entrusted to the Kiev International Institute of Sociology (KIIS). The project received the name of Ukrainian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (ULMS) and was launched in 2003. The sample of the first wave in 2003 consisted of more than 8600 respondents, which is comparable to the initial samples of the American Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), the British Household Panel Studs (BHPS) and the RLMS. Collection of the third wave of the ULMS in 2007 was sponsored by IZA, DIW Berlin and the European Union. Thus, three waves have been collected; in 2003, 2004, and 2007. Currently, the data for the 2012 wave are being collected as a joint effort of IZA and the World Bank. The purpose of this article is two-fold. First, it describes the content and structure of the ULMS with regard to sample design, survey instruments, data access and user support, including essential information about the 2012 wave. Second, it reviews some of the studies which were based on the ULMS data to illustrate the appropriateness and richness of the data to address research and policy issues important not only in the context of Ukraine’s transition, but also more generally. We hope that our paper can inspire many further high quality studies of the Ukrainian transition process. The remainder of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 presents details on sampling, survey instruments, and content of the survey. Section 3 describes the available data. Section 4 provides a selective review of ULMS-based studies. Section 5 concludes.",20

2007, Czaikas and Kis-Katos
2009). The significance of labor migration in conflict-affected countries is reflected in the large increase in remittances to migrant and refugee exporting countries that have experienced recent political crises (Goldring
2002). In this paper, we investigate the impact of remittances on individual labor supply in post-conflict Tajikistan, a country that experienced some of the most significant migration flows in its recent history 1, but remains largely under-researched as a case study. Based on the official data for Tajikistan (Table
1), around eight percent of the population left the country between 1991 and 2005. About 83.8 percent of them left during between 1991 and 1998, which overlaps with the 1992-1998 armed conflict in Tajikistan. By 2005, almost every family in Tajikistan had sent at least one family member abroad as a migrant worker (IMF 2005). In line with the literature on effect of armed conflict on households and individuals, in our analysis we differentiate between the regions by their exposure to the 1992-1998 armed conflict in Tajikistan. We analyze the differences in the impact of remittances on the individual decision to participate in the labor market and on the number of work hours supplied by men and women living in more conflict affected areas, in comparison to individuals in regions less exposed to the war. To study this question, we use individual and household-level data from the 2003 Tajik Living Standards Measurement Study (henceforth, 2003 TLSS) survey. We combine these data with information on violent events during the 1992-1998 civil war in Tajikistan based on two Russian-language newspapers published in Tajikistan, reports by non-governmental organizations, mentions of the conflict in books (e.g. Bliss
2010; Gomart
2003) and daily accounts of the 1992 and 1993 events that rely mostly on government records (Nazriev and Sattorov
2005,
2006). The development literature has long recognized the importance of migration (and resulting remittances) as a mechanism used by households in the times of peace to secure income and improve welfare. There is a large literature that examines the impact of remittances on a number of household-level economic outcomes such as consumption decisions (Adams
2005), production (Damon
2010), schooling (Acosta
2006; Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo
2010) and labor supply (Acosta
2006; Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo
2006; Damon
2007; Hanson
2007). Studies on the relationship between remittances and labor supply find that an increase in remittances has a negative effect on labor hours supplied and labor force participation by men and women of working age and that the effect is often greater for women. Authors suggest that remittances are a source of non-labor income. An increase in non-labor income is often associated with a decrease in the opportunity cost of leisure and the relaxation of credit constraints. These effects in turn allow for a greater tolerance of risk and increased participation in self-employment. Some of the studies focus on countries affected by conflict in the past (e.g. El-Salvador (Acosta
2006; Damon
2007), Nicaragua (Funkhouser
1992)), but they do not take directly into account the effect of conflict on the outcome of interest. This approach may lead to potentially significant omitted variable bias since violent conflict may affect the very structure of labor markets, as well as fundamental individual incentives, tastes and preferences, leading households to make decisions in a way that differs from what they would have done in peaceful settings (see reviews by Blattman and Miguel
2010; Justino
2009,
2012). The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we examine the transfers from private and institutional donors to households by their exposure to the 1992-1998 conflict in Tajikistan. Second, we attempt to advance current understanding of the role of remittances in post-conflict settings by looking at the differentiated ways in which individual labor supply (of men and women aged 16-65) responds to remittance flows, differentiating between communities by their exposure to the 1992-1998 armed conflict. Third, we contribute to the emerging literature on the economic impact of armed conflict by analyzing important labor market effects for civilians (e.g. Fernández et al.
2011; Menon and Rodgers
2011). Similar to previous literature, we find that the amount of remittances received by a given household has an overall negative impact on the labor force participation and hours supplied by men and women. In the full sample, the negative effect of remittances is found to be stronger for men than for women. Such a result is intriguing as previous research on the effects of remittances on labor supply has shown that female labor supply is typically more responsive to changes in remittances (Amuedo-Dorantes and Pozo
2006; Funkhouser
1992; Hanson
2007). The differences between our results and those of the existing literature can be explained by the differences in the samples used, as well as by the differences in the institutional settings. Notably, Tajikistan is a country that is transitioning from the Soviet planned economy into an independent one. The country also experienced a severe civil war that resulted in casualties amounting to between 50,000 and 100,000 people, large population displacement and destruction of industrial and agricultural assets (Bliss
2010; Falkingham 2000). When we differentiate by community’s exposure to the conflict, we find that the labor force participation of women in the communities that suffered from greater physical damage and loss of life during the civil war is negatively associated with the receipt of remittances, suggesting that remittances were used as a coping strategy by the households in these regions. The next section discusses the main hypotheses tested in the paper and the conceptual framework. Section 3 discusses our empirical specification and the main independent variables of interest. Section 4 presents data and preliminary observations. Section 5 describes the main empirical results. The last section concludes the paper.",14

The Orange revolution (November 2004-January 2005), marked a big turning point in Ukrainian history. Following it, several reforms were implemented, accelerating Ukraine’s movement out of its transition period and significantly changing the environment in which economic agents operate. A number of acts of the new government concerned labor market legislation, with a particular emphasis on gender equality. This was a sign of change and an important step in defense of one of the most vulnerable and disadvantaged groups of Ukrainian society in line with the international commitments subscribed by previous governments.1
 In their 2005 study of the gender gap in Ukraine, Ganguli and Terrell welcomed this renewed interest towards gender equality and analyzed the evolution of the gender wage gaps from 1986 (with communism) to 2003 in order to evaluate the distance of Ukraine from the European benchmarks of gender equality in the labor markets. They found that the mean gender gap in Ukraine - corrected for differences in the hours of work - was relatively higher than in other countries2 and it was higher especially in the public sector. (Pignatti 2011), analyzing 2003–2004 data, found that patterns of gender wage gaps in the formal and informal sectors of the economy differed, with the gender wage gap remaining largely unexplained in the formal sector and almost fully explained by individual and job characteristics in the informal one. Since 2005 several decrees and laws on gender equality have been passed, adding to the already existing provisions contained in the Constitution and Labor Code of Ukraine.3 The increased efforts to promote gender equality and to address gender based discrimination have coincided with Ukrainian efforts to speed up the process of integration into the global community and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goal on gender equality. In a 2010 document published by ILO, Olga Kupets lists the progress achieved (for example a decreasing trend characterizing the official measures of the gender wage gap) but also stresses the need for their consolidation and for a renewed effort to define a long-term modernization strategy for the labor market incorporating the principles of gender equality. In 2010, however, the Ukrainian political scene saw new significant changes4 which are already affecting – and will increasingly affect – the development of the Ukrainian labor market. Sticking to the area of gender equality, the Ministry for Family, Youth and Sports, previously responsible for the implementation of the State Programme for Ensuring Gender Equality in Ukrainian Society up to 2010, has been transformed into the State Service of Youth and Sports, and no longer deals with gender policy. This move has raised concern among national experts on gender policy and international organizations. The main goal of this paper is to study the evolution of the gender wage gap in the Ukrainian labor market in a period (2003–2007) characterized by the introduction of new regulations and institutions explicitly designed to promote gender equality. The analysis will move along several different dimensions. Starting from the aggregate level and from the identification of the raw wage gap, I will delve deeper into the analysis, looking at determinants of the wage gap across the wage distribution and across different sectors of the economy (private/public, formal/informal). I will ask to what extent the measured wage gaps depend on a different remuneration of characteristics (interpreted as an indication of discrimination) or on different endowments. I will also look for evidence in favor or against the persistence of “glass ceilings” and “sticky floors” for women’s wages in Ukraine and will try to see whether results are common across different sectors of the labor market. This part of the analysis is particularly interesting as the same aggregate outcomes can hide very different underlying dynamics and patterns in different sectors of the economy. As a final step, I will decompose the changes in the wage gap in the period 2003–2007, looking at what is due to a change in the composition of the labor force (considering not only human capital but also job characteristics) and what is instead due to differences in returns for men and women. The paper starts with a brief literature review followed by a short description of the main events and trends characterizing Ukraine’s history in the period 2003–2007. In section 4 I will introduce the dataset used and in section 5 the main methodologies used in this paper. In section 6 I will present the results and proceed to the analysis. Section 7 is the conclusion.",8
1.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor & Development,31 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9020-1-6,Does more unemployment cause more fear of unemployment?,December 2012,Vladimir Gimpelson,Aleksey Oshchepkov,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Economists are interested not only in actual dynamics, factors, and consequences of unemployment, but in subjective perceptions and expectations of unemployment as well. Fear of unemployment is one such perception and it affects human behavior. Fear of unemployment may decrease wages (Blanchflower,
1991; Aaronson and Sullivan,
1998; Campbell et al.,
2007; Blanchflower and Shadforth,
2007), contain consumption (Stephens,
2004; Benito,
2006), negatively affect health (Burgard et al.,
2009), suppress subjective well-being, and complicate family relations (Burchell,
1994), among other things. The distribution of unemployment fear across the population is also of high importance. First, workers’ subjective perceptions of unemployment (as well as objective data on unemployment rates and durations, firings, job losses, etc.) are traditionally considered as indicators for the efficiency of the existing social and employment protections (e.g., OECD,
1997; Manski and Straub,
2000; Clark and Postel-Vinay,
2009). Second, workers’ fear of unemployment can be a measure of likelihood of future unemployment. As we know, expectations are likely to affect future behaviour. Third, politicians often use various fears as a convenient tool for political manipulation.2 Widespread fear of unemployment can induce politicians to support more rigid employment protection legislation (EPL). In its turn, more rigid EPL is likely to suppress job creation in the formal sector and to expand informal sector employment. These outcomes feed fears, creating a vicious circle that is hard to disrupt (Clark and Postel-Vinay,
2009). Fourthly, the fear may serve various particularistic interests as well. By heightening fears of unemployment among the population and falsifying inflated forecasts to this end, a Labour Ministry responsible for employment programs and support of the unemployed can get additional funds from the state coffers. Large enterprises can exploit this fear in order to lobby for subsidies from the government and pressure workers for wage concessions.3
 These results motivate research in factors that may drive these fears. As multiple studies on this issue show, fear of unemployment varies across social and demographic groups (e.g., Manski and Straub,
2000; Elman and O’Rand,
2002). In general, more competitive workers and employees in better-protected jobs tend to express less fear of unemployment. The quality of institutional environment where firms and workers operate matters as well. However, trends in actual unemployment remain the most natural cause of this fearfulness, and many studies confirm this hypothesis. The fear of unemployment moves in line with actual unemployment, and even small changes in unemployment are translated into significant changes in the level of fear (e.g., Schmidt,
1999; Green et al.,
2000; Campbell et al.,
2007). This paper considers the case of Russia, where the link between actual unemployment and individual fearfulness can be weak or seriously muted. On the one hand, economic development over the last 20 years was extremely bumpy, with large swings in the GDP growth followed by increases (or decreases, correspondingly) in the unemployment rate. On the other hand, as available survey evidence suggests, workers’ subjective perceptions of job instability were highly inertial and showed little reaction to actual trends. The fear of unemployment among Russian workers and its tentative determinants were explored earlier in Gimpelson et al. (
2003) and
Linz and Semykina (2008). Findings from these two papers note some anomalies that mark the Russian labor market in comparison to the labor markets in more advanced economies. For example, in Russia this fear is not gender neutral (women are more fearful in this respect than men are) and it increases over age and tenure (in most countries, job tenure tends to reduce fears). As to the relationship between actual labor market conditions and unemployment fear, the authors of both papers conclude that it did not appear early in the transition but became statistically significant later on. However, these papers did not consider the period after 2004, when fears remained high despite rapid economic growth and further unemployment decline. In this paper, using the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey data, we study the association between actual unemployment and fear of unemployment in the period from 1994 to 2009. This period includes the years of steep transformational recession (1994-1998), the phase of recovery and growth (2000-08), and the recent economic crisis (2008-2009). We employ two alternative measures for this fear. The first measure looks at the fear of losing one’s current job, while the second deals with the fear of not finding relevant re-employment in case of displacement. Our methodology is based on estimating an ordered probit model, where fearfulness is regressed on actual unemployment rates with controls for individual and job characteristics. Besides the standard regional unemployment rates, we use unemployment rates for local peer groups that are based on estimates from the Russian Labour Force Survey. These indicators are better proxies of labor market-related risks for particular workers and have larger variance. The key finding of our study is that unemployment-related fearfulness of workers is weakly linked to the actual unemployment rate. These results are robust to exclusion of potentially endogenous variables; they hold for different periods, subsamples and regardless of variation in levels of jobs security. Even if an association exists, the practical impact of unemployment on perceptions is subtle. As simulations show, drastically large fluctuations in unemployment add practically little to intensity of fears. These results allow suggest that the high level and persistence of fear of unemployment in Russia may be caused by non-economic factors. The next section presents the story of the Russian labor market over the period of 2000-09 and how it is reflected in subjective perceptions. Section 3 explains our research methodology and empirical data. A descriptive analysis of the fear-related variables is provided in Section 4. Sections 5 and 6 discuss findings from the econometric analysis. In the conclusion, we sum up our major findings and outline further research efforts.",4
1.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor & Development,28 December 2012,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9020-1-5,Risk attitudes and informal employment in a developing economy,December 2012,John Bennett,Matthew Gould,Matthew D Rablen,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In developing economies the majority of urban employment is informal (OECD [10]), and whether as wage- or self-employment, informality can involve significant risks for the worker. Informal workers have little social protection and relatively volatile earnings, while microfirms have a high rate of failure (Perry et al. [11]; Günther and Launov [7]). An absence of legal protection by the police or courts may leave workers at risk of being cheated (Deshingkar and Akter [5]). Lack of application of health and safety regulations may expose both informal workers and the self employed to significant health risks, and the growth of informality is associated with a greater incidence of depression and stress-related illnesses (World Bank [14]). However, in virtually all of the theoretical literature on labour market informality in developing economies, workers are either assumed to be risk-neutral or risk is disregarded altogether. In the seminal paper by Rauch ([12]), which is an adaptation of the Lucas ([9]) formulation of firm size-distribution to informal labour markets, the focus is on the heterogeneity of agents’ (entrepreneurial) ability, but there is no allowance for risk aversion.1 In the informality literature based on search-and-matching theory the risk of not being able to find a job is a central feature, but workers are assumed risk neutral (see, e.g., Zenou [15]; Albrecht et al. [1]). The present paper contributes to the Lucas-Rauch branch of the literature by introducing risk aversion. We allow for uncertainty of earnings and we assume that workers, who are heterogeneous, are characterized in two dimensions – risk aversion and ability. In our model, a worker can be in one of three labour market states – formal wage employment, informal wage employment or self-employment. We assume that formal wage employment gives a certain income, but the other two states generate uncertain income, with the uncertainty being greater (in a sense that we specify) for self-employment than for informal wage employment.2 The formal wage is assumed to exceed the maximum possible level of the informal wage. Ability is assumed to affect earnings in self-employment, but not in either type of wage employment. We take the demand side of the labour market as given, with downward-sloping demand functions for each type of labour, and we focus on the supply of labour to the three types of work. The great majority of urban self-employment in developing economies can be classified as informal. In Latin America and the Caribbean, for example, according to Perry et al. ([11]), 26.58% of urban workers are self-employed (Perry et al. use the term ‘independent’), of whom 23.64% are ‘informal’ and only 2.94% are ‘professionals’. We may therefore regard all self employment (or at least involuntary self employment) as informal in our model.3 As specified by Rauch ([12]) and much of the ensuing literature on informality, we assume that the wage rate in the formal sector is fixed above the market-clearing level. This might be because of a minimum wage law or union activity; it might be an implicit representation of social security benefit provision; or it might be because formal firms are relatively large, so that monitoring of workers is difficult and employers choose to pay an efficiency wage to deal with moral hazard. The model is formulated in Section 2. Workers may differ with respect to risk aversion and ability, though each has constant relative risk aversion. Each individual worker may, in principle, gain formal wage employment, informal wage employment or self employment. Because the latter two types of employment yield uncertain income, we specify von Neumann-Morgenstern utility. Because the formal wage rate is set above the market-clearing level, there is rationing of formal jobs and so not all workers who prefer formal employment will achieve it. For each worker we specify the first preference among the three employment states as a function of risk attitude and ability. Under our assumptions informal wage work can never be a first preference. However, formal wage jobs are rationed, and so some of the workers whose first preference is formal wage employment are forced to turn to other work. For these workers we specify a second preference, which can only be for self employment or informal wage employment. Again, we specify this choice as a function of risk attitude and ability. Self employment here is defined as ‘involuntary’, whereas self-employment as a first choice is defined as ‘voluntary’.4 Worker preferences across risk attitude and ability characteristics are illustrated diagrammatically. In Section 3, assuming that the informal wage rate is market-clearing, we specify conditions for the existence of equilibrium and we illustrate the equilibrium by reinterpreting the diagram formulated in Section 2. We then derive and discuss the comparative statics of the model, examining the effects on the labour market of several policy changes and of some simple representations of economic development. Section 4 concludes, and proofs are given in an appendix.",1

Figure
1 shows the decline in the percentage of total employment accounted for by industry (including both mining and manufacturing) from 1989 to 1995 in several East European countries. The drop is large in all cases, but it is by far the largest in Romania. 
Industrial Employment in Seven Transitional Economies, 1989-1995.
 Although the existence of the decline in industrial employment is well-known (if not the fact of Romania’s pre-eminence in at least this dimension of transition), there is little consensus on its meaning. Some observers tend to equate the decline of industry with economic deterioration more generally, and they stress the social costs of job loss in the formerly well-paid industrial sectors. Others emphasize the inherited misallocation of labor and see the decline as a reflection of progress in restructuring. In this paper, I argue that both views may have some validity, but that an evaluation of the fall in industrial employment depends on a number of factors that have heretofore not been measured. The paper employs a unique data set – matched labor force survey files on 22,161 working age Romanians in 1993 and 1995 – to quantify some of the important factors and to improve understanding of the labor reallocation process associated with the industrial decline. After a brief description of the data and the changing characteristics of industrial employment in section 2, the discussion is organized around three sets of results. The first set concerns the measurement of the flows of industrial labor in Romania from 1993 to 1995. Information on the change in total industrial employment obscures the possibility that disaggregated industrial sectors have had heterogeneous experiences of decline, with expansion in some areas and decline in others; if such heterogeneity is significant, it would support the view that significant reallocation of labor is occurring. The change in total industrial employment also masks the possibility that there may be significant inflows as well as outflows from industry. The existence of inflows would again support the reallocation view, in the sense that the composition, if not the numbers employed, of labor would be changing. Is there some dynamism in Romanian industry during this early transition period such that there exists significant turnover of employment and such that sub-sectors display some heterogeneity in their labor market behavior, or is the industrial sector characterized by uniform decline? In section 3, I present evidence on these issues. The second set of results concerns the employment status in 1995 of workers employed in industry in 1993. In addition to remaining employed in the same industrial sector, five possible destinations for those who change status are distinguished: employment in a different industrial sector, employment in services, employment in agriculture, unemployment, and nonparticipation in the labor force. What is the relative importance of each of these destinations? How one evaluates the overall drop in industrial employment depends at least partially on the answer to this question. If most movers end up in unemployment, in labor force withdrawal, or in marginal agricultural activities, then it would appear that the substantial down-sizing is accompanied by relatively little genuine reallocation occurring, at least during the time period under observation. On the other hand, if most movers have new jobs in other industrial sectors or in services then the observed outflows of employment from industrial sectors is merely one side of the process by which labor is reallocated to new uses. Which view is near to the truth? In section 4, I attempt to answer this question by analyzing 1993-95 employment transition matrices for the entire matched labor survey sample (22,161 observations) as well as on a more detailed basis for those employed in industry (5,581) in 1993. The final set of issues concerns the impact of individual and firm characteristics on the process of industrial labor reallocation over the 1993 to 1995 period. What types of industrial workers have tended to move, and which characteristics tend to raise the probability of each of the alternative destinations? In addition to examining gender, age, and urban/rural residence, I focus particularly on the effect of different types of education on the probability that an industrial worker in 1993 moves to unemployment, to nonparticipation in the labor force, and to different types of jobs. Does the amount of human capital (measured by schooling) or the specificity of skills (measured by attendance at more general or more specific educational programs) affect the flexibility of worker response and the quality of labor market outcomes? With respect to characteristics of the industrial employer in 1993, I focus on ownership, motivated by the possibility that differences in corporate governance give rise to different labor market behavior. Is private ownership associated with greater or lower outflows of labor and with any differences in the destination of those workers who leave?

According to this argument, often attributed to Pritchett (2001), education works as a gateway to inefficient activities, such as unproductive public sector employment, rather than boosting productivity in the competitive and open sectors of the economy. Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries are usually portrayed as primary examples of countries where expectations related to educational investments have not been fulfilled. Even though these countries invested heavily in education after gaining independence in post WW II period, the economic growth has been disappointing. Indeed, Makdisi et al. (2003) show that the level education has not been a significant determinant of economic growth in MENA countries. The experience of Tunisia is a typical example of this pattern. Investment in education was for a long time larger than in most countries in the developing region. Despite these investments, however, both GDP growth and total factor productivity growth have been very low since the 1980’s. Previous literature on the effects of education investments in MENA countries has focused on the estimation of private returns to education and typically reports estimates that are comparable to the ones obtained in industrialized countries. This pattern of results would suggest that, at least at the private level, educational investment does pay off also in this region. However, previous literature also points to potential inefficiencies. Salehi-Isfahani et al. (2009) report estimates that seem to suggest that returns are convex in the level of education in Egypt and Iran and interpret this as evidence of “sheepskin effects”, that is returns attached to official degrees rather than actual learning. Assaad (1997) and Tansel (2005) provide evidence on the attractiveness of public sector employment for university graduates in Egypt and Turkey, respectively. However, due to lack of suitable instruments, this literature has been unable to address the causality of these estimates. Isolating the causal effect of education is important because the observed patterns could be driven by relevant unobserved factors correlated with educational attainment, such as the capacity to finance education or unobserved productive skills (credit constraints and ability bias, respectively). For instance, convexity of estimated returns to education could be due to the fact that higher levels of education are costly so that credit constrained individuals are left out, and extra return premia are generated for these levels. The attractiveness of the public sector to university graduates could be potentially driven by a successful public sector selection on the basis of ability. None of these explanations would imply that the education is used to access privately rewarding but inefficient activities. This paper is an attempt to assess the extent of inefficient absorption of educated individuals by the public sector in Tunisia by providing evidence on the effect of education on the employment status of Tunisian men in different sectors. Our estimates purge the effect of education from the aforementioned biases by exploiting a policy change that restricted the access to secondary schools for several cohorts in the 1970’s. We use this policy change as an instrument for educational attainment and use Tunisian census and labor force survey data to estimate the effect of educational attainment on occupational outcomes. The education policy change we exploit took place after the rapid expansion of public education in the 1960’s. This growth of public education led to increased budgetary pressures to which the Tunisian government responded by restricting the access to secondary education drastically. The promotion rates to secondary education were decreased by 15 percentage points starting in 1971 and remained at low levels until 1980 when they were increased again approximately back to the level where they were before 1971. These policy changes, both limiting and subsequently loosening of entry to secondary school, generate between cohorts variation in educational attainment and we use this variation as an instrument for educational attainment. The first stage results suggest that the policy change is a strong instrument: individuals that were affected by the reform completed on average one grade less of education1. The compliers of our instrument (i.e. the people affected by the policy change) are likely to have been students at the margin of passing to secondary school and therefore probably academically weak in relative terms. We use micro data from Tunisian 2004 census and 2010 Labor Force Survey to estimate the effect of educational attainment on employment and occupational status of men in different sectors, focusing on the distinctions between the public and the private corporate sector. Descriptive statistics and OLS results suggest no inefficient over-representation of educated workers in the public sector. The public administration does employ more college workers, but this appears to be due to the specific occupational structure of the sector, particularly its abundance of health and education workers. Hence, the descriptive evidence would suggest that educated workers are not allocated inefficiently in the Tunisian labor market and that we would need to look for alternative explanations for the lack of economic growth from educational investment. However, using the changes in the access to secondary education as an instrument for education does deliver results that are consistent with inefficient absorption of educated workers by the public sector. First, IV estimates of the effect of education on working in the public sector exceeds the effect on working in the private sector. This suggests that educational attainment, when purged from the effect of other productive characteristics, works as a gateway to public sector jobs in the Tunisian labor market. The pattern, however, could still be driven by differing occupation structures across sectors. Our second set of results thus focuses on differences across sectors in selected occupations. We find no effect of education on white collar occupations in the multinational sector, with the exception of clerical work, the least skill-intensive of our white collar occupations. In contrast we find a clear effect of education on most white collar occupations in the public sector. The pattern is most striking for managerial occupations: this effect is large in the public sector, considerably weaker in the private Tunisian sector and essentially nonexistent in the multinational sector. The interpretation of these results as inefficient absorption of educated workers by the public sector is strengthened by the fact that our estimates probably apply to relatively academically weak students that should have benefited least from the acquisition of technical skills at school. This is because the policy that we use as our instrument is likely to have shocked the education level of students at the margin of accessing secondary school. Consistent with this idea, we find no effect of education on natural science occupations in any sector even though natural science occupations should be the most skill intensive occupations in our data. We argue that the fact that education increased the chances of presumably “marginal” students to work as managers in the public sector but not in the multinational sector is consistent with the idea that the public administration hires and promotes workers inefficiently, rewarding titles rather than actual skills. Hence, even if our identification strategy does not allow us to formally distinguish the effects of titles from years of education, this pattern of results is consistent with the public sector sheepskins effects discussed in the earlier literature. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In the following section we present a short history of educational investment in Tunisia and describe the policy reform that we will exploit in our identification strategy. The third section describes the data sets used in the analysis and presents some descriptive statistics on the allocation of educated workers in the Tunisian labor market. We then move on to present the results on the effect of educational attainment on the employment status. We report IV estimates of the effect of education on the probability of working in different sectors on average as well as separately for certain occupations. The fifth section concludes.",4

data",December 2013,Carlos Lamarche,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Latin American economies are known for offering disappointing evidence in terms of
development. Argentina is a leading example of an economy falling behind the United
States and other Western world economies in the last half century. Although existing
theories offer different explanations, a conventional view focuses on government
policies restricting competition and efficiency. Industry-wide work rules may be seen
within this view, because they set working conditions for heterogeneous firms in an
industry at a regional or national level. Thus, unions might generate inefficiencies
associated with restrictive work practices, having a negative impact on productivity.
This paper offers industry-level evidence that in an economy promoting policies to
weaken industry-wide collective bargaining, labor productivity in manufacturing
improves. Argentina’s labor market reforms in the early 1990’s invite an opportunity
for estimating the effect of work practices on productivity. For decades, labor market
institutions had responded to a monopolistic (state-sanctioned) protection of unions by
sectors, centralized bargaining including industry-wide work rules, and union contracts
of indefinite duration (Etchemendy 2001, O’Connell 1999). During the 1970’s and 1980’s, contracts signed by
industry had been dominating contracts signed by firms leading to what is best known as
industry-wide work rules. The hierarchy of contracts could have important implications
for efficiency and management’s ability to organize production since industry-wide
agreements include binding standards applied throughout the industry. Since the reforms
in the early 1990’s, the government implemented policies promoting firm-level
collective agreements that were bargained at low levels of organization (Tuman and
Morris 1998). This includes a decentralization framework for
collective bargaining and negotiations based on productivity. Although the reforms were
in practice only partially effective, they affected industrial relations in the
manufacturing sector. For instance, several contracts in the automobile industry were
limited to the utilization of high quality production techniques. Our identification strategy is based on the comparison of manufacturing industries whose
workers are covered by contracts bargained after the reforms and industries whose
workers are covered by contracts bargained before the reforms, when unions played a
major role at the industry and national level. It is naturally challenging to
investigate how work practices including rules on technology acquisition affect
productivity levels and growth, but the exercise should offer a credible measure of the
effect of industry-wide work rules. First, the policy change should be perceived as
exogenous relative to the manufacturing industries because the reforms were part of
Argentina’s market-oriented structural reforms that include a liberalization
program, privatized public enterprises, and measures to deregulate the economy. Second,
it is possible to find work rules that were bargained between firms and unions from
samples of collective agreements signed before and after the labor reforms. We develop a
unique union contract data set that includes union practices on capital acquisition
affecting manufacturing firms located in different states. To the best of our knowledge,
our study is the first one that uses union contract data in a developing country to
examine the effect of work practice changes on productivity. Although the reform may be considered to be exogenous, work practices are suspected to
be endogenous because unions and firms bargain on practices and productivity after the
reforms. In order to investigate this possibility empirically, we employ classical
instrumental variable approaches for estimating a difference-in-difference model. The
specification includes industry effects and state effects. To instrument a work rule
bargained in an industry located in a state, we use length of contracts and number of
employees covered by union contracts in other industries located in other states. These
instruments capture variation created by the reforms that is not related to productivity
advances in the industry. The sets of instruments pass standard tests used by
practitioners in all the specifications. The evidence shows that industry-wide practices
on displacement of workers and capital acquisition have a negative impact on
productivity. However, in the period after the reforms, union practices do not appear to
restrict economic efficiency. This evidence might be interpreted as suggesting that
policies designed to weaken the industry-wide collective agreements increased
firm’s efficiency in the manufacturing sector. A recent body of the literature investigates the distributional effect of policy (see,
e.g., Bandiera et al. 2010, Bitler et al. 2006). While the empirical literature traditionally has focused upon
estimating how unions affect mean productivity, this approach may be incomplete if
industry-wide rules do not similarly impact low- and high- productivity industries. As
in Bandiera et al. 2010, we model heterogeneity of effects
throughout a quantile regression model. We can use instrumental variable and panel data
quantile regression approaches to estimate the models (Chernozhukov and Hansen (2006, 2008), Harding and Lamarche 2009, Koenker 2004). Existing methods,
however, are not well suited for investigating the effect of practices on our
productivity equation. We simply accommodate the approaches proposed in Koenker (2004) and Harding and Lamarche (2009) to
estimate the distributional effect of work practices on the conditional response
distribution. We find that practices on capital acquisition have a small negative impact
at the lower tail of the conditional productivity growth distribution, suggesting that
this practice has a modest negative effect on low-productivity growth industries. On the
other hand, practices on technology acquisition seem to have an adverse effect on
high-productivity growth industries, decreasing productivity by 6.7%. The results for
the period post-reform suggest that productivity growth improves 3.6% under weakened
industry-wide practices on the incorporation of new technology. Union practices affecting economic efficiency have received extensive attention from
theorists and applied economists. Theoretical support for the effect of working rules on
aggregate output growth is given by Holmes and Schmitz (1995),
Parente and Prescott (1999
2000), Prescott
(1998), Cole et al. (2005), and Bental
and Demougin (2006). Holmes and Schmitz (1995) show that better technology is not adopted in an economy where workers
have some degree of monopoly power. Prescott (1998) argues that
work practices affect economic efficiency. In Parente and Prescott (1999), the coalition of factor suppliers set work practices and wages, and
make it difficult to enter the market with a more productive technology. Inferior
technologies are used, and consequently there is less growth in output. Cole et al.
(1999) argue that international and domestic competitive
barriers explain why Latin America economies have not followed Western economies
success. The large existing empirical evidence is controversial. The literature reports positive
and negative overall union productivity effects consistent with the fact that unions
have two “faces”. Freeman and Medoff (1984) initiated
a debate by pointing out that potential increases in productivity are induced by unions
that provide workers a collective voice in the workplace. In contrast, unions may reduce
productivity by reallocation and inefficiency associated with restrictive work rules
(Bremmels 1987).1 The mixed empirical evidence of the
effect of unions on productivity covers a variety of industries including manufacturing,
construction, and services in the United States and United Kingdom. A few papers,
notably Ferreira and Rossi (2003) and Galiani and Sturzenegger
(2008), have studied the effect of unions in Latin America.
Our empirical approach, that uses data before and after a policy change, is similar to
the one used in Ferreira and Rossi (2003). The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 introduces a theoretical framework.
Section 3 presents institutional details and describes the union contract data set
constructed in this paper. While Section 4 briefly presents models and methods, Section
5 presents empirical results. Section 6 concludes.",4

UISA are individual savings accounts to which employer and employee transfer a share of the worker’s salary for possible unemployment spells. Before the introduction, unemployment protection was practically limited to severance pay in case of job termination due to economic necessities of the firm. Additionally, high opportunity costs were involved in job change, and employers had to deal with rigid labor market regulations. After the introduction of UISA, the access to and amount of benefits transferred to workers in case of unemployment or inactivity increased, and opportunity costs of workers changing employment decreased, while ad-hoc obligations of employers to lay off workforce were reduced. While incentives to leave unemployment have been studied in this context (Reyes, van Ours, & Vodopivec 2011;; Huneeus, Leiva, & Micco Huneeus, Leiva, & Micco ; Huneeus, Leiva, & Micco 2012), this study is the first one to my knowledge to empirically investigate the effect of UISA on employment duration. In this paper I fill the gap by using longitudinal social protection data containing information of employment duration of formal private sector workers before and after the introduction of the policy. The paper examines (i) whether the introduction of UISA affected employment duration among formal private sector workers, and (ii) the magnitude of this effect. Following the policy introduction, I expect that workers reacted to the changes by reduced employment duration. I conduct an empirical analysis using survival analysis techniques to analyze employment duration: in the first part I focus exclusively on the failure of the employment relation: if the current employment relation was terminated, irrespective of the event that follows. In the second part I apply a competing-risk model, where the different following events after employment termination are taken into account. The results confirm that workers affiliated to the scheme show an increased hazard ratio of leaving employment, or accelerated time to employment termination, suggesting shorter employment duration and higher mobility of the workforce: they have a higher hazard of leaving employment in the Cox model, or accelerated time to failure in the parametric analysis, with this effect being statistically significant throughout the analysis. In the competing-risk analysis, the outcome is equally significant if the following event is a new employment relation or unemployment, and for the final regression model in the case of inactivity. The effect is larger for workers becoming unemployed or inactive compared to workers changing jobs. The paper is organized as follows: After the introduction, Section 2 describes the Chilean UISA scheme, followed by a literature review on severance pay and labor mobility in Section 3. Section 4 specifies the database used for the analysis, including descriptive statistics of relevant variables. Section 5 describes the method used for the analysis. In Section 6 I apply survival analysis techniques for the empirical analysis and discuss the results: I start with the non-parametric analysis using the Kaplan-Meier estimator, continue with the semi-parametric Cox model and parametric models, before finalizing the analysis with competing-risk models where three different possible endpoints are taken into account. The final section concludes.",1
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor & Development,07 November 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9020-2-8,The Egypt labor market panel survey: introducing the 2012 round,December 2013,Ragui Assaad,Caroline Krafft,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"The Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey, carried out by the Economic Research Forum (ERF) in cooperation with Egypt’s Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) since 1998, has become the mainstay of labor market and human resource development research in Egypt, being the first and most comprehensive source of publicly available micro data on the subject. The 2012 round of the survey provides a unique opportunity to ascertain the impact of the momentous events accompanying the January 25th revolution on the Egyptian economy and labor market and on the lives of Egyptian workers and their families. The Egypt Labor Market Panel Survey of 2012 (ELMPS 2012) is the third round of this longitudinal survey, which was also carried out in 1998 and 20061. Like other labor markets in the MENA region, the Egyptian labor market suffers from high youth unemployment, low and stagnant rates of female labor force participation, rapid increases in educational attainment, but poor quality education, anemic private sector growth and continued informalization, and strong preference for public sector employment among new entrants (see Assaad 2013). In addition, the fact that Egypt is in the midst of a deep economic downturn, which started with the world financial crisis of 2008/9 and deepened considerably after the January 25th 2011 revolution, affords an opportunity to study how labor markets react to such economic downturns. Anecdotal evidence suggests that although hiring slows in such crises, there are appear to be few outright layoffs and relatively little job destruction. Instead, real earnings appear to adjust downward and employment in some sectors becomes more precarious and irregular. The economic crisis has also interacted in complex ways with the evolution of the youth bulge, whose peak seems to have shifted beyond the age of labor market entry, thus placing reduced pressure on labor supply, just at the time when labor demand slowed. The 2012 round of the ELPMS will allow for a careful examination of all these issues and many others. It contains a great deal of information about current employment characteristics for a nationally representative sample of individuals, but also allows for the study of labor market dynamics and employment trajectories over time, both through the panel design as well as through a large number of retrospective questions about the individual’s employment history. The ELMPS is also notable for the fact that it allows for clear distinctions between market and subsistence work, allowing flexibility for researchers to explore various notions of economic activity, such as the market and extended labor force definitions. It uses a battery of questions to identify participation in market and subsistence work, an approach that is particularly critical to correctly identifying the work status of women and children. Additionally, the survey allows for various definitions of unemployment to be explored by asking separate questions about the desire to work, availability for work, and search behavior. Having detected employment, the ELMPS collects a great deal of information about the characteristics of employment, including its formality, regularity, the form it takes, the benefits that are associated with it, the nature of the workplace, and the conditions of work. The 2012 round includes some subjective assessments about satisfaction with one’s work and attitudes about changes that occurred since the January 25th revolution. It also asks respondents to report about some of the characteristics of their employers, where relevant, such as size, legal form, formality status, export orientation, and degree of reliance on tourism. In addition to standard labor market topics such as labor force participation, employment, unemployment, and earnings, the ELMPS also covers topics such as parental background, education, housing, access to services, residential mobility, migration and remittances, time use, marriage patterns and costs, fertility, women’s decision making and empowerment, savings and borrowing behavior, and the operation of household enterprises and farms. Besides the survey’s panel design, which permits the study of various phenomena over time, the survey also contains a large number of retrospective questions about the timing of major life events such as education, residential mobility, jobs, marriage and fertility. The survey provides detailed information about place of birth and subsequent residence, as well information about schools and colleges attended at various stages of an individual’s trajectory, which permit the individual records to be linked to information from other data sources about the geographic context in which the individual lived and the educational institutions s/he attended. These are just a few of the features of the ELMPS that make it a particularly valuable data source for researchers, and also an excellent model for researchers interested in undertaking similar surveys. This paper introduces the 2012 round of the ELMPS and coincides with the release of the public use micro data from this round as well as the integrated data from the previous rounds in both repeated cross section and panel formats. We proceed as follows. First, we describe the samples and questionnaires for each survey round, as well as information on access to the micro data. Second, we describe the data collection process in the 2012 round and present information on the attrition processes observed in the panel and the creation of weights to correct for this attrition. Third, we present a comparison of our data to other statistical sources for Egypt to evaluate the representativeness of the sample. We also present a comparison of unemployment trends based on other sources and the ELMPS to demonstrate how the collection of the high quality data provided in the ELMPS allows for a substantially improved understanding of labor market trends and conditions. The first round of the panel, the Egypt Labor Market Survey of 1998 (ELMS 1998) was carried out on a nationally representative sample of 4,816 households containing 23,997 individuals2. The original sample of the ELMS 1998 was a two-stage stratified random sample selected from a CAPMAS master sample3. Two hundred primary sampling units (PSUs) were systematically selected from among the enumeration areas of the CAPMAS master sample from geographic strata representing the 22 governorates covered by the survey divided into urban and rural subcomponents, where relevant. Urban areas were over-represented in that sample (140 out of 200 PSUs at a time when the rural population made up 56.8 percent of the population), an issue that was taken into account in the creation of sampling weights. The ELMPS 2006 followed the initial ELMS 1998 sample, locating 3,685 households from the original 4,816 surveyed in 1998, and adding 2,168 new households that emerged from these households as a result of splits, as well as a refresher sample of 2,498 households, all totaling 8,351 households containing 37,140 individuals. In 2006, the refresher sample of households was selected from an additional 100 PSUs randomly selected from a new master sample prepared by CAPMAS. The additional PSUs were selected to represent the actual distribution of rural and urban areas across governorates at that time. The ELMPS 2012 is therefore the third round of a periodic longitudinal survey that tracks the labor market and the demographic characteristics of households and individuals interviewed in 2006, some of whom were also interviewed in 1998. The field work for the ELMPS 2012 was carried out from March to June of 2012. The final sample for 2012 round of the survey was 12,060 households, consisting of 6,752 households from the 2006 sample, 3,308 new households that emerged from these households as a result of splits, and a refresher sample of 2,000 households. This refresher sample was selected from an additional 200 PSUs selected from an updated CAPMAS master sample. It was designed to over-sample areas with high migration rates to increase the representation of current migrants in the sample4. Of the 37,140 individuals interviewed in the 2006 survey, 28,770 (77 percent) were successfully re-interviewed in 2012. These individuals, 13,218 of whom were also tracked in 1998, form a panel that can be used for longitudinal analysis. The 2012 sample also includes 20,416 new individuals adding up to a total of 49,186 individuals. The attrition that occurred from the original 1998 sample to 2006 was mostly random in nature, due to the loss of records containing identifying information for 1998 households (Assaad and Roushdy 2009). The attrition that occurred from 2006 to 2012 was due to a variety of processes. We discuss the factors related to these attrition processes and how they are corrected for using non-response weights below. The 1998, 2006, and 2012 questionnaires all have three major sections: (i) a household questionnaire administered to the head of household or his or her spouse, requesting information about basic demographic characteristics of all household members, ownership of durable goods and assets, and housing conditions, services, and facilities; (ii) an individual questionnaire administered to every individual in the household age six and above; and (iii) an enterprise and income module that collects information on enterprises operated by the household, as well as all non-labor income sources. In 2006 and 2012 this section also includes information on current migrants, remittances, and transfers. The questionnaires for the different survey rounds are intentionally similar to ensure data comparability over time. However, additional modules and questions have been added to the surveys over time. Table 1 lists the different modules in the individual questionnaire, and indicates which modules were included in all three rounds, as well as modules added in 2006 and 2012. The initial 1998 ELMS and subsequent surveys collected information on parents’ characteristics, respondents’ education, employment, and unemployment, job characteristics, job mobility and geographic mobility, and earnings. The 2006 ELMPS added modules on siblings’ characteristics, fertility, women’s status, the cost of marriage, and questions on the characteristics of the first job. The 2006 round also added additional questions to detect employment and a more detailed education history. The ELMPS 2012 added a life events calendar, tracking education, marriage, work, and migration over time, as well as modules on health, return migration, information technology, and savings and borrowing. Additionally, in 2012, the module on female employment was extended to include previous as well as current wage workers. Questions were added on non-wage earnings in 2012. The mobility module was also expanded to better capture information on first jobs and questions were included about any job changes since the revolution. As well as including detailed labor market data, the ELMPS surveys include detailed information on education, geographic residence, occupation, and economic activity, which can be linked to other sources of data on Egypt. The data includes the codes for all schools attended, as well as for the educational certificate an individual obtained. Geographic codes identifying up to four different places of residence are collected. Additionally, detailed economic activity and occupation codes are collected. This level of detail allows researchers to connect the ELMPS data to other datasets on Egypt, and further expands the opportunities for research and analysis. The public use micro data for the 1998 and 2006 surveys, as well as a harmonized dataset including the 1988 special LFS, are available from ERF at http://www.erfdataportal.com. The public use micro data and documentation for the 2012 round will become available on November 1, 2013 from ERF, also at http://www.erfdataportal.com.

In contrast, data are not centrally or systematically collected for the private educational sector (comprising those studying either English language for more than six months or A-levels, and those in vocational training, further education (FE), pre-university preparation, and higher education (HE). However, it is thought that in recent times these international students have numbered between 150,000 and 200,000 (UK Council for International Student Affairs 2010). A British Council (2010) report, covering the fiscal year 2009/10, estimates that the number studying on English Language courses in the UK in any given year could be as high as half-a-million and calculates that the English language tuition industry is currently worth somewhere between £3 billion and £4 billion per annum to the UK economy. The total value of UK exports of education services4 in 2003/04 was calculated at £8.6 billion (Lenton 2007), with a more recent British Council report estimating international education and training exports to be currently worth in excess of £12.5 billion (British Council 2010). It is evident that international students contribute significantly towards the revenues of educational institutions, and more broadly to the UK economy5. In addition, their presence in the UK is generally regarded as having positive cultural benefits, and helps create future opportunities for increased trade, investment and political influence. Indeed, the importance of international students to the UK was acknowledged by the government when the Prime Minister’s Initiative for International Education (PMI) was launched in 1999, and a second recent phase (PMI2) initiated in 2006 designed to attract an increased number of international students to the UK6. The global demand for international education is anticipated to increase dramatically in the near future. Bohm et al. (2004) forecast that the demand for international student places will increase to approximately six million by 2020 with Asia predicted to comprise about three-quarters of the increased global demand across the five major English-speaking destinations7. The emphasis of the present research on developing countries is important as the demand for UK education services from this source is expected to be higher in the future than from other countries8. A recent estimate from the OECD (2011) predicts that about 10% of all those studying abroad are in the UK, compared to 18% in the USA, 7% in Australia and 5% in Canada. In recent decades, immigration flows have persistently exceeded emigration flows resulting in the UK being a country of net immigration (Hatton 2005). The significance of international students is further underscored by the fact that they comprise the largest proportion of annual migration inflows into the UK. According to figures from the Office for National Statistics, international student flows are currently the second largest ‘migrant’ inflows into the UK, having overtaken work-related flows in 2009. While other migration flows have been more or less constant or declined over time, international student flows exhibited an upward trend to 2010. Since then a slight decrease has occurred, which is likely to have been triggered in part by student visa policy changes. In spite of the importance of international students from developing countries to both the UK educational sector and the economy, there are features of the demand for UK education services from such countries that are not well understood. In order to fill these lacunae, the current paper examines the phenomenon indirectly through investigating the determinants of the demand for UK student visas from developing countries (including emerging economies) using, among other sources, data obtained from UK Border Agency (UKBA) publications. Previous studies that have examined the demand for UK visas have mainly done so within a tourism demand framework (see Oxford Economics 2008
Blake and Cortes-Jimenez 2007) 9. Other studies have approached the topic from a migration perspective (see Pedersen et al. 2006 , Clark et al. 2007, Grogger and Hanson 2011, Ortega and Peri 2009 and Mayda 2009). To the authors’ knowledge, the current research constitutes the first attempt to model student visa demand to the UK from exclusively developing countries. The study’s key research questions relate to determining the magnitude and sensitivity of student visa demand to changes in source country income levels, visa costs and bilateral exchange rates. A number of other themes are also interrogated. These relate to the importance of trading links between the UK and the set of developing countries in influencing the level and pattern of student visa demand, the effect of geographic and cultural closeness, the impact of the July 2005 London bombings, and the role of source country human capital levels. The organization of the paper is now outlined. Section II provides a review of the literature broadly germane to the analysis of student visa demand, Section III outlines the data used and describes the key variables proposed for analysis, Section IV presents the econometric model and details the estimation procedure, Section V reports the empirical findings, and Section VI offers some concluding remarks.",5

As a result, in addition to numerous consequences of previous conflict and crises, the labor market is presently characterized by substantial imbalances along several dimensions, with gender disparities possibly being the most dramatic. As reported in a number of policy documents (e.g., UNFPA 2007), women are often the object of discrimination and violence; they also represent the weakest segment of the working population. Existing studies1 of gender differences in Kosovo have noted that in contrast to gender disparities in other developing countries, the women in Kosovo are at a disadvantage compared to men both in terms of their educational attainment and their employment prospects. However, it is not clear how this affects gender differences in earnings, as available databases to date typically do not provide information on wages in Kosovo. As a result, little is known about the gender wage gap in Kosovo. In addition, in Kosovo and in many other countries more generally, little is known about the evolution of gender differences in wages (as well as in labor supply) over the life cycle. An understanding of the first few years in the labor market is particularly important because it is likely that the wage growth during this period is “the primary cause of the overall gender pay gap,” as has been argued recently2. Data collected by the ILO on School-to-Work Transitions (SWT) in 8 countries, including Kosovo, provide an opportunity to analyze the earnings differentials between men and women, particularly in their early labor market experience. ILO collected the data between 2004 and 2006 covering young workers aged 15–29, and recently made the micro data available to researchers. As the name of the survey suggests, the ILO collected information on the experiences of young workers at the beginning of their career, as they left school and entered the labor market. The ILO conducted the SWT survey in September and October 2004 in 5 out of 7 regions in Kosovo (Pristina, Mitrovica, Gijlan, Gjakova, and Prizren)3. In Kosovo’s case, available SWT data allow an analysis of early careers only up to age 25, because the final sample includes only individuals aged 15–25 (as opposed to 15–29 in other countries). Although the SWT data are by now a few years old, the general lack of publicly available data on earnings or wages in Kosovo means that the availability of SWT data still provides a rare opportunity to look at gender wage differentials in Kosovo. The results of the analysis reveal that women tend to have lower education attainment not only in the adult population, as noted in a recent (World Bank 2012) report, but also among those in the youngest age group. In general, young women tend to be disproportionately represented among those with low educational attainment. However, this educational disadvantage disappears when one considers only the employed men and women. This provides compelling evidence of the existence of a notable segmentation between employed and non-employed young women in Kosovo. The former are generally much better educated, at the same level or more than their contemporary men, and have higher than average productivity characteristics. The latter, instead, have a much lower educational level and productivity characteristics than their male counterparts. The consequences of this segmentation on labor market participation and wages in early career are striking. Among employed men and women in their late teens (age 15–19), there is no evidence of a gender wage gap in favor of men. This indicates that in the period prior to the childbearing years, women tend to fare as well as their male counterparts. The results of Juhn et al. (1993) decomposition analysis reveal that differences in productivity characteristics, rather than in prices or in residual inequality, drive the gender gap. The greater mean educational attainment of employed women tends to compensate for the higher average number of working hours of their male counterparts. The last part of the analysis attempts to assess the impact of observed and unobserved differences between employed and non-employed women on the returns to education and the gender wage gap. Interestingly, when we control for selection bias, the gender wage gap for the SWT sample as a whole and for the component of the young adults is still not statistically significant, despite the lower productivity characteristics of the non-employed women compared to employed women. This may be due to the relatively small sample size. At the same time, the returns to women’s education rise when selection bias is taken into account, confirming the lower productivity-related characteristics of non-employed women compared to employed women. The rest of the paper is outlined as follows. Section 2 reviews the existing literature on gender disparities in Kosovo’s labor market. Section 3 presents the methodology adopted in the econometric analysis. Section 4 discusses the main advantages and shortcomings of the Kosovo SWT survey database. Section 5 reports the main empirical findings. The final section provides some concluding remarks.",2
2.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor & Development,29 April 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9020-2-4,The costs of worker displacement in urban labor markets of China,December 2013,Yuhao Ge,Hartmut Lehmann,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In most OECD countries the costs of job loss are large for displaced workers, but these costs differ in their nature across countries. For example, in the U.S. labor market these costs are long-term even for displaced workers who find re-employment, with relative wage losses estimated to lie between 7 and 35 percent even several years after finding a new job (
see Couch and Placzek 2010
). In contrast, most studies on displacement in Continental Europe do not find large relative wage losses for displaced workers who have found re-employment; instead the main costs of job loss consist in foregone earnings due to periods of non-employment (
see, e.g., Kuhn 2002
and Hijzen et al. 2010
). Due to a lack of appropriate data, the consequences of job loss in transition and emerging economies have received scant attention in the literature in spite of large restructuring and labor reallocation since the beginning of economic reform (
Djankov and Murell 2002
). Rigorous studies on worker displacement in transition economies are few: Lehmann, Philips and Wadsworth (
2005
), Lehmann, Pignatti and Wadsworth (
2006
) and Lehmann, Muravyev, Razzolini and Zaiceva (
2013
) discuss the incidence and the costs of worker displacement in Estonia, Ukraine and Russia. In these studies, the authors find no relative wage losses of re-employed displaced workers, but establish large foregone earnings due to long unemployment spells for a substantial fraction of displaced workers. In contrast, the study by Orazem, Vodopivec and Wu (
2005
) on Slovenia finds lasting relative wage losses of re-employed displaced workers. The small existing literature on worker displacement in China focuses on the incidence and the costs of the large retrenchment that occurred in the latter half of the 1990s. This retrenchment was connected to the restructuring of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), which prior to restructuring exhibited substantial labor hoarding, a phenomenon prevalent in command economies (
Kornai 1992
). To improve the financial position and labor productivity of SOEs, the Chinese government insisted on large labor shedding amounting to about 25 percent of the workforce in these firms (Appleton et al.
2006a
). The available evidence points to very large costs for displaced workers especially in terms of foregone earnings since many of these workers had extremely long non-employment spells. In addition, those workers who found reemployment also experienced large wage penalties1. The analysis of worker displacement in this paper is more general for several reasons. First, it covers involuntary separations not only from SOEs but also from private firms and considers both urban workers with urban “hukou” and rural–urban migrants as populations at risk. Second, we look at the period 2003 to 2009, which is not dominated by massive government-sponsored layoffs but entails job and worker reallocation predominantly driven by market forces. Third, the 2009 wave of the Rural to Urban Migration in China (RUMIC) data set that we use covers 15 urban labor markets, embedded in regions, which vary substantially regarding their level of development, and thus allow a broader regional coverage than previous studies2. The employed data also permit a precise definition of the control group, which enables us to evaluate the costs of displacement in a more rigorous fashion. We look at traditional labor market outcomes in connection with displacement like the length of the unemployment spell, earnings upon reemployment as well as hours worked. We also analyze whether informal or self-employment is disproportionally associated with involuntary job separations as shown by Lehmann, Razzolini and Zaiceva (
2012
) for the Russian labor market. We investigate whether displacement has an impact on happiness and how it affects physical and mental health. With the latter outcomes, we thus also contribute to a strand of the literature that has started to look at non-conventional outcomes that are related to workers’ welfare as well as the welfare of their families. For example, Sullivan and von Wachter (
2009
) analyze life expectancy as an outcome and establish that displacement at age 40 will shorten the life expectancy of an average worker in the United States by 1 to 1.5 years. Lindo (
2011
) investigates parental job loss and infant health in the United States. His analysis reveals that husbands’ job losses have significant negative effects on infant health. Liu and Zhao (
2011
) study a similar issue in China, looking at the effects of the mass layoff of parents in the mid-1990s on their children’s health. They find that paternal job loss affects children’s health negatively while maternal job loss does not show any significant effect3. The reform of labor relations that essentially abolished guaranteed life-long employment picked up speed in the 1990s (
Dong and Xu 2009
). It led to the emergence of three distinct types of workers in the urban labor markets of China: workers employed in SOEs and private firms who have never been laid off, laid-off workers who are urban residents, and rural–urban migrants (Appleton et al.
2006b
). Analyzing labor market developments in the wake of the reforms, Knight and Yueh (
2004
) try to establish the existence of a dual urban labor market in China by presenting evidence on mobility rates of migrants and urban residents. The mobility rates of migrants far exceed those of urban residents, which can be taken as evidence of a dual labor market. Our paper, using a different perspective, also asks the question whether the evidence points to an integrated urban labor market or to a dual labor market with a competitive segment for migrants and a primary segment where urban workers, who have not been laid off, can extract some rent and some of the laid-off urban workers are rationed out of this segment. Nearly two decades into labor market adjustment we try to answer this politically relevant question by comparing the costs of displacement of migrants and urban workers in terms of the length of unemployment spells and of monthly earnings upon reemployment. The remainder of the paper has the following structure. The next section discusses the data and gives a descriptive analysis of worker displacement in China. In section 3 we briefly sketch the empirical models used, followed by the presentation of the main results in section 4. Finally, robustness checks are discussed in the penultimate section, while in section 6 we draw some conclusions. This paper uses the Rural to Urban Migration in China (RUMIC) dataset, which is administered by the Australian National University and Beijing Normal University of China. The RUMIC dataset has as its main focus rural-to-urban migrants. However, for comparison purposes there is also a sample of urban residents who possess urban “hukou”, i.e. who have the right to reside in urban centers. The data set is conceived as a panel and thus far the two waves of 2008 and 2009 have been made available to researchers. However, only in the 2009 wave do we have precise information on the reason for job separation; so we only use this cross section of the data. We concentrate on individuals of the working age population, that is we restrict the age span to 15-65 years, resulting in 8436 and 4527 respondents in the urban sample and in the migrant sample respectively. The data set has a retrospective part which enables us to identify a separation at any point in time between 2003 and 20094. Vital for our analysis is, of course, information on the reason for separating from a job. The possible answers are reproduced in Table 1. They are taken from standard answers in labor force surveys administered in OECD countries but adjusted to the specifics of the Chinese labor market. As respondents are told to only give one answer it is relatively straightforward to classify job separations into quits and displacements5. Answers 1 through 5 in Table 1
6 are in most cases related to involuntary job loss, although answer 5 might involve individual dismissals connected to improper behavior requiring disciplinary action. In our main analysis we classify answers 1 through 5 as involuntary job loss; we also perform robustness checks where we tighten the definition of displacement by dropping respondents giving answer 5. We find no substantial differences to our main analysis with the migrant sample, although, as we can infer from Table 1, those giving answer 5 are roughly 19 percent of migrant displaced workers. On the other hand, among the urban displaced only about 4 percent experience individual dismissals initiated by the employer. The RUMIC dataset provides detailed information on demographic characteristics, happiness, health conditions, labor force status, industry affiliation and occupation, salary, formal, informal and self-employment. We will analyze the losses of displaced workers taking quitters and still-employed workers as the control group. In the questionnaire of urban sample, we use the question “So far, have you ever changed a job, resigned, retired or become unemployed”. If the answer to this question is “No”, then this person is identified as a still-employed worker (a stayer). If the answer to this question is “Yes”, then this person is identified as a displaced worker or a quitter depending on the reason given why she or he left the last job. In the questionnaire for the migrant sample, the corresponding question asks “Is your current job the first job after migration”. If the answer to this question is “Yes”, then this person is identified as a stayer. A negative answer to this question identifies this person as a displaced worker or a quitter depending on the reason given for the separation from her or his last job. We are able to establish the unemployment spell of each workers who separates since we know (up to a month) the end of the previous job and the beginning of the new job7. For those who separate from a job we are thus able to calculate the months of the most recent unemployment spell. The empirical literature on displacement points to a strong correlation between industry affiliation and occupation on the one hand and the incidence and costs of job loss on the other hand. There are two problems with the migrant sample of the RUMIC dataset regarding industry affiliation and occupation. First, questions on working industry and occupation in the migrant sample are open questions and we have to encode them. There are more than 500 items in the variable of industry affiliation and more than 900 items in the variable of occupation. We integrate them into 9 broad industry and 5 broad occupational categories, respectively. These categories do not coincide completely with the industry and occupation codes that are given to us in the urban sample. Second, respondents in the migrant sample are reluctant to give information on, or do not know, their industry affiliation and occupation. So, once we control for these variables, the number of observations used in the analysis of the migrant sample falls substantially. We, therefore, provide both the results with only demographic and ownership controls and with industrial and occupational controls added. The latter augmented empirical models also include controls for local labor market conditions, which are crucial determinants of labor market outcomes (
Heckman et al. 1999
). We use city dummies to proxy local labor markets. The number of quits in the urban sample depends crucially on how we treat retirements. Inspection of Table 1 leads us to conclude that roughly half of all quits among urban workers are retirements or early retirements. For our analysis, we exclude these observations from the subsample of quitters since we are only interested in those workers separating voluntarily from their jobs who remain in the labor force. It is noteworthy but, of course, expected that migrant workers have an extremely low incidence of retirement, amounting to no more than half a percent. When we exclude retirees and early retirees the urban sample is reduced from 8436 to 6382 observations, while the change of the migrant sample is a negligible 13 observations. Given the large attrition of migrants that is observed between waves and associated with many of the migrants choosing to return to their rural place of origin (
see, e.g., Kong et al. 2009
), it can well be that the migrants who are interviewed in 2009 are a select group. Those migrants who have been displaced at some point in time between 2003 and 2009 and who remain in the urban labor market might be particularly productive and search effective in finding a new job, while the less productive among the displaced migrants might have returned home. We, however, do not think that the large differences in the costs of job loss that we observe when comparing these costs across the two samples can be entirely due to selection bias. Table 2 presents summary statistics of the three mutually exclusive subsets of the migrant and urban samples: displaced workers, quitters and stayers. The variables related to demographics, ownership type of the firm and outcomes are of particular interest and will be discussed in some detail. The distributions of industry affiliation and occupation are also shown.  Urban workers are about 7 years older on average than migrants; in the migrant sample displaced workers are somewhat older than their non-displaced counterparts, whilst in the urban sample the displaced are on average about 8 years older than quitters and stayers. Among urban workers the shares of females and males are more or less equal, while in the migrant sample male workers are disproportionately represented, in particular in the subset of the displaced. A majority of all workers is married; however, urban workers have an incidence of marriage that is up to 20 percentage points larger than migrants. Unsurprisingly, urban workers are on average more educated than migrants, with the difference in years of education being particularly large for the stayers of the two samples. It is also noteworthy that displaced workers on average have the least education whether we look at migrants or urban residents. There is a huge divergence between the two samples if we look at the ownership type of the firm in the last job (for displaced and quitters) and in the current job (for stayers). More than 80 percent of migrants worked or work in private firms, while a large majority of urban workers had the last job in an SOE or are still working in such a firm. As far as the urban sample is concerned, it is also striking that displaced workers originate much more from SOEs than quitters; so, for urban workers the state sector still drives displacement, hinting at an ongoing restructuring process of this sector. Inspection of the spell length of unemployment in Table 2 produces two important results. First, migrants who separate from jobs have much shorter spells than their counterparts in possession of urban “hukou.” Second, the average spell length of displaced and quitting migrants do not really differ while a displaced worker in the urban sample experiences extremely long and far longer spells than urban quitters. The average completed duration of more than one and a half years for displaced urban workers is in line with, e.g., the findings of Betcherman and Blunch (
2006
) who look at the impact of retrenchment in two large Chinese cities. So, our numbers suggest that the average laid off urban worker, if displaced from an SOE in the years 2003 to 2008, faces similar disadvantageous labor market prospects as the workers experiencing mass layoffs in the latter half of the 1990s, when the government-inspired retrenchment program was at its peak. Table 2 also reports the four outcomes hours, salary, informal employment and self-employment in the current job for stayers and separators. These outcomes, therefore, are used to establish potential costs of displacement upon re-employment. The worked hours per week are in general much larger for migrants than for urban residents, which corresponds to the evidence from earlier surveys. Migrants who voluntarily separated from their jobs have a particularly long working week in their new jobs. The average monthly salary is very similar for the three subsets of the migrant sample, while upon re-employment the urban displaced seem to incur a large wage penalty relative to quitters and stayers. The incidence of informal employment, which we define as an employment relationship without contract8, is much higher among migrants and reaches nearly 40 percent among displaced migrants. In contrast, urban displaced workers have with about 17 percent an incidence that is only a few percentage points higher than urban quitters. Particularly striking is the low incidence for urban stayers, which at around 7 percent is more than 20 percentage points lower than for their migrant counterparts. Finally, more than one fifth of all non-displaced migrants are self-employed, while displaced migrants like all three categories of urban workers on average have a percentage of self-employment that remains in the single digits. The incidence of excellent, good or average self-assessed health9 is high in all subsets of the two samples and there are no discernible differences between the displaced and their non-displaced counterparts. Taking the Body Mass Index (BMI) as a measure of objective health we see that the average respondent is well within the norm even if urban workers have a slightly higher value. Also, there are no differences between the three categories within migrant and urban workers. So, at least as far as these unconditional statistics are concerned there seems to be no correlation between displacement and health status whether of a self-assessed or of an objective nature. When we turn to self-professed depression and happiness10 the picture is clearly different. Displaced workers have roughly twice the incidence of feeling depressed relative to stayers in both samples, with migrants in general feeling more depressed than urban workers. A mirror image of this is happiness, since displaced workers are on average roughly 7 and 5 percentage points less happy than stayers in the migrant sample and urban sample respectively. As we would expect urban resident workers seem in general happier than migrants. The multinomial logit results for the migrant sample in Table 3 confirm that males and older workers have a higher probability to be displaced although these effects are quite small. They also show that being married and education have no predictive power regarding the likelihood of displacement. The marginal effects on industry affiliation demonstrate on the other hand that migrant workers have an especially high probability to be displaced from the manufacturing sector while being affiliated with public management and social organizations reduces the likelihood of being displaced the most. The marginal effects on the city dummies show no clear pattern since in most cities displacement is lower than in Guangzhou (the omitted category), no matter whether the city is located in a developed or less developed region. Turning to the results for the urban sample in Table 4, being married and having more education lowers the probability of being displaced while older workers are more affected by layoffs. The most striking results are, however, linked to ownership of the firm and industrial affiliation. With working in a private firm and in agriculture as reference categories, working in an SOE and in manufacturing raises the likelihood of being displaced by 22 and 19 percent respectively, while working in financial intermediation or in health lowers it by 21 percent. So, it is above all being tied to an SOE and to manufacturing that is associated with a layoff event. We also see that some occupations are an important predictor of layoffs pointing to the importance of controlling for occupation when evaluating the costs of job loss. Finally, in the urban sample relative to residing in Guangzhou workers residing elsewhere are more affected by displacement. Like in the migrant sample, a clear regional pattern cannot be made out since some of the cities with larger displacement are high growth regions (e.g., Shanghai) and some are located in less developed areas (e.g., Luoyang and Bengbu). So, are displaced workers systematically different from non-displaced workers? The information thus far collected allows us to infer that displaced workers are more likely to be male, be less educated, to be older and to work disproportionately in manufacturing and in SOEs. The latter factor, however, only plays a role for the sample of urban workers. It is also noteworthy that factors related to the firm and to the job have more predictive power than demographic factors as the much larger marginal effects on the dummies for ownership type, industry affiliation and occupation attest. So, while we have a broader coverage of displacement than the previous literature we still find that most of displacement takes place in the manufacturing and the state sectors pointing to ongoing restructuring in this part of the Chinese economy. However, as an additional result we establish that the laying off of less productive workers is not confined to the state sector but economy-wide. In Table 5, we report the cumulative return rates to employment, conditional on unemployment duration, of migrant and urban displaced workers and compare these to return rates of those who quit. These rates are based on the complement of the Kaplan-Meier estimator of survivor functions (
Smith 2002
). The most striking result is the large difference in the return-to-employment pattern of migrants and urban residents. Nearly half of all displaced migrant workers return to employment within a month, i.e. they experience a job-to-job move, and 90 percent are absorbed into employment within a year. It is also noteworthy that among migrants the displaced do not face more difficulties in finding reemployment than those who quit. For urban residents who separate from a job the situation is very different. Only a quarter of urban displaced workers experiences a job-to-job move and, what is even more striking, less than half are able to find reemployment within a year leading to very long average unemployment spells. Essentially, a minority immediately finds a new job while the rest lingers on in unemployment. For urban quitters the difficulties are less severe although only roughly two thirds find reemployment within a year. Contrasting the cumulative return rates to employment of the migrant and urban samples we can make two inferences. First, for migrants the costs of job loss in terms of unemployment spells are mild, while they are extremely severe for urban residents. Second, the observed patterns lead us to moot that we are confronted with two distinct segments of the labor market in the cities under study: one segment for migrants, which seems quite competitive insofar as job separators are not rationed out of the market, and one segment for workers with urban “hukou” where many job separators seem to be blocked from reentering employment. We take this as a first piece of evidence that urban labor markets in China are dualistic and not integrated. Our options of empirically modeling the costs of job loss are quite limited given that we can only use the cross section of 2009 of the RUMIC data set. We unfortunately cannot use a fixed effects regression, which is one of the workhorses in the displacement literature. Instead we start out with simple OLS regressions of the following type:
 where y

i
 is labor market outcome for individual i and an element of the set {unemployment spell, monthly earnings, hours worked, the incidence of informal employment, the incidence of self-employment, the BMI, the likelihood of being in good health, of feeling depressed, and of being happy}. The vector X contains demographic variables, the ownership, industry, occupation and city dummies shown in Table 2. DIS is a dummy set equal to 1 if worker i was displaced any time between 2003 and 2009. In our simple OLS specification, the coefficient δ thus captures the average effect of any displacement in the indicated period on the outcome variable. Finally, ϵ is a white noise error term. In the case that there are no unobserved heterogenous factors that impact on the probability to be displaced and on the outcome variables of interest the average displacement effect is identified with the coefficient δ. However, it is unlikely that controlling for the above mentioned conditioning variables will eliminate all selection problems. Nevertheless, while we treat our OLS results with caution, we can point out that the multinomial logit regressions show very strongly that observed firm and job related factors are far more important than observed personal characteristics, and thus probably also unobserved personal characteristics. In addition, one of our robustness checks consists in looking only at the subset of displaced related to firm closure. This scenario of displacement is often considered to have less selection problems than when predominantly redundancies are involved. As we will show, we get very similar results when only considering this subset of the displaced. We extend our analysis at any rate, hoping to get closer to a causal effect of displacement, by employing a matching estimator, using propensity score matching. When evaluating the costs of worker i’s displacement we essentially ask the question that is posed in the evaluation literature: What is the outcome (e.g., monthly earnings, unemployment spell, etc.) of worker i who is treated (here: displaced) relative to the hypothetical outcome that would have prevailed if the same worker had not been treated (displaced)? Since the treated worker can never be observed in the non-treatment state the problem arises how to construct a credible counterfactual. When the treatment is randomized, under certain assumptions it is sufficient to compare the average outcome of the treated (E(Y

i

 = 1)) and the average outcome of the control group (i.e. the non-treated) E(Y

1983
). For identification of a causal treatment effect they invoke the conditional independence assumption (CIA): conditional on workers’ characteristics, the potential outcome in the non-treatment scenario is independent of the treatment status, i.e.
 where D

i
 is the treatment variable that takes the value 1 under treatment and the value 0 if the individual is in the non-treatment state, while Y

i
(0) is the outcome variable for individual i in the non-treatment state. P(X) is the propensity score, estimated with the probit model:
 Matching takes place on the propensity score using the nearest neighbor method. As controls we take those who remain in their jobs (stayers) and those who quit (quitters)11. The covariates presented in Table 2 are used for our propensity score matching procedure. At an intuitive level, propensity score matching attempts to balance the unobserved characteristics of two samples by balancing the observed characteristics. This works particularly well when the number of covariates is large and includes those variables that are potentially correlated with the outcome variable of interest. Employing the variables shown in Table 2 we try to balance the unobserved characteristics with our matching procedure and thus reduce selection biases. The difference in the average outcome of those displaced and the average outcome of the controls might thus get us closer to the causal effect of displacement:
 Analytical standard errors are calculated using the algorithm developed by Lechner (
2001
). Table 6 presents the nine outcomes that we predominantly associate with a loss brought about by displacement for migrant and urban workers. The results related to unemployment spells confirm what we have learned about cumulative return rates to employment. For migrants there is no penalty associated with displacement as far as the duration of unemployment is concerned, while this penalty is between 6 and 8.5 months for the displaced among the urban residents. Putting more trust in the matching results with the full set of control variables we find that urban displaced workers have unemployment spells that are nearly three quarters of a year longer than their quitting counterparts. We also establish no wage penalty upon reemployment for migrants, while urban displaced workers experience a monthly earnings loss of between 31 and 23 percent. Worked hours per week in the current job are not affected by displacement for migrants, while they are slightly raised for urban resident workers. The first two results of our analysis strongly hint at segmentation of urban labor markets. We have a competitive segment for migrants where a new job can be found easily and where the labor supply curve is highly elastic, i.e. the new job offers in essence the same salary as the lost job, and a non-competitive segment where incumbents and quitters can extract rent while displaced workers are either completely rationed out of this part of the market or upon reemployment have to accept substantial wage cuts. The results, of course, also imply that urban displaced workers will not be hired into the competitive segment or are not willing to perform the tasks that migrant workers are asked to do. Several studies on informal employment in emerging economies find that this employment state is undesirable for a majority of workers since they associate job insecurity, poor working conditions and lack of social protection with it (
see, e.g., Lehmann, Razzolini and Zaiceva 2012
a). Thus perceived, the higher incidence of informal employment due to displacement imposes especially large costs on migrant workers while these costs are more modest for the urban sample. It is worth recalling from Table 2 that informal employment, defined as working without a contract, is rather the exception than the rule even for migrant workers. The large decrease in the incidence of self-employment for displaced migrants can only be considered a cost of job loss if self-employment is thought to be a desirable state. This conjecture is, however, controversial in the literature since many researchers consider self-employment in transition economies an employment state of last resort (
see, e.g., Earle and Sakova 2000
). The matching results for the urban sample are in line with this interpretation of self-employment since they show a slight increase in self-employment associated with displacement. Self-assessed health is not affected by displacement in the case of migrants while urban residents who are displaced are slightly less healthy. In contrast, the body mass index (BMI), considered an objective measure of health, is in most estimates not significantly lower for the displaced than for their non-displaced counterparts. Displacement makes urban workers less happy albeit only slightly, a result not observed for displaced migrant workers. In contrast, there is an increased incidence of feeling depressed, which is particularly large for this latter group. The results in essence demonstrate that in both samples there are some psychic costs brought on by displacement. The above cited literature on retrenchment establishes that the experience of displaced workers might differ by regional location, gender and age. To ascertain heterogeneous effects of displacement, we slice the urban sample by these dimensions and additionally partition the sample by ownership of the firm where the worker had her/his last job. The results of this last partition (panel 1 of Table 7) show no differences as far as unemployment spells are concerned. Wage penalties upon reemployment, on the other hand, while existing for both types of displaced workers, are substantially larger for workers displaced from SOEs. Workers displaced from private firms incur some costs in terms of reduced working hours per week; in contrast, workers displaced from SOEs work between 3.5 and 5 hours more per week than their non-displaced counterparts. This latter result may be a reflection of a relatively short working week for stayers in the state sector. Relative to quitters and stayers only workers laid off from a job in the state sector have a higher incidence of informal employment. Those laid off from private firms are far less likely to be self-employed in the new job than their non-displaced counterparts while the reverse effect can be seen for workers being laid off from SOEs. Given that SOEs predominantly lay off workers from the lower end of the skills distribution, this points to the interpretation of self-employment as a last resort. Self-assessed health is slightly worse only for those displaced from SOEs, while displaced from both types of firms feel less happy than the non-displaced. The mirror image of this is a higher likelihood of feeling depressed for all laid off urban workers. Turning to the level of development (panel 2 of Table 7) displacement is associated with substantially longer unemployment spells only for workers residing in developed regions. One reason might be the more generous income support available to displaced workers in these regions (
Giles et al. 2005
). Wage penalties are slightly larger in the more developed regions, while the larger number of working hours and the higher incidence of an informal current job is essentially the same in both subsamples. Increased self-employment, on the other hand, can only be found in the less developed regions. Health is weakly negatively associated with layoffs in both types of regions. In contrast the negative (positive) impact of displacement on happiness (feeling depressed) is given in regions, where there is more development. Men are more penalized than women regarding the increased spell of unemployment, whilst wage penalties and the increase in working hours do not differ markedly by gender (panel 3 of Table 7). After a layoff event, both sexes experience more informality in the current job, but only males have a slightly increased incidence of self-employment and lower self-assessed and objective health. When we divide displaced workers by age we find that those who were 40 years of age or less at the time of job separation incur higher costs of job loss than older workers as far as an increased incidence of informal employment in the current job is concerned. For the other outcomes we do not find any systemic patterns and, therefore, do not present the numeric results for this partition of the urban displaced workers12. In summary, after slicing the data by various dimensions our results clearly show that it is important to stratify the overall sample by level of development, gender and ownership type of firm when evaluating the economic, health and psychic costs of displacement, while age seems of lesser importance. Our first robustness check13 consists in the tightening of the displacement definition. We exclude those workers from the displacement sample who separated from their jobs because of reason 5 given in Table 1. A “dismissal initiated by employer” might entail individual layoffs connected to unsatisfactory performance or disciplinary problems. In addition, this type of dismissal might hit low productivity workers especially hard who in all likelihood perform worse upon job loss than displaced workers who separated from their jobs for one of the reasons 1 through 4 given in Table 1. A comparison of the results using the more encompassing and the tighter definition of displacement shows only small differences regarding the length of unemployment spells for urban displaced workers. In addition, the fact that migrant displaced workers do not incur any costs in terms of prolonged unemployment is confirmed with this tighter definition of displacement. The absence of a wage penalty upon reemployment for migrant workers is also a robust result, while the wage loss found for reemployed urban displaced workers is slightly smaller than in Table 6, which can be understood as a weak confirmation of our supposition that individually dismissed workers might be on average of lower productivity. Informal employment, self-employment, self-assessed health, happiness, and feeling depressed are all associated with displacement in the same fashion as when the more encompassing definition of displacement is used. The BMI, on the other hand, is never affected by displacement. Restricting displacement to involuntary job separations caused by firm bankruptcy or closure is often considered a way to reduce selection biases (
see, e.g., Kuhn 2002
). We are fortunate insofar as the majority of displacements are linked to bankruptcy or closure in the RUMIC data set, which is rather unusual in survey data. For example in Russia and Ukraine, where we have similar survey data in emerging economies, redundancies outnumber displacements due to bankruptcy and closure by a wide margin (
Lehmann et al. 2012
b). Since displacement events linked to bankruptcy or closure are considered “more exogeneous” than when redundancies are also involved, similar results with this more restrictive definition of displacement would imply that we are not just looking at correlations but a causal effect of displacement on the outcomes under study. However, with this restrictive definition the number of observations is reduced to 128 in the case of the migrant sample, which might lead to imprecise point estimates. Reduced significance certainly should not be a problem with the urban sample since we still have around 900 observations at our disposal. In comparison with the definition that includes redundancies, one of our main results still holds: migrants do not incur costs of displacement in the form of longer unemployment spells and of wage penalties while urban residents do. Also, the magnitudes of these costs are in the same ballpark as when we include redundancies. Also, displacement has similar effects on self-employment, self-assessed health and happiness whether we include redundancies or not. An increased likelihood of informal employment and of feeling depressed is associated with displacement but with the definition of displacement restricted to firm closure these effects are only significant in the case of urban residents. All in all, the important results related to economic losses still pertain with this restricted sample of displaced. Our last robustness check alters the definition of controls by keeping only stayers in this group. In the early literature on displacement stayers were used to construct a counterfactual. However, more recently students of displacement have argued that stayers are too “stable” a group to be a credible counterfactual for the displaced. Instead, both stayers and quitters should be used for the construction of this credible counterfactual, since for a displaced worker the non-treatment state might be either staying at the firm or quitting the firm. Compared to our analysis with the larger definition of controls we can establish qualitatively similar results when we use only stayers as controls. However some point estimates differ somewhat. For example, the wage penalty for urban displaced is now smaller. This is not a surprise since from Table 2 we know that quitters in the urban sample have a higher average wage than stayers. So, by not including quitters one actually understates the wage penalty. In contrast, the larger likelihood of being informally employed has an upward bias in the migrant sample, because migrant stayers have a lower incidence of informal employment than migrant quitters (see Table 2). So, on this evidence it strikes us as better to choose both stayers and quitters as controls when one wants to estimate the true level of losses associated with displacement. Our robustness checks have shown that the results of Table 6 remain virtually always valid whatever sample of displaced or controls we use. In particular, the dualistic nature of labor markets in cities is clearly confirmed, since our basic analysis presented in Table 6 and our robustness checks all determine that displaced migrant workers are not confronted with longer job search than their non-displaced counterparts and that upon reemployment they do not face a wage penalty, while displaced urban workers incur large losses regarding these two outcomes.",2

In this paper we theoretically explore the circumstances in which either informal1 or formal hiring channels are preferred and either positive or negative wage differentials emerge, considering the role played by moral hazard and the diversity of networks and cultures in the choice of hiring channel. On the empirical side, we investigate the adoption of social networks as hiring channels and its impact on wages in the case of a developing country, Senegal, whereas the others contributions to this topic generally focus on OECD countries. An impressive number of vacancies are filled through informal hiring channels, which comprise family, friends, and in general social networks to which individuals belong, rather than through the formal labor market. Granovetter (1973), Rees (1966) and Corcoran (1980) find that about half of the jobs in the United States are filled through personal contacts and Ioannides and Loury (2004) notice that the role played by networks increased over time. Sociologists and economists have first looked at the supply side of the labor market. Holzer (1988), for example, show that when multiple search methods are possible, workers prefer social networks to formal hiring channels, because the former are less expensive and characterized by a higher probability of being hired than the latter. On the demand side, the traditional wisdom among economists2 is that informal hiring channels may help to mitigate selection problems arising in recruitment. For instance, Montgomery (1991), Saloner (1985) and Simon and Warner (1992) all argue that informal hiring channels may reduce information asymmetry between employers and employees and provide a better matching of unobservable characteristics. Montgomery assumes that social networks are based on homophily of unobservable characteristics, so that people tend to refer others like themselves. Saloner’s results rest instead on the referees’ willingness to safeguard their reputation. Simon and Warner posit that the use of informal hiring channels reduces employers’ uncertainty about applicants productivity. All these models predict that hiring through social networks should always be preferred to formal channels. Moreover, the enhanced selection that is guaranteed by informal hiring channels should be specially exploited for vacancies requiring high skills and should imply wage premia for workers hired through social networks. However, in the real world, formal and informal hiring channels coexist and their adoption greatly varies in different contexts. First of all, the practice of hiring through social networks is even more pronounced in developing countries than in industrialized ones.3 Moreover, many empirical studies suggest that vacancies for unskilled occupations are more likely to be filled through social networks than jobs requiring high skills,4 while some find the opposite5. Finally, wage differentials imputable to informal hiring channels are far from being found always positive.6 For instance, Pellizzari (2009) finds that, out of 15 industrialized countries, in Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands networked workers enjoy wage premia, in Greece, Italy, Portugal and UK they suffer wage penalties, while in the 8 remaining countries there are no significant wage differentials imputable to the adopted hiring channel. The discrepancies between theoretical predictions and empirical studies suggest that theories focusing on adverse selection overlook some crucial aspect of the phenomenon. This paper aims at reconciling theory and empirical findings on the choice of hiring channel and its potential effect on wages. It does so, first of all by taking into account that, besides selection issues, incomplete information may also imply problems of moral hazard. Second, it considers that networks differ in their tightness7, while the existing theoretical literature does not consider the variety of social networks.8 We argue that the strength of links is important, because tight networks are able to exert peer pressure to ensure proper behavior of members who are hired through them.9 Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) show that, when observing employees’ effort is costly for firms, employers need to increase workers’ expected value of not shirking with respect to shirking. That is, firms need to rise either the monitoring or the salary of their workers.10 However, the role played by peer pressure may decrease the monitoring costs for workers hired through social networks with respect to other employees.11 Third, even networks characterized by similar tightness may play a very different role in the job market depending on the culture. There are contexts in which a worker hired through a social network reciprocates the working opportunity by exerting more effort than workers hired through the formal channel, while a culture of favoritism encourages networked employees to work less than the others.12 Our model integrates all these aspects and explains why either formal or informal hiring channels are adopted and why either positive or negative wage differentials may emerge for workers hired through informal channels, depending on circumstances. Moreover, it accounts for the stylized facts that developing countries rely even more on social networks as hiring channels than industrialized ones and that informal hiring channels are often adopted to fill unskilled vacancies. The paper also contributes to the empirical literature by investigating the determinants of hiring channels at worker, network and firm level and the impact of the adopted hiring channel on wages in the Senegalese formal manufacturing sector. While most of the empirical literature on social networks as hiring channels is largely confined to developed countries studies, very few studies have analyzed the crucial role of social networks in less developed countries’ labor markets (notable exceptions are Egypt’s studies by Assaad (1997) and Wahba and Zenou (2005)) and none takes into account the fact that social networks differ in their tightness. Moreover, to our knowledge the only existing analysis of informal hiring channels concerning Sub-Saharan Africa refers to the colonial period (Fafchamps-and-Moradi (2009)). However, this region is pervaded with informality to a greater extent than other developing countries13 and social networks play a crucial role in their labor markets14. At the same time, Senegal is a rare example of a Sub-Saharan African country characterized by a dynamic economy moving away from the ubiquitous informality to a market economy, thus providing a unique opportunity to investigate the remains of informality in an economy that is developing toward formal markets. Estimating an endogenous switching model,15 we find that informal hiring channels are preferred to fill unskilled vacancies and are associated with a wage penalty. Moreover, the probability of having been hired through a social network and the absolute value of wage penalties is increasing with the strength of ties. These findings are consistent with our theoretical predictions in contexts where favoritism is widespread. Section 1 analyzes the case of Senegal, providing details on the data and some descriptive statistics characterizing sampled firms and workers. Section 1 presents a theoretical framework that accounts for the elements intuitively singled out above and corroborated by the analysis of rough data. Section 1 presents econometric evidence supporting the hypotheses and the predictions of our theoretical framework. Finally, Section 1 concludes.",4

This applies to the more affluent EU15 as well as to the less affluent new EU member states (Alesina & Glaeser 2004). In both cases the reason is the same: population changes lie at the root of the problem, as the institutional structures of the various types of European welfare state or European Social Model were established around extra revenues called the “demographic dividend” that used to be easily available throughout the decades of the 20st century. They, however, ceased to be available at the end of that century when most, if not all, European societies reached stage four of their demographic transition (Atkinson 1995). Pension systems are deeply rooted in the public perception of societies. This applies not only to developed countries but also to those various countries that were historically linked to the European institutional tradition. Pension systems belong to core institutional systems that are expected to be very stable and reliable. That perception has been developed over many decades when consecutive generations of citizens participated and benefited from that participation. Over time, the link between welfare and work effort has weakened. The public internalised that situation and began to perceive welfare as being granted, solely on the premise they were the citizens of affluent and well organised countries. European countries still try to manage these pension institutions as if the dividend was still available. Governments focus mostly on the inevitable fiscal cuts from such a situation, even though it is deep social reforms that are needed. Europe is less affluent than European citizens tend to assume. With smaller resources available, they need to rethink the way these may be distributed within societies. Pension systems are probably most directly exposed to the problems stemming from the loss of the “demographic dividend”. At the same time, in terms of GDP, pension systems in Europe are large or very large. Consequently, they influence the economic and social situations the most. Various pension reforms are on the top of policy agendas throughout Europe. These reforms are very often contested by societies. Managing the disillusion is the challenge. It should be stressed here that I do not refer to the discussion on whether the welfare state is in general rather a good idea (Barr 2001), or rather an idea leading to problems (Bodor & Rutkowski 2012). In this paper I focus on the various consequences of the situation, when resources needed for financing welfare state institutions are growing (in terms of GDP) due to population changes, irrespective of whether the institutions are good or bad. In this paper I analyse selected political economy issues related to pension reforms, such as the worker-retiree conflict of interest, distribution by age of the costs of the loss of demographic dividend, and key goals behind pension reforms. The focus of this paper is on the pension reform in Poland, which actually was an implementation of a thoroughly new pension system. Its design is analysed and discussed from a political economy viewpoint. Furthermore, analysis of the Polish pension system is presented in a broader European context.",6

The act aimed to limit unemployment by raising the cost of layoffs. It required that each layoff of a covered worker, whether the layoff involved a single employee or a mass layoff, must be approved by the government. Until 2003, the government also determined on a case-by-case basis the level of severance pay that the firm was required to pay to the laid off workers. Since its introduction, critics have argued that the TEWA’s non-transparent, discretionary, and costly regulations discourage employment growth, hinder reallocation of labor from inefficient firms to more profitable sectors, slow the introduction of new technologies, and increase unemployment. There is at least a prima facie case that the TEWA policy has affected the size distribution of firms in Sri Lanka compared to that in 15 other developing countries reported by Leidholm and Mead (1987). Sixty-eight percent of Sri Lankan firms had 10 or fewer employees, in the top third of small firm shares in the Leidholm-Mead compilation.1 Only 12% of Sri Lanka firms had over 49 workers which would have given it the second smallest large firm share in the Leidholm-Mead listing. However, Sri Lanka’s firms in Export Promotion Zones (EPZ) have a remarkably different size distribution: only 17% of the firms have 10 or fewer workers and 57% have more than 49. Of all the countries for which we have size-distribution information, Sri Lanka’s EPZ firms have the smallest fraction of workers in firms with fewer than 10 workers and the largest fraction of workers in firms with over 49 workers. Meanwhile, the reason the overall size distribution in Sri Lanka is weighted more heavily toward small firms is that the nonEPZ firms are so unusually small. Micro-econometric analyses have shown that employment protection policies can have negative consequences for workers. Heckman and Pages (2000) show that in Latin America, more stringent job security laws are associated with lower employment and higher unemployment, particularly among young workers. Similarly, Besley and Burgess (2004) find that labor regulations in India had important adverse effects on output and employment. Expanding on that study, Ahsan and Pages (2009) report that regulations concerned with labor disputes and job security hurt covered workers. Bassanini and Duval (2006) find that changes in tax and labor policies explain about half of the 1982–2003 changes in unemployment among OECD countries. Other studies using macroeconomic data have also found negative efficiency effects of severance pay including Nickell and Layard (1999), Haffner et al. (2001), and the OECD (1999). Nevertheless, these negative findings from labor market regulations are not universal, particularly those based on cross-section analysis (Baker et al. 2005).2
 This paper adds to this literature by identifying the impacts of the Sri Lanka TEWA on firm employment and growth. We exploit two sources of variation in the way firms are treated to identify the policy’s effects. First, the law only applies to firms with more than 14 workers, and so smaller firms need not comply. Second, firms in EPZ do not face the same constraints imposed by the TEWA. These sharp differences in policies applied to firms of different size create several strategic options. Firms that anticipate growing beyond 14 workers will try to sort into the EPZ to avoid the constraints imposed by the law. The cost of growing beyond 14 workers may discourage nonEPZ firms from growing. Furthermore, the costs imposed by the TEWA may be large enough to drive covered firms out of business. Panel data on the cohort of all firms registering for business in Sri Lanka between 1995 and 2002 is used to provide evidence for all three possibilities. Consistent with our theoretical predictions, we find that the potential TEWA costs result in substantially lower firm size in the nonEPZ sector, with the differential incentives to add workers inside and outside the EPZ clearly limiting growth for firms well below the threshold. EPZ firms have a 26 percentage point larger growth probability below the 14 worker employment threshold and a 14 percentage point growth advantage above the threshold. In addition, evidence is consistent with the view that the cost of adding a 15th worker implies a larger marginal cost of expansion for all nonEPZ firms below the threshold compared to nonEPZ firms already above the threshold, and so nonEPZ firms above the threshold have more rapid employment growth than nonEPZ firms below the threshold. NonEPZ firms already above the threshold are 21 percentage points more likely to add employees than are nonEPZ firms below the threshold. Finally, the results show that the biggest and most significant differences in survival probability (about 10 percentage point) is the higher exit rate of nonEPZ firms relative to EPZ firms. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an institutional background, highlighting the intentions of the TEWA at its introduction, and its provisions and procedures. It also gives a description of EPZ and nonEPZ firms and description of the data. Section 3 presents the model highlighting firm entry and exit decisions. Section 4 describes the empirical section focusing on the need for analysis by firm. Section 5 presents the empirical results based on the estimation of the multinomial model of employment growth of firms. Section 6 concludes with a summary and policy recommendations.",3

As discussed in detailed by Schneider and Enste (2000), informality may be explained by many factors. In several studies, the burden of taxes and social insurance contributions are typically identified as one of the most important factors for explaining informality1. Based on this finding, governments are sometimes motivated to decrease taxes, particularly payroll taxes, to promote labor formality and thus provide social insurance services for a larger share of the population. This may be an especially demanding issue for some regions in the world. For example, Gasparini and Tornalli (2009) estimate that approximately 56 percent of wage earners in Latin America are informal in the sense that they do not pay labor taxes in exchange for social insurance services such as health and pensions. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the effects of a fall in payroll taxes on labor markets with high labor informality. In this regard, the recently approved tax reform in Colombia provides an interesting case study. With the aim of increasing labor formality, the government introduced a series of changes in the Colombian tax code in 2012, which included a 13.5 percentage point decrease in non-wage labor costs and a partial shift of the tax base from labor to corporate income to finance social programs2. The Colombian case is interesting for two reasons. First, non-wage labor costs are very high: previous to the 2012 reform, they accounted for more than 60 percent of the average wage rate (Hernández, 2012; Moller, 2012). Second, the share of informal workers is also high, regardless of the definition used, and ranges from 56 to 67 percent of the total workforce (Bernal, 2009; Mondragón-Vélez et al. 2010). Evaluating the effects of payroll taxes on labor markets is not an easy task because there are several factors that need to be taken into account. As noted by Summers (1989) and Farné and Rodríguez (2013) among others, there are at least five issues that should be addressed to appropriately analyze the effects of payroll taxes: (1) the labor demand elasticity; (2) the labor supply elasticity; (3) the worker’s valuation of the social insurance benefits financed through payroll taxes; (4) the presence of a binding minimum wage; and (5) the bargaining power of workers in the labor market. An additional element of analysis to be considered especially for developing countries is the existence of a significant fraction of informal workers in the labor market. Typically, the literature incorporates only some of the factors mentioned above into the analysis. In contrast, the model presented in this paper addresses many of the relevant factors listed, such as labor demand and supply equations derived from first principles, the valuation of worker’s benefits financed through payroll taxes, and the distinction between formal and informal workers. In this manner, the present model may offer some additional insights not previously considered in the literature. In particular, this paper presents a dynamic, general equilibrium model with occupational choice, tax evasion and informality. In the model, household members may choose among three alternative occupations: salaried worker, own-account or employee. This specification is important because own-account workers represent a significant share of the work force in developing countries and are usually associated with informal labor (see, for example, Gollin, 2008). As will be clear from the discussion of the next section, the modelling of own-account workers is typically ignored in the analysis of payroll taxes and labor markets. The model also features endogenous tax evasion: firms may optimally choose to avoid paying taxes, including payroll taxes. In this manner, a firm must choose not only how many workers to hire but also the mix of formal and informal workers. Thus, labor informality endogenously arises when the firm chooses not to pay labor taxes for some of its workers. As detailed below, the model also includes corporate income (CIT) and value-added (VAT) taxes to capture some features of the 2012 Colombian tax reform and the complexities of the tax code, especially for the VAT. Given its general equilibrium structure, the effects of a fiscal reform on both employment and wages may be appropriately evaluated from first principles. The model is calibrated for the Colombian economy and used to simulate the effects of the 2012 tax reform on occupational choices, employment and earnings. The results suggest that the tax reform would have a positive but small effect on total employment. Specifically, employment would increase between 0.3 and 0.5 percent compared to the pre-reform scenario. At the same time, the reform would bring a significant reallocation of labor across occupational choices and formality status. In particular, formal employment would increase between 3.4 and 3.7 percent of total employment, and informality would decrease between 2.9 and 3.4 percent. Interestingly, the model also suggests that the reform would bring an increase of 4.9 percent in the formal wage rate, net of taxes and transfers. This implies that formal workers may actually bear a significant share of the tax burden imposed by non-wage labor costs through lower wages. The rest of the paper is divided as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the literature on payroll taxes and their effects on labor markets. Section 3 discusses the 2012 Colombian tax reform in some detail, particularly the changes related to payroll, corporate income, and value-added taxes. Sections 4 and 5 describe the model used to evaluate the effects of the tax reform and how it is calibrated to the Colombian data. Section 6 presents the results including a sensitivity analysis, and Section 7 concludes the paper.",12

Human capital accumulation is done throughout life, but more than one half of this lifetime accumulation is done on-the-job after completing formal schooling (e.g., Heckman et al., 1998). In spite of the importance, much more is known about the investment in formal schooling, and specifically on the returns to formal schooling, than on the investment in on-the-job training and their returns. This paper explores a matched employer-employee data set with unique information on formal firms and their workers for two developing countries with very different levels of development, Malaysia and Thailand1. According to the World Economic Outlook Database from 2005, the per capita GDP in 2002 was 3,880 USD in Malaysia and 1,994 USD in Thailand and in 2004 was 4,624 USD and 2,521 USD, respectively2. Between 2002 and 2004, these economies were growing at similar rates (5.6% and 6.1%). In terms of population, Thailand more than doubles the size of Malaysia (65m vs. 25m). Both countries present a high literacy rate of around 93%. East Asian countries have been drawing a great deal of attention to themselves. Impressive growth rates, competitive wages and high levels of education of the workforce are just some of the reasons why it has now become so interesting to study these countries. Having a detailed data-set from these two countries offers the possibility of studying the dynamics of these labor markets and their investment in job training. In developing countries, governments are increasingly concerned with the rapidly changing demand for skills and the slow response of the general and vocational schooling tracks to adjust the provision of skills. As a consequence, many employers complain about the lack of skills and education of their workforce. Policymakers are thus increasingly concerned that the supply of skills in the labor market does not keep pace with the demand. The investment by firms in on-the-job training is one important way to mitigate this skills’ gap as it develops job relevant skills among the existing workforce. The evidence on both the incidence and the economic returns to on-the-job training is generally scarce in developing countries3. And it is unclear how different the returns should be in developed and developing countries. On the one hand, the returns to the investment in job training (as well as in schooling) could be higher in developing than in developed countries simply because skilled labor is scarcer in developing countries (e.g. Psacharopoulos and Patrinos, 2004). On the other hand, if skilled labor and capital are complements, the returns to this investment could be smaller in developing countries, where capital is relatively scarce. In theory, whether workers with and without on-the-job training receive, all else constant, significantly different wages will also relate to whether the training offered general or firm specific skills. It may also relate to whether there are differences in the competitiveness of the local labor markets. When the labor market is perfectly competitive and training is general, workers will support the cost of job training through lower wages during that same period. Once training is received, the worker will be paid the equivalent to his marginal productivity, which we now assume to be higher (e.g. Becker, 1964). But when training is firm specific the costs and benefits will likely be shared between the firm and the worker depending on the bargaining power of each one of them. In principle, the worker will receive a lower wage at the time of the training, to account for his share of the costs, and a higher wage after the training event, depending on the benefit he could extract from the firm (e.g. Leuven and Oosterbeek, 2001). If the labor market is not competitive and firms are able to pay a wage lower than the worker’s marginal productivity, firms will only want to invest in training if the increase in productivity is higher than the effect in the growth rate of wages (e.g. Acemoglu and Pischke, 1999). Even in this scenario, there is no theoretical reason for the wages to decrease after the training program. They should increase or remain constant. In sum, no matter the assumptions we have, theory predicts that after participating in a training event the worker’s wage should increase or stay invariable. Finally, as training is a decision variable for the firm one expects wage returns to job training to be a lower bound estimate for the impact of training in firm productivity4. This paper estimates whether the firm’s investment in job training translates into higher wages for the workers in Malaysia and in Thailand. Our findings show that the wage returns to the investment in job training decrease significantly as one controls for worker’s and firm’s characteristics. We find that on-the-job training is associated with increases in individual wages of 7.7% in Malaysia and 4.5% in Thailand. We also estimate that wage returns to on-the-job training tend to be quantitatively higher for men than for women although in Thailand they are not statistically significant for males. In Malaysia, the returns for males are 11% while for women they are not statistically different from zero. Workers that have at least completed secondary education also report higher returns to on-the-job training than other workers (returns are 9% and 10% for Malaysia and Thailand, respectively). In the empirical work, we start from a simple worker level Mincer type equation relating hourly wages with several observable worker and firm characteristics, including differences in the incidence of on-the-job training. Our main coefficient of interest quantifies the average effect on wages of having received on-the-job training. However, the estimation of the effect of on-the-job training on wages poses a major challenge as training is likely to be an endogenous variable to wages. On-the-job training is a choice variable for both firms and workers and most likely is also correlated with worker and firm characteristics, which in turn are also correlated with labor productivity and wages. Failure to control in a flexible manner for these characteristics may create a bias in the estimates of the effect of training on wages, as workers selecting into training may have different characteristics. In our empirical approach, we hope to minimize this problem by exploring a rich data set with many worker and firm characteristics and the propensity score matching (PSM) method. When compared to ordinary least squares (OLS), the PSM estimates allow for a more flexible (non-linear) functional form relating observable worker characteristics and their wages. The propensity to score matching method is developed in two steps. First, it estimates the probability of each worker to be selected into the training provided by the firm, given his or her observable characteristics. Based on this probability, it generates a “control group” of workers that did not participate in the training but whose probability of being selected into on-the-job training was very similar to the probability observed for the sample of trained individuals. These workers are very “similar” to those actually participating in training in all their observable characteristics (e.g., education, occupation in the labor market, years of experience). The only thing that distinguishes them from the trained workers is the sole fact of not having received on-the-job training. Hence, the wage difference between these two groups can be fully attributed to the wage impacts of on-the-job training. Our empirical findings document two interesting patterns across the two countries. First, the incidence of on-the-job training differs significantly by several worker and firm characteristics. In particular, we find that the more educated and more tenured workers are, in both countries, the more likely they are to receive on-the-job training. We also show that larger, more innovative foreign firms are also more likely to invest in on-the-job training. Second, there is strong evidence that the workers’ wages increase with the incidence of on-the-job training in both countries. In our preferred estimates exploring propensity score matching, the average wage returns to on-the-job training are 7.7% in Malaysia and 4.5% in Thailand. Furthermore, the heterogeneity analysis shows that in Malaysia the wage returns to job training are larger for men (11%) than for women (for whom they are not statistically different from zero). We also find that in both countries there are higher wage returns to job training for workers with completed secondary education or more years of education when compared to those who have not completed secondary education. The returns to on-the-job training for workers with at least secondary education are 9% in Malaysia and 10% in Thailand, respectively. In contrast, for workers with lower levels of education, there is no evidence of positive wage impacts both for Malaysia and Thailand. These findings clearly reinforce the idea that the investment in job training is complementary to the initial level of education of workers. Our paper relates closely to two empirical literatures. First, it relates to the work analyzing the firm’s investment in on-the-job training in developing countries (e.g., Ariga and Brunello, 2002, Almeida and Aterido, 2010, 2011, Almeida, 2010 and Almeida and Cho, 2012). The main empirical patterns found in these papers for developing countries are close to the findings found for developed countries (e.g., Bassinini et al. 2005). Larger, more open and innovative firms, with a more skilled workforce and operating in more technologically intensive sectors are more likely to train their employees. The major exception is Ariga and Brunello (2002). Exploring an employee survey for Thailand in 2001, they find a significant and negative relationship between years of formal educational and training. Second, we relate to the empirical work quantifying the wage returns to on-the-job training exploring worker level data5. Table A1 in the Appendix summarizes some of the main empirical studies quantifying the wage returns to on-the-job training, for developing and developed countries. Panels A and B report the estimates from papers using worker level data. Panel A refers to developed countries and Panel B to developing countries6. A word of caution is needed when comparing cross country estimates of the returns to on-the-job training. First, the variable capturing on-the-job training differs significantly across data sets yielding reduced comparability across studies. Second, there is little comparability in the reduced form equation used across most of the analysis7. The point estimates reported in Panel A for developed countries are very diverse. Some studies report positive and significant wage returns to training. However, more recently, as longitudinal data becomes available and experimental methods are used, the wage returns to on-the-job training tend to be smaller than in the cross section studies. Furthermore, in some cases, the returns are even zero (e.g., Leuven and Oosterbeek, 2002, 2004)8. The point estimates for most developing countries, reported in Panel B, are generally in the order of 20%. The evidence in the panel is also quite diverse. Chung (2000) and Johanson and Wanga (2008) explore cross sectional data and find evidence of large returns (between 20% and 38%) for Malaysia and Tanzania, respectively. On the other hand, Frazer (2006) finds that in Ghana, during the 90s, the returns to apprenticeship training were not statistically different from zero. Monk et al. (2008) find in addition some heterogeneity within the country and across education levels. They show that the returns of apprenticeships are 50% for individuals with no education but decline as education raises. They find evidence that the returns are zero for individuals with more than 6 years of formal education. The methodology in our paper is closer to Rosholm et al. (2007). They estimate that the returns to training are on average 21% for Kenya and that in Zambia training is not associated with higher wages. Like us, they also explore a matched employer and employee data set (collected by the World Bank) and a propensity score matching methodology. However, the larger number of observations in our sample and the more detailed information on worker and firm characteristics allowed us to conduct a deeper analysis. First, we consider hourly wages as a dependent variable, while Rosholm et al. (2005) consider only monthly wages. Second, we are able to control both for detailed worker human capital characteristics and for several firm characteristics that they do not. At the worker level, we include variables such as having received training at a previous employer, owning a bank account and using the internet. These variables, especially past training, will prove to be important in explaining the selection into training. At the firm level, we are able to control for the average years of schooling of the workforce, for the degree of innovation or for the degree of exports. The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset used and the descriptive statistics. Particularly, in Section 2.1 we explain in detail our main dependent variable of interest: the logarithm of workers’ hourly wages. In Section 3 we analyze which variables determine the selection into training. Section 4 presents the propensity score matching estimates for the wage returns to on-the-job training. In section 4.1, we explain the empirical model, and in section 4.2 we report the main empirical findings for the wage returns to on-the-job training. In Section 5, we report heterogeneity analysis by gender and level of education. Finally, Section 6 concludes.",8

The first one is usually captured by educational attainment and years of work experience. In Latin America, the average years of schooling is 8 which is relatively low compared to Europe and more advanced countries. Needless to say that ethnic minorities are the most disadvantaged in this respect. Concentrated mainly in rural areas their access to education and health services is precarious and limited. Moreover, occupational segregation is particularly high. Indigenous workers are mostly found in low-productivity activities either in the agricultural, manufacturing, and construction sectors or in domestic service. The strength of social norms is particularly evident in the strict gender division of labor in the region. In line with traditional gender roles, women are mainly responsible for domestic activities and for looking after children, even though their participation in the labor market has increased over time, and men are perceived as breadwinners working primarily in outside-home activities. These gender stereotypes are culturally acceptable in most Latin American countries and little has been done to change them. Women in the region face premarket discrimination and exclusion in the labor market and they are double burned taking most of the housework in the household. Ethnic and gender disparities have two main consequences in the job market. The first one is the existence of significant entry barriers to the formal job market and the second one, is that even when these barriers are crossed, there is still a wage gap between the discriminated group and the non discriminated one. A priori, this wage differential could lead to a smaller labor force participation from the discriminated group, increasing the demand for domestic production on in-home activities. In this context, women may have a bigger incentive to stay at home and accomplish domestic tasks rather than participating in the labor market, especially when the wage differential is significant. But to what extend does the level of wages really influence the distribution of domestic activities within a couple? The literature on gender and ethnic inequality is enormous, but much of the research focuses on wage differences neglecting the importance of domestic labor and time use. In this article, we examine the gender and ethnic gaps in wages and in the allocation of time to paid and unpaid work in Bolivia, Ecuador, and Guatemala. We pay particular attention to the role of education in explaining and reducing the gap along the wage and time distributions. The low level of human capital in the region is an important factor that determines women’s expected social role in domestic activities and it certainly plays a significant part in the inequality of opportunities endured by ethnic minorities and women in these countries. Needless to say that human capital and social norms are highly correlated. Education, for instance, helps individuals changing existing norms by influencing their perceptions and behavior. In order to assess the importance and determinants of the wage gap between the discriminated group and those who are not, we use the standard Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition (BO decomposition, hereafter) and complete the analysis with a quantile decomposition method proposed by Firpo et al. (2009). In order to explain the determinants of weekly allocation of time between domestic and paid market activities, while taking into account the inter-dependance of decision-making process inside the household, we use seemingly unrelated regressions. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 reviews the theoretical framework. Section 3 provides a literature review. Section 4 introduces the econometric methodology. Section 5 describes the data, and Section 6 presents the results and concludes.",14

Indeed, European transition countries such as Albania, Moldova, and Bosnia and Herzegovina are among the top recipients of remittances as a portion of gross domestic product (GDP) (Mansoor and Quillin 2006). In Kosovo, around one fifth of households are involved in labour migration, with this proportion slightly higher in rural areas (United Nations Development Programme 2010). Migration is well-known to be a coping strategy and a source of income that compensates for the low employment rates in the country (Corbanese and Rosas 2007). The very high unemployment rate of around 40%, plus the estimated number of 200,000 young people who will enter the labour market within the coming five years, increases the pressure to migrate. Indeed, 50% of the younger generation say they would emigrate if they could (Haxhikadrija 2009). Currently, between 315,000 and 500,000 Kosovars live abroad, of whom about 50% reside in Germany. It is estimated that every third household in Kosovo has family members living abroad (Mustafa et al. 2007; European Stability Initiative 2006). There is hardly any official and reliable data available on the remitted sums resulting from this migration, because considerable amounts of the money are transferred informally (World Bank 2010). The United Nations Development Programme (2010) estimates the absolute amount of remittances in 2009 as € 443 million. The share of remittances is estimated to represent around 13% of GDP. Despite its economic importance for the country, relatively little is known about migration and remittances in Kosovo, which have been widely underrepresented in the migration and development literature (Vathi and Black 2007). Although a number of studies have been published recently, most of the analyses are descriptive. The recent report of Gashi and Haxhikadrija (2012) nicely summarises results of available data and migration literature on Kosovo. Havolli (2011) and Meyer et al. (2012) provide more detailed analyses of the drivers of remitting. When the impact of remittances on households in Kosovo is analysed, this is done based on a simple comparison of recipients and non-recipients: for instance, in Haxhikadrija (2009); Möllers et al. (2013); and Elezaj et al. (2012). In this contribution we highlight the impact of remittances on the welfare and income distribution of the rural population1. The paper adds to the debate on the linkages between remittances and poverty and inequality (see, for instance, Taylor 1992; Adams 2011; Lokshin et al. 2010). Unlike earlier studies on Kosovo, we base our analysis on counterfactual incomes derived from Propensity Score Matching (PSM). Our main aim is to quantify the income-related outcomes of migration on (migrant sending) rural households. In addition to changes in poverty and inequality indicators, we also explore factors that determine household based success of migration (measured as an upward shift in income quintiles among migrant households). The paper is structured as follows: after a brief survey of the literature in Section 2, we introduce our methodology and data in Section 3. Section 4 provides a descriptive comparison of migrant and non-migrant households. The main analytical results are presented in Section 5. We start from a comparison of income groups. Based on headcount indices and using counterfactual incomes, we then determine the share of migrant households that would fall into poverty without remittances. We show if and how the rural income distribution is affected by mixed income structures – and especially by remittances. To analyse the marginal effect of remittances on inter-household income distribution we calculate decomposed Gini coefficients and Gini elasticities. Finally, an econometric analysis of the success factors linked to whether a rural migrant household will climb up the income ladder is presented. The procedure applied for this is a logit regression.

3.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor & Development,09 September 2014,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-9020-3-15,Job vacancies in Colombia: 1976–2012,December 2014,Andrés Álvarez,Marc Hofstetter,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In Álvarez and Hofstetter (2012, 2013), AH hereafter we built a 50 year-long monthly vacancies’ series for the city of Bogota based on the counting of Help-wanted (HW) advertisements in the main newspaper in town, El Tiempo. This represented the first effort to build a proxy for vacancies in Colombia. As a matter of fact that constituted a pioneer dataset within Latin America as there are no survey-based vacancies’ series in the region and only a few efforts similar (but shorter or less frequent) to those in the aforementioned paper. We extend the scope of AH to seven main metropolitan areas using the information collected by AH and by the Banco de la República (Arango 2013). With these datasets we build national help wanted indexes and vacancy rates. Moreover, we discuss the correspondence of the vacancy rate to the business cycle in Colombia and report Beveridge curves. While we discuss some hypotheses that might explain the shifts and patterns that become apparent from this first look at the data, a rigorous analysis examining their plausibility is beyond the scope of the paper. With these datasets and the preliminary look at them we hope to spark new research in the area. The count of HW advertisements is taken from the print versions of the main newspaper in each city. The Banco de la República will continue collecting the HW information and making it available for public use (see details in Arango 2013). The monthly series start in 1976, the year when household surveys—and thus reliable labor market information—became available. The seven cities are those where the DANE—the national statistical agency—performed the household surveys between 1984 and 2000: Bogota, Medellin, Cali, Barranquilla, Bucaramanga, Pasto and Manizales. Prior to 1984 the surveys are only available for the four main cities (the first four in the list); after 2000, the DANE added six cities to the survey. Population-wise, the seven cities that we focus on in this paper account for roughly half of the urban population in Colombia since the mid-seventies 1. Are the series a good proxy of the actual movements of unmet labor demand? As we argue in the rest of this section, the evidence based on other (developed) countries that have collected vacancy series using HW ads and the actual behavior of our series, suggest that they are indeed informative. Given the absence of direct and/or official sources of information on vacancies, HW ads have been used as a proxy, especially in developed countries. For instance, in the US the Conference Board HW Index (CBHWI) (see Preston 1977) is a widely used dataset built using this method. We collect our raw data following a strategy that resembles that in the CBHWI. Whether this strategy is accurate to depict the general characteristics of actual vacancy rates is a question that researchers have studied carefully. Abraham (1987) assessed whether the CBHWI adequately tracked the actual movement of job vacancies. She uses another source of data collected directly through representative surveys available for Minnesota and Wisconsin. The comparison shows that the HW index for those states tracks very closely the movements reflected in the data from job vacancy surveys 2. Amoah (2000) discusses the Canadian case, evaluating the performance of a very similar HW Index with official data both collected by Statistics Canada since the 1970s, concluding that “… the HWI provides incomplete information on vacancies and hence unmet labor demand. Whatever the degree of undercoverage of the HWI, that is, whatever the error in the estimates of level, what really counts is any bias in the measure of change in the unmet demand for labor. It may well be that the sources of undercoverage in the HWI are fairly constant through time, so the HWI’s measures of change are relatively unbiased.”(p: 16) Thus, as Amoah (2000) concludes, job vacancies based on HW ads do not capture the level of the actual job vacancies but rather their movements. The same is true for our paper: our vacancy rates obtained with HW ads help estimating the dynamics of unmet labor demand, not its absolute level. As long as the importance of the HW ads as a strategy to find workers remains constant over time, the series will be a good proxy of vacancy movements. As we explain below, there is one strong reason to suspect that the importance of ads in print versions of newspapers has declined over time: the advent of internet job-search platforms. We propose a method to correct the series for this decline, and report the results of both the original uncorrected series as well as the adjusted one. There are two potential disadvantages in our series compared to similar ones in developed countries. On the one hand, the considerable extent of informal job searching strategies in Colombia (family or friends, and other informal networks). Uribe and Gómez (2004) show that, in 2003, 86% of employees reported having searched for a job through informal channels 3. Furthermore, the readership of newspapers in the country is below that in the US: an average of 29.5% of the population for the period 1999–2009 (Media General Survey) while a similar measure for US shows an average of 52.7% for the same period 4. These two facts imply that our HW data could underestimate the level of job vacancies more than the HWI in the US. Nevertheless, as discussed above, our series are used to understand the movements in unmet labor demand, not as an estimate of its actual level over time. Therefore, these two characteristics of Colombia vis a vis US do not affect the accuracy of the unmet labor demand dynamics. While we have no direct ways of checking the accuracy of our estimates (i.e. comparing them to series based on surveys) our indirect tests are very encouraging. On the one hand, the dynamics of our vacancy rate are coherent with the business cycles in Colombia. Indeed, in section 4, we show that our HW series track the most salient characteristics of the cycle for almost the last 40 years. Moreover, the Beveridge curve that comes out of our data behaves also in a way consistent with the priors that we had both in terms of the slope as well as with the structural changes it suggests. In the next section we describe how the data was collected. In section 3, we build a national HW Index (HWI) and a corresponding national Vacancy Rate (VR). We also propose modified series that take into account the fact that with the rise of online HW webpages, the traditional print versions have lost ground as outlets for the advertisements. Section 4 takes a first look at the resulting series. Finally section 5 concludes. The whole dataset, including the raw counting of HW ads, the HW Index and Job Vacancy Rate and adjusted data, is available online at: http://economia.uniandes.edu.co/vacantescolombia.",7

In response, the government implemented a public employment scheme called Jefes y Jefas de Hogar Desocupados (Jefas). The main purpose of Jefas was to alleviate suffering by providing cash to poor families with children. By bolstering household income, program designers hoped to improve children’s well-being. The existence of a relationship between household income and children’s work and school attendance has been well-established, both theoretically (Basu and Van 1998) and empirically (e.g. Fiszbein and Schady 2009). Indeed, a large literature demonstrates that pure and conditional cash transfer programs (CCTs) reduce child labor and increase school attendance (Schultz 2004; Attanasio et al. 2006; Filmer and Schady 2008; Edmonds and Schady 2009). However, a key difference between public employment and cash transfers is that by requiring parents to increase their work hours outside of the home, public employment may raise the returns to children’s productive activities in the household and thus increase the opportunity cost of school attendance. The Jefas program required participants to work 20 hours per week in order to receive benefits. In contrast, CCTs have been shown to modestly reduce participants’ hours of paid work (Fernandez and Saldarriaga 2014). As a result, the impact on children’s school attendance may be smaller for public employment than for CCTs. In this paper, I estimate the impact of Jefas on child work and school attendance for children ages 10–14 by comparing Jefas participants with a propensity-matched group of program applicants who were not receiving benefits. The same basic strategy was used by Galasso and Ravallion (2004) to estimate the effect of Jefas participation on adult employment, incomes, and poverty as well as to study program targeting and distributional impacts. Galasso and Ravallion (2004) found that Jefas had only a small effect on the overall poverty rate but a larger effect on the extreme poverty rate. They also found that the program’s work requirement was largely binding and that targeting was good, with about half of Jefas participants coming from the poorest fifth of Argentine families. However, a large share of program participants were women who would not otherwise have been in the labor force. For that reason, the program was only able to reduce the unemployment rate by 2.5%, rather than the 5% reduction that would have occurred had all participants been otherwise unemployed. Building on Galasso and Ravallion’s (2004) empirical strategy, I find that the Jefas program was beneficial for children’s work and school attendance. Using cross-sectional data, I find that children age 10–14 whose parents enrolled in the Jefas program and received benefits were 46% (0.6 percentage points) less likely to report working and 38% (2.0 percentage points) less likely to forgo schooling, compared with similar children whose parents had applied but were not enrolled. Matched difference-in-differences estimates using a smaller panel sample confirm these results, suggesting program effects of 0.8 percentage points on child work and 1.8 percentage points on school attendance. These findings demonstrate that public employment can be effective at both reducing child work and increasing school attendance. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. I describe the background and institutional details of the Jefas program in section 2. In Section 3 I describe the data, and in Section 4 I present descriptive statistics of the sample used for analysis.

However, research on the economic consequences of wars and other violent events have only recently gained momentum as micro-level data from conflict areas become available. This is an important line of research as it indicates to policy makers the direct consequences of violent conflicts and which issues need to be dealt with once a conflict is over. The findings in this literature offer interesting insights into peoples’ lives in war-torn countries and on the effects of exposure to conflict. However, forced migration has seen relatively little attention, even though the UNHCR counts 10.4 million refugees and 36 million people of concern in 2009 in their Global Report (UNHCR 2009). In this paper I study the effects of displacement of parents on educational expenditure on their children.1
 I use the ethnic division during the Bosnian War between 1992 and 1995 as a natural experiment for displacement. The war divided the previously ethnically mixed Bosnia and Herzegovina into two parts and through “ethnic cleansing” resulted in two areas of homogeneous ethnic make-up. The resulting displacement of part of the population enables me to uncover its causal effects. The identification strategy circumvents the problem of endogenously migrated households by using only households who moved across the front line during the war. No significant difference in time invariant household characteristics support the assumption that treatment was exogenous. The short time span between the end of the war and the collection of the data set does not allow me to evaluate educational outcomes of children of displaced parents. However, the education system of Bosnia and Herzegovina requires parents to provide textbooks, uniforms, school materials etc. to their children, which gives me the chance to look at inputs in educational production. In particular, I am interested in parents’ education expenditure on their children. I find that displaced parents spend significantly less on the education of their children five years after the end of the war than comparable households that were not displaced. The estimates of the reduction in spending on education range from 20 to 30%. Considering that the average household in Bosnia and Herzegovina spends more than half a monthly household income on the education of a child per year, this is quantitatively a large difference. The finding is robust to a number of specifications and nearest-neighbor matching estimates confirm the magnitude. Displaced parents also spend significantly less on single expenditure positions like annual tuition in secondary school, textbooks, and other school materials. Recent experimental evidence suggests that students’ test scores react positively to additional educational inputs within a given institutional setting (Das et al. 2013), confirming an intuition that has been challenged in the past.2 As small an investment as $3 per student spent mostly on child’s stationary, classroom materials, and practice books can increase test scores by 0.1 standard deviations in India (Das et al. 2013). As Hanushek (2003) points out, there is evidence that increased school quality has positive effects on labor market outcomes and productivity. Exploring the causal channels through which displacement influences education expenditure, I show that at most one third can be explained by differences in income and wealth levels. The employment status of parents also fails to explain a major part of the difference, so there is no evidence that displaced parents substitute school inputs for increased parental effort as found by Houtenville and Smith Conway (2008). Potential explanations for the reduced spending of displaced parents on education include altered preferences through exposure to violence, increased uncertainty about the future, and tighter financial constraints. The paper is organized as follows: The next section reviews the literature, Section 3 discusses the background of the study in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the data and the identification strategy, while Section 4 presents the main results. Section 5 discusses some channels through which displacement works and Section 6 concludes.",8

Economic historians, such as North and Thomas (1973), North (1990) and Acemoglu and Robinson (2012), have shown the important role of property rights in economic development. Institutional economists, such as Coase, highlight the importance of well-defined property rights on the grounds of resource allocation efficiency. Mutually beneficial exchange would rarely take place in the absence of well-established property rights and enforcement mechanisms (Olson 1965, 2000). More recently, development economists have shown how deleterious the lack of a formal property rights system can be for the poor. Banerjee and Duflo (2008, 2011) and Karlan and Appel (2011) thoroughly examine the problems of missing markets for the poor, their implications, and what can be done to fix them in an effective way. One of the most discussed problems of missing markets is the absence of credit markets for the poor. Sometimes it is not a lack of assets that prevent the poor from accessing credit, but the lack of well-defined property rights that could make those assets liquid and therefore accepted as collateral by lenders (Ray 1998). In the same vein, de Soto (2000) argues that the lack of a property right system creates constraints for the poor to use their assets, e.g. land, as collateral to access credit markets (De Soto 2000). Many authors have argued that without access to credit the poor become more vulnerable to adverse shocks as they have access to limited and imperfect risk coping mechanisms (see Chambers 2006; Morduch 1994; Calvo and Dercon 2007). Perhaps land title is one way of helping the poor to smooth the effects of such shocks. This seems to be the case in Brazil. Piza and Moura (2011) analyze the same data used in this paper to assess the impact of having a land title on the use of credit. They find that land title increased access to and use of credit by 25 percentage points, with credit borrowed from formal banking institutions as the main driver of this result. There is some evidence that titled households may have used credit to consume durable goods, such as freezers and washing machines. Despite the theoretical appeal, the impact of property rights on outcomes such as investment and access to credit is ultimately an empirical question. There is relevant literature that looks at the impact of property rights through the role of land title and tenure security (see Goldstein and Udry 2008; and Deininger and Feder 2009). This is exactly the approach used in this paper. Most of the literature has focused on outcomes such as access to credit and investment (see Besley 1995, Field and Torero 2004; Carter and Pedro 2003; Galiani and Schargrodsky 2010; and Piza and Moura 2011), but only a few authors have turned their attention to second order effects, such as labor supply. As far as the authors of this paper are concerned, there is a limited sample of studies that apply experimental or quasi-experimental techniques to estimate the impact of land title on labor supply outcomes in urban areas of developing countries. Field (2007) looks at the impact of a massive land titling program in Peru on the labor supply (adult and child), whereas Moura and Bueno (2010) used quasi-experimental techniques to estimate the impact of a Brazilian land title program on the child labor supply. In 2003, the federal government of Brazil announced a national plan to title 750,000 families. The program was designed to issue land titles to families living under illegal conditions (i.e., residents illegally squatting in urban dwellings). According to the most recent Brazilian annual household survey, about 5 percent of the country’s households, or 10 million people, do not have tenure security (IBGE 2009). This particular land title plan only operates in illegally settled public areas. The main consequence is that new official property owners are fully protected under Brazilian Law. The government does not have any post rights over the land/property after titling execution. Other land dispute cases in Brazil are much more complex given that the invasion occurred on private property, which led to protracted legal battles as describes ANOREG (2007) manual report. This paper contributes to the literature in different ways. It is the first investigation of the impacts of the Brazilian land-titling program on the adult labor supply. Such analysis can provide theoretical insights for titling programs and pro-poor spending in other developing and emerging economies. Secondly, the paper investigates whether the program had distributive impacts on the adult labor supply by estimating unconditional quantile treatment effects. To the best of our knowledge, potential distributional effects of a land-titling program on labor supply have never been studied. Finally, it is one of the few studies available in the empirical literature on land titles providing evidence of the impact of urban land titling programs. We use fieldwork data from a public intervention that took place in one community of the Brazilian city of Osasco. In order to estimate the impact of the program, we collected baseline data in two neighboring communities and follow-up data one year later (March/April 2007 and March/April 2008). Although the households of these communities are not entirely similar in observed characteristics, the design of the intervention left no space for self-selection, as all households in the treated community were given the title. Although drawing upon a framework more suitable under random allocation of the treatment, our difference-in-differences (DD) results passed several robustness checks. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the land-titling program potentially had heterogeneous effects on the adult labor supply. We found a greater impact at the first two quartiles of the weekly hours worked distribution, which suggests, assuming the rank-preserving condition, a higher effect on adults who worked fewer hours prior to the intervention. Our results also contribute to the broader literature on land titling. Since the distribution of weekly hours worked was identical before the intervention, it is unlikely that the results are driven by reversion to the mean. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines three potential mechanisms through which we argue land titling could increase the adult labor supply of squatter households. Section 3 discusses methodological issues, the data collected, and some descriptive statistics. Section 4 describes our empirical strategy. The empirical results are then discussed in Section 5. Lastly, Section 6 concludes the paper, offering some policy recommendations and proposing areas for future research.",

Employment in the informal labour market plays an important role in most developing economies. Very broadly, the informal labour market consists of workers in the informal sector, plus casual workers in the formal sector. The informal labour market is a very large part of the agricultural sector, but is also a significant part of the urban sector. There is a difference between employment in the formal sector and the informal sector in terms of the conditions of work, whether workers are subject to government taxes, have access to social security or insurance, are casual or contract workers, and whether or not they receive the minimum wages1. The informal economy is a very important sector of the Indian economy. The National Council of Applied Economic Research estimates that the informal sector-“unorganized sector”-generates about 62% of GDP, 50% of national savings and 40% of national exports (ILO 2002), p. 30. In terms of employment, the informal economy provides for about 55% of total employment (International Labour Organisation 2002), p. 142. Urban areas (especially large cities) attract numerous migrants from both the rural areas and from smaller urban towns and cities in the hope of a better life. The Indian labour market can be conceived of as a segmented market. One segment is the formal sector composed of workers who have salaried work, good working conditions, and are employed in organised business. The other segment is the informal economy consisting of small self-employed traders and business people, and casual workers in the informal or formal sectors. Some individuals are born into wealthy families who own large businesses and hence are in the formal sector by right of birth. Others who are born with parents from the professional classes would almost certainly have education from good schools and universities, and have a network of contacts that would ensure their joining the ranks of the employed in the formal sector. Some individuals may have built up sufficient assets over time to set up small businesses and hence enter the formal sector. However, most workers in the formal sector enter the sector through their educational achievements, or by birth (children of rich people) and through social networks. For someone who comes from a disadvantageous background (either in terms of income or belonging to a socially backward caste or religion) the only way to enter the formal sector is via education in “good” schools3 or universities. Even with a good education, entry into the formal sector is often based on family connections. The Indian government has for some time had a policy of positive discrimination for the Dalits, and as a result they may have a higher probability of finding a job in the formal (government) sector. Migrants (especially from rural areas) who come into urban areas would likely have to work in the informal sector for some time before they build good networks enabling them to move into the formal sector. The literature on the role of the informal sector in developing countries has oscillated between treating the informal sector as a backward sector that is holding back economic development to a dynamic sector that is helping to develop the economy rapidly without straining foreign currency balances and with relatively low demands for (real) capital goods (see Mazumdar (1976), Weeks (1975), Bromley (1978), Gerxhani (2004))4. The informal sector is considered to be a pre-capitalist form of production compared to the formal sector which is a profit maximising capitalist sector. There is a large volume of literature on rural–urban migration (see, Harris and Todaro (1970)) that examines migrants arriving in the city and initially finding work in the informal sector, then moving on to better paid work in the formal sector. Fields (2009) developed an early model of the informal sector as a “way station” along the path toward a formal job in urban areas (De Mel et al. (2010)) which has been followed by others. This view of the informal sector as a temporary abode for migrants has been disputed (among others) by Mazumdar (1976). The debate has also ranged over whether informal sector workers are living in poor conditions with low incomes, or whether some of the informal sector workers are there out of choice and have a comfortable life (see Meng 2001, Perry 2007). Some individuals may have employment in the formal sector and work in the informal sector as well. Given the setup of the urban labour market in India, some of the important issues to investigate are (1) whether individuals working in the informal sector are migrants and whether they move out of the informal sector into the formal sector after a few years; (2) whether they are from disadvantaged social and ethnic groups who do not have social networks to enter the formal sector; and finally (3) whether those with low levels of education and skills are unable to enter formal sector employment and have to find low paid works in the informal sector (Mitra (2004, 2008)). This paper is interested in studying the characteristics of the workers in the informal economy and whether migrants treat this sector as a permanent base or only as a temporary location before moving on to the organised or formal sector to improve their lifetime income and lifestyle. We limit our study to the Indian urban (non-agricultural) sector and study the characteristics of the household heads that belong to the informal sector (self-employed and informal wage workers) and the formal sector. We find that members who come from the lower social groups (castes and religions) are more likely to be in the informal sector. We distinguish between migrants in urban location who came from rural areas and those who came from other urban areas. We find that rural migrant’s likelihood of staying in the informal wage labour sector is inversely related to the length of time a rural migrant spends in an urban area. In Section 2 below, we clarify the definition of informal labour markets and briefly review the literature; Section 3 provides a detailed discussion of the properties of the urban informal sector in India; Section 4 discusses the lexicographic preferences that people have over formal sector, self-employment, and informal wage labour; Section 5 sets up an econometric model for estimating the probability of working in the informal sector and provides some results, while Section 6 provides results using a multivariate logit model; Section 7 concludes with a summary of the results. In general, we find that the longer the duration of a migrant in the urban sector the more likely s/he will have moved out of the informal sector.",5

Vocational schooling in South Africa,December 2014,Todd Pugatch,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Youth unemployment far exceeds adult unemployment in most countries. Developing countries are particularly concerned about youth unemployment because their younger populations make the problem more severe. Low productivity levels and mismatch between youth skills and employer demands are often cited as major contributors to youth unemployment. Vocational education may be an effective means to provide youth with skills that employers seek. Countries with high youth unemployment face the largest gaps between the supply and demand of qualified young workers, and therefore might gain the most from effective vocational education. South Africa is a prime example of a country in which vocational education could play this important role. Youth unemployment is exceptionally high, exceeding 50% in recent years,1 with surprisingly few opportunities in the informal sector. Students face wide variation in school quality and high rates of grade failure and repetition. Improving the difficult school to work transition for youth, particularly for those from vulnerable circumstances, is a key social and political issue. Vocational schooling, in which about 400,000 students enroll at the secondary and post-secondary levels annually each (Bunting and Cloete [9]; UNESCO Institute for Statistics [40]), offers the promise of an alternative educational path for students struggling in the general education system. The South African government intends to expand vocational secondary programs by over 6 times current enrollment in the coming years (Oxford Business Group [36]). Yet little is known about what types of students enroll in vocational programs in South Africa, why they choose to enroll, or how they fare on the labor market. This paper analyzes the role of vocational schooling in the school to work transition of South African youth. Specifically, I examine whether vocational schooling serves as a “safety valve” for students struggling in traditional academic schooling, experiencing adverse household shocks, or forming households. I also examine whether vocational schooling benefits students after they leave, or whether (consistent with concerns expressed by many South African students) it is a “sinkhole” offering little chance for success on the labor market. After defining the terms safety valve and sinkhole in a model of human capital investment with multiple schooling types, I test for evidence of these characteristics in a panel of urban youth in South Africa. I find support for the safety valve role of vocational schooling, with a 1 percentage point decrease in vocational enrollment in response to grade failure, compared to a decline of 40 percentage points for academic enrollment. These findings account for persistent unobserved heterogeneity and remain after extending the model to account for multi-dimensional ability and splitting the sample among various subsamples of interest. In contrast, I fail to find evidence that vocational schooling is a sinkhole, with wage and employment returns at least as large as those for academic schooling. Labor market returns to both types of schooling are precisely estimated, so that these findings are not due to large standard errors (the sample is underpowered to detect such differences when distinguishing between secondary and post-secondary schooling of each type, however). Although not causal, I use the method of Altonji et al. ([1]) to present evidence that these returns estimates are not driven by selection on unobserved characteristics. The results suggest that vocational schooling plays an important role in easing difficult school to work transitions for South African youth. Students who struggle to advance in academic programs may find it optimal to enter vocational programs, where they can earn comparable returns. Vocational schooling has been the subject of considerable previous economic research, much of it focused on estimating comparative returns between vocational and general/academic programs. For the developing world, Bennell ([7]) provides an early review, questioning the then-conventional wisdom that academic returns exceeded vocational. Since then, a number of researchers have continued to estimate comparative returns for individual developing countries. A partial list includes Egypt (El-Hamidi [15]; Krafft [23]), Indonesia (Newhouse and Suryadarma [33]), Taiwan (Rodgers et al. [41]), Tanzania (Hawley [19], Hawley [20]), and Thailand (Kahyarara and Teal [22]), with varying results regarding the direction and magnitude of comparative returns. Two recent studies (Oosterbeek and Webbink [35]; Malamud and Pop-Eleches [30]), rely on policy changes in the Netherlands and Romania, respectively, to isolate plausibly exogenous changes in vocational schooling2. Both studies find little difference in labor market outcomes between students with vocational and academic schooling as a result of the policy change, and argue that non-random selection into these tracks drives the varying findings of other studies in the literature. Hanushek et al. ([18]), using data from OECD countries, find initial gains to vocational schooling that are overtaken by academic schooling later in working careers, providing another plausible explanation for contradictory findings regarding returns. Because my sample is composed entirely of young adults, the Hanushek et al. ([18]) results call for caution in interpreting my results on labor market returns, as differences between academic and vocational returns may emerge later in working careers. The notion of vocational schooling as safety valve or sinkhole has been discussed in previous literature. Arum and Shavit ([2]) consider whether vocational schooling in the United States “is simply the crude mechanism of social exclusion” (i.e., a sinkhole), but conclude that “vocational education is a safety net that reduces the risk of falling to the bottom of the labor queue” (p. 187). For South Africa, Needham and Papier ([32]) refer to a stigma attached to vocational schooling, and the common perception that it is a sinkhole: “Some school [general education] students saw FET college [Further Education and Training, or vocational secondary] education as a second choice education that would result in low-paying jobs with no career prospects” (p. 36). They also reference vocational schooling’s safety valve role, citing qualitative evidence of poor previous schooling outcomes among vocational students: “[S]tudents viewed vocational education, particularly FET colleges, as second chance programmes that you went to if you could not make it at [traditional] school” (p. 37)3. This paper contributes to the literature by formalizing the safety valve and sinkhole concepts in a human capital investment model, documenting the patterns of differential selection into vocational and academic schooling in South Africa, and estimating the wage and employment returns to each type of schooling. These returns estimates, while observational in nature, use high-quality panel data that include complete schooling histories, measures of ability, and actual (rather than potential) work experience, allowing for bias reductions relative to similar estimates from a census or labor force survey. In the next section, I define the terms “safety valve” and “sinkhole” in a simple model of human capital investment. Section 3 describes the data and presents descriptive statistics. Section 4 analyzes the role of vocational schooling in youth enrollment choices and labor market outcomes, and Section 5 concludes.",3

Figure 1 shows that workers’ remittances have grown steadily over the past 30 years and since 2005 have exceeded foreign direct investment as a source of capital inflows to Mexico. Given this trend, the potential impact of remittances on the economy is tremendous. Remittances differ from other forms of capital inflows, however, because they need not only be used for investment. Households receiving remittances may use them for many purposes: to supplement consumption, to invest in assets such as land or real estate, to purchase productive capital such as tools or agricultural inputs, to pay for children’s education, to start a small business, to be saved for consumption smoothing, or to fund any of a number of other end uses. How these remittances are used will ultimately determine the extent of their impact on the economy. Thus, it is necessary to examine the factors that influence how households choose to use their remittances and the role that economic institutions play in that decision making process. 
Capital flows to Mexico 1980-2008.
 One economic institution of particular interest in its relationship with remittances is the financial sector. This relationship is complex because some financial sector services, such as wire-transfer services, act as complements to remittances. Others services, such as small-business loans, may act as substitutes for remittances. Thus, on one hand, development of the financial sector works with and facilitates the flow of remittances, while on the other hand the same financial sector competes against remittances for bank loans. The size of, and degree of competition within, the financial sector will determine whether these opposing interests work, on balance, for or against remittance receiving households. In a best-case scenario, competition will drive down the price of both wire-transfers and loans, thereby increasing the flow of remittances to the community and reducing the cost of borrowing. In a worst-case scenario, banks may attempt to raise the price of wire-transfers in order to make higher interest loans relatively more attractive, thereby reducing the quantities of both. In addition to affecting the flows of remittances and the use of banking services, development of the financial sector will also affect the impact of remittances on the economy by altering the composition of remittance usage in the community. It is the composition of that spending that ultimately determines how remittance flows will affect the economy as a whole. The current body of research on remittances focuses primarily on the motivations for sending remittances (e.g. to support family members, repay debts, etc.) or on the economic outcomes arising from receiving remittances (e.g. growth, income inequality, education, health, etc.). The majority of the research linking remittances and financial sector development falls into the latter category. Thus, there exists a gap in the research that neglects to examine how households decide for what purpose remittances are used once they are received. The aim of this paper is to begin to fill that gap. This paper examines the relationship between development of the financial sector and remittance use by testing how the size and scope of the banking system in Mexican communities affects how households choose to spend their remittances. In particular, I test whether there is a difference in remittance use between households in communities where banks are present and communities where they are not. I also test whether the size of the financial sector affects remittance use, as well as whether the types of services offered by banks affect the use of remittances. Section 2 presents a brief review of the literature while Section 3 provides the empirical methodology and data. The main hypotheses are presented in Section 4. Section 5 presents a discussion of the empirical findings and explores potential endogeneity. Section 6 concludes and provides some policy implications.",4

A majority of these studies find that remittances favorably impact asset accumulation by increasing the share of spending on investment over consumption (e.g. Zarate-Hoyos 2004, Adams 2005, Mora and Taylor 2006, Airola 2007). Some find, in addition, that remittances shift household spending from less productive asset accumulation to more productive asset accumulation (Chiodi, Jaimovich and Montes-Rojas 2012). In this study, we explore an additional factor that shapes household expenditure patterns by examining how the uncertainty of remittance income affects the accumulation of human, physical and financial assets. While it is important to understand how the level of transfers from family abroad affects household spending, it is also useful to ascertain how the predictability of such money inflows influences household spending. Some households receive remittances on a regular and predictable basis, e.g. they receive $200 each and every month. Other households might receive the same overall level of transfers irregularly –when emigrants return home, when they have accumulated a sufficient sum to send to family members in the home country, or at other unpredictable intervals. Consequently, while one remittance-receiving household is able to forecast with reasonable precision the timing of future remittance inflows, another one might be unable to, even if in the end both households receive the same overall amount. We argue that, ceteris paribus, the expenditure pattern of the two households is likely to differ. Specifically, households with regular and predictable remittance inflows are more likely to use those funds to meet ordinary, perhaps scheduled, consumption needs. In contrast, households that receive remittances on an irregular and less predictable basis are more likely to use those funds toward the accumulation of assets1. This hypothesized behavior follows from the life-cycle permanent income hypothesis (LCPIH), according to which regular and permanent increases in income tend to be consumed as individuals can expect to enjoy those income increments over the long term. The expectation of an increase in income over the long-run allows for an upward adjustment of consumption over the lifecycle. In contrast, irregular increases in income are less likely to be viewed as permanent. Since households cannot count on them for the longer-run, they are more likely to be saved2. The idea that less regular income is more likely to be saved is further supported by the precautionary saving motive (Leland 1968). When households find it more difficult to predict future income flows, they tend to save more –as a precaution against future income shortfalls. The LCPIH and precautionary saving motives lead us to suggest that remittance-receiving households with more volatile remittance inflows will save more by engaging in more asset accumulation3. Concern about the economic and social implications of remittances in the receiving countries has permeated much of the debate on remittances. Gaining a better understanding about the impact of remittances on asset accumulation in remittance-receiving households can further inform on the economic well-being of migrant-sending nations. Despite the overall optimism concerning the important and positive role that remittances play in poorer countries, there are a number of studies that point to unfavorable effects, such as reducing labor supply, depressing long-run economic growth and breeding “dependency” (see Keely and Tran 1989, Glytsos 1993, Durand et al. 1996, Adams 2011, Senbeta 2013). While we do not subscribe to the view that expenditures on consumption are undesirable (they can significantly raise the quality of life of recipient households), we do see an important role for investment in human, physical and financial assets as they facilitate entrepreneurial investments and the accumulation of back-up savings for consumption-smoothing over the lifecycle. Consequently, a better understanding of the factors influencing the channeling of remittances by households towards the accumulation of human, financial and physical assets can inform on policies that may help harness the most out of remittance inflows.",5

By providing monetary transfers to families conditional on a set of fulfillments, such as school attendance and health care of children, the objective of CCTs is twofold. The first is alleviation of current poverty through periodical stipends; allowing families to increase overall consumption. The second goal is to reduce future poverty by increasing human capital of children, which is achieved by means of program conditionalities. During recent years, CCTs have received a great attention from policymakers and academics, since significant reductions in poverty levels have been observed after their implementation. Furthermore, these programs have been catalogued as one of the main models of safety-nets in developing economies. After the success of programs such as Bolsa Escola in Brazil and PROGRESA in Mexico ""virtually every country in Latin America has such a program"" (Fiszbein and Schady 2009). Most of the existing literature on the effects of CCTs has focused on scholastic achievement, health and nutritional outcomes of children. However, less attention has been paid to the indirect effects that cash transfers could have on adults’ behavior. More specifically, little is known about the effects of CCTs on adult labor supply. While cash transfers are necessary to accomplish improvements in consumption, education and health, they can also generate incentives to reduce work intensity among adults, since this payment can be thought of as a pure income effect. Recent experimental evidence has shown small effects of CCTs on labor supply of adults from beneficiary households (Parker and Skoufias 2000; Maluccio and Flores 2005; Skoufias and Di Maro 2008; Galasso 2006; Foguel and Paes de Barros 2010). This literature relies on comparisons between beneficiaries and non-beneficiaries to estimate the so-called average treatment effect of CCTs on labor supply. Nevertheless, there is no evidence on the immediate labor supply response to cash benefits. This article deviates from the previous literature in two subtle but important ways. On the one hand, this study represents the first attempt to analyze the transitory effects of welfare programs, namely CCTs, on labor supply. That is, we do not aim to estimate the average treatment effect of CCTs on labor supply. Instead, we are interested in exploring whether benefit recipients change their labor supply after they receive the cash transfer. On the other hand, we adopt a novel empirical strategy which exploits exogenous variation in the difference between the program’s pay dates and interview dates of a household survey. The combination of pay dates and interview dates allows us to compare beneficiaries’ labor supply before and after receiving the cash transfer. We think of these deviations as representing our contribution to the literature on the labor supply responses to cash transfers. There are several reasons why analyzing immediate labor supply responses to cash transfers can be of particular interest. First, cash recipients are independent workers and the available evidence suggests that such workers do not behave according to life-cycle models of labor supply but instead they work ""one day at a time"" (Camerer et al. 1997; Fehr and Goette 2007; Goette et al. 2004). Moreover, these studies argue that independent workers (who are free to choose when and how much to work) are better described as having income targets: once they reach their income target they stop working. Second, beneficiaries of CCTs are, by construction, credit constrained. These restrictions may prevent households to smooth consumption and leisure and, therefore, both variables may react to the timing of cash transfers. Indeed, empirical studies have shown that consumption of welfare recipients jumps up after the pay date and then declines (Shapiro 2005; Mastrobuoni and Weinberg 2009). Third, benefit recipients of CCTs live in rural areas where access to markets is quite limited. In such locations, every time beneficiaries are paid, they must incur in transportation costs (money but also time). Therefore, these short-term responses are relevant for the design of CCTs. In particular, the time that beneficiaries spend picking up the money is an opportunity cost that policy makers should take into account when choosing among alternative payment methods (bank deposits versus cash-in-hand) and frequencies (monthly versus bimonthly). We find that cash recipients (female household heads) hours of work are reduced by 6 hours in the week following the pay date. This reduction is rather large, since it implies a decline of roughly 20% of their weekly hours of work. Moreover, this decrease in hours of work is larger for married women and mothers with children aged 5 or less. However, no significant effects are found for labor force participation, nor for the probability of working for paid activities. We do not find significant effects of cash transfers on the labor supply of recipients’ partners (when we restrict the sample to married recipients). The document is structured as follows. Related literature is reviewed in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the program, named Juntos and its mechanics. Section 4 presents the econometric set-up and describes the data. Section 5 presents the results and additional robustness checks. In Section 6 we discuss our results and make comparisons with respect to previous empirical findings. Section 7 concludes.",5

Evidence from Tajikistan,December 2014,Anita V Staneva,G Reza Arabsheibani,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The size of informal sector, cited as the central factor underlying wage inequality, poverty and labour market inefficiency, has always attracted attention in all transition and developing countries and Tajikistan is not an exception. The National Human Development Report (2010) for Tajikistan shows that during 2008–2009 over 47% of employment in the country was in the informal sector. The number of people employed in this sector was estimated to be over 1 million. It is generally assumed, and empirically supported by much of the literature, that workers in the informal sector are paid less than their formal sector counterparts. Empirically and theoretically it is not clear why this should be the case. There are a number of explanations offered, most of which are based on a segmented view of the labour market (Badaoui et al. (2008)). The presence of barriers to entry into the formal sector could be a possible cause (Fields (1975); Mazumdar (1975)). A wage penalty for informal workers might be due to sorting, where those with lower human capital are more likely to work in the informal sector (Tokman (1982)). Marcouiller et al. (1997) show a significant wage premium in the informal sector in Mexico, while in El Salvador and Peru formal workers have a higher wage premium. However, evidence in favour of the existence of a wage premium for formal worker depends on the category of informal job (e.g. self-employed are, in general, better paid than salaried workers). Using the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey, Braithwaite (1995) and Kolev (1998) find higher wage premium in secondary jobs, compared to the main job, which are the main locus of the informal economic activities. Lehmann and Zaiceva (2013) show a wage penalty in the lower part of the distribution and no statistically significant difference between informal and formal wages in the upper half of the distribution for salaried workers in Russia. In contrast, by including informal self-employed and entrepreneurs the authors find significantly positive in the upper part of the distribution, pointing to a segmented informal sector with a lower free entry tier and an upper rationed tier. Carneiro and Henley (2001) indicate that differences in earnings are strongly explained by the non-observable characteristics of workers who decide to join each sector. Wu and Li (2006) show that about 90 percent of the observed formal-informal monthly income differential in urban China can be explained by differences in observed characteristics. One of the major difficulties in being able to identify and understand the informal sector employment has been the lack of consensus on how to define and measure informal sector activities. Whilst there is a large literature on the informal economy, very few studies have applied it so far to the transition economies. An improved understanding of the formal/informal pay differential is crucial for addressing country’s welfare, equity and poverty consequences. In this regard the present study complement the existing literature by capturing the diversity of informal sector employment in Tajikistan and estimating earnings differential along several dimensions. First, we try to distinguish and define informal sector employment in Tajikistan a country that has received little attention in the literature and provides rich evidence for a large and heterogeneous labour market. Household survey data available for Tajikistan contains detailed information on individual household member economic status and permits some comparison of alternative informality definitions. It cannot be assumed that different definitions are broadly consistent and therefore, any particular choice of definition measurement is important. 
Second, earnings gap is commonly used to test for the existence of segmented versus competitive labour markets. Large differentials are often viewed as an evidence for institutional rigidities in the labour markets and thus suggesting need for a policy action considering equity and efficiency purposes. To provide a more detailed insight into the formal-informal pay differential, the current study looks across the entire conditional earnings distribution by extending Machado-Mata procedure (2005), where for the non-discriminatory wage structure we follow Neumark (1988) and Oaxaca and Ransom (1994) procedure. The methodology employed decomposes the earnings gap into differences in endowments of skills and differences in returns to these skills. Disentangling the formal/informal pay gap along various quantiles of the earnings distribution enables a multidimensional array of policy implications. In this fashion, one can also address the issue of heterogeneity within formal and informal sectors which is often an important issue in such earnings analyses. 
Third, the main challenge in earnings gap analysis is to control for a possible sample selection bias which may result from either self-selection of individuals into different employment types (formal/informal). The importance of controlling for endogeneity lies in the fact that it allows us also to discuss the role that changes in the distribution of unobserved ability might play in the observed changes of the earnings distribution. Finally, we consider that possible differences in the distribution of observed characteristics of the formal and informal workers may lead to biases for the estimates in the preceding section. Following Ñopo (2008), we use matching, as an alternative to the linear specification approach, to identify workers in the formal sector that display the same observable characteristics as informal sector, and compare their wages across the distribution. The method does not require estimating earnings equation for formal and informal sector workers, and thus it is not necessary to assume that the linear estimators of the earnings equations are valid out of the supports of individual characteristics for which they were estimated (Ñopo (2008)). The purpose of implemented matching approach is to balance the unobservables by adjusting for pre-treatment observable differences between sectors. There are a number of econometric issues involved in the decomposition methods applied. Obviously, matching has advantage over the traditional linear regressions, recognizing importance of differences in the support and being less computationally demanding. It is possible also to obtain a distribution of the formal-informal pay differences. The considered method has also an advantage in the estimation of the gap, because it is based on the matching between observable individuals and as a result, does not need to account for selection bias such as in other decomposition methods. However, we should mention the curse of dimensionality - the use of many matching characteristics for a single matching discrete variable may reduce the chances of obtaining adequate number of matched observations (Ñopo (2008)). The remainder of the paper is structured as followed. In section 2, we provide a brief discussion of the Tajikistan’s labour market. A discussion of the existing literature on measuring informal sector employment and our propose measure is given in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the data, and section 5 presents the econometric methodology. Finally, sections 6 and 7 discuss the main results and conclusions.",19

Therefore, researchers frequently encounter that employers are paying wages below mandated minima. Existing estimates report that 16–50% of developing country workers earn sub-minimum wages (Rani et al. 2013). Moreover, this non-compliance tends to be heterogeneous within countries, depending on institutional factors, industry-specific attributes, location, and worker characteristics. Unfortunately, the majority of the minimum wage literature has provided scant attention to enforcement and compliance. This is troubling because small changes in enforcement may lead to vastly different consequences of minimum wage hikes (Basu et al. 2010). Since modifying wage floors is controversial because they pose an equity-efficiency trade-off, enforcement and compliance issues warrant further discussion because they help determine which effect dominates. Studies that analyze non-compliance often calculate how many workers earn less than the minimum wage. While this measure is useful, it tells an incomplete story since individuals earning just below the minimum and those paid much less are equally weighted. For example, a construction worker earning one percent below the minimum counts the same as a seasonal farm worker that makes only half the wage floor. Both employees are underpaid but find themselves in two clearly different situations, which the standard measure of non-compliance is unable to identify. Bhorat et al. (2013) recently proposed using the Foster et al. (1984) poverty measures to provide evidence on the incidence, depth, and severity of non-compliance with minimum wages. Their use helps distinguish between compliance at extensive and intensive margins. Extensive compliance counts how many workers receive sub-minimum wages, just like the traditional measure. Intensive compliance, however, quantifies how far individual wages are from mandated minima. These measures are known as the family of minimum wage violation indices. This article estimates these indicators on household survey data from Honduras. The country sets multiple minima that have differed across regional, industrial, and firm-size categories. Additionally, minimum wages only cover some workers. Following Honduran legislation, I define covered employees as private-sector wage earners and uncovered workers as the self-employed. Jointly, these occupations represent more than two thirds of the total workforce. The data cover seven years (2005–2011), providing information on more than 150,000 workers (approximately 22,000 per year). Using this data, I investigate two issues. First, I explore heterogeneity in industry-level compliance, highlighting urban-rural differences and duality in minimum wage coverage. Second, since previous literature is mainly concerned with how variations in enforcement affect compliance, I instead focus on how higher minimum wages change extensive and intensive compliance by taking advantage of a large unexpected increase. Findings from this study contribute to previous literature by providing new estimates of minimum wage violations and their depth. While a few studies have analyzed heterogeneity in compliance, further evidence is required to fully understand this phenomenon. Moreover, there remains almost no knowledge about whether and how compliance responds to rising wage floors. Lastly, the broader minimum wage literature may benefit from a more profound study of compliance since it is a key dimension of this policy. Addressing these gaps would help researchers better understand minimum wages in developing countries and inform policymakers on how to enhance the tractability of labor market institutions. Results show substantial heterogeneity in non-compliance across industries, location, and coverage status in Honduras. Despite a generalized level of violations, some industries comply more than others, especially in urban areas. Findings also support that the depth of non-compliance captures different factors than its incidence. Compliance worsens after minimum wage hikes, since violations at the extensive and intensive margin increase significantly. There is suggestive evidence of partial compliance in the urban covered sector but it seems minimum wages are not complied with in the rural covered sector and for uncovered workers. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature on minimum wage compliance in developing countries. Section 3 describes the Honduran labor market and its minimum wage policy. Section 4 presents the data and empirical strategy. Section 5 analyzes heterogeneity in minimum wage compliance. Section 6 studies how extensive and intensive compliance respond to a large minimum wage hike. Finally, Section 7 concludes and discusses directions for future research.",7

Shaleva,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Over the last few decades, trust within societies, known also as interpersonal or social trust, has turned out worthy of increasing attention from both public policy makers and social scientists. Arrow (1974) defines trust as a social lubricant to cooperation and economic exchange, and Putnam (1993) considers it a fundamental building block of social capital. More specifically, Stiglitz (2000) and Millo and Pasini (2010) suggest that interpersonal trust alleviates moral hazard and incentive problems. Empirical evidence confirms the economic theories by finding associations of trust, for example, with investment and transcation costs (Zak and Knack 2002), large organizations’ performance (La Porta et al. 1997), and ultimately—by revealing a causal relationship of trust with growth (Algan and Cahuc 2010). Motivated by the above findings, this paper falls into a branch of the economics literature interested in the factors that influence trust. Regarding determinants at the individual level, Alesina and La Ferrara (2002) find that trust is lower for blacks, women, people with traumatic experience, and those who live in societies with ethnic, race and economic heterogeneity. Zak and Knack (2002) study trust as an outcome of formal/informal institutions, while Aghion et al. (2010) find a negative effect of market regulation on trust. Income inequality is another factor for which previous studies have consistently uncovered an effect on trust. The higher the gap between rich and poor in a society, the lower the level of interpersonal trust on both cross-country (Zak and Knack 2001) and cross-community dimensions (Alesina and La Ferrara 2002). Related literature has implied the interconnection between income mobility and sense of fairness by discussing mobility’s relationship with inequality. Solon (2002) suggests that intergenerational income mobility could involve intergenerational transmission of inequality. In the majority of country-level studies, high income mobility is complemented with low cross-section inequality (Gottschalk and Smeeding 1997; Freeman and Katz 1995; and Aaberge et al. 2002 – cited in Solon 2002). Gottschalk (1997) argues that the trend toward greater inequality is to be reduced only if mobility increases. Under a standard approach that assumes all inequalities as unfair, translating the stylized facts on mobility and inequality to mobility and fairness bolsters the speculation that more fairness could be attained also with higher mobility. That said, social trust could be affected by changes in income mobility, and not only by changes in income inequality. Under a structural approach, controlling for selection on unobservables, this paper aims to uncover a causal relationship between relative intergenerational income mobility and present-day interpersonal trust. The intuition behind is that through changing perceptions of fairness about others and the system, income mobility would affect interpersonal trust. This underlying hypothesis has previously been evidenced in the work of Fischer and Torgler (2006), drawing attention to “envy,” a concept that differently from perceptions of fairness has a negative connotation, and showing that people’s positional concerns about their relative income correlate negatively with their generalized trust. The authors relate the focus of their study to early origins of economics in moral philosophy–for example, the phenomenon of relative wants is central to human behavior in Adam Smith (1759/1976), and similarly, humans measure their wants and pleasures in relation to society in Marx (1849), while in Marshall (1961) the emphasis is on the relevance of human distinction.1 Despite the importance of the question for studying behavior and attitudes, Fischer and Torgler (2006) point to the scant empirical evidence on it. Except for adding new empirical evidence to the niche and confirming with causal results Fischer and Torgler’s (2006) correlation effects on the impact of relative income position on interpersonal trust, more practically, this paper also contributes to the policy debate. Policies aimed at increasing equality of opportunities, creating education opportunities for disadvantaged children and thus increasing upward intergenerational income mobility could be an alternative to income redistribution. The latter could be seen weak in preventing the underpriveleged from remaining so in the long run as they fight against inequality upfronted ex-post, i.e., by taking away from the wealthy to give to the needy.2 Based on the results, I can conclude whether the policy option of increasing income mobility would be beneficial for trust. The availability of US General Social Survey (GSS) data which reports respondents’ income, their family income at age 16 along with their current degree of interpersonal trust makes it feasible to identify how trust is affected by the intergenerational change in income position experienced by GSS respondents. For that purpose I construct a simple measure of relative income mobility that equals the difference in income positions achieved by the son/daughter away from their parents’ income positions.3
 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data, Section 3 presents the econometric specification and the approach for identification. Section 4 analyzes the results. Section 5 discusses briefly the policy considerations and Section 6 concludes.",2

Firm owners regularly demand information on how to influence the expansion of their firms. Citizens can be negatively affected by being unemployed in terms of their levels of subjective wellbeing, as work can help give people meaning in life, connect them to other individuals and their community, provide social recognition and identity, build up skills and capacities, and provide income (Krauss and Graham 2013). Policymakers in turn often design and implement policies and programmes aimed at promoting employment growth. The extent to which firms create jobs can be shaped by the broader business, investment and institutional environment within which they operate, i.e. by factors that can influence firms’ opportunities and risks, their decisions about investments and their incentives to expand. Within this broader environment, applied economists often analyse the relationship of policy (such as improved access to infrastructure or technology) or managerial choices (such as the decision to export) with firm expansion. An abundance of research exists on the correlates of job creation globally and in OECD countries, but such research is more scarce within individual East Asian and Pacific countries1. Papers using enterprise surveys that analyse job growth often focus on a specific issue such as basic firm-level traits2, labour productivity3, innovation4, business regulation5, electricity6, or finance and corruption7. By expanding on this work and broadening its scope, the first main contribution of this paper is to explore these factors but to do so simultaneously also including other factors ranging from levels of wages to other specific infrastructure and technology traits, among others. This can allow for a broader understanding of a wider range of correlates of job growth. Most such papers, which use enterprise survey data to analyse job growth, apply pooled, cross-country regressions. This modelling approach merges idiosyncraticies within individual countries into pooled results or into the error term, making the strong assumption that correlates of job growth would be similar across countries. By assessing instead between country variations, this paper investigates this assumption and illustrates that it is not supported by empirical evidence. It identifies thereby several limitations in applying this popular approach of pooling data in the job growth literature. First, this approach can ignore much firm heterogeneity and variations between individual countries with unique business, financial and regulatory environments8. It can ignore the fact that processes in each individual country that can link the selected dependent and independent variables vary given different labour standards, bureaucratic structures and institutions. It can ignore levels of inflation and political stability in individual countries that can influence decisions about investment and firm hiring, both domestically and abroad. It can ignore the fact that in a country with high population growth or high economic growth it would be expected to be less difficult for firms to hire new employees. Because these factors, together with other country-specific variables, are not all included in these surveys and cannot always be controlled for in statistical models, pooled regression analysis using enterprise surveys is faced with limitations. Second, as this approach forces variations observed across countries into a single—averaged and weighted—coefficient, a result can often be influenced by a few outlier or large economies, as later illustrated. Third, it can reduce the usefulness of findings for policy in specific countries, as this paper shows that the additional pooled regional results presented here have limited value for policymakers and firm owners in individual countries given that the pooled results are almost entirely shaped by trends in China due to its large survey sample. By analysing job growth for East Asian and Pacific countries individually, the second main contribution of this paper is thus identifying correlates of job growth within individual countries and across sub-groups of countries including the Pacific Island economies and larger economies. The country-specific analyses conducted here help reduce the assumptions and limitations of using the common approach of pooling enterprise survey data across countries. While this is not the first paper to analyse job growth at the country level using enterprise survey data, existing papers often do not conduct comparative analyses across countries or they often apply a few variables relative to the wide range applied here9. This paper is therefore the first to examine a broader range of correlates of job growth for each country separately across all East Asian and Pacific countries with enterprise survey data, which can help produce more policy-relevant results for individual countries—this is the paper’s main objective. To be clear, the results here illustrate correlations of firm characteristics with job growth, not potential causal effects. Enterprise surveys do not allow for the identification of causal relationships irrespective of the statistical model applied (despite most existing studies cited throughout this paper claiming they establish causation) as for example many observable and non-observable household, macro and institutional level factors can influence firms and job creation and can interact with correlates but are not captured in firm-level enterprise surveys. It is important—while not common practice in research—to outline the limitations of firm-level analyses, with the paper making explicit the strong constraints in analysing enterprise survey data that many existing studies neglect to acknowledge. Being conscious and transparent about the limitations, descriptive data analysis can still provide useful information to inform policymakers. This paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the data sources used for the analysis and outlines a number of important data limitations accompanying enterprise surveys. Section 3 illustrates the descriptive results. Section 4 presents the model, outlines its limitations and provides the multivariate regression results of a wide range of firm-level correlates of employment growth in individual East Asian and Pacific countries. Section 5 discusses potential policy implications and concludes.",

In addition, it has been reported that the informal sector and informal employment affects macroeconomic stability and job satisfaction (Perry et al. 2007; Fiess et al. 2010). A plethora of empirical studies have also found significant gender differences in informality rates, observed in both developed and developing countries (International Labour Organization 2002; International Labour Organization 2012). Several explanations for the documented gender gap have been proposed, often focusing on motivational differences, such as necessity and choice (Adom and Williams 2012) and differences in labour market attachments and household-level structures (Perry et al. 2007; World Bank 2012). The recent global crisis has reawakened interest in informality in general and women’s informal employment in particular; and yet there appears to be some ambiguity about the effects of recession on informality, in relation to both theory and empirical evidence (Hazans 2011).1
 Kazakhstan is clearly an interesting case because of the nature of its restructuring and its recent economic performance, with real GDP growth averaging 10% during the 2001–2007 commodity boom. Necessity-driven self-employment observed during the period of structural adjustment has persisted well into the 2000s, and there was also a sharp rise in the number of own-account workers during the macro-economic downturn post 2008, suggesting that self-employment correlates positively with recessions.2 Evidence also reveals that around half of all workers in the informal sector are self-employed, mainly own-account workers (Verme 2001; Allen et al. 2007; Rutkowski 2011, p. 5), and that women are ‘pushed’ into self-employment, as in many regions of the developing world (Duban 2012, p. 50; International Finance Corporation 2011, p. 43). According to Allen et al. (2007, p. 15), around 40% of women in Kazakhstan start a business out of necessity, and in general the self-employed and informal workers were the most vulnerable groups during the 2008–2009 global economic crisis (Gavrilovic et al. 2009). Finally, although many empirical studies have examined the informal sector and informal employment in transition countries (e.g. Rutkowski 2006; Lehmann and Pignatti 2007; Lehmann et al. 2012; Slonimczyk and Gimpelson 2015), relatively little is known about informality in the countries of Central Asia. It is therefore interesting to contribute to the debate on informality and its causes in Central Asia’s largest economy. The objective of this paper is to identify factors that shape the informality decision amongst self-employed men and women. Additionally this paper intends to investigate the effect of the global recession on informal self-employment. We perform these analyses by estimating the choice between formal and informal self-employment using data from the Kazakhstan Labour Force Survey (KLFS) for 2006, 2009 and 2011.3 To decompose changes over the five-year period in the average probabilities of being informal, we use a decomposition framework suggested by Gomulka and Stern (1990). The decomposition, performed separately for men and women, provides a nuanced perspective on what matters for formality and has potentially important policy implications for linking formality with development. The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we provide descriptive analysis of issues related to the persistence of informal self-employment. Section 3 introduces the methodology. Section 4 describes the data set and defines the variables used in the analysis. Section 5 presents the econometric results. Section 6 concludes and presents policy applications.",5

Policymakers around the world worry about how to foster productivity and growth among this group of firms. In a modern economy, the investment in human capital is crucial to foster technological adoption and, thus ultimately, achieve higher productivity growth. This paper explores a large firm level survey across 99 countries to document the differences in the job training provided by employers across firms of different sizes. Our findings show that a strong and positive correlation across the investment in job training and firm size is a robust empirical finding within and across countries with different institutions and income levels. Furthermore, proxies for some market imperfections and institutional failures impeding SME development do not explain most of the differences in the training intensity across small and large firms. It is thus a very robust finding that large firms conduct more on the job training. Unfortunately, with our data, we cannot fully disentangle correlation from causality. It is possible that size is not driving training and that on-the-job training is productive and itself drives firm productivity and growth. We highlight that more and better data sets are needed to rigorously tackle this identification problem and thus shed more light on this important policy question in developing countries. The importance of the SME sector throughout the developing world is undeniable. First, SMEs account for more than half of manufacturing employment in many countries (e.g., Ayyagari et al. 2008). Second, there is also a growing recognition of the role that SMEs play in sustained global and regional economic growth, higher employment and poverty alleviation. Moreover, few economists disagree that SMEs face greater constraints to their growth than large firms. Access to finance usually ranks high among these constraints and is often pointed to as the main reason behind SMEs having a smaller capacity to invest. Documenting and understanding the main binding constraints on firm’s investment and growth in developing countries is crucial for the design of policies that promote long run productivity growth. The investment in human capital has been widely documented as a core component of each individual’s human development, firm growth and aggregate productivity growth. For example, Heckman et al. (1998) estimate that individuals invest in human capital over the whole life-cycle, but more than one half of lifetime human capital is accumulated through post-schooling investments taking place on the job. Moreover, differences in total factor productivity account for approximately half of the differences in income across countries and are generally associated with differences in technological progress (Hall and Jones, 1999). These differences are also large between firms within a single country (Hsieh and Klenow, 2007), and technology adoption and investment in human capital are shown to be core factors in explaining how firms catch up to the technology frontier. Moreover, these factors are also important for designing policies to enhance growth and development. Surprisingly, very little research has been done on the differences within countries and across firms in the investment in job training around the developing world, and the reason also relates mainly to lack of data. This paper explores a unique cross sectional firm level data set across 99 countries in the developing world to document differences in the investment in job training across firm sizes. The Enterprise Surveys, collected by the World Bank, have unique information to study this topic. First, the surveys explore an almost standardized questionnaire across countries and thus collect information that is comparable across and within countries. Second, the surveys are available for 99 developing countries covering all the geographical regions of the world and income levels. This wide range of countries covered allows us to test the extent to which the existing differentials are explained by differences across countries in their institutions and policies. Third, the survey collects detailed firm characteristics including variables that are good proxies for the firm’s access to information and external finance, measures of the degree of openness and technological innovation, measures of the human capital composition of the workforce and on the perceptions regarding the firm’s investment climate. The availability of several firm characteristics will allow us to analyze the role of different factors in explaining the correlation between the investment in job training and firm size. Unfortunately, survey limitations affect the scope of the analysis beyond our control. First, in most countries, these surveys are representative of the formal sector, and particularly of the manufacturing sector. Since in developing countries the services and/or informal sector can reach more than half the workforce, this will naturally limit the representativeness of the analysis to the informal or non-manufacturing sectors. Still, we expect that most of the job training taking place in the informal sector to be more of the type of learning-by-doing or apprenticeship rather than formal training programs (see Johanson and Van Adams 2004). Second, the surveys collect only information on formal training programs, leaving undocumented any informal training taking place while workers are on the job (e.g., learning by doing)1.  For this reason, we are likely underestimating the overall investment in training, especially among the smaller enterprises, where informal training or apprenticeship schemes are likely to be more important (e.g., Frazer, 2006, Velenchik, 1995, Teal 1996, Monk et al. 2008)2.  However, our findings are still relevant and important for the formal training programs. Apprenticeships are usually focused on employee hands-on learning to enable usually youth to perform a given task. They often have limited or no linkages to more academic training. Formal training programs, instead, tend to be more broadly determined by the needs of firms, often when they start new tasks and explore new production processes or upgrades/changes in knowledge and procedures. This training is obviously very different from the apprenticeship training. In this paper, we focus only on formal training programs and on how different the patterns of investment are across firm sizes. The paper documents several interesting findings. First, we find robust evidence of a large and statistically significant positive correlation between firm size and the investment in job training. In particular, we find that small (11–50 permanent employees), medium (50–250 employees) and large firms (more than 250 employees) train approximately 13, 30 and 40 percentage points more than micro firms (with 10 or less employees). Second, our findings show that these differences are robust across countries in different geographical regions and income levels and, thus, also with different institutional and economic backgrounds. Interestingly our findings show that the disadvantage of micro firms relative to large firms in offering formal training opportunities is greater for firms operating in the Middle East and North Africa and in Africa, as well as for low income countries where formal training incidence is very low. Moreover, within countries, this pattern is also robust to firms with similar patterns of investment in innovation and technology adoption, operating in the same sector of activity and located in the same city. Third, we find robust evidence that the differences across firm sizes in the investment in job training are not fully explained by differences across small and large firms in the access to information and external finance, facility in the coordination with workers or in the degree of perceived economic uncertainty. Even though the disadvantage of SMEs across all these factors may partly explain their lower training provision across the developing world, these differences do not fully explain their gap in investment in training with respect to larger firms3. It is reassuring to see that the differential in the investment across firm sizes is robust to several cuts in our sample as well as to the control of many firm observed characteristics (e.g., managerial education, contract structure within the firm or perceptions of the economic uncertainty) or unobserved country-sector and city variables. The small explanatory power of these market imperfections is again a robust finding across geographical regions and countries with different levels of development. Even though our main empirical findings survive a battery of tests, because we are exploring a cross sectional data set, we cannot ultimately rule out that the positive correlation between firm size and the investment in job training is driven by a reverse causality argument. In fact, it is very possible that on-the-job training is itself productive and impacts firm productivity and growth, ultimately leading to larger firm sizes (and not the other way around). It is thus difficult to interpret this causally. In order to do so convincingly, one would need an instrumental variable for training, or a panel data set observing over time the investments in formal on-the-job training programs and direct measures of firm productivity. Only if such data were available would it be possible to investigate whether training is productive and the extent to which it impacts firm productivity growth. Nevertheless, it is reassuring that our results are quantitatively large and very robust across a wide set of specifications and after controlling for several different firm characteristics. And even though it is likely that part of the identified correlation is explained by the productivity impacts of training, it is unlikely that all the correlation is accounted by this reverse causality argument. These findings are, however, important to help shape the data and analytical agenda moving forward. They highlight the importance of determining more rigorously whether the investment in formal training is, or not, productive in developing countries and which types/modalities of formal trainings are most cost-effective and for which types of firms4. Possible future avenues for data collection and for research in developing countries involve collecting longer panel data sets with firm level and time series information on the human resources practices of firms (including investments in formal training programs, apprenticeships or other informal learning) together with information on direct measures of firm productivity several firm characteristics, including technological adoption practices, and also the direct and indirect costs of these investments. For instance, Dearden et al. (2006) and Almeida and Carneiro (2009) illustrate for UK and Portugal, respectively, how long panels can be used to estimate the impacts of job training on productivity. In addition, there is also need for more research evaluating rigorously the impact of specific policy reforms incentivizing the investment in job training and analyzing their impacts on firm growth and productivity (see, e.g., Leuven and Oosterbeek, 2004). It is worth stressing that we do not directly address the problem of the determinants of the firm size distribution at the country level. Instead, we take the distribution of firm size as given within countries and investigate the impact of this predetermined size structure in the investment in job training at the firm level. Nevertheless, our data shows substantial differences in the distribution of firm sizes across countries. And a significant part of these differences are likely to relate to differences across countries in institutions, like product and factor regulations, or in the fiscal policy (e.g., Kumar et al. 1999)5. However, our empirical analysis conditions on country and sector heterogeneity and thus explores within country and sector variation across firm size. Moreover, we will also test the robustness of our findings when exploring variation within country, sector and city. Our paper relates with three strands of the literature. First, we relate to the literature analyzing the patterns and determinants of the investment in job training. In spite of the importance of the topic for both individuals and firms, the systematic empirical evidence based on micro data in the developing world is still scant. Exceptions include the work by Frazer (2006), Teal (1996), Velenchik (1995), Lopez-Acevedo and Tan (2003), Rosholm et al. (2007), Pierre and Scarpetta (2006), Almeida and Aterido (2011)6. Some interesting patterns have been documented at the firm level for developed countries, including the advantage of large firms in this investment (e.g., Black and Lynch, 2001; Lillard and Tan, 1992; Leuven and Oosterbeek, 1999; Royalty, 1996; and Bassanini et al. 2005, for OECD countries). However, to our knowledge, no empirical work to date has documented the robustness of the differences in the intensity of offering formal training within and across developing countries with very different institutional and economic differences. Second, we relate to the literature investigating whether training is productive. To our knowledge, this literature exploring direct firm level productivity measures is quite reduced, partly due to the lack of good data in developing settings. One exception is Lopez-Acevedo and Tan (2003), who explore firm panel data for Mexico between 1993 and 1999 and show that training had a large and statistically significant impact on productivity. Conducting joint training and R&D yielded larger returns than these investments alone. In the developed world, evidence has shown that even though public job training has low returns, private job training can be quite productive and have heterogeneous returns. The empirical findings overwhelmingly show a strong and positive impact of employer provided training on different measures of firm productivity both in a cross section (e.g., Bartel, 1995) or with longitudinal panels (e.g., Dearden et al., 2006, Zwick, 2006, Almeida and Carneiro, 2009, Colombo and Stanca, 2014, and Konings and Vanormelingen Forthcoming)7. More recently there is also evidence from a randomized experiment finding supportive evidence of positive impacts of training on firm performance (De Grip and Sauermann, 2012)8. Almeida and Carneiro (2009) find that rates of return are very heterogeneous but that for those firms providing some training, employer provided training is productive. To the extent that this pattern is also true in developing countries, we may expect that part of the estimated correlation between firm size and training could be driven by a productivity effect of training. However, it is unlikely that this explains all of the correlation as it is quantitatively large. In addition, some studies have also looked at the impact of training on wages, assuming this impact is a lower bound of the impact on firm productivity. As summarized recently in Almeida and Faria (2014), the point estimates are generally positive, but magnitudes are quite diverse. Chung (2000) and Johanson and Van Adams (2004) explore cross sectional data and find evidence of large returns (between 20% and 38%) for Malaysia and Tanzania, respectively. On the other hand, Frazer (2006) finds that in Ghana, during the 90s, the returns to apprenticeship training were not statistically different form zero. Monk et al. (2008) find, in addition, some heterogeneity within country and across education levels. They show that the returns of apprenticeships are 50% for individuals with no education but decline as education raises. Rosholm et al. (2007) and Almeida and Faria (2014) both explore a matched employer and employee data set and a propensity score matching methodology. They find that the wage returns to training are on average 21% for Kenya and that in Zambia, training is not associated with higher wages, while Almeida and Faria (2014) show that the average wage returns to on-the-job training are 7.7% for Malaysia and 4.5% for Thailand. Third, we relate to the empirical literature looking at the growth constraints facing SMEs in the developing world. Some papers analyze the differences between small and large firms in their growth and productivity and on how these relate to differences in the general business environment (e.g., Van Biesebroeck, 2005, Ibarrarán et al. 2009, Aterido et al. 2011). A particularly large strand of this literature looks at differences across firm sizes in the access to external finance (e.g., Beck et al. 2005). Some papers have also analyzed differences across small and large firms in other performance indicators like the investment in innovation and technological adoption (De Mel et al. 2009). While it is unquestionable that SMEs play an important role in the developing world, most analyses do not lend foundation for policies supporting SMEs (e.g., through subsidizing SME’s investments; see Beck et al. 2008 and Ibarrarán et al. 2009)9. However, most micro analyses have been criticized for being country or region specific. To our knowledge, no previous work has investigated empirically the differences across small and large firms in the investment in job training by SMEs. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 briefly describes the data set used. Section 3 discusses alternative reasons why SMEs could be less likely to invest in job training than larger firms. Section 4.1 documents the differences across firm sizes in the intensity to train, and section 4.2 analyzes the heterogeneity of these findings across alternative samples within and across countries. Section 5 analyzes the extent to which training differences across firm size are fully explained by differences in market imperfections and institutional failures impeding SME development. Section 6 concludes and draws policy implications.",13
4.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor & Development,26 May 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40175-015-0027-5,"Court-ship, kinship and business: a study on the interaction between the formal and the informal institutions and its effect on entrepreneurship",December 2015,Tanika Chakraborty,Anirban Mukherjee,Sarani Saha,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Effective contract enforcement is the key to the process of economic development. A contract can be enforced by the formal legal court or by informal community courts, for instance panchayats in South Asia. In less developed societies both types of institutions co-exist, often coming in each others way. These conflicts are well documented in the context of the marriage market and common property management (Chowdhry 2004; Keremane et al. 2006; Madsen 1991; Nagraj 2010; Yadav 2009). However, till date there has not been any study that analyzes and estimates the effect of such interactions on economic decision making. In this paper we look at the effect of the interaction between the informal loan network and formal court system on the decision to run a business using both analytical and quantitative methods. We find that the informal network helps in business proliferation when the formal court system is weak. However, when the formal court system improves sufficiently, business might fall in areas with strong informal networks. Our paper is related to a vast body of literature that studies the effect of institutions on economic development. There is a consensus among economists that better institutions encourage capital accumulation and subsequent growth (Acemoglu et al. 2001, 2002; Rajan and Zingales 1998). However, the existing empirical literature on the effectiveness of formal institutions mostly look at the institutions of property rights which prevent the elites from expropriating. One exception is Acemoglu and Johnson (2003), who distinguish between the effects of property rights institutions and contracting institutions on growth. Using a cross country data set, they find that while good property rights institutions have a positive effect on growth, the effect of contracting institutions is not robust. This result is counter intuitive, and one possible reason could be that their data, which only measures the quality of formal contracting institutions, fails to account for the role of informal network based institutions, ubiquitous in many developing countries. Evidence shows that in the absence of effective formal courts of law, business often thrives under the informal institutions (Biggs and Shah 2006; McMillan and Woodruff 1999). In a related paper, Harriss-White (2010) finds that in absence of effective formal institutions, Indian SMEs are largely regulated by what she calls “social regulation.” This is nothing but informal institutions working through community networks and reputation mechanisms. The caste system prevailing in India can also be seen as a grand framework of contract enforcement using the reputation mechanism (Freitas 2006). The key to the success of such reputation based mechanisms is information about one’s past action (therefore reputation) flowing in the community network (Ghosh and Ray 1996; Rosenthal and Landau 1979; Kandori 1992). Many credit institutions in less developed countries, such as ROSCA in East Asia (Besley et al. 1993) and Grameen Bank in Bangladesh (Ghatak 1991), crucially depend on such information flow within communities. The use of community level information for enforcing contracts was also ubiquitous in medieval Europe (Greif et al. 1994; Greif 1993; Slivinski and Sussman 2009). Besides the general literature on institutions and its impact on economic growth, this paper is also related to the role of networks in credit provisioning. Network membership, which is often characterized by caste or ethnicity, may work both in positive and negative ways. A number of studies found in the African context that community membership can increase the probability of getting a loan if one’s own community controls the supply of loans (Biggs and Srivastava 2002; Fafchamps 2000,2003, Fisman 2003; Gajigo and Foltz 2010). On the other hand, it may decrease the probability of getting loans if the credit granting authority has any negative bias towards the credit applicants ethnicity. This result has been confirmed by various studies in the context of the United States (Blanchflower et al. 2003; Fairlie and Robb 2007). However, most of the literature on institutions look at formal and informal institutions as separate phases of development – the informal system getting replaced by the formal ones in due course of development (La Porta and Shleifer 2014). At best, some authors have adopted a dual sector approach – making formal and informal two parallel sets of rules without interfering with one another (Straub 2005). But in reality, formal and informal institutions interact and mutually constitute each other. Evidence suggests that social capital affects formal economic behavior like financial decisions. Luigi et al. (2004) find that in Italy people are more likely to use formal checks, invest less in cash and more in stocks, have higher access to institutional credit and make less use of informal credit in areas of high social capital. The effect of social capital is stronger in areas with weaker legal enforcements. In a similar line of research, Karlan (2005) uses an experimental approach to find the effect of social capital on financial decisions. The interaction between formal institutions and informal norms also plays a role in the management of common property resources. For example, Sandner (2003) looked at the interaction between formal institutions and norms of the Kuna community in Central America for preservation of marine resources. He shows that erosion of norms and insufficient development of formal institutions can lead to over exploitation of marine resources. The interaction between formal and informal institutions is particularly important in less developed countries. In these countries de facto practices are quite different from de jure rules – and these differences are often shaped by the interaction between formal and informal institutions. The only theoretical exposition of such interactions that we have come across is Dixit (2004) where he argues that the development of the formal may have a detrimental effect on the informal mechanisms. The informal system relies heavily on the reputation mechanism, where someone with a reputation of cheating does not get a job within his/her community. People using formal contracts however do not care about reputation – punishment under formal contracting is direct and enforced by a third party (fine, imprisonment). Hence one can always cheat someone using the informal contract and then find their next employment with another employer using a formal contract. On the empirical front there has been much less research on this issue. One of the few papers related to relevance of institutions in affecting business decisions is Chemin (2012). He finds that reforms in the civil court procedure leads to lower breaches of contract, higher access to capital and building of new capacity in India. However, what Chemin finds is an average effect of more efficient courts. His research does not answer whether the effect is different for areas with different initial conditions in terms of informal institutions (such as the presence of caste panchayat). We claim that the effect of better legislation on business decisions will critically depend on these initial conditions. Another closely related paper is Klapper et al. (2006). Their study, based on 34 Eastern and Western European countries, find that higher requirements to comply with formal bureaucratic regulation prevents new businesses from entering the industry by increasing entry cost. The main contention of our paper is that formal and informal institutions might come in the way of each other, producing undesired results in places where traditional, community based dispute resolving systems are widespread. We define a business in terms of a contract where a contractor agrees to supply certain inputs to an entrepreneur. The quality of the input cannot be verified beforehand or by any third party, creating a possible moral hazard problem. The only way to punish a cheater contractor is to fire him and deny him any future employment opportunity. Hence, we have a structure similar to Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) and Greif (1993), where the only way to prevent cheating is to pay the cheater contractor an honesty-inducing price for his input so that he finds that cheating pays off is less than the honesty pay-off. The entrepreneurs can come from a traditional producer community or someone coming from outside the community. The latter group can only enter the market if the formal contracting institutions are of sufficiently good quality. For entrepreneurs belonging to the traditional community, the community norm requires them to boycott a contractor who cheated any community member. This makes the cost of cheating someone very high for the contractor, depressing the honesty inducing price of his input supplies. We argue that in the presence of an effective formal system, the capacity to punish declines in the informal system. This is precisely because a strong formal system allows entrepreneurs from outside the community to enter the market who do not abide by the community norm of not hiring a past cheater. This makes it easy for a cheater contractor (who cheated a community member in the past) to find employment with an entrepreneur who does not belong to the community. This increases the honesty inducing price for the input, pushing the entrepreneurs with small capital stock out of the market. Our theoretical model suggests that in areas with strong networks, an honesty inducing input price is low, accommodating small entrepreneurs in the system. But as formal systems improve (and consequently the input price rises), these areas are the worst hit as facing the rising input prices, the entrepreneurs are forced to quit the market. We use the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) 2004-2005 to test our theoretical predictions. In accordance with the theoretical predictions, our empirical evidence suggests that business is affected by the interplay of formal institutions and informal norms. Specifically, when formal institutions are strong enough, we find that the probability of doing business is lower in the presence of a large informal network. Given the cross-sectional nature of the data, we should be careful in interpreting our results as causal. However, this inference does not suggest the preservation of the informal institutions by limiting the power of the formal courts. It rather emphasizes the possibility of jeopardizing the expansion of business by imposing a rapid expansion of the formal contracting system. There is no point in denying that improvement in formal contracting enhances efficiency and social mobility by allowing contractors without any family/community connection to enter the market. However, the preexistence of a strong informal institutional framework, captured by large community networks, makes the rapid institutional switch socially costly as it may exclude people from participating in the market. Most importantly, the exclusion comes from the high cost of accessing the formal institutions. Given the efficiency property of formal institutions, the most logical implication of our research is to reduce the cost of formal contracting. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the analytical model, Section 3 outlines the empirical framework, Section 4 summarizes the data used to test the implications of our model, Section 5 reports the empirical findings and, finally, Section 6 concludes.",1
4.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor & Development,15 May 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40175-015-0028-4,The effects of electrification on employment in rural Peru,December 2015,Rosamaría Dasso,Fernando Fernandez,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Access to public services and infrastructure such as water (Devoto et al. 2012; Sekhri 2014), roads (Banerjee et al. 2012), electricity (Dinkelman 2011; Rud 2012; Libscomb et al. 2013) and telecommunications (Goyal 2010; Beuermann 2011; Beuermann et al. 2012) seems to be key to generate welfare improvements in rural areas. Many governments in developing countries allocate large amounts of money to finance infrastructure projects as an attempt to boost economic development in poor areas. The growing empirical literature on this topic has documented that such public projects have positive effects on the welfare of rural households by allowing them to have access to markets, jobs and information. In this study, we evaluate the impacts of electrification on employment in rural Peru. In 2006, only 39 percent of rural households had access to electricity. However, the Peruvian government rapidly increased electricity coverage during the last decade through the Programa de Electrificación Rural, known as PER (for its acronym in Spanish). Rural families largely depend on the labor market to meet their consumption plans, so we focus on the impacts of electrification on employment. Electricity provision can affect labor outcomes through different channels. First, it can be thought of as a technological shock that improves household production. Second, it implies a larger time endowment because everyone can work during the night (and not only during the day). Third, it could promote the start of new businesses by allowing households to produce goods and services that require appliances. Fourth, it might increase the time spent watching TV (Olken 2009). Since the theoretical prediction of access to electricity on labor supply is ambiguous, we empirically examine the total effect of electrification on different employment outcomes in Peru. Two previous studies analyze the association between access to electricity and hours of work in Peru (Escobal 2005; Torero et al. 2007). Based on matching techniques, both papers find that households with electricity work more hours in non-farm activities than families without electricity. However, it is likely that unobservable differences remain even after controlling for observable characteristics. Using data from other developing countries, four more recent papers deal better with the fact that electricity is not randomly assigned to households. First, Dinkelman (2011) estimates the impact of electricity provision in rural areas of South Africa during 1990-2007. She takes advantage of the roll-out of an electrification program done by ESKOM, the electricity utility. Between 1993 and 2003, about 470,000 households were electrified. Program placement was not random so the author uses community level data and relies on instrumental variables and fixed-effects strategies to uncover their parameters of interest. In particular, she uses land gradient as an instrument for program placement and then adopts a fixed-effects estimator to remove time-invariant unobservables that may jointly affect program placement and employment. Her results indicate that electrification leads to an increase in female employment in both the extensive and intensive margin and that women’ s wages fall while male earnings go up. Second, Rud (2012) evaluates the link between electricity provision and industrialization in India during the period 1965-1984. To overcome endogeneity concerns, he uses the start of the Green Revolution, an agricultural technology intensification in irrigation introduced in the 1960s as a natural experiment. In particular, he predicts electricity expansion using (initial) groundwater availability in the 1960s. The author documents that an increase in electrification provision is associated with gains in manufacturing output. He also finds that places with higher access to electricity have more factories and output among small firms. Third, Libscomb et al. (2013) analyze the effects of electrification on the Human Development Index (HDI) using county-level data from Brazil. The authors also rely on geographic characteristics to adopt an IV approach. More specifically, they simulate how the electricity grid would have evolved if its expansion had only taken into account geographic cost considerations (water flow and river gradient), ignoring demand-side considerations. Then, they use this forecast as an instrument for actual program placement. Their results indicate that electricity provision is associated with higher levels of HDI. Moreover, their analysis suggests that migration is unlikely to account for the large magnitude of development gains observed. They also estimate large, positive effects of electrification on employment, salaries, and investments in education, but not health. Fourth, Grogan and Sadanand (2013) use several methods to analyze the association between household electricity and time use in Nicaragua. Using past population density as an instrument for current access to electricity, they find that access to electricity makes women – but not men – more likely to work outside home. Our paper adds to this literature by using individual-level data instead of aggregate data. Also, we have detailed information on labor outcomes that allow us to identify the channels through which electrification affects employment. In the absence of an experimental design, our approach consists of using two identification strategies: Differences-in-Differences and Fixed-Effects. For the former, we use seven repeated cross-sections of the Peruvian household survey during the period 2006-2012. For the latter, we utilize a unique household panel data set collected between 2007 and 2010. We document the following impacts of the program on labor outcomes. Our preferred specification suggests that men in treated areas reallocate their time devoted to work as follows: they work harder (2.5 additional hours per week) in their main occupation but are less likely to have a second job (a reduction of 6 percentage points). Among women, our estimates indicate that treatment increases earnings and hourly wages by around 30 percent. Additional evidence suggests that these gains are related to a lower probability of working in agriculture. Since male earnings are unaffected, these estimates imply that the program has reduced the gender wage gap in treated districts. These findings represent our contribution to the literature that examines the role of electricity provision on labor markets in developing countries. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the electrification program and our data sources. Section 3 outlines the empirical strategies. Section 4 presents our results. Section 5 offers concluding remarks.",22

In the last three decades, fertility in Iran has dropped sharply from an average of seven births per woman in 1984 to less than two births in 2005. Although fertility in Iran has experienced one of the fastest declines in modern human history, no considerable rise in FLFP in Iran is documented (Aghajanian 1995; Abbasi-Shavazi et al. 2009; Majbouri 2010). Using household-level information, this paper investigates the effect of children on FLFP of mothers in urban Iran. The association between fertility and FLFP is extensively documented in theoretical models of work and family. While it is difficult to empirically estimate the endogenous effect of fertility on FLFP (Schultz 1981; Goldin 1995), several studies estimate its causal effect by exploiting an exogenous variation in family size. For example, Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1980) and Bronars and Grogger (1994) use twinning at the first birth. Angrist and Evans (1998) use an instrumental variables (IV) strategy based on the sex composition of siblings in families with two or more children. Agüero and Marks (2008) exploit random assignment of infertility as an exogenous variation in family size. Using the Iranian Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES), this paper contributes new evidence on the effect of fertility on FLFP by using an IV strategy. I follow Angrist and Evans (1998) strategy to construct IV estimates of the effect of fertility on FLFP based on sex composition of children. While in the US, parents are more likely to have a third child if their first two children are of the same sex, in Iran, as parents prefer sons to daughters, the presence of daughters in their previous children acts as a positive shock to fertility. To show this relationship and investigate the effect of children on FLFP, I construct three samples: one with families with one and more children (1+), another with two and more children (2+), and the third with three and more children (3+). In all these samples, families with more daughters than sons are more likely to have another child. In other words, presence of more girls relative to boys results in an increased likelihood of having another child. Considering this relationship, I construct an IV based on the sex composition of previous children to investigate the effect of fertility on FLFP by using dummies for the gender of the first child, the first two children, and the first three children in the samples of 1+, 2+, and 3+, respectively. As sex-selective abortion and infanticide are rare in Iran, I consider sex composition among children as essentially random. To support this claim, I follow Almond and Edlund (2008) by observing that sex ratio does not vary significantly with birth order parity and sex composition of the previous children. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first estimation of the effect of fertility on FLFP in Iran. While most empirical estimations of the effect of fertility on FLFP find a negative impact, which in most cases is less negative than its ordinary least squares (OLS) counterparts, I find no significant effect of children on the labor force participation of Iranian mothers in urban areas. This result is similar to Agüero and Marks (2008), who find an insignificant effect of fertility on FLFP in six Latin American countries. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In the next section, I present the data. In section ""Sex composition of children and fertility"", I describe the methodology and explain how fertility in Iran is influenced by the sex composition of previous children. Section ""Estimation results"" presents the results, and section ""Conclusion"" concludes.",11

4.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor & Development,29 January 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40175-014-0025-z,Economic development and female labor participation in the Middle East and North Africa: a test of the U-shape hypothesis,December 2015,Paolo Verme,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Studies on female labor market participation can be broadly divided into two groups: studies that look at the long-term factors that drive Female Participation Rates (FPR) over periods spanning decades and focus on epochal transformation of societies such as structural changes in the economy, and there are studies that use shorter time periods or simply cross-section information to derive associations between FPRs and other factors that can vary over the short-term such as education or marriage. To the first group belong studies that have been largely pioneered by Ester Boserup and Claudia Goldin. To the second group belong a wide variety of studies on female labor supply and participation. This paper will focus on the first body of literature. The prevalent hypothesis about the long-term relationship between economic development and FPRs is the U-shape hypothesis (Boserup, 1970, Durand, 1975; Psacharopoulos and Tzannatos, 1989; Goldin, 1995). This broadly states that during the early stages of economic development, FPRs decline due to the initial structural changes of the economy and the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized society, while it increases in later stages when countries mature into modern economies, fertility rates decline and female education rates increase. The literature points to essentially five factors explaining the U-shape hypothesis: 1) the economic transformation of societies from agriculture to industry; 2) the increasing share of the female educated population; 3) long-term demographic changes including falls in fertility rates; 4) cohorts effects; and 5) evolving gender norms and culture. Thanks to the increasing availability of long time-series, these factors and their role in explaining FPRs can now be tested for a wide variety of countries. The purpose of this paper is to test the U-shape hypothesis in the context of Middle East and North African (MENA) countries following the leads that the literature has provided across countries and within countries over the past thirty years. To our knowledge, there is only one short paper that recently tested the U-shape hypothesis in MENA countries (Tsani et al, 2013). This paper exploits the FPR statistical difference of this group of countries vis-à-vis other world countries to simulate with a Computerized General Equilibrium (CGE) model the outcome of alternative GDP growth and FPR scenarios. It finds potential beneficial effects on growth when removing region specific barriers to female participation. The present paper follows the more standard approach of testing the U-shape hypothesis with parametric and nonparametric methods and assesses each of the main factors behind the U-shape hypothesis one at a time. FPRs remain one of the puzzles in the development process of MENA countries. The 20 years that predated the Arab spring were characterized by tremendous structural transformation of the economies with stabilization, liberalization and privatization reforms starting in the 1990s, which delivered sustained growth throughout the first decade of the 2000s. This same period also saw unprecedented gains in female education accompanied by sharp falls in fertility rates. Yet, this period has also been characterized by moderate growth in terms of employment and FPRs, with women and youth being the two groups benefitting the least from the growth process. It is therefore compelling to take a long-term view of FPRs, and the factors that help explain FPRs, to better understand the roots of the anomaly represented by the MENA region. The paper is organized as follows. The next section reviews theory and evidence of the U-shape hypothesis. The following two sections describe models and data respectively. Section 2 presents results, and section 3 concludes. The prevalent hypothesis about the long-term relationship between economic development and FPR is the U-shaped hypothesis (Boserup, 1970, Durand, 1975; Psacharopoulos and Tzannatos, 1989; Goldin, 1995). This broadly states that during the early stages of economic development, FPRs decline due to the initial structural changes of the economy and the transition from an agricultural to an industrialized society. FPRs then increase in later stages when countries mature into modern economies, fertility rates decline and female education rates increase. This is how Goldin (1995) states the hypothesis: 
“Across the process of economic development the adult women's labor force participation rate is u-shaped. When incomes are extremely low and when certain types of agriculture dominate (…), women are in the labor force to a great extent. They are sometimes paid laborers but more often unpaid workers on family farms and in household businesses, often doing home workshop production. As incomes rise in most societies, often because of an expansion of the market or the introduction of new technology, women's labor force participation rates fall. Women's work is often implicitly bought by the family, and women then retreat into the home, although their hours of work may not materially change. (…) But as female education improves and as the value of women's time in the market increases still further, relative to the price of goods, they move back into the paid labor force, as reflected in the move along the rising portion of the U-shaped curve.” (p. 62) The U-shaped hypothesis has found consistent support in data and analyses since it was first proposed, and this applies to cross-country studies as well as to time-series and panel studies. Among cross-country studies, Goldin (1995) found this relationship to hold for 1980 and 1985 across a group of more than one hundred countries. Mammen and Paxson (2000) replicated Goldin’s results for 1980 and 1985 and extended the test to 1970 and 1975, reaching the same conclusion. This paper also pinpointed that the lowest participation rate is found for countries with annual per capita income around $2,500, essentially middle-income countries according to the World Bank classification of the time. Similar results have also been found by Tam (2011) for a panel of 134 countries for the period 1950-1980 and by Tsani et al. (2013) for South Mediterranean countries. Results from time-series studies in developed economies also support the U-shaped hypothesis. Goldin found initial evidence of the U-shape relation in a study on the US (Goldin, 1995). These results were confirmed in more recent studies (Goldin, 2004, 2006, Olivetti, 2013) that were also able to pinpoint five distinct phases characterizing the evolution of FPRs in the US. The first phase (“The independent female worker”, up to the 1920s) saw the entrance of young and low educated women into the labor force, mostly in poorly paid or non-paid occupations followed by a subsequent exit from the labor force explained by marriage and the shift to home work. In a second phase (1930s-1950) married women start to join the labor force due to the increased demand in clerical jobs and the increased level in female education. In the third phase (1950s-1970s), FPRs go through a real revolution, with rapid increases explained by better education of women, rising wages and the introduction of more flexible working arrangements such as part-time work. Time-series evidence for countries other than the US are still scarce, but similar results to the US have been found by Tilly and Scott (1987) for England and France. The U-shaped hypothesis has also been studied in developing economies with time-series data, although these series are typically much shorter than in developed economies. Mammen and Paxson (2000) provide some evidence for the U-shaped hypothesis in Thailand and India. Using cross-country longitudinal data with country fixed effects, these authors found the U-shaped relation to hold for the period 1970-1985 (although the turning point of the U curve lowers to $1,600). Only one recent paper has questioned the U-shaped hypothesis (Gaddis and Klasen, 2013). This paper used cross-country data for the period 1980-2005 and found that results related to the U-shape hypothesis are very sensitive to the data source used and that they tend to disappear with the use of panel data. The paper also finds a great heterogeneity of results across countries, little support for the structural change hypothesis from agriculture to industry as an important factor in driving declining FPRs and a more relevant role for sector specific growth rates as opposed to GDP growth. It recognizes, however, the role of fertility and education in explaining rising FPRs on the positive side of the U curve. While the declining portion of the U curve is mainly explained in terms of the structural transformation of the economy from agriculture to industry, the explanation of the rising part of the curve relies on a more complex combination of factors. Fertility has been among the first factors to be identified (Goldin 1995), a factor that found consistent evidence in subsequent studies (Angrist and Evans, 1998; Bloom et Al., 2009). Similarly, female education was detected early on as a major factor of rising FPRs (Goldin, 1995), and matching evidence was found over the years across countries. These two factors are also related to each other (female education delays marriage and pregnancies), so identifying the specific contribution of each factor on FPR is not straightforward. However, the evidence is rather solid in determining a correlation between fertility and education and FPRs cross-country and longitudinally. A more controversial set of factors relates to culture, gender norms and identity. Akerlof and Kranton (2000) made a convincing case of identity being a major driver in female labor participation: “Similarly women’s assumed lower desire for labor force participation (…) can be understood as the result of their identity as homemakers” (p. 732). Goldin (2006) indicated two major factors that could explain the gains in female labor participation in the US during the 1970s and 1980s described as “expanded horizons” (an increase in women’s expectations that leads to a change in educational choices) and “altered identities” (an increase in women’s decisional power in relation to labor market choices within the family). These changes were largely the product of a cultural revolution that revolutionized female marriage age, college graduation rates and professional school enrollments, all factors occurring in the 1970s. US data clearly show a turning point around 1970 followed by the fast increase in FPRs between 1970 and 2000. The factors that led to the cultural revolution of the 1960s may be debatable, but the effect of this revolution on FPRs is clearly evident in the US data. A recent World Bank report on gender equality in the Middle East and North Africa (World Bank, 2013) found FPR to be low in the region and the gap between male and female labor force participation to be the highest by world standards. The report did not test the U-shape hypothesis but finds some of its drivers to have developed in the expected direction during the past few decades. The performance of the MENA countries in terms of education and health has been outstanding, with major achievements in terms of declining fertility and mortality rates and in terms of steep improvements in female education. This makes low FPRs in the MENA region the most puzzling unless these countries find themselves at the turning point of the U curve. This paper returns to the U-shape hypothesis by focusing on MENA countries. To our knowledge, the only paper that tested the U-shape hypothesis in the MENA region is Tsani et al. (2013). This paper uses a pooled regression on 160 countries with the South-Mediterranean countries as the control and then uses the coefficient for these countries to carry out CGE simulations of alternative scenarios. In this paper, we follow a different approach using cross-country panel equations and within countries time-series equations, testing separately for cohorts effects, fertility rates and structural transformation of the economy away from agriculture. We will also test for the role of specific sectors as opposed to GDP in raising FPRs. We follow here the three most recent contributions to the literature of the U-shape hypothesis (Tam, 2011, Gaddis and Klasen, 2013 and Tsani et al., 2013). The standard equation used to test this hypothesis since the first paper by Goldin (1995) is as follows: where \( {y}_i \) is typically GDP per capita at Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), and i is a subscript for countries. This is a cross-country equation that is normally applied to one point in time and sometimes replicated over several points in time to test the robustness of results. Recent data and the availability of longer time-series within countries have allowed for adding a longitudinal dimension to the equation, turning the data into panel data as follows: where t represents time. Despite the time dimension and the panel data, Equation (2) is still a cross-section equation in that the coefficients measure the average change in FPR as GDP changes, ignoring the difference between time and country effects. In this case, findings consistent with the U-shape hypothesis essentially state that countries at different levels of development distribute over a U-curve, but nothing is said about the longitudinal shape of the FPR/GDP relation. To add the time dimension and, at the same time, account for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity, one should run the equation within countries (losing the sample size advantage provided by the multiple countries approach), use country fixed effects in equation (2) or, alternatively, use the first difference equation as follows: Equation (3) is still not optimal because if FPR varies little, lagged FPR is correlated with the error term and the regressors become endogenous. To overcome this last problem and control for endogeneity, one can run a linear dynamic panel data model, such as the Arellano and Bond (1991) model, estimated with a Generalized Method of Moments with Instrumental Variables (AB-GMM) – where the lagged FPR functions as an instrument as shown below with one lag. where \( {\mu}_i \) are the fixed effects, and \( {\vartheta}_{it} \) is the error term. The model in equation (4) accounts for endogeneity but does not account for autocorrelation. Similar estimators include the Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998) estimators, which can account also for autocorrelation. All these estimators are particularly suited for panel data where the number of points in time is smaller than the number of countries, which is the case of our data. However, the Blundell and Bond (1998) types of estimators assume that the instruments (lagged dependent variable) are uncorrelated with the individual effects (country/year). As in Gaddis and Klasen (2013), we find this assumption too restrictive and finally opt to use primarily model (4) for the panel equations. This is also the preferred choice in the recent literature. The shape of the FPR-GDP per capita relation may be different across group of countries and across individual countries in the MENA region. This is expected and explained by the fact that different groups of countries or individual countries may find themselves transiting on different parts of the U curve during the period considered. We are observing a historic segment of 23 years (1990-2012), which is a longer process of economic development and that segment could be located on different parts of the U curve. Therefore, we need to be cautious on how results of the equations illustrated are interpreted. A combination of significant coefficients of the type \( {\widehat{\beta}}_1<0\kern0.5em and\kern0.5em {\widehat{\beta}}_2>0 \) (-/+ for short) is consistent with a U-shape hypothesis, and this is what the literature considers as evidence of the hypothesis in a cross-country panel setting (see for example Gaddis and Klasen). However, this combination could represent a set of countries that just entered the saddle point of the curve. Vice-versa, a \( {\widehat{\beta}}_1>0\kern0.5em and\kern0.5em {\widehat{\beta}}_2<0 \) combination could indicate an inverted U-shape or a set of countries that have passed the saddle point of the U curve and are now experiencing a stagnation of FPRs. These are all cases that can potentially be consistent with a U shape hypothesis. Similarly, combinations of \( \widehat{\beta}>0\kern0.5em and{\widehat{\beta}}_2>0\kern0.5em \mathrm{or}\kern0.5em {\widehat{\beta}}_1<0\kern0.5em and\kern0.5em {\widehat{\beta}}_2<0 \) show accelerations of increasing and decreasing FPRs, respectively, which could be consistent with the long-term hypothesis if these were set of countries that found themselves on the two sides of the U curve. If the FPR equation is applied to a single country using a longitudinal time series, one has to be even more cautious. The U shape (-/+ signs) would show only for those countries which, during the 23 years considered, transited through the saddle point of the curve. This may not be easy to find in the MENA region because most of the MENA countries had already passed in 1990 (year 1 of our analysis) a GDP per capita of 2,5000 USD in PPP values, which is what the global literature found to be the turning point from declining to rising FPRs. This is part of the reason why the literature uses cross-country evidence when individual countries’ data series are too short. Hence, while we seek a combination of (-/+) signs for the panel regional regressions to test the U-shape hypothesis, we also need to understand how the individual countries’ longitudinal series contribute to shape the form of the curve at the regional level. A graph that combines longitudinal countries time series for all MENA countries will help us to understand the relationship between the within country longitudinal series and the cross-country MENA results. We will also consider time-series models for individual MENA countries. For this purpose we will use standard OLS models, test for stationarity and correct by instrumenting with lagged dependent variables (OLS-IV). We will also use a reduced version of the Granger model to test how a number of key variables underlying the U-shape hypothesis affect FPRs. The model is as follows: where X includes fertility rates, the share of agriculture in total value added, and value added in manufacturing and services. The number of lags of the dependent variable will depend on the stationarity test. The test used is the Breusch-Godfrey test for higher-order serial correlation. The data on FPRs are collected from the International Labor Organization Economically Active Population, Estimates and Projections (ILO-EAPEP) database. This is the same data used by the quasi totality of cross-country studies reviewed in the previous section. We use the latest edition available at the time of writing (6th edition, 2011). The rest of the data, including GDP per capita, fertility rates, female education and the share of agricultural value added, are taken from the World Bank open data repository. Additional file 1 provides a full description of the variables used, including the corresponding codes in the World Bank open repository. We have a total of 172 countries, and for all countries, we have 23 annual observations for the period 1990-2012 for both FPR and GDP per capita, with the exceptions of 20 countries where the minimum amount of observations is less than 23.1 We use therefore an unbalanced panel in the cross-country models.

The first is the release of raw data from the Palestine Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) at the turn of the century of the quarterly labor force survey, and the second is due to the conflict with Israel and the lack of progress in the peace process. Although Palestine is geographically a small area, it is far from being contiguous. Settlements and security zones inhibit rural urban migration, and as a result, we notice higher migration in the Gaza Strip than in the West Bank because Gaza is free of settlements (despite the blockade). Another unique feature of the Palestinian labor markets is the proximity to the Israeli labor market and the frequent interruptions to labor flows; this has considerable negative shocks to rural Palestine (mainly the West Bank as Gaza is blockaded). The vulnerability of the Palestinian rural population is compounded by a disproportionate share of employment in agriculture. In general, it is argued that rural wages are lower (among other things) because of the lower stock of human capital in rural Palestine. We argue that the disproportionate share of employment in agriculture coupled with higher share of employment in Israel is potentially contributing to the lower stock of human capital in rural areas. To improve the well-being of Palestinian rural areas, it is imperative to understand the dynamics of employment in agriculture and its effect on wages. The literature on wage gaps in labor economics cites three types of gaps: a gender wage gap in favor of males, an urban rural wage gap in favor of urban areas, and a sector wage gap in favor of non-agricultural jobs vis-à-vis agricultural jobs. The magnitude of such gaps varies with country and estimation technique. Hertz et al. (2008) provide estimates for the unexplained portion of the gap which can reach at least 30 % for the farm/non-farm wage employees and rise to 56 % in some cases. Their contention is that the urban-rural wage gap is higher where the probability of getting a job in urban centers remains low. Although early models of development conflated the terms rural and agricultural employment, the distinction has become more important in recent years. Winters et al. (2008) investigate whether wage employment in agriculture has potential in improving the well-being of rural areas for 14 countries. They find that investment in education and infrastructure are far more important for finding high-paying jobs than for choosing a particular sector. This distinction implies that the traditional view of rural workers having only the option to migrate because of the higher expected wage and greater probability of getting a job in the urban centers is no longer the only viable solution to rural workers. Rather, individuals have a choice in finding non-agricultural jobs in the rural areas. Gollin et al. (2014) applied improved measurements of inputs (human capital and hours worked) and outputs to find out that a sizable productivity gap still exists in agriculture. This suggests that moving workers out of agriculture shall improve productivity in agriculture and reduce the inefficiency of resource misallocation. In an earlier paper, Lagakos and Waugh (2009) argue that subsistence food requirements motivate low-productivity workers to self-select into agriculture. On the other hand, the urban/rural wage gap is partly shown to depend on spatial mobility (Lagakos et al. 2016) arguing that sorting and migration cost explain the spatial wage gap. In a recent article, Fallah and Daoud (2015) investigate the impact of restrictions imposed by the occupation authorities on area C, which falls directly under Israeli security jurisdiction, on wages; they find that there is an 8 % gap between area C and the other areas.Footnote 1 The restrictions include an almost complete ban on construction as well as limits on the movement of labor and goods among other measures. Area C is mostly rural; thus, one would expect lower wages resulting from the restrained labor demand. Their findings reveal a 13 % wage gap between rural and urban residents and that the area C gap is not mainly driven by Israeli restrictions, but rather “a rural character effect.” Prior to that, Daoud (2005) showed a much lower gap using 1999 and 2001 data. Depending on specification, the 1999 data showed that average wages in rural areas enjoyed a 1–2 % premium over urban dwellers. This gap turned negative (around −3 %) in 2001 with a higher negative impact for rural females over males. In addition, the closure of Israeli labor markets led to higher unemployment and lower wages. Our paper complements the literature in that it explores the role of employment in agriculture in the determination of wages for rural and non-rural workers. None of the reviewed works addresses this issue directly.Footnote 2 Therefore, the contribution of our paper is twofold: first, we find evidence that employment in agriculture has a bigger negative effect on wages for rural residents, and second, it is the first to apply the selection in agriculture in Palestine. The implications of these findings suggest that there is a stronger case for reallocating workers out of agriculture in rural Palestine. It is also evident that the Israeli labor market cannot be relied upon as a source of higher wages and employment in the long run as it may be responsible for the lower return to education particularly in rural areas. The present study is the first to consider rural labor market and self-selection into agriculture in Palestine. It shows the average daily wage distributions for rural and non-rural areas in the years 1999 and 2012. Figure 1 below suggests that the distributions are closer in 2012 compared to 1999 and a slight improvement for rural wages.Footnote 3 By controlling for migration (to the Israeli labor market), education, occupation, and other worker and industry characteristics, we aim to estimate the effect of employment in the agricultural sector on the rural and non-rural population and find out which factors affect the decision to select into agriculture. The distribution of average daily wage for rural and non-rural workers. The density functions excluded observations where average daily wage is greater than 250 NIS; this accounts for 59 observations out of 22,249 total for 1999 and 330 out of 19,445 for the year 2012 While the Israeli labor market has been shrinking its dependency on Palestinian workers since 1993 and more severely since 2000,Footnote 4 the Palestinian Authority (PA) has been opening opportunities for skilled workers in the public sector.Footnote 5 As a result, many rural workers ended up with government jobs, meanwhile taking part in casual agricultural work (Sayre 2001). The PA followed a policy of support to the agricultural sector to increase the resilience of the rural work force and to avoid land confiscation by Israel for settlement activities. However, employment in agriculture in rural Palestine is similar to many other developing countries in that it is seasonal, but it differs because it acts as a refuge for workers whose employment is disrupted due to political unrest. The rural population makes up 17 % of the total Palestinian population, which accounts for almost three quarters of a million people, thus making the impact of political as well as structural factors on wages and reallocation a large one. Our hypothesis is that the sector of employment matters significantly for rural wages. In particular, the rural population relies heavily on agriculture for employment and that may be responsible for the rural-non-rural wage gap. As the economy grows, reliance on agriculture as a sector of employment diminishes overtime; hence, one would expect a convergence of wages in the two areas (Hnatkovska and Lahiri 2013). Rural areas also depend more heavily on employment in Israel (where wages are higher), but the importance of this source of disparity has been diminishing overtime due to restriction on labor mobility by Israel. This may favor the wage convergence hypothesis which states that rural and non-rural wages will tend to converge as the agricultural share of employment gets smaller and access to the Israeli labor market becomes more restricted.

During the period that followed the Rose Revolution of 2003, the Georgian government implemented a broad set of reforms that entailed the restructuring of the public sector, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and sharp reductions in the costs of conducting business (Papava 2012). This period also coincided with the recession, which came on the heels of the 2008 financial crisis and the August War with Russia. Between 2004 and 2007, the Georgian economy expanded at an average annual growth rate of 9.3 %, in part buoyed by the growth of the state sector. In 2008, the growth slowed down to 2.3 %, and the Georgian economy entered a recession in 2009. Although output growth resumed after 2009, in 2011, the economy was still recovering from the impact of the crisis. These developments were bound to alter the gender balance in labor markets in Georgia. However, the direction of the changes in the gender wage gap at the mean and across the wage distribution during this period is ambiguous. Empirical evidence documenting the evolution of the gap across wage distribution in the transition region reflects this ambiguity.Footnote 1 Ganguli and Terrell (2005) find that the gender wage gap narrowed in Ukraine between 1986 and 2003 and that this decline was primarily caused by the reduction in the gender wage gap at the bottom of the distribution. Pignatti (2012) assesses a more recent 2003–2007 period in Ukraine and finds evidence of a further contraction, mostly in the upper part of the distribution, however, highlighting a shift that appears to have taken place between the two periods. The findings in Pham and Reilly (2007) reveal a contraction in the gender wage gap in Vietnam between 1993 and 2002. It is particularly pronounced at the top of the distribution, similar to Pignatti’s (2012) findings for Ukraine. Kecmanovic and Barrett (2011) find that the gender wage gap in Serbia contracted during 2001–2005, and the contraction appears to be uniform across the wage distribution. In contrast to the contraction in Ukraine, Vietnam, and Serbia, Pastore and Verashchagina (2011) demonstrate that the gender wage gap in Belarus more than doubled between 1996 and 2006 and did so mostly at the bottom of the distribution. Chi and Li (2008) evaluate the case of China between 1987 and 2004 and find that the gender wage gap widened during this time, also primarily at the bottom of the distribution.Footnote 2 Hence, the empirical evidence reveals a range of outcomes in the changes in the distribution of the gender wage gap in the transition region, underscoring the presence of a complex interplay between economic and institutional mechanisms. Our understanding of the dynamics of gender inequality in labor markets in Georgia and factors contributing to it is limited. During the 1990s, the gender wage gap at the mean appears to have widened (Yemtsov 2001). At the same time, the collapse that followed the dissolution of the Soviet Union also yielded coping strategies among women that raised their labor force participation rate in the first part of the 1990s as the corresponding rate for men declined. Jashi (2005) finds that, although Georgian women face formidable barriers to economic, political, and social opportunities, their access to these opportunities has improved. The decrease in the gender wage gap during the early 2000s potentially corroborates this argument with respect to the labor markets (Khitarishvili 2009). This paper is the first study to analyze changes in the gender wage gap in Georgia before and after the 2008 crisis and to evaluate them across the wage distribution. Conducting a distributional analysis enables us to assess the heterogeneity underlying the movements in the mean gender wage gap. This can allow us to assess whether economic forces affect low- and high-earning men and women differently. We employ the recentered influence function quantile decomposition method based on Firpo et al. (2007, 2009). This method decomposes the gap into the composition and wage structure effects for each of the explanatory variables at various percentiles of the wage distribution. This allows us to evaluate how the factors that influenced the gender wage gap differed before and after the recession. In addition, we use the decomposition approach developed in Ñopo (2008) to assess the degree to which nonoverlapping supports in the characteristics of men and women may influence our baseline results. Accounting for this possibility may be important in many settings and especially in economies such as Georgia’s, which exhibit high occupational and industrial segregation. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we present the data summary and analyze the changes that took place in the characteristics of wage workers in Georgia during 2004–2011. Section 3 outlines the implementation of the decomposition methods in Firpo et al. (2007) and Ñopo (2008). Section 4 presents the analysis of the determinants of the gender wage gap at the mean and across the wage distribution and contrasts the results before and after the recession. We discuss the implications of our study in the conclusions.",6

Rozo,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The young are the segment of the population that has the highest use of illegal drugs, marijuana, cigarettes, and alcohol. They also have the highest crime rates and make up the greatest proportion of crime victims.1 Consequently, in recent years, interest has grown in the field of economics for identifying the means to prevent at-risk young adults from engaging in risk behavior. For economists, a natural question is whether labor market incentives can prevent risk behavior (see a recent review by Blattman et al. 2015). However, little evidence currently exists on the causal effects of labor market incentives on risk behavior because of the difficulty in finding exogenous sources of variation on factors such as employment and income. Youth training programs have been widely implemented in developing countries to help disadvantaged young individuals find employment or improve their earnings (Kenneth and Palmer 2010). In that sense, it might be expected that, if youth training programs help young individuals in improving their economic conditions—as has been extensively documented by Card et al. (2011), Attanasio et al. (2011), Ibarrarán et al. (2012), Hirshleifer et al. (2015), Ibarrarán et al. (2015), and Kugler et al. (2015)—then they could possibly improve the risk behavior of this population. Because youth training programs primarily aim at improving participants’ employability, there is little evidence on their unintended effects on other outcomes such as risk behavior. This paper contributes to the literature in three main ways. First and foremost, it takes advantage of unique data from a randomized trial, to study the effects of youth training programs on risk behavior. Second, by relying on individual data, our paper overcomes the confounding biases of studies that employ regional aggregate data to study risk behavior. As suggested by Blattman et al. (2015), studies that employ aggregate regional data make it impossible to distinguish whether changes in individual decisions or on other market forces drive changes in risk behavior. For example, if a municipality experiences lower risk behaviors, it is not possible to determine if the individuals themselves are behaving differently or if the opportunities for risky activities are dropping. Since our analysis is based on surveys collected at the individual level, we are able to examine the direct effect of youth training programs on an individual’s decision to engage in risk behavior. Third, we study whether youth training programs may be more successful in deterring risk behavior for individuals with better socio-emotional skills. Our interest in these types of skills is motivated by recent findings on the strong correlation between socio-emotional skills and youth risk behavior (Blattman et al. 2015; Cook et al. 2014; Heller et al. 2015; Ludwig and Shah 2014). This correlation arises from two bases. First, recent findings suggest that youth discount the future more than adults (myopia), which prompts intrapersonal conflict between “selves.” This conflict is apparent in decisions made at separate times—a decision made by today’s self for tomorrow might differ from one made by tomorrow’s self. These limitations could lead to poor decision-making, particularly with regard to risk behaviors (JPAL 2013). Young individuals with higher socio-emotional skills have also lower myopia, which could allow them to make better decisions and vice versa. The importance of socio-emotional skills is also supported by findings in neuroscience that demonstrate the malleability of the prefrontal cortex—the region of the brain in charge of emotions and self-regulation—until the early twenties and the strong association between the development of the prefrontal cortex with preventing risk behavior (Almlund et al. 2011; Cunha et al. 2006; Heckman 2008). Hence, it is likely that higher levels of employment and income (induced by the participation in youth training programs) could have differential effects on youth risk behavior based on their heterogenous socio-emotional skills. We use experimental data from the youth training program Galpão. The program was designed to improve the employment and earnings of at-risk youth living in the Favelas in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The program’s sole main objective was to improve the employability of young marginalized adults. Galpão was not intended to reduce the risk behavior of the treatment recipients directly. Calero et al. (2015) evaluated the impact of the program on earnings and employment. In contrast to other interventions that show modest effects from these types of programs (see Kenneth and Palmer 2010), Galpão was effective in increasing employment and earnings. We use the exogenous source of variation induced by the experiment to examine the effects of youth training programs on risk behavior. Brazil presents an interesting context for studying youth risk behavior because it ranks 11th among 90 countries in the rate of firearm-related deaths, with 21.9 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants (Waiselfisz 2015). Victims of this violence are more likely to be among the young, and youth violence has shown a sharp increase in the last three decades. According to Waiselfisz (2015), the homicide rate by firearms rose from 12.8 to 47.6 per 100,00 inhabitants between 1980 and 2012—an increase of 271.8 % (see Fig. 1). Higher rates of violence have also exposed youth to other types of risks. For instance, the use of illegal drugs (e.g., marijuana or cocaine) has also increased in recent years among the young,2 and criminal organizations continually recruit young individuals, particularly those with low income, little education, and no religious attachment (Carvalho and Soares 2013).
 Brazilian mortality rate from firearms per 100,000 inhabitants (1980–2012). Notes: Mortality rates come from Waiselfisz 2015
 We find no evidence that the program was successful in directly reducing risk behaviors such as smoking, casual alcohol consumption, hard drug consumption, or crime victimization, despite increasing employment for treatment recipients. We were not able, however, to rule out significant effects of the program on high alcohol consumption and fight participation. We also check if the program had a significant effect on socio-emotional skills, but we find no evidence of such an effect. We then proceed to examine if the program had differential effects on treatment recipients who had heterogeneous levels of socio-emotional skills. We find that individuals with higher socio-emotional skills who participated in the program, reduced their alcohol consumption and had lower crime victimization. When analyzing which type of personality traits (socio-emotional skills) is more important in predicting risk behavior, we find that consistency of interests and empathy show the highest correlation with all measurements of risk behavior. Consistency of interest is defined as the capacity of maintaining constant interest in goals and projects and keeping stability in their actions and thoughts concerning goal achievement (Duckworth and Quinn 2009). Empathy measures the capacity to understand and accept other individuals, to consider their point of view, as well as showing respect for opinions which differ to your own (Brea 2010). These findings suggest that consistency of interest and empathy should receive higher emphasis when trying to modify the risk behavior of young individuals. From a policy perspective, our results suggest that reducing risk behavior for youth may go beyond offering youth training programs, helping them find a job, and subsequently increasing their income. In particular, socio-emotional skills have a crucial role in guiding an individual’s decision to engage in a risk behavior. Hence, further efforts should be directed at understanding how socio-emotional skills can be improved more efficiently.3
 We contribute to two groups of literature. First, we contribute to the literature on the link between income and risk behavior. Most of the relevant work in this area focuses on the associations between poverty, violent crime, and conflict (see Bazzi and Blattman 2014; Berman and Couttenier 2015; Dube and Vargas 2013; Iyer and Topalova 2014; Miguel et al. 2004). Most of these studies show that unexpected negative changes in income or unemployment increase violent crime and conflict. We instead analyze the effects of a positive income shock (caused by higher employment due to the youth training program) on risk behavior of young adult men. Second, we contribute to the group of studies that examine the unintended effects of youth training programs. The most closely related papers in this area are Ibarrarán et al. (2012) and Novella and Ripani (2014), who study the training program Juventud y Empleo. The former is a preliminary exploration on the effects of the program on teenage pregnancy rates; it finds small but significant effects. The latter examines the effect of the program on teenage pregnancy in more detail. The authors report that the program effectively reduces teenage pregnancy rates, particularly for teenagers with higher self-esteem scores.4
 The rest of the paper is structured in six additional sections. Section 2 describes the program, Section 3 describes the data, and Section 4 presents the research methodology. Section 5 studies the effects of the program on risk behavior. Section 6 studies the heterogeneous effects of the program by socio-emotional skills. It also studies which personality traits (non-cognitive behavior) are better predictors of risk behavior. Finally, the last section presents the conclusions.",5

Constraints to firm transition in the Indian informal manufacturing sector,December 2016,Rajesh SN Raj,Kunal Sen,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The predominant type of firms in developing countries is small family firms and the self-employed in the informal sector, which contribute to the bulk of production and employment in the economy (Gollin 2008).Footnote 1 These firms tend to be the least productive among all firms in the manufacturing sector, and the individuals that own, manage and work in these enterprises comprise a large proportion of the urban working poor in developing countries. The majority of these firms are not able to grow in size and make the transition to larger firms which employ non-family wage labour (De Neve 2005; Woodruff 2012). Yet, the difference in productivity between small family firms and the larger firms employing wage labour is large—in India's case, larger firms in the informal sector, employing 6–10 wage workers are 40 % more productive than small family firms with no wage workers (Raj and Sen 2016). The preponderance of small family firms located in the informal sector of developing economies is an important reason why aggregate productivity in these economies remains so low, relative to that of advanced market economies (Hsieh and Klenow 2009). For many informal household enterprises, the transition to larger enterprises in the informal sector could be a route out of poverty, as well as providing employment for a large proportion of unskilled workers in urban and semi-urban areas.Footnote 2
 What explains why some family firms can make the transition to larger firms in the informal sector and others cannot? The determinants of firm growth in the informal sector of developing countries remain less understood, with much of the previous literature focusing on firm growth in the formal sector (Gang 1992; Variyam and Kraybill 1992). A wide set of factors has been seen as constraints to small firm growth in the formal sector, such as the lack of access to external finance (Mead and Liedholm 1998; Rijkers et al. 2010), the lack of capabilities in small firms that allow them to compete with large firms (Arend 2014; Schmitz 1982), the lack of access to networks and locational disadvantages (Mean 1984; Schmitz and Nadvi 1999; Rijkers et al. 2010), human capital (Nafziger and Terrell 1996; Burki and Terrell 1998) and infrastructural constraints (Aterido et al. 2011). In this paper, we assess the role of financial constraints, firm capabilities, location and geographical factors, and infrastructure and human capital in explaining the transition of firms in the informal sector from small family firms to larger firms employing wage labour. Our empirical context is the Indian informal manufacturing sector. The formal manufacturing sector in India is taken to be definitionally equivalent to the organised sector, which comprises firms that are registered under the Factories Act of 1948 of the Government of India (Kulshreshtha 2011). Firms have to register with the Indian government under the Factories Act if they employ ten or more workers and use electricity in their operations, or if they employ 20 or more workers without the use of electricity in their operations (Pais 2008). The Factories Act regulates the conditions of work in the formal manufacturing sector, including minimum safety, sanitary, health and welfare standards, as well as stipulating regulations on hours of work, leave with wages and holiday provisions for workers, which employers in the formal sector need to follow or face stiff penalties (NCEUS 2009). The informal manufacturing sector, by default, comprises firms that fall outside the scope of the Factories Act; they generally do not pay taxes and are outside the purview of government regulations (Kanbur 2011).Footnote 3
 The informal sector is very large in India, with about 75 per cent of manufacturing employment and 17 per cent of manufacturing output in the sector, and the majority of firms (about 86 per cent) in the Indian informal sector are family firms (NCEUS 2007; Mazumdar and Sarkar 2008; Raj and Sen 2016). The firms in the informal manufacturing sector in India range from pure household enterprises (PHEs), which are very small in size, to slightly larger enterprises using both family and non-family labour, which we call mixed household enterprises (MHEs), to even larger enterprises employing mostly non-family labour, which we call non-household enterprises (NHEs). We use firm-level data drawn from representative all-India surveys of informal firms in the Indian manufacturing sector which are repeated cross sections for the years 2000–2001, 2005–2006 and 2010–2011 to examine firm transition in the Indian informal sector—that is, the extent to which access to finance, firm capabilities, infrastructure, and human capital can explain the likelihood of a firm being a MHE or NHE as compared to a PHE. In contrast to the evidence available from earlier studies, we find a lesser role for financial constraints in explaining the likelihood of a firm being a larger firm employing wage workers as compared to a small family firm. According to our study, firm capabilities significantly matter in explaining whether firms are more likely to be MHEs and NHEs rather than PHEs. We find that firms which maintain accounts and firms that are registered under any act or authority are more likely to make the transition to larger firms employing non-family labour. Our results also confirm the crucial role of location, infrastructure and human capital in determining whether a firm is a MHE or a NHE versus a PHE in the informal sector. The likelihood of a firm being in the MHE and NHE categories is higher among firms that are located in urban areas and those that are located  closer to the state capital. We also find that transition is faster among firms that have access to better infrastructure, especially power. Our finding on the positive effect of education beyond the secondary level supports the crucial role of human capital on firm transition. The rest of the paper is in five sections. In the next section, we provide a brief discussion of the literature on the possible determinants of firm transition in the informal sector. In Section 3, we discuss the data, describe our econometric methodology and discuss the empirical specification. Section 4 provides an array of descriptive statistics and presents the results of the empirical analysis. Section 5 concludes.",2

Although significant progress has been made in reducing gender disparities in health and educational outcomes, economic opportunities remain limited for women. In particular, existing research suggests that variation in women’s labor force participation is associated with changes in individual and household behavior on several fronts including marriage (viz., van der Klaauw 1996), fertility (viz., Goldin and Katz 2002), and intra-household resource allocation (viz., Luke and Munshi 2011). Thus, the policy priority of closing the gender differences in access to economic opportunities is critical not only for reducing poverty but also for improving individual and household welfare in developing countries. In this paper, we exploit the exogenous, temporal sub-district level variation in the intensity of implementation of India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS) to identify shifts in rural women’s participation in the labor market and its impact on their children’s educational outcomes. The scheme operationalized the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (2005) by providing a legal guarantee for up to 100 days of annual employment at a predetermined wage rate to rural households willing to supply manual labor on local public works.Footnote 1 From a gender perspective, there are two interesting features of this program. First, the wage rate offered in the scheme is uniform across gender, and second, it gives priority to female employment on public works and mandates one third of the program beneficiaries to be women. Thus, NREGS not only brings employment opportunities to rural women’s doorstep but the equal wage rates provided in the program can also reduce any gender disparity prevalent in the rural labor markets. A change in parental labor supply could affect children’s educational outcomes purely due to an income effect. However, labor force participation of mothers, per se, could impact her children’s education through additional channels. First, mothers are likely to have more alternative uses of their time than fathers—market work, household chores, and leisure. If children’s time in doing household chores substitutes for mother’s time, then an increase in labor force participation of mothers may lead to a decline in the educational attainment of her children. However, if the mother’s and children’s time are not close substitutes and child care services in the market are either unavailable or unaffordable, then it is possible that schools substitute for child care services and children attend school when mothers are at work. Note, however, that this mechanism is unlikely to hold if child care services are available within the household through the presence of older members (viz., grandparents). Second, a working mother’s say in household resource allocation decisions may be greater due to her higher earned income. Existing research suggests that this is likely to have a positive effect on her children’s schooling. If an increase in mother’s earned income translates into greater weight being attached to her preferences in resource allocation decisions of the household and mothers prefer to invest more in their children’s health and education relative to fathers (Blumberg 1988; Thomas 1990; Hoddinott and Haddad 1995; Quisumbing and Maluccio 2003), then we should see an improvement in child outcomes. In this paper, we focus on the latter two channels of impact of mother’s labor supply decisions on her children’s education. We, therefore, control for changes in household level income to account for any income effect. The net impact of mother’s participation in the labor force on her children’s time allocation and, thereby, schooling, would then depend on which of the two effects dominate—the negative substitution effect or the positive bargaining power effect.Footnote 2
 There exists relatively little empirical research on the impact of parental labor supply on children’s time allocation, particularly in a developing country context. Skoufias (1993) shows that an increase in female wages (and thereby female labor supply) in rural India reduces the time in school significantly but only for girls. Similar results are found by Grootaert and Patrinos (1999) in a cross-country study. However, Ilahi (1999) does not find any impact of female wages on children’s time use in Peru. In contrast to the sparse literature on time allocation effects, there is considerable empirical evidence suggesting that households’ resource allocation decisions are made in a “collective” or a bargaining framework where the final allocation usually depends on the bargaining power or weights attached to the preferences of the members of the household. The importance of labor income as a determinant of women’s bargaining power within the household has been highlighted by Anderson and Eswaran (2009). Using data from Bangladesh, the authors show that the effect of earned income on female autonomy is far greater than that of unearned income. Women who work on the household farm have no more autonomy than those who are housewives, while those who earn independent income have considerably greater autonomy. Luke and Munshi (2011) exploit data from tea plantations in South India where women are employed in permanent wage labor to find that a relative increase in female income has a positive effect on their children’s education. Qian (2008) shows that a change in agricultural pricing policy in post-Mao China, which increased female labor income, raised the educational attainment of all children within the household. However, when the policy increased male labor income, educational attainment of girls decreased but had no effect on boys’ attainment. We utilize child and household level panel data for 2007 and 2009–2010 from the Young Lives Study in the state of Andhra Pradesh to assess the effect of mother’s participation in the labor force on three educational outcomes of her children—time spent in school, enrolment, and grade attainment. To identify exogenous shifts in mothers’ labor force participation, we take advantage of the temporal, sub-district level variation in the implementation of the NREGS. Our identification strategy utilizes the lagged amount of funds allocated for the implementation of the NREGS as well as lagged rainfall shocks within sub-districts as exogenous shifters of labor force participation of women in rural areas. The analysis accounts for unobservable child characteristics, age cohort trends, and differences in time trends by initial levels of economic development, both at the district both the sub-district level. Our results suggest that participation of mothers in the workforce results in more time spent in school by their children. Almost half of the rise in children’s time in school can be accounted by an increase in the probability of a child being enrolled in school when the mother works. Further, this increase in school participation is reflected in higher grade attainment of children. Labor force participation by the mother reduces the gap between the child’s actual and ideal grade by more than 40 percentage points. Our results are robust to the inclusion of a host of other variables that account for alternative explanations for the improved educational attainment of children: changes in fathers’ labor force participation, creation of household assets, migration, impact on private wages, and increased supply or demand for public schools arising from NREGS beneficiaries’ heightened awareness of their entitlements. In order to understand the mechanisms through which these effects occur, we exploit household level data on education expenditures and on household members’ say in decision-making and control over income from various sources. The analysis of panel data on household level expenditures shows that mother’s participation in the workforce significantly increased the share of education in total household expenditure of less landed households. Moreover, cross-sectional two-stage least squares (2SLS) analysis suggests that the probability that mothers have a say or control over utilization of household earnings from different sources increases when they participate in the labor force. These results suggest that greater weightage on working mothers’ preferences in household decision-making could be among the primary drivers of the improvements in educational attainment of their children. While we cannot completely rule out the possibility that schools serve as child care centers while mothers work, this mechanism cannot account for all of our results: the impact of mother’s labor force participation on children’s time spent in school is robust to the presence of older members or potential child care givers in the household and is equally significant for older children who are relatively less likely to require child care services than the young. Our findings can, hence, be explained within the framework of a bargaining model of household resource allocation. This study not only informs us about the relevance of women’s labor supply to intra-household outcomes but it also addresses the broader policy issue of the role of the design of public programs in improving household outcomes in developing countries. Specifically, our paper extends the debate on the effect of workfare programs on household and individual welfare (Jalan and Ravallion 2003; Azam 2012; Dasgupta 2013; Zimmermann 2014; Klonner and Oldiges 2014; Imbert and Papp 2015) and finds evidence which suggests that mandating women’s participation in public programs has consequences beyond those immediately intended by policy makers. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the methodology used in this paper. Section 3 discusses the results and Section 4 concludes.",50

A typical purpose of minimum wage policies is to support low-wage workers and thereby fight inequality and poverty (Belser and Rani 2015). Less frequently, minimum wage policies are advocated as a means to correct imperfections in the labor market, regarding employers’ monopsony power in particular (e.g., Boal and Ransom 1997). However, the effectiveness of the minimum wage in achieving these goals is highly contested. From the theoretical viewpoint, the standard labor supply and demand model suggests that the minimum wage may increase unemployment, especially among low-skilled workers (Stigler 1946). There are also concerns that the minimum wage promotes informalization of the labor market, which is particularly relevant in the developing world. Moreover, the benefits of the minimum wage in monopsonistic environments have been questioned in a number of recent contributions, such as Danziger (2010). The empirical evidence regarding the employment effects of the minimum wage remains contradictory and inconclusive. For example, the seminal symposium published in the Industrial and Labor Relations Review (ILLR) in 1992 provided highly conflicting results regarding this issue. The estimated effect of the minimum wage on the employment of less-skilled workers ranged from negative (Neumark and Wascher 1992) and zero (Card 1992) to positive (Katz and Krueger 1992). This controversy continues to date. For example, Dube et al. (2010) find no disemployment effects in restaurants and other low-wage sectors in the USA, Dolton et al. (2012) report no or a small positive impact of the minimum wage on employment in the UK, while Sen et al. (2011) find significant disemployment effects among teens in Canada. As the most comprehensive survey of the literature up to 2006, the review study by Neumark and Wascher (2008) concludes that the minimum wage has a negative effect on the employment opportunities of less-skilled workers and no effect on overall employment. However, Belman and Wolfson (2014, p. 15) point out that the estimated effects of the minimum wage “are either statistically nonsignificant or are too small in magnitude to be economically meaningful”. Most empirical papers in this field commonly focus on relatively small increases in the nominal minimum wage, typically below 20 %. For instance, in the USA, the magnitude of the federal minimum wage hikes examined in empirical studies—including those published in the 1992 special issue of ILLR—did not exceed 30 %. Similarly, each of the regular increases in the UK minimum wage between 1999 and 2007 did not exceed 15 % (Dolton et al. 2012). It is plausible that the absence of robust evidence regarding the employment effects of the minimum wage stems from this particular feature of the empirical literature. Indeed, from the theoretical viewpoint, employers’ adjustment costs may deter them from laying off low-wage workers in response to a small increase in the minimum wage. From the estimation perspective, small variation in the minimum wage can complicate econometric identification, especially when minimum wage hikes are regular and expected or when there are measurement errors in the data. In this paper, we present new evidence on the employment effects of a large increase in the minimum wage. We take advantage of a natural experiment that occurred in Russia in September 2007 when a comprehensive reform of the minimum wage setting was introduced. Firstly, the federal minimum wage was sharply raised from 1100 to 2300 Rubles.Footnote 1 Secondly, the minimum wage setting was decentralized with regions receiving the right to set their own regional minima above the federal floor. Some regions made use of this opportunity instantaneously, whereby the minimum wage in these regions increased by much more than the 109 % implied by the federal law. With over 80 regions being characterized by very diverse economic conditions—including employment and wages—and abrupt changes in its economic policy, Russia provides a very good laboratory for studying the economic consequences of the minimum wage. To estimate the impact of the 2007 increase in the minimum wage on employment, we rely on the methodological approach proposed by Card (1992). It is based on comparing labor market outcomes before and after the minimum wage change across regions with different fractions of affected workers (namely, workers earning between the old and new minimum wages). This approach has found many applications in the empirical literature, both in the USA (e.g., Card and Krueger 1995; Wessels 2007) and internationally (e.g., Bazen and Skourias 1997 for France and Stewart 2002 for the UK). The main strength of this paper is the use—for identification purposes—of the unique data with extremely large variation in the minimum wage as well as labor market outcomes across 85 regions of Russia. Our study is among the first to exploit this quasi-experimental setting—and the 2007 reform in particular—in analyzing the labor market effects of the minimum wage.Footnote 2 Another strength of the paper is its focus on a broad range of labor market outcomes, including not only employment and unemployment rates among various sub-groups in the population but also informal employment. We argue that data from post-transitional Russia—a country that combines essential features of developed and developing economies—are particularly well suited for studying the effect of the minimum wage on such multiple outcomes. The main results of the paper can be summarized as follows. We find some evidence of adverse effects of the minimum wage on employment. Specifically, the 2007 minimum wage hike was associated with a decrease in youth employment and increased informality. The result is largely driven by regions that introduced their own minimum wages above the federal floor. We attribute the latter to the larger magnitude of the minimum wage hikes in these regions compared to those that simply adopted the federal minimum wage. Another possibility is that the regional increases in the minimum wage were less anticipated than the federal one, whereby it was impossible for employers to adjust to them in advance. Importantly, the results are in line with the findings in Muravyev and Oshchepkov (2013), which adopts the region panel data approach (e.g., Neumark and Wascher 1992) to studying the effect of the minimum wage on employment in Russia. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the institutional background of the minimum wage setting in Russia. Section 3 outlines the methodology of our empirical analysis. Section 4 describes the data, before Section 5 presents and discusses the empirical results. Finally, Section 6 concludes.",12

In their survey of the literature, Schneider and Enste (2000) find that at the beginning of the 1990s in most countries in Africa, Asia and Central and South America the informal sector accounted for over half of aggregate GDP. A leading example of the prevalence of informal markets is Latin America, where by the end of the 1990s the size of the informal sector accounted for 40–50 % of the labour force (Maloney 1999; Attanasio et al. 2004). The expansion of the informal sector is a response to weak institutions and a burdensome regulatory environment. A growing literature has shown that countries with poorly functioning institutions, labour rigidities, a heavy tax burden and high levels of corruption tend to have large informal sectors (Loayza 1996; Johnson et al. 1998; Botero et al. 2004; Vuletin 2009) and lower aggregate welfare (Meghir et al. 2015). Therefore, unsurprisingly, the bigger the informal sector, the lower the level of economic development. Pratap and Quintin (2006) find that informal output represents 10–15 % of GDP in most high-income countries, compared to 25–80 % in most low- and middle-income countries. While several studies have documented the expansion of the informal sector, few have noted that changes in the size of this sector tend to move together with changes in wage inequality. An example of this trend is Latin America, where in the 1990s most countries experienced significant changes both in informality and in wage inequality. Among Latin American countries, Mexico provides an interesting setting to study the relationship between wage inequality and informality since the co-movement between changes in the share of the informal workers and in wage inequality was particularly evident. Binelli and Attanasio (2010) present a descriptive analysis showing how in the 1990s changes in informality tracked closely changes in wage inequality: in the first half of the 1990s, both the proportion of workers employed in the informal sector and wage inequality increased, reached a peak in 1995 and decreased afterwards. The descriptive evidence presented by Binelli and Attanasio (2010) is interesting but is neither complete nor informative of the direction of causation. First, how did the changes in informality contribute to the changes in wage inequality? In particular, how much of the change in overall wage inequality is due to changes in wage inequality within formal and informal workers relative to changes in wage inequality between formal and informal workers? Second, what is the mechanism through which changes in informality affected changes in wage inequality? In the mid-1990s, Mexico was hit by a severe financial crisis, the peso crisis, which resulted in substantial income and consumption losses (Mckenzie 2001), a massive devaluation of the national currency (Whitt 1996) and an increase in wage inequality (Verhoogen 2008). Was the increase in informality one of the channels through which the peso crisis affected wage inequality? In other words, did the peso crisis affect informality and, via this, wage inequality? In order to answer these questions, I first compute a wage inequality decomposition to quantify the change in overall wage inequality that is due to changes in wage inequality within formal and informal workers relative to changes in wage inequality between formal and informal workers, and I then assess the impact of the peso crisis on the share of informal workers and, via this, on wage inequality. In particular, I propose a simple mechanism of a direct effect of informality on wage inequality by using the peso crisis as an instrumental variable. The peso crisis of the mid-1990s acted as an exogenous macroeconomic shock that hit the Mexican economy and resulted in a significant rise in unemployment among formal workers. Mexico has no programme of unemployment compensation, so only those with some economic comfort can afford to be unemployed (Martin 2000). For the majority of the jobless workers, the informal sector became the only viable option, and, consistently, the data show that the proportion of workers employed in the informal sector sizably increased. While in the formal sector wages are kept stable by collective bargaining and employment protection legislation, in the informal sector wages are lower and unregulated, thus more flexible by design. An increase in the proportion of informal workers therefore increased aggregate wage inequality. Both the results of the wage inequality decomposition and the instrumental variable regressions provide supportive evidence that in Mexico the increase in informality resulted in higher wage inequality. The empirical analysis provides a research strategy and framework to assess the impact of informality on wage inequality, which could be tested in other countries to assess the robustness of the findings in different settings and labour market institutions. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data; Section 3 performs a within-between formal and informal workers’ decomposition of the Theil index of wage inequality; Section 4 reviews the previous literature on informality and wage inequality, and discusses how the peso crisis affected informality and, via this, wage inequality. Section 5 presents the empirical strategy, the main results and a detailed discussion of robustness checks. Section 6 briefly concludes. The Appendix includes all tables and figures.",13

To further analyze the role of specific human capital, labor economists have estimated the returns to employer, occupation, and industry tenure. In the USA, pioneering work by Altonji and Shakotko (1987) has used an instrumental variable strategy to correct for endogeneity when estimating the returns to employer tenure. Subsequent work has investigated the importance of industry, occupation, and employer-specific human capital in determining wage growth (Altonji and Shakotko, 1987; Parent, 2000; Kambourov and Manovskii, 2009). The most recent work concludes that general labor market experience and occupation tenure are the most important contributors to wage growth in the USA (Kambourov and Manovskii, 2009; Sullivan, 2010). Little is known about how human capital accumulation affects wage growth in developing countries. A dearth of adequate panel data with labor market histories is to blame for this gap in the literature. This paper contributes to filling this gap by estimating for the first time the returns to potential experience, employer tenure, occupation, and industry in a developing country, Indonesia. Furthermore, when investigating the sources of wage growth in developing countries, it is important to consider the role of the informal sector as a factor that differentiates jobs. Indeed, in developing countries, the informal sector typically employs a large share of the labor force. While the share of workers employed informally is less than 10 % in developed economies, it is as high as 60 % in the developing world (Bacchetta et al., 2009). A job in the same occupation and industry may be quite different and require different skills depending on its formality status. For example, let us examine the case of a salesperson in the retail industry. A formal salesperson job will typically be in a larger shop and will consist of assisting wealthier customers and handling credit card purchases. In contrast, an informal salesperson is likely to work on the street, trying to attract customers while at the same time avoiding potential police harassment. More generally, we can expect formal jobs to use a more modern, more capital intensive, production technology. The substantial size of the informal sector and the distinctive characteristics of formal and informal jobs imply that, in addition to employer, occupation, and industry, sector-specific human capital is likely to matter in determining wage growth in developing countries. Determining whether sector-specific human capital contributes to wage growth in developing countries is important for two reasons. First, formality comes with social benefits, such as minimum wage, health insurance, and pensions. Formal sector workers have to pay taxes to enjoy these social benefits, so the formal sector is unattractive for workers who value these benefits at less than their cost. In addition to these tax disincentives to switching to formality, informal workers may lose their sector-specific human capital when they switch to formality. On the other hand, formal workers may choose to remain formal despite tax disincentives so as to benefit from the returns to their formality-specific human capital. Therefore, estimating the magnitude of sector-specific returns will improve our understanding of workers’ sector attachment. Second, estimating the returns to sector tenure is also important to design better public policies. Indeed, when informality is high, governments lose tax revenue and state capacity is eroded. For these reasons, many governments in developing countries are interested in policies that can increase formality. The presence of formality and informality-specific human capital offers both challenges and opportunities for the design of such policies. On the one hand, if there is informality-specific human capital, it will be hard to persuade older informal workers to switch to the formal sector and renounce the benefits of their informality-specific human capital. On the other hand, positive returns to formality-specific human capital open the possibility that a temporary subsidy to formality will yield a persistent long-run increase in formality. In this paper, we estimate the returns to employer, occupation, industry, and sector tenure in Indonesia. We use the instrument developed by Altonji and Shakotko (1987) and used by Parent (2000) and Kambourov and Manovskii (2009) to estimate returns to tenure using the Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS). The panel structure of the data allows us to construct respondents’ employment history between 1988 and 2007. We find that the 10-year return to employer tenure is 24 % and the returns to potential experience are 18 %. Once we include occupation, industry, and sector tenure, we find that the returns to employer tenure and potential experience remain significant and of similar magnitude, while there is no significant return to sector tenure. However, when we allow the returns in the formal sector to differ from the returns in the informal sector, we find that the returns are much higher in the formal sector. All else equal, the 10-year return to formal sector tenure is 35 %, while there is no significant return to tenure in the informal sector. This paper makes two key contributions to the literature. First, it provides the first detailed estimates of the return to general and specific human capital for a developing country using an estimation strategy that has been broadly used for developed countries. This allows us to compare the sources of wage growth across developed and developing countries. We find that, contrary to what was found for the USA (Altonji and Shakotko, 1987; Altonji and Williams, 2005; Beffy et al., 2006; Sullivan, 2010), the returns to employer tenure are higher than the returns to experience in Indonesia. The fact that the returns to experience are lower in Indonesia than in the USA is consistent with the broader pattern of lower returns to experience in poorer countries uncovered by Lagakos et al. (2012). Furthermore, in Indonesia, the returns to employer tenure are essentially unaffected if we allow for returns to industry and occupation tenure, which is again different from the results found on US data (Kambourov and Manovskii, 2009; Sullivan, 2010). Second, we show that returns to formal sector tenure are very important and are in fact the most important source of wage growth in Indonesia. This result suggests that workers in the formal sector enjoy substantially higher wage growth than their informal counterparts. Policies aiming at increasing the formalization of the economy should take into account the high returns to formal sector tenure; this suggests that incentives for formality should be targeted to younger workers to allow them to acquire formality-specific human capital. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the institutional background. Section 3 describes the data, and Section 4 describes the estimation strategy. Section 5 presents and discusses the results. Section 6 concludes.",3

(2007) estimate that more than 200 million children under 5 years of age fail to reach their potential in cognitive development because of poverty, poor health and nutrition, and deficient care. The positive correlation between health and education has also been highlighted by a number of empirical economic studies (see Grossman and Kaestner (1997) for a review). This correlation is robust even after controlling for different measures of socio-economic status, such as income and race, and regardless of whether health levels are measured by mortality rates, self-reported health status, or physiological indicators of health. More recently, Mayer-Foulkes (2003) provides evidence from Mexico that childhood nutrition and health as well as parental education have substantial and possibly increasing returns in the acquisition of education as measured by school permanence. The poor are less able to invest in human capital, and constituent elements for a low human capital trap or for a prolonged transition in intergenerational human capital accumulation are present in Mexico. The correlation between health and educational attainment has also been tackled theoretically. For instance, Edwards and Grossman (1977) develop a model of childhood health and cognitive development to study the effect of parents’ income and other variables on a child’s subsequent health and cognitive development. Their model is developed on the lines of analyses of inter-generational transfers (e.g., Becker (1967, 1974)) and allows them to analyze whether poor health in childhood adversely affects cognitive development of the child. Their key insight is that to understand the behavior of parents with respect to the child’s health and development, it is important to distinguish low-income families from high-income families. In a recent paper, Galor and Mayer-Foulkes (2002) develop an overlapping generation model in which they focus on the effects of minimal health requirements for acquiring an education. They show that when families do not have enough resources to invest in the satisfaction of basic needs and health care, and finance is not available for this purpose, a poverty trap may exist with low health, education, and income. This approach adds to the literature that explains the persistence of poverty through the presence of credit constraints. However, both Edwards and Grossman (1977) and Galor and Mayer-Foulkes (2002) make no assumption that the returns to investment in child health and cognitive development are stochastic. Consequently, their approach is inappropriate in an environment of insurance market failures. An entire branch of development economics deals with the effect of widespread risk and market failures on investment decisions by poor households in developing countries. It is argued that uninsured risk is a cause rather than just being an aspect of poverty. A number of studies have found that in the presence of uninsured risk, investment decisions by households will be inefficient. For instance, Jacoby and Skoufias (1997) estimate the effect of financial market imperfections on child school attendance using panel data from India. They find that seasonal fluctuations in school attendance are a form of self-insurance, i.e., households withdraw children from school when they experience a negative income shock. Moreover, a few empirical studies analyze the effect of childhood health on educational attainment within a stochastic setting (e.g., Alderman et al. (2001); Gan and Gong (2007)). However, mathematical models of investment in human capital under risk typically focus on a household’s decision to invest in education or health rather than situate the effect of risk on the interlinkages from education to health. Moreover, often, the effect of credit market failures on the health-education correlation cannot be distinguished from the effect of insurance market failures. This is the lacuna which this paper aims to fill up. The model in this paper is developed by linking and extending existing models of investment in health and education. For instance, consider the seminal paper by Levhari and Weiss (1974) on the effect of risk on a household’s decision to invest in education. Levhari and Weiss show that under the assumption of decreasing absolute risk averse preferences, investment in education will be positively correlated with a household’s initial income level. In this paper, we follow Levhari and Weiss closely by adopting their framework of a two-period model where in the first period, a household invests in a child’s education and, in the second period, it receives stochastically determined returns on that investment. However, we also extend the model developed by Levhari and Weiss by adding another dimension to human capital investment, that is, health. Investment in health has been modelled in interesting ways in the literature. In Grossman’s (1972) model, individuals demand health for two reasons. As a consumption commodity, health enters directly into their utility functions, and as an investment commodity, health determines the total amount of time available for work in the market sector of the economy, where consumers produce money earnings, and for work in the non-market or household sector, where they produce commodities that enter their utility function. Typically, risk is introduced into the consumption or investment versions of Grossman’s (1972) model of demand for health (see Grossman (1999) for a review). For instance, Dardanoni and Wagstaff (1990) introduce uncertainty into the pure consumption version of Grossman’s model, and Cropper (1977), Muurinen (1982), Dardanoni and Wagstaff (1987), Selden (1993), and Chang (1996) introduce uncertainty into the pure investment version of Grossman’s model. In line with the latter group of studies, we ignore the consumption motive for spending on health and assume that individuals demand health purely as an investment commodity. This helps to focus our analysis. As we will see below, our approach of analyzing the effect of health on education in a stochastic framework offers a new interpretation for the empirically observed positive correlation between health and education. Typically, the observed positive correlation between health and schooling is explained in one of the following three ways. First, it is argued that there is causal relationship that runs from increases in schooling to increases in health. Education improves health by raising economic conditions in per capita income terms so that a higher expenditure in health is possible and/or by increasing knowledge of health issues (Grossman 1975; Kenkel 1991; Rosenzweig and Schultz 1991). Second, it is argued that the causal relationship runs from increases in health to increases in schooling rather than the other way around. Healthier students are more efficient at studying (Perri 1984; Currie and Hyson 1999). Better health may also increase the demand for education because of longer life expectancy (Gan and Gong 2004). Third, it is argued that no causal relationship is implied by the correlation between health and education. Instead, differences in one or more third variables, such as physical and mental ability, parental characteristics, and time discount rates (Fuchs, 1982), affect both health and schooling in the same direction. In this paper, we construct a sufficiently general framework to capture the interplay between health and cognitive development under risk. This approach allows us to infer that in the presence of uninsured risk, part of the correlation between health and education will reflect the effect of risk on household investment decisions. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents and discusses the model. Section 3 analyzes the optimal level of health and education investments under perfect insurance markets. Section 4 concludes.",
6.0,1.0,IZA Journal of Labor & Development,13 January 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40175-016-0067-5,Pathways from school to work in the developing world,December 2017,Marco Manacorda,Furio Camillo Rosati,Giuseppe Dachille,Male,Male,Male,Male,"In this paper, we present novel evidence on transition durations from school to work and on the probability of ever finding employment and stable employment in a sample of 23 low- and middle-income countries around the world. To do so we exploit unique and yet unutilized micro data from the ILO School to Work Transition (STWT) surveys that collect retrospective information on work histories on a sample of around 35,000 individuals aged 15 to 29 around the world. Young individuals are at particular risk of unemployment and joblessness. This is true both in developed and in the developing world (ILO 2013, 2014). In addition to joblessness, underemployment, informality, low wages, and lack of quality employment affect youth labor markets, especially in low-income countries. A critical stage in an individual’s working life is the transition leading from school to the first employment spell. Lengthy transitions impose an array of individual and possibly social costs and they might potentially lead to worse job matches, either due to the effects of prolonged unemployment spells on human capital stock or to employers perceiving long unemployment spells as a signal of low productivity. Long transitions might even translate into worse labor market outcomes in the long term, i.e., lower employability, lower wages, and/or poor quality jobs. One should not necessarily assume though that fast transitions are an indication of good matches or are individually or socially desirable. Short durations might be the result of low reservation wages or poor prospects of finding decent employment and in turn lead to long-term underemployment and poor quality employment. Some evidence exists on the length of transitions from school to work in more advanced and, to a minor extent, in emerging economies (see for example Cunningham and Salvagno 2011 and OECD 1998, Quintini et al. 2007, Quintini and Martin 2014, Ryan 2001 for high-income countries). Much of this evidence points to the role of lack of adequate skills as an obstacle to timely and successful transitions. Considerably less is known, however, about the characteristics and key correlates of transition from school to work in developing countries. As the majority of youth worldwide live in low- and middle-income countries, characterizing these transitions and understanding their determinants is of primary importance. There is convincing evidence from more advanced economies on the negative effect of protracted job search and unemployment, especially during youth. Long-term unemployment has itself adverse consequences on the probability of finding work through negative state dependence (Machin and Manning 1999), and post-unemployment wages appears to be negatively affected by the length of the unemployment period (see for example Card et al. 2007, Lalive 2007, Schmieder et al. 2014). A number of related studies also show evidence of the scarring effects of joblessness, which can persist in an individual’s life (see Ellwood 1982, Gregg and Tominey 2005, Mroz and Savage 2006, Bender and von Wachter 2006). Economic theory rooted in the canonical search and matching model (Pissarides 2000) suggests that the demographic bulges and the low arrival rate of high quality wage offers that characterize many developing economies will negatively affect employment prospects in the long run, although their effects on transition durations are ambiguous. While demographic pressure and the paucity of decent job opportunities are likely to mechanically lead to lower job offer arrival rates and longer transition durations, these will also push workers to accept low wages and low quality jobs. As better opportunities than the current ones are unlikely to materialize in the future, there are disincentives to wait when job-to-job mobility is costly, fostering circles of poor quality employment and underemployment. Similarly, widespread poverty and lack of unemployment insurance that also characterize low-income economies will likely lower reservation wages and speed the transition process, as well as possibly directly lead to worse labor market outcomes in the long run. In order to systematically investigate the length and endpoint of the transition process from school to the labor market and its determinants in low- and middle-income countries, in this work we use retrospective data on work histories since the time of leaving school on a sample of around 35,000 individuals from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean and Eastern Europe. These data are clearly right-censored, as not all individuals will have transited to employment by the time of the survey. More importantly, not all of those who are observed not having transited at the time of the survey will necessarily ever transit to employment, let alone to high quality employment. In order to account for this, we fit to the data a split-cure model (Schmidt and Witte 1989) where we simultaneously parameterize the probability of ever transiting to employment (or stable employment) and the duration of unemployment. This allows us to obtain estimates of baseline hazard rates net of differences in socioeconomic characteristics of the population across countries. In our sample of countries, and similar to high-income countries, hazard rates display pronounced negative duration dependence. While transition durations are on average not very dissimilar from those observed in high-income countries, this masks substantial heterogeneity across regions. Transition durations are the lowest in low-income countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia and the Pacific and the highest in middle-income countries in Latin America and the Caribbean and in particular in the Middle East and North Africa. We also find that in some low- and middle-income countries a substantial fraction of individuals are predicted to never transit to employment. We next investigate the determinants of the heterogeneity in the transition duration and the probability of ever transiting to employment or to stable employment across individuals and countries. Those with higher levels of education (proxied by higher school-leaving age) and those with work experience while in school transit faster and are more likely to ever find employment than early school leavers, possibly pointing to the role of early human capital accumulation and education in shaping transitions. Women are less likely to transit and, if they transit, generally do so at a slower rate than men, although we reaming agnostic on whether this reflects preferences or constraints.Footnote 1
 We show that, despite the extreme pressure put on labor markets by demographic bulges that negatively affect job finding rates especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, transition durations are markedly lower in low-income countries compared to middle- and high-income countries due to a combination of widespread poverty and lack of unemployment insurance, both of which negatively affect reservation wages. These same forces appear to lead to a lower probability of finding employment and stable employment in the long run. Although one has to be cautious in drawing any causal inference from this evidence, these results suggest that shorter durations driven by low reservation wages in low-income countries have potentially long-run welfare costs in terms of a reduced probability of achieving high quality employment. We also find some suggestive evidence that additional years of compulsory education are associated with shorter durations to the first—and in particular the first stable—job. This suggests a role for educational policies in smoothing the transition to employment and in particular quality employment. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the data. Section 3 presents simple descriptive statistics on youths’ labor market status across 28 countries for which the ILO survey data are available. Section 4 presents estimates of the split sample model for 23 (of the 28) countries for which work histories can be reliably derived from the surveys and investigates the individual and macro correlates of such phenomena. Section 5 concludes.",19
