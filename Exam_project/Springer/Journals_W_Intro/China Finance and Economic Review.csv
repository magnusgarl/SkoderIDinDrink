For the past three decades, China’s economic growth has been the result of demographic dividends, high saving rates, and large inputs of energy resources. Favorable demographics lasted only through the 1990s. Thereafter, the demographic structure changed as growth of the working population slowed dramatically. In 2008, the contribution rate of labor to economic growth was more than three times less than in 1988 (Economy Research Project 2012). Nevertheless, China’s economy continued to grow at even a higher rate. In addition to increasing contributions of capital inputs, energy inputs also accounted for a larger share of growth. From 1990 to 2010, Chinese standard coal consumption increased by 2260 million tons. To be more specific, it grew by 469 million tons from 1991 to 2000 and by 1794 million tons between 2001 and 2010. The growth rates for these two decades were almost the same: 10.43 % for the first decade and 10.48 % for the second. But overall energy consumption during the decade from 2001–2010 was 3.6 times higher than the decade from 1991–2000. It is safe to say that the high growth rate from 2001–2010 is attributable to increased resource inputs. In 2011, China’s energy consumption per GDP unit was twice the world average, 2.4 times higher than in the USA, 3.7 times higher than in the European Union, 4.4 times higher than in Japan, and 1.1 times higher than in India. Those figures become 1.5 times, 2.1 times, 2.2 times, and 1.8 times if calculated based on Purchasing Power Parity (Wang 2012). In 2009, China’s economy accounted for around 8.5 % of the world economy, but for 45 % of coal and 10 % of oil and gas consumption. China has only recently become a middle income country, and Chinese income per capita is still far behind that of developed countries. If China is to catch up with developed countries by simply consuming more energy, as it has for the past two decades, China will consume over 50 % of the world’s energy resources. Compared with the performance of developed countries at the same stage of industrialization, China’s energy consumption fluctuates within a relatively low range. However, we should remember that the nature of world resource reserves at present makes it impossible for China to follow the same path of developed countries. China has to find a new road toward industrialization by consuming less energy and generating fewer emissions. In its eleventh five-year plan, the Chinese government put forward the target of reducing energy consumption by 20 % per GDP unit. Despite this, rapid economic growth caused Chinese consumption of standard coal to grow by 889 million tons. The growth of China’s coal consumption accounted for 91 % of the world’s total. With such a high consumption of coal, China has experienced many environmental problems in the past three decades, especially in areas with intensive energy production and consumption. In sharp contrast, environmental problems gradually emerged in as many as around 200 years in developed countries. Through analysis, scholars discovered that the growth of energy consumption in China is actually undermining economic growth (Liu et al. 2009). Both theoretical and empirical research show that there are increasing negative effects of energy consumption on economic development. Unless a proper response is made, this will adversely affect our goal of building a moderately prosperous society. A look at the relationship between the four five-year planning periods from 1990 to 2010 shows that the higher the demand for power, the higher the rate of coal production to energy consumption increases. From 1991 to 1995, standard coal consumption grew by 325 million tons, and coal output increased by 200 million tons of standard coal, accounting for 61.5 % of total consumption. From 1996 to 2000, standard coal consumption grew by 144 million tons, and coal output increased by 16.92 million tons of standard coal, accounting for 11.7 % of total consumption. From 2001 to 2005, standard coal consumption grew by 905 million tons, and coal output increased by 689 million tons of standard coal, accounting for 76.1 % of total consumption. From 2006 to 2010, standard coal consumption grew by 889 million tons, and coal output increased by 593.54 million tons of standard coal, accounting for 66.2 % of total consumption. Excessive energy inputs not only inflict damage on the environment, but also hinder the restructuring of the energy industry. Since 1990, economic development did not improve China’s coal-dominated energy structure; in fact, the energy structure worsened. From 1990 to 2010, the energy production grew 1.86 times, and up to 79 % of the total was produced by coal. The proportion of coal to total power generation increased from 74.2 % in 1990 to 76.5 % in 2010. Yet, according to the analysis of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, China’s produces only ten million tons of coal per year. The problems of over-production and unsafe mining conditions only add to the negative externalities of China’s power predicament. The burning of coal contributes 70 % to total dust and smog emissions, 90 % of SO2 emission, and 67 % of NOx emissions. By the end of the 11th 5-year plan, some regional administrations suspended power generation in order to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by 20 %. This disturbed the speed of production. Using administrative directives to restrict energy outputs ultimately goes against the goal of restricting the growth of power generation. The key to reducing negative externalities of energy consumption and increasing energy efficiency lies in upgrading the energy structure and the industrial structure. To control energy consumption during the 12th 5-year plan period, we should rely on economic instruments, such as price controls and taxes, and on encouraging upgrades to the industrial structure and promotion of new energy sources, rather than rashly taking administrative measures to curb energy consumption. In this way, we can achieve faster economic growth with fewer energy inputs.",4

China currently has three commodity futures exchanges: the Shanghai Futures Exchange (SHFE), the Dalian Commodity Exchange (DCE), and the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange (ZCE). The main trading venue for financial futures, the China Financial Futures Exchange (CFFEX), was established in 2006 in Shanghai. China is now among the world’s leading commodity futures markets. For example, in 2014, China’s futures in rapeseed meal, soybean meal, white sugar, rubber, and palm oil were the world’s top five most actively traded agricultural futures; futures trading in coke and coking coal on the DCE rank fourth and fifth among energy futures, respectively.Footnote 1 The rapid growth of China’s futures market has attracted great attention. China has actively been seeking ways to further liberalize its capital market and promote the internationalization of its futures markets. For example, the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFII) program launched in 2002 and the Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (RQFII) scheme introduced in 2011 provide venues for foreign institutional investors with certain characteristics to participate in China’s securities market. The recent launching of nighttime trading hours is a major step by China on its way to strengthening the price-setting power of key commodities on the global financial market. Nighttime trading of gold and silver futures on the SHFE was launched in July 2013, and thereafter, the other two commodity exchanges in China, the DCE and the ZCE, followed its example. By the end of 2015, many commodity futures on China’s exchanges had an additional trading session at night, while trading in markets overseas (i.e., the USA, Europe) is active. Kyle (1985) modeled a framework that incorporates information into the price across time with trading behavior. Thanks to the nighttime trading sessions, traders in China are able to better manage their risk and react to the information flows released from other markets more swiftly through prompt trading. The futures price in China’s market is thus expected to be more efficient because of this change. Prior studies have explored the information transmission mechanism across markets in different geographic locations as well as the price linkages between futures market and the corresponding spot market (e.g., Eun and Shim 1989; Fung et al. 2001; Ghosh et al. 1999; Xu and Fung 2005). Trading activities in futures markets and their interactions with pricing dynamics have also been examined in the literature (i.e., Bessembinder and Seguin 1992, 1993; Fung and Patterson 2001; Kao and Fung 2012; Pliska and Shalen 1991). This study investigates the impact of additional trading hours at night on the dynamics of China’s futures market. Our goal is to examine whether more information has been incorporated into futures prices after the policy change and prices are better behaved according to the results in developed country markets. To this end, we have taken several steps. First, we examine the statistics of futures returns, including the mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis during the pre- and post-nighttime trading periods. We aim to examine how these moments change after nighttime trading. If new information is incorporated into the futures prices, we would expect the return distribution of the futures contracts to be more symmetric to reflect the even flow of information. In addition, we test two hypotheses related to changes in volatility behavior after the launching of nighttime trading on volume (a proxy for information) and open interest (a proxy for market depth). A large number of studies have documented a positive relationship between return volatility and volume (Karpoff 1987), which suggests three related hypotheses. The mixture-of-distribution hypothesis (MDH) relates trading volume to the number of new information arrivals (e.g., Clark 1973; Epps & Epps 1976; Tauchen & Pitt 1983). The sequential-arrival-of-information hypothesis (SAIH) indicates that traders receive information at different times. That is, the volatility is potentially predictable with knowledge of trading volume (e.g., Foster 1995; Wang & Yau 2000). Finally, the asymmetrical information hypothesis argues that informed traders cluster on one side of a market to reduce price volatility (e.g., Daigler & Wiley 1999; Downing & Zhang 2004). These three theories suggest that if new information is incorporated into futures prices after post-nighttime trading, we should expect to find a stronger positive relationship between volume and volatility. We also examine the relationship between volatility and market depth. Kyle (1985) in his theoretical model suggests that a deep market lowers price pressures to reflect new information, implying less volatility. Similarly, Kim and Verrecchia (1994) argued that a shallow market can increase the difficulty for large trades to occur smoothly and may reduce the speed of information transmission, thus causing greater volatility. To support these theoretical results, Bessembinder and Seguin (1992, 1993) and Fung and Patterson (2001), in their analysis of futures contracts, documented a negative relationship between price volatility and market depth. The overall findings from these studies suggest that market depth and volatility have an inverse relationship. If market depth shows improvement after the post-nighttime trading in Chinese futures markets, we should expect that the negative coefficient between the volatility and market depth will be stronger in post-nighttime trading. We find empirical evidence of enhanced efficiency in futures prices and show that the volatility behavior exhibits improvement with volume and market depth after the launching of nighttime trading. This study contributes to the literature with empirical evidence about the effectiveness of the new trading policy. Our findings also provide practitioners with important information about trading futures in China and provide other developing countries with lessons for improving trading on their futures markets. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The “Data” section presents the data. The “Methods” section explains the methodology. The “Results and discussion” discusses the empirical results of our regression analysis. The final section presents a summary and concludes the paper. Futures exchanges in China started to launch nighttime trading sessions in July 2013. At the end of 2015, 28 commodity futures with nighttime trading hours, including gold, silver, copper cathode, aluminum, zinc, lead, steel rebar, natural rubber, bitumen, hot rolled coils, nickel, and tin on the SHFE; RBD palm olein, metallurgical coke, no. 1 soybeans, no. 2 soybeans, soybean meal, crude soybean oil, coking coal, and iron ore on the DCE; and white sugar, pure terephthalic acid (PTA), no. 1 cotton, rapeseed meal, methanol, rapeseed oil, flat glass, and thermal coal on the ZCE. Because of their additional trading hours at night, the futures market is accessible to domestic traders while markets overseas are still open; hence, the information flow is expected to be incorporated into domestic futures prices in a more timely fashion through trading activities. This study investigates the impact of the launching of nighttime trading in China’s futures market on its domestic market dynamics using daily futures data from the Commodity Systems Inc. (CSI) database. The sample information is summarized in Table 1. Of the 28 commodity futures listed, the 23 futures with a longer trading history and data available in the CSI database during the pre-change period are included in our sample.Footnote 2 The sample spans the earliest available date of each selected future in the CSI database until the end of October 2015. We generate continuous futures price time series by rolling over to the next nearby contract when its open interest is larger. The summary statistics of futures returns during the period before and after the launching of nighttime trading are shown in Tables 2, 3, and 4. The futures return (R

t
) is constructed as the log difference of daily settlement prices (i. e., R

t
 = log(P

t
) − log(P

t − 1)). The statistics for futures on each of the three commodity exchanges are presented in separate panels. Several points are worth noting. First, the mean returns of most futures remain relatively unaffected by the launching of nighttime trading. For 18 of the 23 sample futures, no statistically significant change in mean return is observed, except for silver, copper cathode, steel rebar, no. 1 soybeans, and thermal coal futures. Second, most sample futures exhibit reduced variances after the nighttime trading was launched. Specifically, variances for metal futures on the SHFE, agricultural futures and energy futures on the DCE, and agricultural futures on the ZCE become significantly lower. Third, changes in the skewness and kurtosis statistics reveal improvement toward the normality of return distribution during the post-nighttime trading period. In particular, negative skewness was eliminated and became insignificant for 14 of the 23 futures, indicating that downside risk was largely reduced when traders could access the futures market at night. Furthermore, significant excess kurtosis no longer exists for rapeseed meal futures and flat glass futures. The normal distribution hypothesis was rejected for all the sample futures during the pre-nighttime trading period, according to the Jarque-Bera test.Footnote 3 After the launching of a nighttime trading session, three commodity futures—natural rubber, rapeseed meal, and flat glass—were found to have normally distributed returns. The overall implication of overnight trading is that the returns of futures contracts became more symmetric, showing that balanced information is reflected in the prices on the market. In Fig. 1, we plot the mean returns and standard deviation (a proxy of risk) of these futures during the pre- and post-nighttime trading sub-sample period to examine the change in the risk-return relationship. We observed that the scatterplot has moved leftward and that the linear trend line is no longer negative after the launching of nighttime trading. The plot shows an obvious improvement in the risk-return relationship for sample commodity futures, indicating that overnight trading contributes to improved information flows in the futures prices.

The internationalization of equity markets gained considerable attentions from investors all over the world. Investors began to invest in different equity markets wherever they can earn more benefits. The removal of investment barriers to equity markets not only enhanced the returns of investors but also became the cause of integration of different equity markets. The flow of financial crises between different markets is one of the foremost causes of integrations of markets. The knowledge about spillover of financial information from one market to another gained a considerable attention over the last few decades. The main focus of the researchers is to provide the information about integration about markets because two integrated markets will not provide the benefits of portfolio diversification (Jebran 2014). Numerous studies examined the spillover effects of volatility between different equity markets. Most of the researchers have studied developed equity markets for volatility spillover effects; however, there are also studies which examined developing as well as emerging equity markets. The various studies carried out for developed equity markets include studies like Hu et al. (1997), Chou et al. (1999), Ng (2000), Baele (2002), Wagner and Szimayer (2004), Harris and Pisedtasalasai (2006), Diebold and Yilmaz (2009), and Xiao and Dhesi (2010). The studies on developing equity markets include Mukherjee and Mishra (2010), Joshi (2011), Choo et al. (2011), and Sakthivel and Kamaiah (2011). There are also studies that examined emerging equity market integrations, see for example, Wang et al. (2005), Worthington and Higgs (2004), Li and Majerowska (2008), and Beirne et al. (2009). These studies provide valuable insights about integration between equity markets and provide investors effective investment opportunities regarding portfolios. Markowitz (1952) laid the foundation of portfolio theory. He provided the concept of portfolio diversification. According to him, investments should be made on the basis of risk and return relationship. People should prefer those investments which provide maximum benefit at a given level of risk or should prefer low risk at a given level of return. According to portfolio theory, investment should be made in non-correlated assets. This reveals that if there is no correlation between assets, then the shock that arises in one asset may not transmit to other assets and vice versa. In this aspect, the risk of investment is minimized and return is maximized. So careful selection of assets should be made in this regard to minimize the risk and maximize the return of portfolios. The foundation of portfolio theory gained a considerable attention from investors to know about the integration between different equity markets around the globe. This motivated many investors and researchers to explore the integration of different equity markets. The knowledge of integration would help investors to prevent themselves from market imperfections. If the markets are integrated in terms of spillover of volatility, so one market crises will be transferred to other markets (Baele 2002; Choo et al. 2011). The other aspect regarding the integration of markets is that it also plays a key role for determining the price of different securities. The investor is willing to pay a high price for non-integrated securities rather than correlated assets (Glezakos et al. 2007). The importance of unveiling the association of equity markets has motivated this study to know about the relationship between different equity markets. This study has been undertaken to study the volatility spillover effects between Asian countries. The aim behind using Asian countries is to provide insights to investors regarding their geographical equity markets. The Asian countries included in this study are taken from South and East Asia. This study considered three countries from South Asia and three from East Asia. The countries taken from South Asia are Sri Lanka, India, and Pakistan. The countries considered from East Asia are Japan, Hong Kong, and China. Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) is the major market in Pakistan and is considered for this study. The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) has been selected from India. The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) is selected from Sri Lanka. The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) is selected from China. The Hang Seng Stock Exchange (HSSE) is selected from Hong Kong. The Nikkei 225 (Nikkei) is considered from Japan in this study. The novelty of this paper is that it is using daily data which is considered to give more spurious results than weekly and monthly data. Furthermore, this study considered a 15-year period for the purpose of long-term analyses. This study will add to the literature of Asian countries. This study also constitutes a sample of diverse mix countries and will also add to the literature of diverse mix Asian countries. This study will provide benefits to investors, as the information of this study will provide them knowledge about the integration of markets which will help them in making portfolio decisions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The second part discusses the literature review. The third part shows methods and data description. The fourth section discusses empirical results. The fifth part is about conclusion and policy implication. The finance literature provides numerous studies which provide information about volatility spillover effects between different stock markets. The knowledge of how information is transmitted from one market to another is the prime focus of many domestic and foreign investors for the investment decision-making in different markets. Most of the studies have been carried out to study developed equity markets; however, there are also studies analyzing developing and emerging markets. The literature can be divided into studies that have been undertaken to study developed, developing, and emerging equity markets. The studies on developed equity markets include Hu et al. (1997), Chou et al. (1999), Ng 2000, Baele (2002), Wagner and Szimayer (2004), Harris and Pisedtasalasai (2006), Diebold and Yilmaz (2009), and Xiao and Dhesi (2010). Hu et al. (1997) studied four emerging markets named Shenzhen, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Taiwan with the developed equity market in the USA and Japan. Their analyses were based on daily data from period 5 October 1992 to 15 February 1996. By applying the causality in variance test, they found evidence of transmission of volatility among Hong Kong and US markets. Chou et al. (1999) provided evidence of spillover effect of volatility between US and Taiwan markets. The analyses were made using Engle and Kroner M-generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model. They used various types of data in examining volatility: closed to open and open to closed data rather than simply using daily data. Their analyses indicate the transmission of both return and variance between Taiwan and USA. Ng (2000) examined the transmission of volatility from Japan and US equity markets to six Pacific Basin stock markets (Thailand, Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan). By taking the weekly data of stock returns, he analyzed by using ARCH family framework. The empirical analyses of the study provide evidence of spillover of volatility from Japan and USA to many equity markets of the Pacific Basin. Baele (2002) extended the literature of flow of volatility of the US and European Union markets with selected 13 markets of Europe. He has taken weekly data of stock returns and analyzed by using the GARCH and BEKK model. He found increasing tendency of shocks for many markets during 1990. The results further provide evidence of shock transmission from the US market to Switzerland, UK, and Sweden. Wagner and Szimayer (2004) studied the established equity market of Germany and USA in examining volatility transmission. They have considered daily data from 1992 to 2002. Their analyses reveal statistically significant spillover effects of equity markets, but the tendency was mostly related to country specifics. They concluded that the shock spillover shows robustness in the crises period. Harris and Pisedtasalasai (2006) empirically studied the mean and volatility transmission for the small and large stocks in the UK. The daily data taken from January 1986 to December 2002 is converted into continuous compounded return for the indices of FTSE small caps, FTSE 250, and FTSE 100. The empirical analyses are undertaken by using the GARCH model. By applying the model, they found statistically significant transmission of volatility for both the small caps and large caps of the UK. They finally concluded that the shocks are mostly flowing from larger caps to smaller caps of the UK market. Diebold and Yilmaz (2009) extended the literature for seven developed equity markets (France, Germany, Japan, USA, Hong Kong, and UK) with 12 emerging markets (South Korea, Chile, Argentina, Taiwan, Singapore, Philippines, Thailand, Brazil, South Korea, Argentina, Mexico, and Malaysia). They have done a novel work in examining volatility transmission by taking data of both before and after Asian financial crises period. The VAR model is applied in examining volatility transmission. Their results reveal no current trend in return spillover but show robustness with time. However, they found clear robustness of volatility transmission with time. They concluded integration of many markets. Xiao and Dhesi (2010) examined transmission of volatility for four indices (FTSE 100, S & P 500, DAX and CAC) from the period 5 January 2004 to 1 October 2009. They used two different multivariate models, BEKK and DCC models, and found evidence of statistically significant volatility transmission between the European and US markets. Their results show evidence of spillover of shock from the US to all other selected equity markets. The studies on developing equity markets include studies, for example, Mukherjee and Mishra (2010), Joshi (2011), Choo et al. (2011), and Sakthivel and Kamaiah (2011). Mukherjee and Mishra (2010) empirically examined volatility transmission of equity market of India with 12 selected equity markets (China, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia, Pakistan, Malaysia, Korea, Hong Kong, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and Japan). Their observations consist of intraday stock price from July 1998 to April 2008. By applying the GARCH model, they found evidence of bidirectional return spillover between India and all selected markets except Sri Lanka. Joshi (2011) empirically examined the spillover of return and volatility between Asian countries (Korea, China, India, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and Japan). By applying the GARCH BEKK model, he found bidirectional return spillover in the following markets: Indonesia and China, Korea and Japan, India and Hong Kong, and Hong Kong and Korea. Choo et al. (2011) examined volatility transmission between larger and smaller stocks of Malaysian equity market. By using daily data from April 1992 to September 2005, they employed the GJRGARCH model in examining volatility transmission. Their analyses show evidence of bidirectional spillover of return for larger and smaller stocks. Sakthivel and Kamaiah (2011) examined co-movement and transmission of volatility between markets of India, Australia, USA, UK, and Japan. By using the GARCH model, they found bidirectional spillover of volatility from India and US equity market. They also found unidirectional transmission of shocks from the UK and Japan to India. The studies on emerging equity markets include studies like Wang et al. (2005), Worthington and Higgs (2004), Li and Majerowska (2008), and Beirne et al. (2009). Wang et al. (2005) used the EGARCH model in examining the volatility transmission from established equity markets of Japan and USA to newly emerged capital markets of Asia. Their empirical analyses show evidence of both return and shock transmission from established markets to emerging capital markets of Asia. Worthington and Higgs (2004) studied the emerging market of Asia for cross-border transmission of volatility. They used the GARCH model for investigating spillover effects. They found statistically significant spillover of volatility from Japan capital market to newly emerged markets of Indonesia, Korea, and Hong Kong. Li and Majerowska (2008) empirically investigated emerging market of Budapest Stock Exchange and Warsaw Stock Exchange in comparison with USA and Frankfurt. The daily data is examined through the BEKK GARCH model. Their analyses reveal clear evidence of transmission of volatility from US and DAX capital markets to Budapest and Warsaw equity market. Beirne et al. (2009) examined newly emerged markets with established markets for flow of shocks from one market to another. The data ranges from 1990 to 2008 for 41 newly emerged markets. By applying the tri-variate GARCH model, they found clear evidence of flow of shocks from established markets to emerging markets. Based on the discussed literature, we develop the following hypothesis for this study. H0: There is no volatility spillover between Asian countries’ stock markets H1a: There is bidirectional volatility spillover between Asian countries’ stock markets H1b: There is unidirectional volatility spillover between Asian countries’ stock markets",14

A rapidly “developing” economy, in addition to increased per capita income, often sees (whether as cause or effect) significant political and environmental changes and such changes in social organization as less of the workforce found in agriculture, more people working in the formal sector of the economy, demographic transition (Hafner and Mayer-Foulkes 2013), and a greater reliance on formal titling in property and credit markets (De Soto 2000). It is also marked by a change in class structure (Easterly 2001), with more people identifiable as being in the upper and especially middle classes (Landes 1998). Part of this change is driven by changes in average income and its distribution among the population. But part of it is said to reflect a change in values and in people’s perceived relation to their fellow citizens and perhaps to the state itself. In particular, to a first approximation, as societies develop, more of their members feel more of an identification with the middle class and its values. This is partly driven by the aforementioned changes in average material standard of living, while others, e.g., McCloskey (2010), posit causation in the other direction. She traces the history of the idea of the middle class and says it is the adoption of what she terms bourgeois values that drives development. Whatever the direction of causation, these hypotheses suggest that rapid, sustained economic growth should coincide with a rising share of the population that is and deems itself to be part of the middle class. This paper comparatively analyzes data from China to outline an anomalous path for that country. As the country’s standard of living has grown tremendously in recent decades, the proportion of the population that views itself as middle class has not only stopped rising but has actually declined, even as the data on average income and income distribution are consistent with patterns in other countries in East Asia whose collective sense of self became dominated by the middle-class identity decades ago. (For rising middle-class self-identification in postwar Japan, see Slater 2011; for similar evidence for Korea and elsewhere, see Kharas 2010) The paper does not look at the effect of development on the rise of an objectively defined middle class or vice versa as in Lopez-Calva and Ortiz-Juarez (2014) but on the perception of belonging (or not) to the middle class. The unusual pattern in China is interesting in its own right and to the extent that it is this perception that drives the social and individual behavioral changes in McCloskey-type arguments, this question is important for China’s future as well. “The dynamics of class self-identification in China” section documents the phenomenon. The “Class identity dynamics in other transition countries” section renders it curious by looking at class identification transition in other countries that have had comparable patterns of economic growth. The “Determinants of self-identification as middle class from microdata” section uses cross-country data to investigate the determinants of class identification both around the world and in China in particular, and “The housing effect in China” section explores the potential distinct effect in China of anomalies in recent years in the housing market there.",1

Reforms in the services sector are slated to continue to take place in the coming years, including in the financial sector. In this paper, we explore China’s success and challenges with structural change, then take a closer look at the financial services sector to find out where reforms have occurred, where the potential lies, and what the future will bring. There is little written about the potential impacts of opening up China’s financial sector on GDP and potential GDP, yet it is critical to understand the role that China’s massive targeted structural change will have upon growth and other factors. This paper seeks to fill the gap in the literature on the economic impact China’s financial service sector reforms can have. Structural change is a complex process that transforms an economy in a basic manner. While China has been successful in transforming from an agricultural-based economy to a manufacturing-based economy, it is unclear to what extent China will be successful in moving to a service-based economy. China’s financial sector in particular faces challenges since financial institutions are closely tied to the state, whose institutional structure has prevented improvements in efficiency. Multiple reforms are expected to occur in the financial sector, but the current economic slowdown, coupled with enduring state interests, present barriers to change. Still, if the reforms were successful, they could potentially generate far more GDP than they do at present. Better productivity, greater employment, and more capital in the banking sector alone could lead to large economic gains. In what follows, we first describe structural change and TFP, as well as structural change as it applies to China, then examine China’s financial services sector. Next, we calculate potential GDP of the financial services sector now and with the implementation of expected reforms. We conclude with policy recommendations. The relationship between economic growth, structural transformation and TFP has been examined to some extent in the literature. This relationship has been illustrated through different models and results in different conclusions depending on countries and sectors examined. Bah and Brada (2009) estimate total factor productivity at the sectoral level, developing a model that estimates sectoral TFP from data on sectoral employment and GDP per capita, in order to examine structural change in Eastern Europe. The authors evaluate TFP in industry, service, and agriculture, finding that the former communist regimes in Eastern Europe have experienced structural change through the services sector, and that TFP is growing rapidly relative to that in Austria. Bah and Brada (2014) look at labor market developments in former communist nations of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, specifically studying the interaction between aggregate output and employment, and later analyzing the impact of privatization on employment outcomes in the context of sectoral restructuring. Buera and Kaboski (2012) analyze the role of specialized high-skilled labor in service sector growth in the USA. The authors create a theory that reflects the shifting demand toward more skill-intensive output as productivity increases. This provides the link between skill accumulation and growth of the services sector. Duarte and Restuccia (2010) examine sectoral labor productivity to explain structural transformation, finding that the productivity catch-up in industry, across countries and relative to the USA, explains about half the gains in productivity across countries. Using a general equilibrium model, the authors also conclude that low productivity in the services sector and lack of convergence explains stagnation observed across countries. Ngai and Pissarides (2007) construct a model in which structural change is driven by sectoral labor reallocation dependent on rates of TFP growth. The authors find that on the balanced growth path, labor that produces consumer goods moves to sectors with low TFP growth rates, while employment shares of intermediate and capital goods remain constant. Acemoglu and Guerrieri (2008) analyze sectoral differences in factor proportions within a two-sector general equilibrium model, showing that as sectoral levels of TFP diverge or capital accumulates, structural change takes place. As in Ngai and Pissarides, Agemoglu, and Guerrieri show that structural change is driven by changes in the relative price of factors. There is little written on the financial services sector per se and structural transformation. Much of the emphasis with respect to financial sector change is associated with regulatory reform and liberalization. This has been discussed with particular reference to developed economies, such as the USA, the UK, and Europe (see Volcker 2012, Bhatia 2007 and Riksbank 2015), especially in the wake of the global crisis, but not with reference to TFP or the structural transition to a service sector-based economy. Structural change is an essential, multi-faceted component of development. This is a broad term that implies some important assumptions. Most importantly, while stages of growth theories a la Rostow and others have been deemed too constricting in their approach, neglecting the variation, dynamics, and fluctuations experienced by developing economies, economists continue to view structural change as a movement from a primary sector-based economy to a manufacturing sector-based economy, and ultimately to a service-based economy, or from a traditional sector-based economy to a modern sector-based economy. The reason for this assumption is that structural change is thought to occur in conjunction with an upgrading of skills and capital, with a climb up the “ladder” of primary, secondary, and tertiary sectors largely coinciding with increasingly skill- and capital-intensive processes. This phenomenon has been applied to China in various ways. Structural change in China has been analyzed across three sectors and across provinces, in the works of Fan, Fan and Robinson (2003), Fleisher and Yang (2003), Wu and Yao (2003), Heckman (2005), Au and Henderson (2006), Bhaumik and Estrin (2007), Bosworth and Collins (2008), and Gong and Lin (2008). Other works use a macroeconomic framework to describe reallocations between private firms and state-owned enterprises, as in Song et al. (2011) and Dekle and Vandenbroucke (2012). China has successfully carried out the structural change from agriculture to industry, increasing total factor productivity in agriculture by 6.5 % annually between 1991 and 2009 (Cao and Birchenall 2013). Cao and Birchenall (2013) find that total factor productivity expansion in the agriculture sector explains most of the reorientation of output and employment toward rapid non-agricultural productivity growth. Movement away from a focus on the agricultural sector comprised an important stage of growth in most other countries. Reforms, which started with the agricultural sector, freed up agricultural labor as productivity rose. Chen, Jefferson and Zhang (2011) use a stochastic frontier sectoral production function to examine total factor productivity growth and quantitative growth of inputs. The authors find that TFP growth exceeded quantitative growth of inputs since 1992, indicating a “structural bonus” as referred to in Timmer and Szirmai (2000), but that the contribution of TFP to output growth declines starting in 2001. Structural change embodied in reforms to factor markets and industrial structure heavily influenced the efficiency of factor allocation over the period in question. This is because factor markets were underdeveloped, and this became clear in particular after 2001. Industrial policies began to favor other, high-profit industries, such as high-tech and heavy industries, which were unable to absorb much labor. Wang et al (2014) put forth a new structural decomposition analysis model, which interprets the changes in sectoral output production. The authors incorporate, among more traditional indicators of structural change, the ratio of final goods demand over total output. Analysis is applied to three periods, 1992–1997, a high growth phase, especially for the mechanical and electrical machinery sector; 1997–2002, a soft landing period, in which growth in the mechanical and electrical machinery sector slowed; and 2002–2006, an initial stage of a high growth period, which experienced a surge in the mechanical and electrical machinery sector, combined with declines in the contribution to growth of the agriculture and services sectors. Findings indicate that the driver of China’s movement toward increased production of machinery and electrical equipment is external demand for export, while changes in production technology and import substitution have hindered structural change. Jiang and Shi (2015) use an Eaton-Kortum model to discern total factor productivity differences across provinces. The authors find that different sectoral contributions by province indicate high migration barriers. They conclude that migration barriers actually expand the provincial manufacturing labor share, and that rich provinces gain less from inter-provincial trade than poor provinces. Lee and Malin (2013) use a structural labor model of sector choice to find that 11 % of aggregate growth in output per worker between 1978 and 2004 can be explained by increased education, with most of the growth (9 %) stemming from sectoral reallocations of labor. Relatedly, a sizeable literature exists on whether China has reached the Lewis turning point, moving from a period of surplus labor in the agricultural sector to a period of rising wages in the agricultural and industrial sectors. This literature indicates that China may have completed the first phase of development and moved into the second, modern sector stage. Scholars noticed in the late 2000s that wages were rising and that labor shortages in some coastal cities were presenting bottlenecks to production. This led to the rise of such literature, with some authors concluding that China has reached the turning point, and others finding that it has not. The discussion can be found in Zhang, Yang and Wang (2011), Zhu and Cai (2012), Cai and Du (2011), Golley and Meng (2011), Cai (2010), Yao and Zhang (2010), Minami and Ma (2010), and others. While we do not discuss the Lewis turning point per se, the demographic implications of these studies are essential to understanding China’s ability to undergo structural change to a service-based economy. What we can gather from these studies is that: (1) China’s working age population has recently peaked; (2) demand for migrant workers remains high in the low-skilled modern urban sector; (3) China has entered a new stage of demographic transition, with an aging population, before it has become fully affluent or developed; and (4) improvements in human capital and technology are now more important than simple labor or capital inputs. China’s financial sector is no exception to these conclusions. We next describe China’s financial sector and discuss where it is heading. First, we must understand China’s financial sector, its reform status, and where it is heading in order assess potential structural change in this industry. As is well known, China’s financial sector continues to be dominated by a small number of major state-owned banks, while private banks play a minimal role. At the same time, demand for financing is high among underserved populations such as rural areas and small- and medium-sized enterprises. Financing constraints among the banking sector gave rise to the shadow banking sector after 2007, alternative methods of financing that sought to serve smaller and riskier borrowers. Leveling the playing field among banks and reducing regulations would increase competition and efficiency in this sector, and enhance the role of the financial industry in China’s restructuring process. Not only would improving competition create employment in this sector, but reducing financing constraints would complement the growth of other industries. China’s Big Four banks, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, and China Construction Bank, have far more market power over the financial industry than do the thousands of other financial institutions. The Big Four comprise 40–50 % of the bank loan market share and 93 % of banking sector market capital. The industry is therefore moderately oligopolistic. By contrast, foreign subsidiaries control only about 1 % of the market share. Barriers to entry in the financial sector are mainly explicit and implicit government preference. The Big Four Banks, ironically, are less profitable, less efficient, and have lower asset quality than other types of banks (Lin and Zhang 2009; Fu and Heffernan 2009). In this way, these firms are atypical oligopolies as to some degree; they are tools of the state. China’s banking structure contradicts the X-efficiency hypothesis, which says that more X-efficient banks have lower costs, higher profits, and larger market shares (Demsetz 1973, 1974). China’s X-inefficiency increased between 1985 and 2002, especially among state-owned banks, indicating a rise in moral hazard (Fu and Heffernan 2009). China’s banking structure also fails to support the relative scale-efficiency hypothesis, which finds that banks that are at the appropriate economy of scale will have lower costs and higher profits that can lead to greater market concentration (Lambson 1987). Other banks include joint-stock commercial banks, policy banks, credit cooperatives, and urban commercial banks. All of these together comprise a little over half of lending activity in China. These institutions, along with the Big Four, are constrained by interest rate ceilings on deposits and lending quotas. Interest rate ceilings on deposits pinch the potential returns on savings that depositors may earn. In times of higher inflation, real returns on deposits have even turned out to be negative. Savers have few viable savings and investment outlets other than bank deposits, and the deposit interest rate ceiling reinforces their dissatisfaction with China’s financial system. What is more, lending quotas may restrict the amount of loans that banks can lend. In recent years, a sizeable shadow banking sector has grown up to serve institutions that cannot obtain loans from the formal banking sector. The shadow banking sector includes trust companies, internet lending platforms, credit guarantee companies, and other institutions, and products include wealth management and trust products, bankers’ acceptance bills, and entrusted loans. Shadow banking encompasses means through which riskier and non-state firms can obtain loans, as the formal banking sector is constrained in its lending. Risks associated with the shadow banking sector are higher than in the banking system, as credit, liquidity, and solvency risks present substantial threats among institutions, products, and borrowers. The bond market includes government and corporate bonds. Government bonds are issued by the MOF, and local governments and Central bank notes and Policy Bank bonds are most actively traded, but are purchased by state-owned banks. Corporate bonds incur large transaction costs during the issuance process and have been insufficiently rated by China’s ratings agencies, leading to potential defaults of companies whose debt quality was overestimated. The stock market is the second largest in the world by equity value but is dominated by state-owned firms. Market prices are inefficient at present, as an asset price bubble looms. Capital controls restrict interaction with the international financial sector. Controls over currency conversion and flows have been loosened, particularly in the current account, but persist in the capital account. The question is, however, to what extent do capital controls stand in the way of domestic financial reform? There are two answers to this: one is that allowing larger capital inflows for investment purposes would help to deepen China’s financial system; while the other, contradicting, view, is that China’s financial system is fragile and must be protected from larger capital inflows. Which argument would best support financial reform as measured by financial deepening? Experience tells us that maintaining a fixed (even within a band) currency in conjunction with porous capital controls and a weak financial system can result in volatile capital flows, shocking the financial and then real economic sectors. However, if all of these elements are to be liberalized over time (and we do not underscore the many arguments in favor of liberalization here—see Eichengreen 2001 and Kose et al 2006 for discussion), there may be a period in which exposure to capital flows disrupts the economy. To combat this, economists have advocated for a proper order of financial liberalization. McKinnon (1993) is one of the heavyweights on the order of economic liberalization. He argues that one of the first orders of reform should be that interest rates are liberalized to reflect borrowing and lending costs, and that private debt contracts be enforced through the legal system. Chinn and Ito (2006) find that increasing financial openness contributes to the development of equity markets only after a threshold of strong legal systems and institutions is attained and after some development in the banking sector has also occurred. The authors also find that liberalization of cross-border goods is a precondition for liberalization of the capital account. In terms of order of capital and exchange rate liberalization, most scholars contend that first, the exchange rate and then the capital account should be liberalized (Eichengreen 2007). The argument is that liberalizing the exchange rate first can reduce speculative pressure. Expanding flexibility of the exchange rate would ideally take place in periods of stability in exchange markets, and as a second best position, should occur when the domestic economy is strong and there are pressures for the currency to appreciate (Prasad, Rumbaugh, and Wang 2005, Eichengreen and Mussa 1998 and Agénor 2004). Exchange rate liberalization will help to alleviate “hot money” inflows and outflows that increase as appreciation and depreciation expectations rise. However, there are dangers associated with this, including currency speculation, creation of adverse conditions for trade, fluctuation in the real value of foreign debt claims, and generation of inflation. The biggest challenge is maintaining financial stability and minimizing shocks. Currency speculations trigger a hostile environment of uncertainty. Investors will tend to shy away from investment. This uncertainty encourages consumer price volatility which is exacerbated by inflation. This is an adverse environment for trade and economic growth. McKinnon (2006) points out that even (and especially) Chinese holders of US public debt may experience deterioration of their assets. Perhaps even more importantly, McKinnon and Schnabl (2012) state that China cannot fully float its currency since it will not be able to lend an amount sufficient to balance the trade surplus; the RMB would continue to appreciate unless the central bank stepped in to purchase dollars. China is seeking to expand lending in RMB through its Silk Road projects and participation in global lending institutions. Over time, this will provide China with further room in which to liberalize its exchange rate. A more flexible exchange rate regime would permit China to support a more independent monetary policy, ensuring a buffer against domestic and external shocks that would reduce its vulnerability. In an ever more globalized world, where countries and economies are becoming more integrated, it is in China’s own benefit to reduce its exposure to potential external macroeconomic shocks. The current overall exposure of the corporate sector and banks in China to foreign exchange risks appears to have been growing slowly as it has become an important player in the international arena. Prasad et al. (2005) however, advocate that China’s banking system is “unlikely to be subject to substantial stress simply as a result of greater exchange rate flexibility.” China’s titanic growth has been in great part a result of its trade flows and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows. For this reason, many policymakers argue that a more flexible exchange rate would negatively influence these trade and FDI flows, hindering China’s growth. On the other hand, studies from Clark, Tamirisa, and Wei (2004) believe that exchange rate volatility does not influence trade flows significantly. The renminbi’s real value keeps a close eye on the dollar and maintains a stable exchange rate, whereas, with its other major trading counterparties, China allows greater exchange volatility. This behavior does not seem to prove an obstacle for China’s expanding trade strategies in other countries. Furthermore, the benefits of enjoying macroeconomic stability that could emanate from increasing exchange rate flexibility could compensate and offset the effects of reduced trade flows. With a greater flexibility, the Chinese financial market would also grow deeper and stronger, together with the foreign exchange market. It is important to note that China need not fully liberalize its exchange rate in order to create more room for a consumption and market-based economy. China may choose to follow the example of a nation like South Korea, which has a weakly managed float in place in order to smooth volatility rather than to manipulate exchange rates. China may reduce its control over the currency by decreasing intervention in the foreign exchange market. Capital account liberalization will help to reduce interest rate differentials between China and other nations, but this may destabilize the economy where large interest rate differentials persist. Currency appreciation expectations may surge given rapid capital inflows, and some basic controls must be put into place to prevent this from occurring. Barriers to reform of the financial system are many, but some of the most pressing include leveling the playing field to make banks outside the Big Four more competitive, fully allowing interest rates to reflect market forces and improving the credit scoring system. Measures to liberalize interest rates are under way; while the lending floor was lifted in July 2013 and a new prime lending rate was created in October 2013, steps to remove the deposit rate ceilings are under way. The PBOC implemented deposit insurance in May 2015 in order to ensure that once deposit interest rate ceilings are lifted, depositors are protected from risky competitive behavior engaged in by banks. China is also in the process of implementing a social credit score to rate individuals and firms based on the credit history and other data. This is expected to be rolled out in 2017. Local provincial governments are collecting credit information as well to improve lending at to local institutions. Banks suffer from some issues with non-performing loans, although the Ministry of Finance is able to combat this problem by using asset management companies to purchase non-performing loans. Foreign competition is also restricted. China’s leadership is well aware of the need for changes and has laid out an ambitious reform agenda for the financial sector. China’s reform agenda aims to: open up the financial sector by allowing small private banks to emerge; promote bond and equity finance; improve insurance compensation process; bring about inclusive finance; promote financial innovation; increase exchange and interest rate liberalization; increase capital account liberalization; regulate capital flows within a macroprudential framework; enhance financial regulation; and reform financial institutions’ exit mechanism. Most banking reforms that have already been carried out have not radically changed the sector’s market structure. Banking reforms include the following. Date Policy Description 7/1/2013 Guidelines on Financial Support for Economic Restructuring, Transformation and Upgrading Allows some changes in capital investment structure 7/26/2013 Guiding Opinions on Strengthening Financing Services to Support SMEs Requires government agencies to enhance financing to SMEs 8/8/2013 Implementation Opinion on Providing Financial Support for Small and Micro Enterprises Provides new financing options to SMEs 8/30/2013 Guidelines on Protecting Rights and Interests of Consumers Requires banks to improve governance to protect consumer rights 9/27/2013 Measures on Consumer Finance Pilots Creates 10 consumer finance business pilots 11/8/2013 Guidance on Commercial Banks Issuing Corporate Bonds to Replenish Capital Allows listed commercial banks to issue corporate bonds 1/6/2014 Notice on Issues Concerning Strengthening the Supervision on Shadow Banking Focuses on stabilizing shadow banking 2/14/2014 General Plan for the Qingdao Wealth Management Comprehensive Reform Pilot Creates a pilot zone to encourage wealth management zone 2/14/2014 Measures for the Administration of Service Prices of Commercial Banks Regulates commercial banks’ service prices 2/19/2014 Circular on the Reapproval of Charging Standards of Supervision Fees for the Banking Sector Changes standards on collecting fees for banks 2/20/2014 Administrative Measures for the Liquidity Risk of Commercial banks Implements measure to assess liquidity risk 2/27/2014 Credit Industry Management Act Calls for social credit information system 3/17/2014 Regulations on Financial Leasing Companies Clarifies operating rules for financial leasing industry 3/27/2014 Opinions on Accelerating the Construction of Microenterprise and Rural Credit Systems Creates credit risk system for micro and rural enterprises 7/24/2014 Notice on Improving and Innovating Loans to Small and Micro Enterprises to Improve the Financial Services to Small and Micro Enterprises Improves loans to small enterprises 7/25/2014 CBRC Approvals to create Qianhai Weizhong Bank, Wenzhou Private Bank, and Tianjin Jincheng Private Bank Establishes three private banks 9/26/2014 CBRC Approvals to create Shanghai Huarui Private Bank and Zhejiang Web Commercial Bank Establishes private banks Source: US-China Business Council (2015) Small-scale reforms have also worked to provide finance to smaller borrowers in order to make finance more inclusive. Although some P2P firms have engaged in risky lending, other internet firms such as Eloan.cn have worked to provide small-scale finance to SMEs and rural borrowers. Foreign entry into China’s financial sector began in 2006 as part of China’s commitment to the WTO agreement. Foreign bank activity is highly restricted by Chinese regulators. Limitations include lending and deposit constraints, foreign exchange constraints, large capital requirements, and murky regulatory framework (PWC 2014). The capital account has been opened to a limited extent under the QFII and QDII programs. Qualified Domestic Retail Investor (QDRI) and Qualified Domestic Individual Investor (QDII2) programs are also in the making. Under the Qualified Domestic Individual Investor scheme, individuals in Guangzhou and Shenzhen (at present) can purchase securities listed on the Hong Kong market. These investors are required to have at least 1.5 million RMB in financial assets. The Qualified Domestic Retail Investor program, still in the planning stage, would allow citizens to invest in overseas stocks and properties. Through the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor system, mainland institutions can invest in foreign exchange products. Approved financial institutions may purchase and sell foreign currency or RMB-denominated financial products to mainland investors. Such products include money market instruments, fixed income products, equity products, mutual funds, and structured products. The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect which opened in April 2014 now allows cross-border stock investment between the Shanghai and Hong Kong stock exchanges, but had a limited impact. Funds will soon be added to sales of cross-border shares through the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect, and a Shenzhen-Hong Kong Stock connect is expected open at the end of 2015. However, strong deviation in prices for the same stocks sold in Shanghai and Hong Kong has revealed lack of market efficiency as well as lack of investor sophistication. Some exchange rate reform has also been carried out. More substantive recent reform measures include reforming foreign exchange management under companies’ capital accounts, expanding multinational use of foreign exchange, setting up pilot zones in which foreign companies can convert foreign capital into RMB (US-China Business Council 2015). Less impactful reforms include promotion of the foreign currency cash business, simplification of cross-border foreign exchange guarantee, providing instructions to government bodies on how to expand foreign trade, clarifying procedures in foreign exchange settlement, and allowing foreign invested banks to convert currency for operating capital. The Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone is an example of one of China’s initiatives to implement economic and social reforms in a controlled manner. As announced by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) Shanghai branch on 28 February 2014, the Shanghai Free Trade Zone will allow yuan convertibility and unrestricted foreign currency exchange. Furthermore, it will also permit a tax-free period of 10 years for the businesses in the area as a means to simplify the process of FDI and facilitate the management of capital accounts. In a nutshell, the Shanghai FTZ’s aim is to facilitate and encourage business. The main benefits entities within the Shanghai FTZ will benefit from are listed below (McBride 2014). Simplified cross-border payment procedures—Shanghai FTZ entities can open capital accounts without prolonged government foreign exchange (FX) registration approvals, and banks are now authorized to carry out FX registration and Renminbi (RMB) cross-border settlement directly. Free trade accounts—Shanghai FTZ entities can open free trade accounts (FTA) and transfer funds freely between FTAs, other offshore accounts, and onshore non-resident accounts. Loosening of control over cross-border finance—controls over outbound security and FX finance have been relaxed so Shanghai FTZ entities may now borrow offshore RMB funds subject to certain requirements (for example, limits on the use of such offshore RMB funds and maturity profile). RMB convertibility—Shanghai FTZ entities enjoy full capital account RMB convertibility along with the benefits of future FX reforms (for example, FIEs can immediately convert foreign exchange into RMB and utilize RMB hedging, whereas a non-Shanghai FTZ FIE must wait until there is a commercial contract requiring hard currency payment before it can make the conversion). Deposit rate liberalization—Shanghai FTZ entities may be offered higher interest rates for foreign exchange and RMB deposits with banks due to the loosening of the statutory interest rate limits. However, there is some distance between the current reforms and reform targets and where the financial sector would be to maximize GDP growth. First, the Big Four banks’ oligopoly should be ended by eliminating policy favoritism and implicit government guarantees. A much better information mechanism needs to be implemented to judge risk and return, particularly for small and medium sized enterprises, which provide most of China’s economic growth but remain extremely credit constrained. These two banking-specific reforms in and of themselves would require massive reorientation of the banking sector to implement. Government projects should rely less on the Big Four banks for funding and seek other types of financing, including tax revenue funding, bond financing (in which bonds would be held by the public rather than mainly banks), and perhaps loans from designated institutions such as the Policy Banks. Breaking up the Big Four oligopoly is not even on the reform agenda, but reducing market share of these institutions would go a long way to freeing up finance for other types of firms. Development of the bond market is also quite nascent and will take massive effort to truly marketize and expand. Well-functioning bond markets are prerequisites for relaxing capital controls and are channels of transmission for an interest rate-led monetary policy. China’s bond market has been growing in leaps and bounds: bond issues are on the rise; market capitalization is expanding substantially; turnover in the secondary market is surging; and the number and variety of market participants and instruments are rapidly increasing. After more than 10 years of development, China’s bond market is now the third largest in the world at about RMB 35.89 trillion, or about USD 4.24 trillion. China has two bond markets: the interbank bond market, which is regulated by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), and the Exchange bond market, which is regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC). The interbank market plays the leading role, accounting for more than 95 % of total trading volume. Commercial banks dominate trading activity in China’s interbank bond market, accounting for around 70 % of trading volume (Goldman Sachs 2015). Foreign investors may access the Chinese bond market through two programs. The first program is the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) program, which allows foreign investors access to both the Exchange bond market and the interbank bond market. The other program was launched in 2010 to allow three types of offshore institutions to invest in China’s largely closed interbank bond market. The qualified institutions include: foreign central banks, lenders in Hong Kong and Macao that have already conducted renminbi clearing, and overseas banks involved in renminbi cross-border trade settlement. When taking a look at China’s fiscal and social landscape, there is pressure to increase public expenditure to cover welfare benefits of an aging population. The population also demands higher investments in education, the health system, and labor protection. These expenditures cannot be financed merely through tax receipts. Thus, the supply of public bonds would need to rise to meet these demands (Aglietta 2007). In an attempt to boost demand for its bonds, China has also been allowing more foreign institutional investors to trade on its interbank market. The decision to eliminate quotas on interbank trading leads to opening up the bond market and the capital account, but much more will need to be done to truly develop China’s financial markets. Essential reforms require better ratings of bonds and better information management. An important feature of China’s financial development is its stock market growth since 1991. The Chinese government is highly engaged in fostering a stock market that can compete with those of developed countries. In order to achieve this objective, the Chinese Government is committed to apply reforms that affect share issue privatization (SIP), the reform of non-tradable shares, the reform of firms’ access to the capital market, the regulation of financial intermediaries, the refinement of the legal system governing the capital market, the convergence of Chinese accounting standards with IFRS (International Financial Reporting Standards), and audit market reforms. According to Megginson and Netter, 2001; Gupta, 2005; Shleifer, 1998, share issue privatization (SIP), in which the government sells shares in state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to private investors, has been the most profitable and successful method of privatization since it has contributed to increase firm’s efficiency. The development and growth of the Chinese stock market must be studied in the context of the “partial privatization” of SOEs in the 1990s. At the beginning of the 1980s, the Chinese Government launched the SOE reform aiming to decentralize the central government’s managerial decision rights in SOEs. In the following decade, the SOEs became partially privatized and began to issue new and minority shares to individual investors, who could trade their shares freely on the newly developed Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets (set up in early 1990 and 1991, respectively). The idea was to give birth to a stock market that was representative of the different geographical regions and industries in China. The central government decided which subset of SOEs was to be selected and listed. Due to this partial privatization process, the government could no longer sell controlling stake in the firms. The shares held by public investors became freely tradable on the stock market, while the shares held by the state and legal persons were still not tradable. Lu and Fu (2014) describe China’s privatization strategy as a two-step approach. The first step is “partial” privatization, which involves SOEs selling a minority stake to public investors which are listed on the stock market, while the majority of stakes are still owned by the State. The second step is known as “complete” privatization, in which the government sells its controlling rights in selected SOEs to private investors. Chinese listed companies can be grouped into SOEs controlled by state asset management bureaus (SAMBs), SOEs affiliated to the central government, and SOEs affiliated to the local government (Chen, Firth, and Xu, 2009). The question of capital account opening is difficult to answer—to what extent must the capital account be opened to induce growth without bringing on too much financial fragility? The banking system continues to be underdeveloped and is unable to effectively handle risk and return. If the capital account is liberalized and foreign capital surges into the banking system, there is a good chance that excessive risk will build up in this sector since channels for obtaining information on borrowers are insufficient. The same is true for capital inflows into the bond and equity markets, which continue to be controlled in the types of firms that can finance through these means, which is not based on risk and return per se. Capital outflows may result in the collapse of the banking system, which is dependent on funding from deposits. If the banking, equity, and bond markets were not constrained, the foreign financial inflows may help to boost growth by funding promising projects. Even so, foreign capital inflows can also result in currency overvaluation under a liberalized exchange rate regime and repress export growth. Further, even though economic theory states that foreign finance will expand the funds available for investment and growth in a developing country, the relationship between external finance and growth is in practice not guaranteed. For example, Aizenmann, Pinto and Radziwill (2004) find that for the 1990s, countries that self-financed enjoyed higher growth rates than countries that had lower levels of self-financing. Prasad, Rajan, and Subramanian (2007) provide evidence that developing countries that rely more on foreign finance have not grown faster in the long run. The question of capital controls and their growth-distance from capital account liberalization remains unresolved and we can choose to leave it out of the equation. It is possible that capital account and exchange rate liberalization can generate growth but also uncertainty and volatility, which may present negative shocks. We therefore examine the potential GDP in China’s financial sector while focusing on assessing and increasing domestic production inputs while leaving opening up reforms to later research. We now turn to the model to assess potential growth in the financial sector, given the present reform trajectory. We calculate potential GDP of the financial sector at present and compare it to the current GDP to find the output gap at the current level of reform. We also calculate potential GDP based on assumptions for labor, capital, and TFP given current reforms and then draw a comparison between the “before” and “after” reform scenarios. To calculate potential GDP, we use the production function approach followed by CBO (2001) and Roeger (2006) (and many others) which is rooted in economic theory. This uses a combination of factor inputs multiplied with the technological level. We use the Cobb-Douglas production function to illustrate potential GDP. where labor L and capital K, checked by excess capacity U

 determine production Y. Total factor productivity, TFP, is given by This equation shows to what extent factors of production are used as well as their efficiency or technological level. We use total wage bill for the financial intermediation sector as a measure of labor input, assuming that the wage bill reflects a real measure of work rather than greed. While we do know the number of employees for the financial intermediation sector and could calculate the hours worked based on this, this would also be an estimate as we would have to assume weeks and hours worked per year and week, respectively. Also, when we compare the two figures, TFP for analysis using the wage bill is more realistic than for hours worked. For simplicity, we assume constant returns to scale, which reflects China’s banking sector reality, as rigorously tested in Fu and Heffernan (2008). We use numbers from Chow and Li (2002) and Chow (2008) for the Chinese economy as a whole, which shows that elasticity of labor α is 0.4 and elasticity of capital 1-α is 0.6. For the capital stock, we use the Penn World Tables Capital Stock table for China which assumes a 3.1 % rate of depreciation. This uses the perpetual inventory method as the capital stock becomes a weighted sum of previous capital stock investments. We must still determine the capital stock in the financial sector. We approximate this by multiplying the capital stock by the ratio of the financial sector output to total output (GDP).",2

While capital outflows have stabilized since March 2016, there remain risks that such outflows could accelerate if concerns about RMB depreciation pressures intensify again or growth prospects worsen. This article attempts to examine the factors driving such outflows and the inherent policy difficulties that may have contributed to the capital flight. Policy implications are discussed when analyzing the policy challenges and dilemmas faced by the China’s authorities. The scale of the recent capital outflows from China illustrates that China is not immune from the vagaries and risks of capital flight even though its capital account is not yet fully open.Footnote 1 It indicates how quickly market sentiments can shift, particularly in response to the lack of policy clarity about what is happening in the economy and the Chinese authorities’ policy intentions. The adjustment of the RMB exchange rate in August 2015 exemplifies this phenomenon. The reform of the RMB central parity fixing mechanism on 11 August 2015, combined with China’s move to weaken the yuan’s daily reference rate by 1.9%, reverberated in financial markets worldwide as it was interpreted as an indication that China was attempting to engineer a weaker currency to bolster its exports, rather than implementing market-oriented currency reform. To calm markets, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) explained the move as a “one-off” adjustment to bring its central parity rate closer to market trading, stating that its daily fixings would be more “market oriented” from now on; however, the PBOC intervened heavily in both the onshore and offshore markets when the RMB further depreciated by another 3% (11–14 August 2015). To soothe financial jitters, top Chinese leaders like Premier Li Keqiang further reiterated that there was no basis for the continued depreciation of the RMB. In early January 2016, the financial market was again shocked by the PBOC’s move in setting the midpoint rate at RMB 6.5646 per USD, the lowest since March 2011. China’s central bank again intervened in the market to support the currency which had triggered intensified RMB depreciation expectations, large capital outflows, and significant declines in China’s foreign exchange (FX) reserves. Clearly, the inconsistency of actions and earlier public statements of no continued depreciation by China’s policymakers caused markets to remain skeptical, raising doubts about government credibility and further underscoring concerns about China’s commitment to market forces. It is apparent that poor communication of policy change has undermined the credibility of the new exchange rate regime and stoked market expectations of further RMB weakness which led to capital outflow pressures. To help anchor currency expectations and as part of a wider effort by the PBOC to be more transparent as well as to smooth the transition to a more flexible exchange rate, the trade-weighted foreign exchange indexFootnote 2 was launched on 11 December 2015, indirectly making it easier for the PBOC to guide the RMB lower against the US dollar, as it attempts to shift the heavy focus away from the bilateral (CNY/USD) rate to several “basket measures” (China clears way for further renminbi weakening 2015). Fundamentally, clear, authoritative, and consistent communications about policy objectives and how they are being achieved are important to reduce uncertainty and misalignment of public expectations. It would help contain the risks of market turbulence and also improve the credibility of the new exchange rate regime that the authorities are attempting to implement. Being a developing economy, China has to manage the transitional risks that come associated with the opening up of its economy while at the same time, balancing the benefit/risk trade-off from capital account opening and introducing more flexibility to the currency. This is not easy given the challenging global and domestic context. Improving the growth outlook is also important to stabilize capital outflows and currency expectations. Structural and institutional reforms, such as improved corporate governance in state-owned enterprises including banks, are imperative, and if reforms were to stall due to a slowing economy, capital flow and currency dynamics could become more difficult to manage and this may heighten financial risks and macroeconomic instability.",9
