For the successful European integration of Hungary, it is necessary to effectively implement the means appropriate in order to ease the differences of regional development. The improvement in the conditions of economic growth is essential for improving the cohesion of the least-developed regions. With help from the EU regional policy, the conditions of competitiveness can be improved by making the region more attractive for investors and by increasing the entrepreneurial spirit to facilitate a faster economic growth. The cohesion policy is not about redistribution of wealth but is rather about the increase in economic growth. It is not about social transfers, or subsidies spent for consumption, but instead about the provision of development resources in order to help economic growth. Essentially, the development means involved in the EU regional policy are the main factors used to promote competitiveness and economic growth at the EU level (Kengyel 2007). The possibilities for development in Hungary basically shifted to the EU-financed development assistance. This is mainly due to the state’s financial situation. This means that besides the state’s co-financing of EU-funds, there are not any budget resources remaining for developments funded solely by the state. This is why the Hungarian development policy is almost equivalent to the Hungarian National Development Plan. This tendency will continue in the period of 2007–2013 and change in the near-future cannot be expected. Instead of examining the causes of this process, it is much more important to analyse the efficiency of using the EU-subsidies. If Hungary cannot use the financial means of the EU efficiently and effectively, than the goal of cohesion and convergence to the level of the former developed countries of the EU will be much more difficult and slower.",

Over the 2002–2006 5 year period, the growth differential versus the Eurozone was of around 2–3% for CEE countries, and 3–4% for SEE countries, and widened even further in 2007, a year of sustained growth in emerging and transition economies. Despite the global slowdown forecast in 2008–2009 by most analysts, the differential is expected to remain in line with the recent trend. Therefore, the GDP per capita gap separating CEE and especially SEE countries from the Eurozone, while still high, is expected to narrow further. All the countries mentioned have been benefiting from significant advances in institutional and economic governance framework, which have fostered a remarkable path of real and nominal convergence towards EU. This paper investigates the main drivers of recent economic growth in CEE and SEE countries. The theoretical framework for the analysis is provided by the growth-accounting approach suggested by a wide strand of literature on the topic. The relative contribution made to growth by changes in inputs (capital and labour utilisation) and their combined efficiency, as represented by total factor productivity,Footnote 1 is evaluated. Recent sustained economic growth in Eastern Countries is shown to be driven both by capital accumulation and total factor productivity changes, with the latter making a major contribution.Footnote 2 In a context characterised by deep product and labour market reforms, enterprise privatisation and banking sector restructuring and by increasing international trade and financial integration, strong FDI inflows are not surprisingly found to have played a primary role in boosting productivity and sustaining long-term economic growth. The analysis allows us to draw some conclusions. As growth determinants—and productivity changes in particular—are expected to continue playing a major role in years to come, CEE and SEE countries should continue to record higher average economic growth than the Eurozone. Furthermore, as the main growth drivers are effectively the same as those shaping the convergence path, these countries are also expected to keep catching up with the Eurozone. The nominal convergence path towards the Eurozone is then investigated from two viewpoints: convergence towards Eurozone averages of inflation, fiscal policy, and long-term interest rates; and convergence towards Maastricht criteria in view of euro adoption. Lastly, the two main issues Governments and Central Banks will face in the process of real and nominal convergence—that is, the reconciliation of exchange rate stability with inflation convergence and with persistent current account deficits—will also be discussed.",5

Modern Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is based mostly on the role of multinational enterprises, transferring capital to foreign countries, with a similar goal in mind. Despite a decline, earlier this decade, the growth of FDI is now surpassing the growth of world trade, being an important growth engine of many countries worldwide. The importance of FDI in financing growth and investment in many countries is well documented, but its role is not easy to distinguish from the role of other factors involved, particularly the domestic ones, like governmental policies, local entrepreneurship, abundance of local input factors and similar. The main objective of this paper is to examine this role by examining the case of two emerging European countries of the CEE area.",1

In a broad sense, Gerber (1999, p. 11) defines interest groups as ‘any organization that pursues its collective goals through the political processes’. An important feature mentioned by P. Bachrach and M. S. Baratz (1970, p. 7, cited by Richardson 1993, p. 6) is the power not to make decisions in given policy areas, that is, the ability to shape decisions conforming to specific goals of the collective action. Having a certain degree of formal organizational structure, interest groups are formed by members who recognize themselves as a group with similar beliefs and goals. The literature reveals particular cases in which various types of interest groups effectively act in order to influence the political decision-making from ‘outside’ (Walker 2000, p. 103) as an indirect effort to impact upon the outcomes of a specific policy decision or from ‘inside’, directly persuading public officials to take some form of action. Various authors argue for the efficiency or failure of specific pressure groups’ outcomes, but separately, either in the American system or at the European level (Martin and Ross 2001; Rucht 2001; Guiraudon 2001; McLaughlin and Jordan 1993; Wilson 1993). This article aims to make a comparison between the European interest groups and the American groups. It proposes to compare the pathways of influence of collective action from the two political systems and to establish the institutional framework in which each of them plays the role of interests’ aggregation. The first section focuses on the means of influencing the political arena, highlighting the main characteristics which differentiate the two types of political actors. The second one concentrates on the target of influence, i.e. the institutional level at which the lobbying process can be effective if the players know the rules of the political game.",
15,2,Transition Studies Review,11 July 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-008-0008-3,The Impact of Europeanization upon Party Systems in Slovakia and Romania,September 2008,Aron Octavian,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Recent political developments in Central-Eastern European countries have confirmed that the impact of European integration has transformed institutional arrangements and development trajectories. The European Union (the EU) has provided incentives for the transformation of decision-making practices, and more importantly it has induced the necessary conditions for change in political parties discourse and agenda. The literature in the field of European studies defines Europeanization as a two-way process: first as a ‘top-down’ perspective in the sense of the impact of European institutions toward national policies and structures and second, as the influence of the national state in the configuration of European policies and the institutional framework (McGowan 2005, p. 988). In this regard, this paper refers to Europeanization as the impact of the EU enlargement on parties’ behavior, interaction and discourse. However, it must be noted that the administrative, legislative and institutional adaptation of acquis communautaire is not the subject of this paper: the EU membership assumes that all requirements of the membership are satisfied (Harris 2004, p. 185) and in this regard the specialized literature has proved in the last years that Europeanization is highly influential. Rather the interest of this paper is to survey how Europeanization became incorporated in the rationale of party discourse, identity and policies in the Central-Eastern countries in the pre-accession period. For the purpose of this paper, two countries will be the subject of inquiry: Slovakia and Romania. This choice is justified in the light of the following arguments: first, the literature in the field suggests that Europeanization has been a positive and contributory factor in the slow transformation of Slovakia (Harris 2004, p. 185) and, therefore, this country case can provide significant insights about how Europeanization transforms the party system. The second country choice can be explained by the assertion that is also relevant to survey Europeanization in states like Romania or Bulgaria. In these states, EU integration has been an important explanatory variable of the country’s political trajectory in the last years and, accordingly, it is relevant to understand what kind of impact has had this process upon parties. Where and when exactly did the change occur? What kind of adjustments in parties’ behavior can be attributed to European issues? Finally, it must be noted that the Slovak party system is characterized by a structural instability and the state is based upon nationalistic mobilization (Harris 2004, p. 185). Concerning this, the Slovak system resembles the Romanian one and in this way a comparative approach between the two countries can offer meaningful insights about Europeanization in Central-Eastern Europe. In making the case of Europeanization in the Slovak party system, it is necessary to emphasize that this phenomenon involves changes in the political, social and economic sphere (Harris 2004, p. 206). Following this statement, this paper argues that Europeanization can be regarded as a second transition after the shift from the Communist system to a fully independent democracy. Concerning this, parties in Eastern and Central Europe did not simply adapt the process of European Integration: they have been part of it (Enyedi 2005, p. 1). There are a number of distinguishing characteristics of Slovak politics in comparison with the other Visegrad countries: the structural instability of the party system aggravated by ethnic division in the party structure; the Slovak “unconventional liberal democracy” between the period of 1993 and 1998 (Pridham 2001 cited by Harris 2004, p. 208) and the relative international isolation which led initially Slovakia to exclusion from the EU and Euro-Atlantic structures (Harris 2004, p.189). For the purpose of highlighting the Slovak party configuration, it is important to illustrate the Parliamentary election results from the early 1990s, when the shift from the Communist system occurred. Accordingly, Table 1 shows that HZDS was Slovakia’s most successful party between 1992 and 2002, when it became part of the opposition. HZDS obtained just 8.79% of the total votes in the 2006 elections, whereas the most successful party turned out to be SMER with 29.15%. Despite of this, HZDS continued to be present in the government due to the fact that 76 seats were required to form a majority government and SMER, which had won just 50 seats, proposed and formed a coalition with HZDS and the Slovak National Party (SNS). Although European membership has been a central theme of Slovak politics since the 1989 revolution (Haughton 2005, p. 1) HZDS discourse and actions between 1994 and 1998 resulted in the EU’s rejection of Slovakia on political grounds at the Luxemburg Summit in 1997. In these four years, HZDS led the Slovak government by a combination of nationalist policies, disregarding often the rule of constitutional democratic policies. Moreover, the party’s behavior and actions deteriorated the country’s external image, causing therefore the rejection of Slovakia from international organizations such as the EU and NATO (Henderson 1999 cited by Haughton 2004, p. 184). Other parties which were at the time present in the Slovak Parliament did not promote consensus about the need of radical marketization policies nor did they advocate a strong European position. At this point it becomes clear that until 1998, the party discourse and behavior were mainly driven by domestic concerns. After the 1998 elections, it can be argued that the Slovak parties started to provide clear indications about commitment toward European integration. However, in these circumstances, how did Europeanization changed the parties’ discourse, interaction and behavior? Did Europe become a rhetorical tool in order to gain electorate or did Europe become a relevant instrument for shaping policies and party competition? In order to answer these questions two remarks must be made. First, after 1998 Slovakia made significant steps toward the consolidation of democracy by improving the procedures and the process of elections (Henderson 2002 cited by Harris 2004, p. 194). Second, the most important aspect of the 2002 elections was the importance given to the accession to European Union (Harris 2004, p. 194). Starting with the 2002 campaign, it can be argued that a clear debate about Europe emerged. Prior to 2002, when the issue of the EU was invoked, it was only a tool for political parties to attack each other (Haughton 2005, p. 11). Nonetheless, from 2002 the EU began to shape not only the parties discourse but also their configuration. In this regard, the European integration was the main factor which influenced the popular party SMER’s decision not to form a coalition with HZSD in 2002. With the improbability of HZSD to return to power and with the perceived likelihood that Slovakia will become a member of the EU, the debate turned from European integration to what each party wanted to obtain from European membership. With some minor exceptions (e.g. Slovak Democratic and Christian Union Party), the manifestos of the major parties did not offer unconditioned support for the EU, but at the same time these manifestos did not argue against European integration (Haughton 2005, p. 11). The examples of Christian Democratic Movement (KDH) and the Communist Party of Slovakia (KSS) illustrate the new European debate. KDH was one of the parties which created the Slovak Democratic Coalition (SDKU) in 1998. Later on, the KDH members within SDKU split into two factions, one of which renounced their KDH membership and joined SKDU, the others remained in KDH. Whereas SKDU is a principled supporter of the EU, the KDH, due to its traditional, Catholic profile, began to articulate conditioned support, demonstrated by its sponsorship of a parliamentary motion in early 2003 declaring the sovereign right of member states to decide on cultural and ethical issues (Haughton 2005, p. 12). What matters for KDH is not simply joining the EU, but what type of union Slovakia is joining and whether she will flourish or not, a sentiment encapsulated in one of the party’s 2002 election slogans ‘not just enter, but also to participate. (Haughton 2005, p. 12). The second example is represented by the Communist Party of Slovakia (KSS). In their election manifesto, the party advocated that joining the EU will not harm the building of socialism in the country. Nonetheless, although the KSS promoted a positive vote in the accession referendum, the party MPs voted against ratification in the Slovak Parliament. Such a behavior can be interpreted as a conflict between the genuine support for integration and the ideological hostility toward the EU within the party (Haughton 2005, p. 13). However, it seems that other parties expressed their contingent support for the EU from opportunistic and strategic positions: The attitudes held by parties toward EU membership may be a conjunctural-opportunistic stance developed in response to short-term tactical and medium-term strategic domestic considerations (Szczerbiak and Taggart 2004 cited by Haughton 2005, p. 12). The Slovakian party SMER, formed in 1999 by Slovakia’s most popular politician, Robert Fico, provides a fine example of the above-described phenomenon. During the 2002 elections, Fico took political advantage by exploiting the concerns of voters who felt that the government had been too quick to complete the EU accession chapters. Furthermore, one of SMER’s 2002 election slogan was “The EU but not with bare bottoms” (Sme 2003, cited by Haughton 2005, p. 12) accompanied by billboards which showed a row of naked posteriors. Nonetheless, even though this party had its anti-EU rhetoric, SMER advocated a ‘yes’ vote in the accession referendum and the party deputies voted in favor of the treaty when it came before the Parliament for ratification (Haughton 2005, p. 12). To sum up, it can be argued that the EU enlargement clearly shaped and changed the Slovak party discourse, competition and behavior. Obviously, the EU played a key role in the formation of the 1998 coalition and shaped afterwards the parties campaign discourse. Therefore it can be asserted that the EU enlargement both enforced limited change and created opportunities for adjustments in party configuration and discourse. The paper demonstrated that in the case of Slovakia, the EU accession process has provided incentives for shaping government coalitions and party behavior. Furthermore, the paper surveys the Romanian pre-accession period in order to determine what impact Europeanization has had upon the Romanian party system in terms of behavior, discourse and interactions. It can be argued that in Romania, the post-Communist democratization process was a domestic affair and it had little in common with European political debates (Henderson 2002, p. 5). Nonetheless, Romania began the negotiation process in spring 1999 and from that moment onwards the parties in government found that their political options were constrained by the fact that any political failure could trigger the suspension of negotiations with the EU. In this regard, the nature of the Romanian party system represents an important factor in explaining changes in parties’ practices. Romania is characterized by a multipolar party system which often generates coalition cabinets functioning like ‘boards of management’ (Blondel and Muller-Rommel 1993 cited by Brusis 2004, p. 167), where procedural rules facilitate consensual decision-making. Table 2 shows that the Romanian Government’s configuration was subject to coalition formation twice: firstly in 1996 when the Romanian Democratic Convention managed to form the Government and secondly, in 2004 when the Truth and Justice Alliance won the parliamentarian elections. The ascendance of centrist political forces in the 1996 elections certainly strengthened the reform orientation, but the parties’ discourse in elections was predominantly about the economic changes and not about Europe (Schimmelfennig 2005, p. 834). After 1999, when Romania started the accession process, the parties began to politically position themselves in line with a pro-European view. In this regard one example is the Romanian Socialist Democratic Party which after the defeat of the 1996 elections, distanced itself from its extremist mid-1990 ideological positions and it began to advocate for European integration (Henderson 2002, p. 6). Nonetheless, as Henderson (2002, p. 7) points out, in the Slovak Republic and Romania, some parties have changed their attitude toward the EU because previously, their Hard-Eurosceptic positions had caused exclusion from the government. Therefore, in 2000 and 2004 elections, PSDR intensively used pro-European slogans (e.g. Together for Europe) accompanied by billboards which displayed European symbols. However, it can be argued that in this party case, the shift in discourse and behavior is explained by opportunistic stances (e.g. increased party support) and not by commitment to the European values. Furthermore, the parties that came into power after 2004 did not manage to shape a distinct European debate. In the case of the Truth and Justice Alliance, the electoral discourse was centered on the economic development and on the anti-corruption fight. However, the EU integration was present in the parties’ discourse, but this did not have a significant impact upon outcomes. The rationale behind this assertion is that the Romanian citizens granted votes to the Truth and Justice Alliance because the previous government failed to provide an improved economic situation and not because this coalition advocated European values. At this point it can be argued that, with the exception of the Great Romania Party, European integration did not have a relevant impact upon the discourse and attitude of Romanian parties. Nonetheless, in Slovakia and Romania, the two nationalist parties, SNS and Great Romania Party, came to be considered ‘uncoalitionable’ by the other parties due to the likelihood that their inclusion in the government would have negative effects upon their countries’ integration (Henderson 2002, p. 7). However, the exclusion of the Great Romania Party from governmental coalition can be regarded as the only visible effect of Europeanization on the party system. To sum up, it is important to emphasize that the Romanian party system did not undergo real changes in terms of discourse, behavior or competition. The number of relevant parties in the national political arena remained unchanged. Nevertheless, the Romanian parties benefited from their European attachment: one example is the pre-accession collaboration of the Social Democrat Party with the European Socialists and through this cooperation PSD obtained a generalized label of quality at the national level. According with this issue, although most parties obtained in Brussels the recognition of European players, this had limited impact upon party competition and behavior (Soare 2004, p. 5).",2

Croatia’s standing on the nautical market will be even better if we manage to harmonize the development with the sustainability. The development of maritime tourism should be sustainable so that the environment is preserved for the generations to come. Maritime tourism harmfully affects the environment preservation by polluting the sea (seabed, surface and sea mass), the air, and the land (by noise, waste accumulation, fire); furthermore, by overfishing, looting amphorae on the seabed, and by general degradation of the ecosystem. The basic hypothesis of this scientific paper is the following: with scientific insights into sustainable development of maritime tourism in the Republic of Croatia, it is possible to suggest a new model for sustainable development of maritime tourism in the Republic of Croatia through the period 2007–2015. Prior to drawing up a model for sustainable development of maritime tourism in the Republic of Croatia 2007–2015, the variables of the model need to be set. By simultaneous accounts of direct and indirect growth rates of the model, it will be possible to follow the change of intensity of variable growths as well as their structural relationships.

It covers a wide range of financial services including loans, deposits, and insurance to poor households and their micro-enterprises. The evidence of the persuasive research shows the considerable role played by the microfinance institutions in improving the lives of deprived communities in several countries. The microfinance institutions which proliferated all around the world especially in developing countries are non lucrative organizations aiming at serving people excluded from the access to financial services offered by the traditional commercial banks. They have a social face and their funds arise from deposits and donations. The donors don’t estimate only the financial aspects of the microfinance institutions, but also and especially the social aspects. Given this double orientation of the microfinance institutions: financial and social, the estimation of their performance is based on the so-called double button line: financial (First Button Line) and social (Second Button Line). The importance to study the efficiency of the Mediterranean MFIsFootnote 1 could be justified by the fact that Mediterranean MFIs play an important role by completing the service offered by the commercial banks. The existence of financial and banking institutions and the microfinance institutions maintains full the financial sector and support the economic growth. This survey has two main objectives: on the one hand, to measure and to analyze the efficiency of the microfinance institutions in the Mediterranean zone and particularly to identify the determinants of efficiency, on the other hand, to fill the research gaps in this area. The fact that the microfinance institutions do not tend to operate in the same way as the commercial banks, does not mean that they are not interested by the profitability and the efficiency. The efficiency in microfinance is a question of how well an MFI allocates inputs (such as assets, staff and subsidies) to produce the maximum output (such as number of loans, financial self-sufficiency and poverty outreach). However, existing tools to estimate the performance of traditional banks cannot be appropriated to this new context. The technique of Data Envelopment Analysis is a suited tool to estimate the efficiency of MFI. This paper will be structured as follows: the second section describes briefly the main features of the Mediterranean microfinance sector. The third section reviews the literature relevant to the assessment of the microfinance institutions’ efficiency. The methodology is described in the fourth section, followed by Data and variables in section five. Section sixth presents and discusses the results of the estimated scores of efficiency.

Under these circumstances, it is possible that the New Accord on Capital acts as detonator, or at least as a joint cause, for a new wave of integrations. This is, in theory, for four different reasons: some banks, especially those that are able to adopt more sophisticated methodologies, could benefit from saving some regulatory capital. The excess regulatory capital could be put at the service of one or more acquisitions; between those banks who are “constrained” by the Accord on Capital (that is, those who are forced to decrease their assets or to raise new capital in order to comply with new regulations) and those who are not “constrained”, there could rise an interest in giving life to new aggregations, due to the relative capital advantage of the latter; the high costs, most of which are fixed costs, due to the implementation of the rating systems and the activities required for compliance with the new regulations, could push upwards the “maximum efficient dimension” which is connected to the achievement of scale economies, moving to further concentration processes; the managerial advantages of those banks that will be the first to plan, implement, manage and bring to profit a rating system will allow such banks to gain value out of less efficient banks, by acquiring the latter and improving their internal processes. Regarding the first two above-mentioned factors (excess regulatory capital and relative capital advantage) an interesting empirical comparison can be found in Hannan and Pilloff (2005) will the adoption of Basel II encourage bank merger activity? Evidence from the United States SUERF Studies 1:1–45. These authors have analysed the M&A of US banks between 1987 and 2002 and have highlighted its possible connections with the prudential surveillance regulations. As far as the specific part is concerned, the First Econometric Test inquires the estimate of the relationship between high bank capitalization and (high) acquisition activity. We can test this relationship by estimating the following: where M
i denotes the level of exogenous acquisition activity of the i- banking organization, (K/A)
i is the relevant asset ratio, and KA1, KA2,…,KAn represent the binary variables which receive value of one if (K/A)
i is in a stated range of values zero otherwise. Equation (1) shows a linear relationship between M
i and (K/A)
i, while the Eq. (2) allows the relationship to vary across different ranges of (K/A)
i but to vary within those ranges. The vector X denotes other explanatory variables that may influence observed merger activity; ε

i
 and u

i
 represent error terms. Finding that β
1 > 0 in the estimate of (1) would be consistent with the hypothesis that the acquisition activity increases when capitalization increases; moreover, finding the coefficients of KA1, KA2,…,KAn to be positive and increase as much as the capitalization increases, could bring to a further increase in the consistency of the formulated hypothesis. As underlined above, different highly capitalized banking organizations set different “buffer” levels on the minimum regulatory capital; as such, we cannot utilize estimates of (2) in order to identify critical levels of capital below which such banking organizations should be constrained. Under these circumstances, a given binary variable might properly classify an organization as able to comply with regulatory requirements, while it might incorrectly classify another organization with insufficient requirements, but with “buffer” capital (that could not properly be classified as surveillance capital being in the form of accrual) that would enable it to overcome the effective capital insufficiency with respect to the minimum requirements. Distorted estimates due to various forms of endogeneities represent an important aspect when assessing the estimated results through (1) and (2). Every characteristic of bank organizations that can influence both its own propensity to acquire (the control of) other banks, and its capitalization, can distorsively influence the relevant coefficients. In order to reduce, but unfortunately not to eliminate, such a possibility, one can also calculate some explicative variables for the year preceding the one in which the acquisition activity takes place, that is, in the case of financial variables, some suitable explicative variables are calculated at the beginning of the year in which the acquisition/merger activity is detected. It appears important to recall, at this point, that (1) and (2) have been estimated by using the set of data based on annual observations of different types of banking organizations, considered in a biperiodic time range: the first (period), between 1998 and 2002, is conceived in order to obtain the maximum benefits from the estimate on the data panel, by using only the most significant (and recent) 5 years; the second period, between 1993 and 2002, is also used with the same objective, but from a longer time perspective. The reported estimates cover both mentioned time periods and the fixed effects of the capital decisions of the banking organizations. This approach, substantially, checks that the specific characteristics of the banks that compose the data panel do not undergo variations in the considered time period. The inclusion of fixed effects eliminates in particular the potential sources of spurious correlation that could stem from the comparison between different bank organizations (particularly if both are highly capitalized). The spurious correlations, in the form of endogenous distortions, are liable to occur even if one variable that has not been observed in a certain time span influences both the merger activity and the level (even when only declared) of capitalization in terms other than what expressed in the sample of bank organizations. This type of correlation can exist, for instance, if before accomplishing the acquisition activity, the bank organizations increase their capital level. The Second Test should not be influenced by endogenous distortions but it requires a jump in the past for what concerns the sample data. Specifically, we have considered the effects on the merger and acquisition activity following the promulgation by the US Congress of the “Prompt Corrective Action” (PCA), in 1991, and the consequent introduction of more restrictive capital standards. A formalization of the test is set out as follows: let us assume that the relationship between acquisition activity and relevant capitalization of a large typical bank organization, before the approval of the PCA, was represented by: where the superscript “b” indicates that the variable (or the coefficient) pertains to the period before the approval of PCA, KADUM
b is a binary variable that takes the value of one if the capitalization was lower than the requirements foreseen by the regulation in the period in which the bank enterprise has been “constrained”, and the value of zero otherwise, and ε

i

b represents the error term. The greater incidence of this specification is represented by the fact that it allows a discrete difference in the mergering activity between “constrained” and “unconstrained” banks. We propose here below the same relationship [expressed in the (3)], after the approval of PCA, formulating it namely: where the superscript “a” refers to the period following the adoption of the PCA financial standards and all other variables (and the relevant coefficients) are defined as for (3). Please note that the coefficients are presumed identical both for (3) and for (4), coherently with the “natural” underlying experiment (constituting the reason of the represented test), represented only by the financial content and not from the underlying relationship between acquisition activity and the explicative variables that have changed through different time periods. It appears, in the light of what already stated, that there are few reasons to expect that changes in regulatory minimum requirements may affect the relationship between merger activity and the relevant determining factors. We should bear in mind that KADUM
a is a binary variable that receives the value of one if the capitalization is lower than its critical value considering the PCA limits. If this critical value is higher than the one of the previous period, then one will observe some bank organizations for which KADUM
a will take the value of zero and others for which KADUM
a will take the value of one, regardless of small (if not absent) differences in the capitalization. In other words, there will be some banks that were not initially “constrained” at a financial level before the introduction of PCA, which will become such afterwards. By subtracting (3) from (4) we obtain: If the determining factors of the acquisition activity, or those associated to the binding capital requirement, do not undergo variations with respect to time, the result will be X
a
 = X
b. When the variables reflect the macroeconomic environment (supposed invariant in the course of time), the β

2
(X
a
 − X
b) in (5) will result either zero, or within the constant term. Under these conditions, only β

1
, KADUM
a, and KADUM
b explicate the differences between the two groups of bank organizations in the politics of merger before and after PCA. It follows that (KADUM
a
 − KADUM
b) = 1 if a bank organization that was not “constrained” before the PCA, becomes such afterwards; (KADUM
a
 − KADUM
b) = 0 in the opposite case. If β

1

 < 0, implicit if the “constrained” bank organizations operate with less intensity on the front of acquisitions as opposed to the “unconstrained” banks, we obtain the simple result that banks that thought they were not “constrained” before PCA (KADUM
b
 = 0) and that become such afterwards (KADUM
a
 = 1), will experiment a sensible reduction (or a negligible increase) in the merger activity with respect to those bank organizations that remain “unconstrained” even upon approval (and application) of PCA (KADUM
a
 = 0). This prediction assumes that: β

1
(KADUM
a
 − KADUM
b), and with β

1

 < 0, the term results negative for banks that see themselves constrained to minimal financial requirements tighter after PCA, and equal to zero for all others. Under the assumption discussed above, this prediction could be tested by using a comparison (envisioned in the very far future) as regards changes in the acquisition activity in the two groups of banks (those “constrained” and those “not constrained” ex-post). This test gives the advantage to focus the present effects of a change in the financial requirements in the recent; moreover, it offers the very well known advantages connected to the applied “difference in difference” method. For greater detail, the test in object is based on the complete estimate of (5). Table 1 highlights the results of the previously discussed model in relation to the more capitalized financial organizations. According to what has been explained above, the acquisition activity has seen a certain acceleration, due to the fact that the IRB approach (internal rating based), has been adopted only by a restricted number of banking organizations, which have had to deal anyway with two problems deriving from such adoption: “excess regulatory capital” and “relative capital advantage”. “excess regulatory capital”, let us recall, refers to the capital surplus, in comparison with what is imposed by the regulatory limits, used by those banking organizations (A—IRB), as a vehicle for acquisitions; “relative capital advantage”, instead, refers to the relative asymmetry towards capital, represented by a higher or lower starting capitalization that the US banks (considered as sample) could (or could not) benefit from. Given all what has been described above, it emerges clearly enough that those banks that dispose of capital in excess with respect to regulatory limits are actually more active in starting new acquisitions (even if the effect is more appreciable if one considers the number of deals rather than their dimension); moreover, an analysis of the behaviour of banking organizations before and after the introduction of the “Prompt Corrective Action” (1991) has shown that, in presence of new surveillance regulations that alter the financial requirements, those banks that are “constrained” by the new requirements reduce their propensity to exogenous growth, while the remaining banks remain more active.",

He was elected at the second round, on February 24th 2008, with 53.37% votes and his victory provided new hopes for negotiations to be started (Hadjicostis 2008). His whole political campaign was based on the Cyprus problem and the candidates’ proposals for reuniting the island, in particular following the rejection of the UN-backed reunification plan in a referendum in 2004 and the end of the negotiations between Greek and Turkish Cypriot side during Mr. Papadopoulos’s presidency. Even during the election campaign, Mr. Christofias underlined the necessity for the Greek Cypriot side to find a solution to their problem that would “reunite the state, the institutions and the economy”. For this reason, he has established strong ties with the Turkish Cypriot labour movement and with the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (KKTC) President Mehmet Ali Talat, a Republic established in 1983 and recognized as a state only by Turkey. After his election, he stated: “I extend a hand of friendship to the Turkish Cypriot people and their leadership”, thanking their political leader Talat for congratulating him and affirming that he looked forward to “substantial cooperation for the benefit of both communities”. Nevertheless, the vote of his left-wing supporters perpetuated internal division, continuing to leave the Turkish Cypriot community with no international recognition, while the Greek Cypriots joined the European Union. Indeed, now he has to demonstrate his intention to restart future negotiations and to solve other issues, such as the territorial claims, the return of property to Greek and Turkish Cypriot refugees, the presence of Turkish troops in the North and the constitution of a unified state. All the analysts have confirmed that he is not a traditional Communist as we might believe, especially for his progressive, social-democratic and ultimately pro-European policy. In fact, some experts of important strategic allies such as US and Great Britain, reacted to his election stating that the sought-after solution will also improve the prospects for a diplomatic meeting between NATO allies, Greece and Turkey, stabilize the eastern Mediterranean region and advance Turkey’s accession to the EU.",2

In this paper, we analyze the anticipated impact of EU accession on the new member states. We examine how the prerequisites for consideration for accession and the negotiation process itself led to changes in two important aspects of accession: exchange rate volatility and the quality of economic institutions policies. We focus on these phenomena for two reasons: they are explicit accession criteria and the literature on economic growth indicates that they can have a significant effect on both the level and conditional convergence of per capita GDP. The prospect of EU negotiations that arose early in the transition era might have been a strong impetus for reform. Our evidence is that economic reforms began earlier and were stronger in the accession countries than in other transition countries. We then show that these reforms are important determinants of economic growth. As a result, the prospect of EU membership and the ensuing negotiations were a strong impetus to growth in these countries. Moreover, further expansion of the EU may already be having an impact on reform and growth in countries like Turkey and the Ukraine. Our results indicate that the pull of EU membership sets these countries apart from others that are otherwise similar. In the next section of the paper, we provide an institutional background illustrating the two-way causality nexus between accession and preparations for negotiation and improvements in economic policies and institutional quality of candidate countries. We then describe our measures of institutional quality and improved policy and show how they impact on growth. In the subsequent section, we provide evidence on the dynamics of exchange rate volatility and of various indicators of quality of institutions and macroeconomic policies for a subgroup of transition candidatesFootnote 1 before and after the start of the negotiating process. Finally, we test econometrically for the impact of these enlargement criteria on levels and growth of real per capita GDP. We find that enlargement candidates have a higher performance in terms of reduction of exchange rate volatility and improvement in institutional quality from the period in which they started to prepare for admission. Since in our estimates these two variables are shown to affect growth of per capita GDP significantly, we conclude that the enlargement process had a significant effect on their economic development.",

It sheds light on the actual economic dynamics of the phenomenon of industrial emergence, especially on how firms and the industry in the two countries have followed specific technological and competition versus partnerships strategies, the achievement and outcome of those strategies, the way companies both domestic and foreign in the car business have been able to catch up with the standards set by world leading companies. The comparison equally shows the trajectories of exiting from former centralised models of industrialisation. In that respect, elements of path dependency as well as early choices explain the contrasted evidence. Where China still shows some patterns of centralised administration of the sector (in localisation of investment or organisation of industrial partnerships for instance), India largely shows a companies-driven trajectory of competition and diversification despite some remaining factors of protection. Finally, this sector serves as a good illustration of the linkage between the gradual and phased out opening of economies on the one hand, and the companies’ objectives and steps of industrial catching-up on the other. This directly relates to the current question of the existence or not of some room for these industries to take significant market shares of the world market. While India develops a modern industry (that is, partly autonomised, partly integrated to the world industry), in China, the automobile firms conversely show, up to now, a limited autonomisation from their international partners (both technologically and financially). We base our argument on the differences in the characteristics of industrial partnerships in the two countries. In China, Joint Ventures (JV) have largely remained, on the Chinese side, administrative partnerships and automobile Chinese firms are on their way to become holdings more than industrial firms. In India, JVs have more generally speaking revolved around industrial contents, know-how along with markets. Endogeneisation has developed in a bigger way, from conception to production. We attempt in this paper to relate these different outcomes to the different modes of opening of the sector in the two countries. We briefly describe the industrial trajectories, actors, and markets of the sector in the two countries in the following section, then proceed with the industrial models and strategies to exit from the former system in ""Industrial Models: A Contrasted Experience"" and conclude with setting the perspective of the world car industry and likely respective positioning of China and India in ""Chinese and Indian Automobile Sectors in the Global Industry"".",20

Has Russia moved to a Western political and economic structure or not? Has it shifted to a democratic system? There are no definitive answers to these questions. Russia is widely referred as an eternal crossroad between the West and the East; the topic of the nation finding its own, the ‘third’ way, has always been popular in Russia. The ‘lack of democracy’ from a Western understanding, extreme centralisation of Russia’s vast political and administrative system and other similar shortcomings which are now commonly discussed, cannot be labelled as ‘bad’, because it is unclear whether the usual Western models of democracy and societal structures would work in Russia, for Russia and for the Russian people. Regardless, foreign players who deal with Russian partners and have to operate in the vast geographic expanses of the nation are often puzzled with the rules and conditions of play and the processes of decision-making by their Russian partners. The processes of the Kyoto Protocol ratification and Joint Implementation (JI) introduction are not exceptions with this. Kyoto Protocol ratification and JI are the foci of this paper, which aims to explain the history, the current situation and future perspectives with regard to these processes and to inform interested parties about the problems with and potential for JI in Russia. The analysis in this paper is based on examination of scholarly publications, mass media sources, government documents, legislation, business and NGO responses and UNFCCC website material. Valuable information has been drawn from the publications on the pilot phase of JI: Activities Implemented Jointly (AIJ). JI and AIJ are the core activities under the Kyoto Protocol for the Russian Federation involving the business sector, and it primarily involves the oil, gas and energy industry sector. Large companies from this sector are major stakeholders in Russian political and economic decision-making. The first section of this paper describes the significance of the energy and mineral resources sector in Russia and its ‘marriage’ with the Russian Government. The second section tells about the history of ratification of the Kyoto Protocol in Russia, pointing out that ‘apolitical’ IPCC findings have led to a highly politicised Kyoto treaty. It also discusses the Russian internal players involved in Kyoto ratification, including business, government, politicians and scientists, and explains their rationales for ratification/non-ratification of the Protocol and gives the reasons for ultimate ratification of the Protocol by Russia. The next section narrows the focus of the paper to JI processes. It argues that proper institutional and legislative frameworks are the most important precondition for successful implementation of the Kyoto flexibility mechanism, JI, and overviews the problems connected to them during the phase of AIJ and at the current time. Then, other problems with JI in Russia are considered: first, those which are more connected to companies’ activities such as implementation level problems and then, those connected with the overall economic climate and political situation in Russia. The external situation to Russian JI problems, such as difficulties connected with JI at UNFCCC, although significant, is not covered as it is beyond the scope of this paper. Finally, this paper shifts from discussion of problems with JI to the future potential for JI: incentives for Russian companies to host JI projects and state-of-the-art JI are described. The last section overviews some recent trends in energy and climate change mitigation policy in Russia, attempts to predict the future of JI and Kyoto Protocol implementation in Russia and summarises the findings of the research.",1

How will the country’s accession to the EU influence the evolution of such imbalance during the years to come? The current account deficit has been increasing ceaselessly beyond 2002 (see Fig. 1 in Appendix). It maintained the deepening trend as a share of gross domestic product (GDP). Its proportions became worrying ever since 2006 when it soared to over 10% of the GDP. By the end of 2007 it was estimated to be about 14% of the GDP (some 16.9 billion Euros in absolute value) by the National Bank of Romania (2008). At a first glance, the concern related to the current account deficit might seem to be the effect of ignoring the operation mode of an open economy. In such an economy, when the domestic savings do not cover the expenses (investments), the economy could find the resources necessary to finance the difference abroad, either in the international financial markets or by attracting foreign portfolios or direct investments (Krugman and Obstfeld 2006). Even if, in theory, such an assessment is a correct one, in reality, continuing to consume more than one’s own incomes would have a worrying impact from a certain level. The main reason is that this consumption charges the incomes of the future generations, who shall however have to pay for the current expenses in time. Additionally, building up foreign debts on the grounds of internal or external deficits up to a certain proportion (of the GDP), might have an impact on the country’s financial stability in both the medium and long term, as well as on the perceptions of foreign investors with respect to the country risk. Also, if the international background were to evolve unfavourably on the overall world economy (just like the situation at the beginning of 2008), or in relation to international financial markets, a large deficit of current account would become an imbalance difficult to cope with not only in the long term, but even in the short term. Romania is an open economy—since September 2006 its capital flows are totally free, while its total foreign trade has exceeded 75% of GDP (Isărescu 2007)—meaning that the above theoretical assertions apply to our country as well. Romania’s current stage of economic modernization and permanent growth might lead to the understanding that the existence of a large deficit of current account is no issue at all. However, as Cojanu and others (2006) put it: “…Romania obviously has a problem related to the level of its savings, which is reflected in the current account deficit…while a deep decreasing of its savings ratio triggers up the problem of just how sustainable the financing of investments from external savings proves to be (capital inflows)”. If we were to also consider the fact that investments are oriented to the real estate market rather than towards production activities, the imbalance between savings—investments becomes even more worrying. The deepening of the deficit during 2007 compared to the previous year and against an international background characterized by volatile financial markets, caused Romania to be sanctioned by certain rating agencies. The Fitch Agency reduced the rating of Romania, at the beginning of 2008, reckoning that its perspectives were heading towards the “negative”: “The current account deficits of Romania, Bulgaria and of the Baltic countries have deepened down to worrying levels with respect to current standards or to the historical ones in the international markets”. The major arguments were that under the present conditions any attempt at collecting the resources meant to cover such a deficit is more difficult. At the same time, the unfavourable international background might cause significant reductions of foreign capital inflows, while the domestic area could be inflicted by expensive macroeconomic adjustments. Given such a situation, we have below reviewed this subject in detail, without claiming to have spotted all the causes generating the deficit, nor all the solutions meant to decrease it. We have merely tried to see how the future progress of the deficit will be influenced by the country’s accession to the EU, in certain points. The study only refers to 2006 (in more detail) and 2007 (to a lesser extent, due to less statistical information available at the end of April 2008), but it takes into consideration the longer-term trends of reviewed phenomena. We intend to investigate three aspects enabling us to figure out an answer to the question opening this paper: (1) the major causes of the deficit; (2) how the latter is being covered, and (3) how sustainable the deficit would prove on both short and medium term, upon the country’s accession to the EU.",

The recent accession of a large number of Eastern and Central European countries, including some Balkan countries, is the second step of their integration to the EC. What was thought to be trade between two blocks of countries 20 years ago is gradually becoming trade within an enlarging Union. Among the Balkan countries, Slovenia, (although not strictly speaking a Balkan country) was the only one to join the EC in 2003. Bulgaria and Romania became full members in 2007, while the remaining countries follow. The same process of integration is followed for the Western Balkan countries, even with a notable delay. This process is initiated by the Stabilisation and Association Agreements between the EC and the countries under consideration. Stabilisation and Association Agreements are similar to Europe Agreements, launching inter alia, a Free Trade Area, between the two parties. The first Stabilisation and Association Agreements were signed with FYROM (2001) and Croatia (2001). These Agreements entered into force in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Since then 2006 the remaining Western Balkan countries have signed the Agreements under consideration. The estimated earliest possible date of their entering into force is 2008. During the early transition period of the 1990s, it is difficult to identify the patterns and dynamics of trade since completely opposite forces operated, with the Western Balkan countries moving on the basis of inertia and most simply abandoning the patterns of the past by cutting off their imports from their former Eastern partners. However, they did prove to be very successful in placing their products in the markets of their new Western ones. This process is reflected, inter alia to their intra-industry trade flows with the EC. The purpose of this paper is to apply the theory of intra-industry trade to vertically differentiated products in a Free Trade Area context. It takes into account two countries of the EC, Germany and Greece, and a third country as a Western Balkan country. It is assumed that Germany is the most technologically advanced country while the Balkan country is the least technological advantaged one. Greece is in an intermediate position. Based on this assumption the theoretical analysis which follows indicates first that an expansion in intra-industry trade will occur under the Free Trade Area regime, launched by the Stabilisation and Association Agreements signed between the EC and the Western Balkan countries. The analysis also indicates that the benefits associated with this process will be unevenly spread between Germany and Greece. The second part of this paper examines the actual level of intra-industry trade between the Western Balkan countries and the EC. The level and the trend of intra-industry trade between two Eastern Balkan countries, Romania and Bulgaria, member-states of the EC since 2007 and which reflect the provisions of Europe Agreements are also investigated.",3

These perceptions appear, at first glance, broadly supported by data compiled by the World Bank.Footnote 1 Figure 1 shows the results of a survey which measures the effectiveness of government to engage in public sector activities. The figure shows that Ukrainian and Moldovan government services are, according to the survey data, more effective than most Former Soviet countries—but much less effective than their Eastern European counterparts in countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic. One implication of relatively low government effectiveness has been an inability to control corruption. Looking at control of corruption indicators shown in Fig. 2, Ukraine and Moldova are roughly as capable (or slightly more capable) in fighting corruption than other former Soviet Union countries—but much less able to control of corruption than the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. Moldovan and Ukrainian “Government Effectiveness” compared with other countries Comparing Ukraine and Moldova’s “Control of Corruption” with other countries This article attempts to provide an academic background on practitioner work in designing an anti-corruption programme at the Transdnistrian border—allowing the reader to “look under the hood” of an anti-corruption programme and see some of the academic considerations in anti-corruption programme design.Footnote 2 The first part of this article will provide an estimate of the scale of corruption along the Transdnistrian border—showing an economic methodology used to estimate corruption in two particular services—border guard and customs—in Ukraine and Moldova. The second part of the article presents the problems with current anti-corruption programme design (particularly those relying on legislative changes and action plans) The third part of the article discusses a risk-management approach to fighting corruption—showing how authorities can fight corruption without increasing the regulatory burden which actually increases corruption. The final section concludes by raising questions for further research. This paper discusses the fight against corruption focusing on two specific government services—the border guard service and customs service—in Ukraine and Moldova; in a very specific geographical region—the Transdnistrian region. At the time of this writing, the political situation surrounding the geographical area between the Dniestr River and the Ukrainian border remained uncertain (as will be briefly discussed in this article) For the purposes of this article, Transdnistria shall refer to the region in along the Ukrainian-Moldovan border and not to the political entity occupying the Transdnistrian area.

Official development assistance (ODA) provided by these countries exceeded 0.08–0.13% of their gross national incomes in 2007. Although still far from aid levels provided by such mature and well established donors as France, the United Kingdom or Sweden, it is undoubtedly a noteworthy achievement in such a short time after the transition from socialism. The Visegrád countries are however not new donors in the international development regime: Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary all had foreign aid and technical cooperation policies with developing countries during the Communist era. Hungarian technical assistance from the 1970s and 1980s for example, especially engineering expertise, is still fondly remembered in parts of North-Africa and the Middle East, as well as some countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. However, during the transition period these development policies were suspended, and the Visegrád countries turned from being aid donors to aid recipients. It was not until the early 2000s that the V4 countries restarted their international development policies, which are now heavily influenced by Western European practices. Our paper argues that the current re-emerging international development policies of the V4 countries cannot simply imitate Western European practices in the short to medium term, as these policies are also heavily influenced by the historical and economic backgrounds of the Visegrád countries. In other words, the current international development policies of the V4 countries exhibit a certain degree of path dependency, influenced both by their Communist era foreign aid policies and their earlier history, as well as by certain characteristics of the transition process itself. In order to understand the persistence of these traits, the paper uses the theory of path dependant institutions and transition as an analytical framework and argues that through the interaction between the imitation of Western development policies and the legacies of the past a new, distinctly Central and Eastern European stream has emerged in international development cooperation. The paper identifies three areas where path dependency is present to some extent in today’s foreign aid policies of the V4 countries: the selection of aid recipient partner countries; aid policies, structures and aid levels; non-state actors as well as social awareness of international development and poverty issues. We concentrate on the Visegrád countries because they have the most visible foreign aid policies, and they were the frontrunners in initiating economic reforms in the early 1990s (Fidrmuc et al. 2002). The paper is structured as follows: the first section discusses some conceptual issues concerning path dependency in the transformation process. The second section presents the main features of past and present foreign aid policies in the V4 countries in a historical perspective. Sections “Partner Countries”, “Aid Levels and Policies” and “Non-State Actors and Public Support” analyse the three aspects of current foreign aid policies mentioned above where a certain degree of path dependency is identifiable. Section “Conclusions” concludes the paper.",16

Exactly a decade has passed since the severe 1998 crisis and now we can start analysing the path taken by this vast country undoubtedly considered a global player of the International Community. Kremlinology seemed to be dead for good, but recently it has been brought up again to understand the everlasting “Russian Enigma”. The Russian Federation is playing on the international chessboard with two opposing approaches that often overlap each other. These two strategies summarize in a simplistic way the multifaceted tendencies of this country, but their different mix represents a crude description of the range of the Russian conducts. The first approach is the hard one which includes the use or the threat of the use of force, the rearmament run and the tight relations with the “Rogue States”. The second one is the method embodied by the soft-spoken Dmitri Medvedev, who speaks of a Russia open to the market, ready to receive the benefits of globalization and sensitive to the development of a civil society. In this work we will examine only the first part, and particularly the new interest in Military Spending. We will try to verify the credibility of the military modernization plans, which are going to take place in the next few years, not through political analysis, but rather through figures from the most authoritative sources in the field. “How much should we concern ourselves with the Russian return in the military sector?”. This is the issue of our work which we will try to answer in the following paragraphs.",2

After the annus mirabilis of 1989 the country was expected to set an example for the other countries in transition in the entire region of former Soviet satellites. After nearly two decades, the question has been sharply raised how did Hungarians manage to make such a mess of it all? Why Hungarians failed to retain and capitalize on the initial advantage and positive evaluation that it had at the outset? This is also the question asked by Publius Hungaricus in the columns of Index,Footnote 1 by intellectuals, students, workers and politicians throughout the country and, not only in Hungary. Outside its borders in London or Brussels, and in the new member states that Hungarians once spoke patronisingly about (like Slovakia, Romania and even in EU candidate Croatia), the same question is being raised. “I am concerned for Hungary,” said John PalmerFootnote 2 in a conversation in the summer of 2006, months before the autumn riots. “What’s happened to all of you?” asked Zarko Puhovski,Footnote 3 with honest curiosity and sympathy at the Savaria International Summer University in the summer of 2007. The list of examples could be extended, but up until now, no clear answer to these questions has been forthcoming, and as long as there is no answer, there is no way out. The deterioration itself was neither sudden nor unexpected. To be sure, there were and are people who sounded the alarm, but their voices were not strong enough and did not crystallize into a coherent critique or lead to wider social discourse in search of solutions. This is primarily a symptom of the weakness of civil society and democracy. Our assumption is that not only the economy but the political class and society are facing severe crises which need to be addressed. Without an adequate diagnosis it is difficult to prescribe the necessary therapy. This therapy is not going to be an easy cure. Complex, comprehensive social, economic and political problems, which swell into a crisis, are unlikely to succumb to charlatan tricks or magic spells. No one can deny that Hungarian society made a poor showing in the first 4 years of EU membership. The reasons for the series of failures and the accompanying bad conscience have never been systematically identified. The institutional structures and the service-providing system of the one time party state have been left, essentially intact or undergone only cosmetic surgery to make them fit the style of the new era. In so far as they were subjected to radical reform, by one or another of the new governments, this took the form of pseudo-reforms or dictatorship without consensus or social support. The outcome was either a rapid regression to the original state of affairs or a scene of raging reform which also caused the present cluster of pathological symptoms. Hungarian society and the political and economic class, who now have a democratic mandate to lead the country, were largely (and still are) unprepared for deep European integration. Instead of trying to understand and utilize the new opportunities opened up for society and the Central European region as a whole, they carried on where the party state had left off. Regrettably, there were many areas where this proved possible. Few valid answers were found to the challenges and problems of globalization as well. The ineptitude and passivity of the media and the political class did not help to submit the possible answers to the challenges of globalisation to open public debate. Various disintegrated segments of Hungarian society stand helpless, baffled, increasingly frustrated and sometimes shamefully and with rage, the jumbled mess of phenomena surrounding the robust processes of European integration, globalization and social and economic transition. The only exception to this general frustration is constituted by a narrow economic and financial elite, which has shown no long term vision for the sake of the country as a whole. They have clearly not even come to appreciate how crucial, indeed, inevitable, it is to take social responsibility, even though this is becoming an ever more inalienable part of the day-to-day activity of any self-respecting multi-national company. The thought of partnership between the Prince, the Merchant and the Citizen has failed to touch the Hungarian political and economic class to any significant depth.",4
15,4,Transition Studies Review,10 December 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-008-0043-0,"Export, Import and Economic Growth: The Case of Transition Economies",February 2009,Hakan Çetintaş,Salih Barişik,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The relationships between export and economic growth have been a subject of much interest in the development and growth literature. The neoclassical view argues that there is a strong relationship between export expansion and economic growth, and that export expansion is one of the main determinants of growth. This causality from export to economic growth has been labeled in the literature as the export-led growth hypothesis. The export-led growth hypothesis suggests that export growth leads to higher economic growth through such means as facilitating the exploitation of economies of scale by specialising in production (Helpman and Krugman 1985), relieving the foreign exchange constraint (McKinnon 1964), enhancing productive efficiency by increasing the degree of competition (Balassa 1978), and promoting the diffusion of technical knowledge (Grossman and Helpman 1991). Growth performance of Asian Countries can be considered as a good example of export-led growth (compared to Latin American and African countries). These newly industrializing countries—in particular, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, Taiwan, Malaysia and Thailand—have doubled their living standards every 10 years. The World Bank perceives the experiences of these countries as a model for development (Giles and Williams 2000). However, the support for export-led growth is not universal. Experiences particularly in East and Southeast Asian countries are criticized as they are rare in many respects, and attention is drawn to the point that these experiences are not absolutely applicable to other countries. On the other hand, it has also been put forward that the belief that “export-led growth policies bolster economy” in less developed countries may not result in sustainable economic growth due to the volatility and unpredictability in the world markets. Other inquiry that has been put forward is that markets of developed countries are not large enough to mass export demand of less developed countries. For this reason, some argue that protective strategies, i.e. import substitution, are a more suitable trade policy for less developed or developing countries compared to internationally open strategies (Giles and Williams 2000). In addition to these criticisms, opponents of the export-led growth hypothesis argue that compared to the export factor, other factors play a more important part in economic growth; since the less developed economies have to increase their production capacities before they increase their export volume. Growth in such countries may result from an increase in the number of basic inputs or improvement of productivity of the production factors, or both. Growth in production promotes diversification and improvement of capabilities upon adoption of division of labor and new technologies, and it also can increase national production-based export efforts for more extensive activity and competition strength. Since import substitution policies increase the dependence on short term capital to achieve continuing imports, countries adopting such these policies were deeply affected by crises in the 1980s. Due to the effects of the crises, the belief in inward growth strategy was replaced to the export-led growth strategy in the middle of the 1980s (Bruton 1989) In many hypothesis, the importance and the effects of exports on economic growth were emphasized. During this period, the economists had suggested development strategies that aim to cancel market promotions and trade obstacles, and to allow foreign competition to enter the markets. The same suggestions had been proposed by the IMF, the World Bank and other multilateral institutions, and they also granted financial aids. Between 1989 and 1991, a rapid transition process to market economy started as a result of political power shift observed in some European and Asian countries. In 27 countries, referred to as transition economies” as well, comprehensive reform packages aimed at transition to market economy were put into effect. International openness and convertibility had formed the basis for these reform packages (Edwards 1993). The trade relationships of transition countries have surprisingly changed at the last decade. After the liberalization, some transition countries have removed trade restrictions immediately, but opening of the markets have given rise to the rapid increase of prices, decrease of real income. Consequently, they have given rise to the selective trading handicaps to be brought in once again. On the other hand, EU and WTO memberships and other selective trade agreements have raised the expectation that the international trade has a crucial effect on the economic development of these countries once again (Dawson and Hubbard 2004). Contrary to Asian economics, there are not so many studies analyzing trade-growing nexus in these countries due to the fact that transition countries pass to the new market economy. There are only few studies testing the export-led growth hypothesis in these countries (Dawson and Hubbard 2004; Awokuse 2007). Unlike the other studies, in this study, the relationships between export, import and economic growth have been analyzed by using panel unit root, panel cointegration and panel causality tests. The study is organized as follows. Empirical literature is explained in the second part and data and methodology are clarified in the third part.",44

This summary is not, and even cannot be all-inclusive as transitology has many approaches to different views and to different methods that all of which cannot be included. Moreover, this classification is arbitrary and it is following the structure of our analysis and our premise is that our only aim is to find methods to answer the questions which were formulated in the first part of this analysis. Hence we focus on different views in literature instead of making a full literature review. According to our first separation we make a distinction between evolutionist and functionalist approaches. These terms are arbitrary so in order to make it clear these terms will be clarified. The evolutionist school contains studies which emphasize the speciality of transition, in other words, the different characteristics of transition countries. These specialities are the results of their different development paths and adaptations compared with Western European countries. These specialities have a huge impact on the next periods of transition. The examples used in this article for this school of viewpoint include Bruszt and Stark (1998), Grabher and Stark (1997), Greskovits (1998), Kolodko (2000), Kornai (2004), Kozma (1998), Lomax (1993), Rodrik (2000), Szalai (1995), Eyal et al. (1998) and Wallerstein’s works. The functionalist school of viewpoint considers the main or only task of transition to be the adoption of democratic and capitalistic structures and the destruction of many or all of its old socialistic institutions. Their analysis does not consider important the possibility to include any other home-grown economic and social structures based on the transition countries. Adherents of this concept are usually the agitators and fellows of the fast and complex adoption of the Western rules, institutions, models and structures. We rate into this school, for example, László Csaba and, due to his early works, Jeffrey Sachs. The vision of the evolutionist and functionalist approaches are very different. The economic and social models according to the first viewpoint are varied, diverse, and heterogeneous. In contrast, the second point of view makes a distinction at most only between successful and unsuccessful states in adapting the Western institutions. There is another possibility in the distinction of transitology literature according to the possible casual order of democratisation and building market economy as well as co-existence of democracy and market economy. The question which distinguishes the two groups is the following: Is the political transition expendable temporarily for the sake of the success of economic transition, and can the democratisation process be delayed in order to carry out a successful economic transition? According to Offe (1991) and Dahl (1992) democratisation works against the success of the economic reforms, because the economic transition causes many social pains and needs strong political support. On the contrary, Kornai (2004) states that this cannot be an argument to stop or delay democratisation. The two processes can be reconciled during the transition according to Gedeon (1992). Rodrik (2000) says more; he argues that democracy stimulates the efficiency of institutions and it is favourable for economic growth. We mention the role of growth theories, although they do not belong directly to transition studies, but we will use some methods from these analyses. The Solow modelFootnote 5 which suggests the absolute convergence of countries has lately received strong competition with the endogenous growth theories. The endogenous theories focus on the intensive factors of growth instead of extensive elements. One approach lays stress upon the role of human capital; the other emphasizes the importance of technical progress. The reason why we pay attention to the growth theories is that the use of institutionsFootnote 6 in growth models arose from the endogenous growth theories. The application of institutions in the growth models happened approximately at the same time as the Eastern European transformation. Using different time series and country samples, the analysis has proven the importance of institutions in economic growth.",1

Italy was entrusted with the reform of justice. This mostly unilateral approach waned in 2006, being considered redundant with the growing efforts of the Afghan government, aimed at taking direct responsibility for the administration of courts and judicial personnel. As a result, the new mantra among the donor community rapidly became that of the ‘local ownership’ of reform process. At the operational level, this principle was implemented by reshaping comprehensively the whole decisional framework, in order to secure the full participation of Afghan authorities in the decisional process. In particular, the overall policy-making structure was aligned with the templates included in policies and guidelines set by major international financial institutions (IFIs) for countries emerging from conflicts. In addition, Afghan authorities were granted the presidency of all the consultative bodies established to support the Executive in formulating sector policies. Eventually, this local ownership consolidating process has recently led to the adoption of a sector development strategy (National Justice Sector Strategy) by the Afghan government, to be implemented through a National Justice Programme. The latter’s key feature is the use of an integrate funding structure to finance justice sector reform, through the creation of a dedicated project, run jointly by Afghan justice institutions (Supreme Court, Attorney General’s Office—AGO, Ministry of Justice—MoJ). The project will be funded through the Afghanistan reconstruction trust fund (ARTF), which is in turn participated by a number of contributing countries and administered by the World Bank (WB). On the other hand, however, the application of the local ownership principle within the justice sector has suffered from a number of problems. At first, such difficulties may be ascribed to the lack of organizational capacity and legal experience among Afghan officials, corruption, dearth of skilled international consultants to carry out aid programmes and the poor security conditions.Footnote 1 Secondly, problems affecting sector development are due to a fragmented decision-making process, at all levels, that hampers the system’s effectiveness and the full application of the local ownership principle. The confusion of roles between international and local players, together with the contradiction between official statements and the reality on the ground (which often imposes external inputs in order to fill the gaps of capacity and expertise among Afghan authorities), generates a ‘mixed ownership’ regime within the existing institutional reform. In this context, the study attempts to describe the evolution of the development aid strategy within the reform of the shaky Afghan system of justice. More specifically, the research analyses single approaches and effects of the current reconstruction process, by giving a practitioner’s view of the ongoing activities ‘from within’. To this aim, it is first necessary to draw a broader picture of strategies and frameworks used at international level to support the development of countries recovering from conflicts. In view of this, the first section briefly illustrates the major changes that occurred after the September 11 attacks in IFI development aid policies. The second one presents the overall policy-making framework set up according to such policies. There then follow three sections which outline the key phases of the justice sector reform that have occurred so far. Indeed, such phases have been marked up by three pivotal conferences, held in Bonn, London and Rome, respectively. The sixth section discusses the progress towards the local ownership of justice sector reform achieved after the Rome Conference, by offering some examples taken from current activities. The article concludes that sector reform is de facto still influenced by external players, generating a decision-making process which is characterized by a national/international mixed regime.",1

Albania faced one of the most important emigration movements considering its population, see Kule et al. (1999), Martin et al. (2002) and Carletto et al. (2006). Since 1990, 20% of the Albanian population has left the country and now lives abroad (Carletto et al. 2006). Greece and Italy are the principal host countries of Albanian immigrants. According to population census in 2001, 438,000 Albanian legal immigrants were registered in Greece; there were 164,000 in Italy the same year (Bonifazi and Sabatino 2003). Albanian immigrants legally residing in other countries of Europe and North America are estimated only in the tens of thousands (Carletto et al. 2006). In addition to legal immigrants, it is estimated that about 30,000 Albanians reside illegally in Italy, and some more in Greece (Carletto et al. 2006). One of the parameters of the immigration phenomenon is the importance of remittances for the economy of the sending countries. In the case of Albania, remittances cover constantly more than 10% of the Gross Domestic Product, rising even to 19% in some years during the period 1994–2006. Numerous studies have focused on immigrants’ remittances by examining different aspects. The use of remittances for investments or consumption purposes has been a main issue. Hamdouch (2005) for the case of Morocco, Leon-Ledesma and Piracha (2004) for the case of Eastern Europe, Woodruff and Zenteno (2007) and Zarate-Hoyos (2004) for the case of Mexico have found that remittances affected investments more than consumption. Airola (2007), Kok and Onan (2004), El-Sakka and McNabb (1999) insisted more on the consumption effect of remittances in the case of Mexico, Turkey and Egypt, respectively. Uruçi and Gedeshi (2003) concluded on the Albanian case that remittances have been used much more for consumption than for investments. They indicated the absence of a plan to use remittances as a tool for local development. The management of remittances in order to increase development has been the object of other studies. Glytsos (2002) commented on an insufficient management of remittances in the case of Mediterranean countries. In the Bulgarian case Bodeva (2005) noted that good economic governance may be more important than incentive measures to attract remittances into investments. Gubert (2005) for the case of Africa, Nyberg Sorensen (2004) for the case of Morocco, and Koksal and Liebig (2005) for the case of Turkey point out the importance of financial institutions in channelling remittances into productive investments. Remittances are found to increase inequality of income as Barham and Boucher (1998) suggest in the case of Nicaragua. Koechlin and Leon (2007), based on a sample of 78 countries, found that this is true in the first stages of migration but then remittances tend to lower this inequality. Remittances reduce poverty according to several studies such as Acosta et al.’s (2006) survey based on the case of Latin America, and Adams and Page (2005) through the example of 71 developing countries. Sall (2005) examining the case of Sub-Saharan countries found that remittances contributed to the creation of basic infrastructure, but today the effect remittances have on development is less evident. Osili (2007) based on the case of Nigeria suggests that remittances can contribute to economic development by reducing poverty and providing savings necessary for future investments. Very few studies have focused on the role of financial network on remittances. In two previous articles (Karafolas 1995, 1998), it was found that immigrants favoured the presence of banks in the host countries, as shown by the case of Greek, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish migrants. Amuedo-Doranes and Pozo (2005) found in the case of Mexican immigrants that those with less regular status and those without documents do not use the banking system for the transfer of saving. The banking system is used by the most educated and those with a network of friends and family in the host city. Using the sample of Mexican immigrants in the US, Amuedo-Doranes and Bansak (2006) found that banking was limited. A bank account did not help to increase monthly remittances flows but it did help to boost the amount brought back home. Orozco (2002, 2003), indicated the lower cost of remittances through the official financial network. The paper focuses on the role of the banking system on the growth of remittances and particularly remittances through the financial network in the case of Albanian immigrants. In particular the relation between the development of the banking network of Greek and Italian banks, the two principal host countries of Albanian immigrants, and the part of remittances conveyed through the official network to total remittances is examined. Money transfer companies have not been considered in this study since their official authorisation in Albania dates only from 2003 (Bank of Albania 2005). The empirical results support the idea that the increased importance of the financial channel on remittances is related to the growth of branches of Greek and Italian banks. Following the introduction, the paper examines the evolution of total remittances of Albanian immigrants by distinguishing the parallel and the official network. In the third section the paper focuses on the networks created by banks in Albania. Empirical results are presented in section four while conclusions are in section five.",7
15,4,Transition Studies Review,03 December 2008,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-008-0037-y,Divergence Period in the European Convergence Process,February 2009,Borut Vojinović,Mariusz Próchniak,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In this paper, we analyse real economic convergence between the ten European countries (EU-10) that accessed the European Union in 2004. Our group includes eight Central and Eastern European countries (CEE-8): Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovak Republic, and Slovenia; as well as two island countries from Southern Europe: Cyprus and Malta. We focus on two concepts of real economic convergence: unconditional (absolute) β convergence and σ convergence. 
β Convergence means that less developed countries (with lower GDP per capita) tend to grow faster than more developed countries (with higher GDP per capita). σ convergence occurs when income differentiation between economies decreases over time. According to Rey and Montouri (1998), β convergence has been more popular with macroeconomists, while σ convergence has been used more in regional science and economic geography literature. β convergence does not necessarily imply σ convergence if each country’s income level is persistently subject to random disturbances that affect country-specific growth rates (Barro And Sala-I-Martin 1990). Our analysis is based on International Monetary Fund data (World Economic Outlook Database, September 2006). The period covered is 1992–2006. For all eight CEE countries the initial period of transition is characterized by drastic falls in output; high inflation and rising unemployment (Fischer and Sahay 2000). The most drastic example is real GDP growth of about −40% in Latvia in 1992. Economic growth in the CEE countries depends on two sets of factor. On the one hand, economic growth depends on factors directly related to the transition process, which can be further separated into initial conditions and reform policies (Vojinović and Oplotnik 2008). On the other hand, it depends on the determinants of long-run growth as described by various theoretical models of economic growth (according to the neoclassical theory, these determinants are technical progress and factor accumulation: labour and capital). Consensus in the literature is that initial conditions do have a significant effect at the beginning of transition, but that their importance is declining rapidly (see e.g. deMelo et al. 1997; Havrylyshyn et al. 1998). It is found that countries with adverse initial conditions can nevertheless achieve a positive outcome by strong commitment to—and therefore a large extent of—reform. DeMelo et al. (1997) find that initial conditions do matter, but that the adverse effect of unfavourable initial conditions can be overcome by strict commitment to reform policy. The further along a country is in its transition process towards a market economy, the more important the standard determinants of economic growth become. Thus, unless a large backlash is observed in these countries, medium-run growth projections may be based around the neoclassical growth framework (with possibly allowing for transitional effects). Hence, if the growth process is described adequately by the neoclassical growth theory, we may assume that the countries have developed in line with convergence hypothesis. However, the neoclassical growth theory is only one from many arguments behind the existence of convergence. There are many other reasons which allow us to expect that the EU-10 countries reveal strong income-level convergence. These include: trade liberalization (significant tariff cuts and export-promoting policies), capital mobility (huge FDI inflow, especially to CEE-8 countries), labour migration, structural and institutional reforms, policy co-ordination, as well as EU funds aimed at developing poorer regions and countries. All these factors contributed to equalizing income levels between new EU member countries. By the end of the 1990s, inflation had been brought down to one-digit or low two-digit numbers. Thus, among new member countries, stabilization policy has been successful and growth is now widely experienced. Concerning predictions of economic growth and GDP per capita with it, it is essential to analyse (based upon the historically observed growth process) growth rates, reached before getting the full membership of the EU of above mentioned economies. The paper is composed of five sections: “Introduction”, “Theoretical background” presents theoretical benchmark for our analysis. Next two sections present the results of “
σ Convergence” and “
β Convergence” analysis followed by “Conclusion”. We analyse beta convergence for the full 1992–2006 period and five sub-periods: 1992–1997, 1995–2006, 1996–2006, 2002–2006, and 2004–2006 for EU-10 countries. We made this subdivision of the whole period 1992–2006 into shorter ones in order to test the reliability of the results on convergence.",5

What does this sudden transition from socialism to market economy really mean to people of the Post-Soviet Republic of Armenia? What does this essential change mean for the opportunity of new types of relations with Armenia, and even the possibility of returning home opened to Diaspora Armenians? Within the framework of a declarative democracy and in the absence of a discourse and competition, transition Armenia (population nearly 3,000,000) is identified as: (a) absence of the perception of social transition goals; (b) weak orientation of political, economic and social institutions towards transition goals and inconsistency of actions of formal institutions; (c) political naiveté of people in commenting and criticizing activities of state authorities and discussing culture. The lack of the population’s understanding of the direct relation between the establishment of democratic values and improvement of their own situation and that of the country is evident even after 10–15 years of independence. (See survey results of a number of organizations IDHR-1999, ACNIS-1995–1997, NGOC 2000–2003, CRRC-2004–2007, etc.) The other part of 8,000,000Footnote 1 (ROA Foreign Ministry, 2003) Armenians—the Diaspora—lives outside of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh in almost 60 countries. Until the 1920s their pre-World War I homeland covered five or six times that of the present-day Armenia, including the eastern regions of Turkey, parts of Iran and SyriaFootnote 2 (Wikipedia 2007). Throughout centuries Armenians were forced to be established in different countries of the world, thus giving birth to the modern-day Diaspora. The long-standing separation from their historical homeland marked a number of changes in the national identity and norms of behavior of Diaspora Armenians, and increased the social distance between Armenians, who live in another part of their historical homeland. The years of the Cold War increased and intensified the historical dissimilarities between the Western and Eastern Armenians. The existence of the Diaspora in countries with different religious and civic cultures, and at the same time conservation of the part of Armenians in the closed Soviet structure marked many changes in characteristics of the two parts of the same ethnicity. These circumstances caused difficulties of adaptationFootnote 3 (Elwell’s Glossary of Sociology, 2007) for those Diaspora Armenians who relocated to Homelands, bringing about the appearance of a new inner-ethnic social group in Armenian socium. Group isolation within parts of one unit has a tendency to grow. The investigation of these processes and particularly possibilities of cultural, economic and social integrationFootnote 4 (Elwell’s Glossary of Sociology, 2007) was carried out using the methodology of focus group sessions with members of inner-ethnic group of immigrants from North America and Middle East and of all age groups. We identify that the process of relocations of the Diaspora Armenians started since 1990s has motivations to start a business in a new location, purchase of realty, seasonal visit, overcoming homesickness by elderly people, presenting Armenia to children by their middle-aged parents, permanent residence, education, especially in University faculties related to culture, cheap education for students from Middle Eastern countries.",1

We would mention a few more issues resulting from research, such as the correlation between FDI and the economic growth (cause or effect), the impact of FDI on modernization of economic structure and exports, on employment, technology and management transfer, the impact on regional/local development, on payment balance, the trade off between FDI and external trade, the impact on exchange rate, etc. Successive evaluations were made about the determinants of FDI, and firms’ decisions to invest in a foreign country, i.e. about the factors of attractiveness. Besides the above-mentioned issues, when talking about the CEECs as host economies, FDI has played an important role in the privatization of the state sector and, consequently, in promoting the market economy and has also contributed significantly to the increased level of competition in this emerging markets. Why do foreign investors choose to invest in the new emerging markets? What are the main determinants that explain the FDI flows towards a country or a group of countries, and what are the motives for the firms’ decisions to take the risk of investing in a certain country? The literature usually categorizes foreign investors according to their reasons for investment as follows: Market seekers: the investors look for new markets. Usually, this kind of FDI is mainly domestic market oriented, and produces what is named horizontal integration (Markusen 1984, developed the most quoted explicative model); Efficiency seekers: the investors look for cheap factors - labor or/ and natural resources. This kind of FDI is mainly export oriented and the host country is rather seen as an export platform. They produce what is named vertical integration (Helpman 1984; Helpman and Krugman 1985). These ‘classical’ or ‘traditional’ reasons for investing abroad are complemented today with new reasons for becoming internationalized firms, such as capabilities, innovatory activities, participation in a cluster, social responsibility/moral ecology, etc. (Dunning 2007b). Countries in Central and Eastern Europe generally offer certain attractive conditions, especially comparative lower labour costs, along with an educated and skilled labour force. Moreover, the fiscal regime has become very encouraging in many of these countries. They even compete to attract FDI. Consequently, important foreign investors preferred to re-localize completely or partly their activities or to open branches in these new areas. The ways of entering these economies are as follows: Full new investment (green field investment) As participant in the privatization process (brown field investment) By mergers and acquisitions of already existing private or state owned companies. The choice of entry mode is an important decision for a company. A short synthesis of theories and empirical researches on this issue can be found in Xuemin and Decker 2004. What is obvious especially from empirical research is that not one single reason is taken into account when a company decides to invest abroad and to adopt a certain mode of doing it. Romania is one of the groups of CEECs which was lagging behind concerning the attractiveness of FDI for many years. The situation has changed and one may notice a new and positive trend to this respect. Our paper aims to reveal the contribution of main determinant factors to the evolution of one of the most relevant indicator that is FDI/GDP (%). The analyzes is based on data provided by UNCTAD, ERDB, National Bank of Romania, and using SPSS for processing. Results allowed us to describe the contribution of main determinant factors, which have been extracted from a certain number of explicative variables. The paper is structured as follows. The first part is devoted to a short presentation of the generally accepted main FDI determinants, and of some specificity when it is about the new market economies such as those in the CEECs. The second part presents the research methodology and analyzes the results obtained by evaluation of the determinant factors contribution in the case of Romania. The final part consists of our conclusions and of policy implications.",3

A situation which seems even more significant because it has been reached in a country which was close to bankruptcy only a couple of years earlier, having been forced to devalue its currency and to depend for its survival on the loans provided by Western countries. After the heavy financial crisis of 1998, enjoying the benefits brought by the devaluation of the rouble and the continuous growth of crude oil prices, the State has started to exploit intensely the enormous reserves of oil and natural gas owned by the country, trying to become an “energy superpower” in the medium-long run. To carry out this plan, the Putin administration decided to give back the management of these strategic resources, which every year generate about 20% of the whole national GDP and 64% of export revenues, to the State. Nevertheless, many Western analysts have criticized the energy policy brought about by the Russian government in the last years; beliefs which come from the idea that the Kremlin strategy is focused on the exploitation of hydrocarbons as a political weapon to press other countries into “softening” their positions on themes of particular interest for the Russian Federation. Starting from these assumptions, in this paper I am going to examine the current situation of the Russian oil and gas sectors, also discussing some of the main pipeline projects Moscow is pursuing nowadays.",

Kiani,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Economists strongly believe that inflation expectations influence the level of inflation, which effects the financial markets as well as returns on investments since both interest and principal payments are expressed in terms of money which changes over times (Thomas 1997). While empirical research shows that several proxies including the difference between the two types of assets such as stocks and bonds have been used for forecasting inflation, Fama (1975) estimated inflation using short-term real interest rates. Fisher (1930) demonstrated that inflation has no impact on real interest rates although correlation between nominal interest rate and inflation does exist. This paradigm was also supported by Summers (1987) who showed that there is a little evidence of any relationship between the inflation and real interest rates. However, Sargent (1973) showed statistically significant evidence that inflation and nominal interest rate cause each other. Additionally, Fama (1975) demonstrated that the level of the interest rate helps forecast future path of inflation, and showed that the movements in the interest rate presumably reflect fluctuation in expected inflation rather than the changes in the real interest rates. This paradigm was also supported by Nelson and Schwert (1977), Mishkin (1981) and Fama and Gibbons (1982). Mishkin (1990) showed that for longer maturities, the term structure of interest rate could be used to assess the future inflationary pressure. This means that the slope of the yield curve would be indicative of the rate of inflation (deflation) in future. Thus, for a steeper yield curve, one might assume that inflation rate would rise and the converse would be true for the fall in the slope of the yield curve. Mishkin (1991) maintained that the short maturity term does not encompass substantial information that might have helped unveiling the future path of inflation. Empirical research shows that people employed multitude of proxies for forecasting inflation. For example, Friedman and Schwartz (1963) noted that the proxies employed for forecasting inflation included the difference between the two types of assets, and the differences between stocks and bonds etc. Therefore, for forecasting inflation, stocks and bonds are considered to be close substitutes for each other and the equilibrium interest rate in the capital market is considered to be the ex ante real rate. Fama (1975) estimated inflation using short-term interest rates, and thereafter Darin and Hetzel (1995) estimated inflation using quarterly data on GDP deflator from 1966:1 to 1979:2 on its lagged values for three periods and claimed that their inflation forecast were comparable to Data Resources Inc. (DRI). Indeed, this was the motivation for the present study to estimate inflation in the selected transition economies using GDP deflator series for the selected countries. Transition economies are of great interest to international investors because of high investment opportunities in these economies. A number of studies focus on forecast of inflation using a number of alternatives that include short-term rates as well as long horizon rates. However, because of the data limitations pertaining to the transition economies a study on the forecast of inflation would be extremely challenging. Therefore, using GDP deflator, which is a backward looking measure of inflation, in conjunction with state space or unobserved component models, the present study seeks to conduct inflation and inflation volatility prognosis in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, and Slovakia. Preliminary data analysis encompasses non-normality and the presence of autoregressive conditional heteroskedaticity in the data series that motivated us to employ the models that encompass conditional volatility for forecasting inflation volatility in all the series. Therefore, we employ state space or unobservable component model to detect any predictability that may exist in all the series. Indeed, if a series encompasses a persistence signal, an unobservable component model provides a convenient description of the observed series that includes observed signal and random noise. Harvey (1989) and Watson (1986) used state space models with the assumptions that the underlying errors are normal. This is because the powerful Kalman filter is operable efficiently only when errors come from normal distributions. However, as in Oh (1994), and Bidarkota and McCulloch (1998), we relax the normality assumption in favor of stable distributions. Further, in order to account for non-Gaussian data, we model inflation within the framework of Paretian stable distributions. Mantegna and Stanley (1995), Buckle (1995), and McCulloch (1997) used stable distributions to model returns series. We use GARCH-like model to explicitly encompass volatility persistence in the return series. The remaining study is organized as follows. First the most general model used in the present work as well as estimation issues are outlined. Thereafter, data sources, empirical results, and hypotheses tests are presented.

The Case of The Philippines,May 2009,Abu N. M. Wahid,Muhammad Shahbaz,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The Philippines is an economy where average inflation was more than 9% per annum during 1963–2005. Average trade deficit was US $6,795 million during 1992–2005. Inflation is currently prevailing at a rate of 7.64%. The trade deficit was recorded to be $7,546 million in 2005. The Philippines’ exports earnings grew at an average rate of 5.31% annually over 2001–2004 but imports also continued to increase at a rate of 5.96%. Furthermore, in 2005, growth rates of exports and imports were 47.3 and 52%, respectively, which showed heavy reliance on imports. To improve the trade balance, the Philippines adopted the flexible exchange rate policy like other developing economies in the region, which linked the local currency with the international market. It may be presumed that an economy devalues or depreciates its currency either in fixed exchange rate or flexible exchange rate regimes to improve the trade balance.",8

Internet is now an established method for carrying out money laundering operations, as the operations carried out on the Web are quick and cheaper. The evolution in the management of the payment methods has lately undergone rapid progress, which has caused such phenomenon to intertwine with the forceful development of Internet communications (Masciandaro 1999). Therefore, we wonder about the possible consequences for “dirty” money laundering by the features and development of the new payment systems of the industrialized economies. In other words, in which ways can the technological innovation in the management of the monetary flows have negative externalities in terms of Public Authorities’ capability to fight and prevent the use of the financial system for illegal and crime purposes? In order to answer this question, it becomes necessary to analyse “electronic” money laundering phenomenology. Basically two laundering methodologies can be identified and namely: instrumental digital laundering; integral digital laundering. Instrumental digital laundering is the set of operations carried out via the Internet aimed at improving the classic laundering strategies. It is well known that the process which aims to legitimate illegal money flows consists of three technical stages (placement, layering and integration) and just in the first stage the computer net support proves important to maintain secrecy during the operation and, at the same time, to disguise the money beneficiaries’ identity. The Internet, in fact, besides ensuring the two mentioned conditions, also allows e-mail addresses to be obtained and, in order to avoid possible identification, there are suitable servers named anonymizers or remailers, which delete information along the path followed by the e-mail as far as its destination or, more simply, it is sufficient to go to a cyber-café and send the message from its public computers. As regards the layering stage, the Internet represents a remarkable step forward for money launderers in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, because it allows them almost total and very fast mobility on any market. There are four Internet areas which may be exploited in laundering: financial brokers online offering services of asset protection, private banking and companies located in tax havens; online banking, in those countries whose laws protect banking secrecy; 
e-commerce; online gambling. 
Online banking allows operating on the international bank circuit without needing to move physically. The added value of Internet negotiations lies in the possibility to create fictitious economic transactions, to show your own product throughout the world and to start or close down a business without binding investments or bureaucratic obstacles, together with the lack of precise and universally shared law regulations (Masciandaro 1994). The use of the computer net in the third and last stage of the laundering process (the integration stage), which concerns the use of the laundered money, allows skilled people who deal with money laundering to choose among a great variety of economic proposals aimed at settling the operation at a cut-rate cost. Unlike the former, in this laundering methodology all the laundering stages are carried out through anonymous electronic transactions. The placement stage is carried out via the Internet in two forms: the first by means of automatic dispensers of prepaid cards or which allow the card to be topped up with the aid of anonymous smart cards; in fact, to buy low value prepaid cards it is not necessary to supply one’s personal data, whereas in order to buy the smart cards it is necessary to open an account; however, to avoid risks, it is sufficient to open it at a bank located in a country where banking secrecy is guaranteed (Guardia di Finanza 2002a, b). the second form of placement is the completely anonymous digital one, (payments through smart card, electronic money). Although it may seem very difficult, a very simple method to launder illegal money is to convert such financial assets into telephone credit. All this may simply occur via mobile telephony and, although this phenomenon may seem paltry, the spreading of mobile devices which use prepaid cards purchased at any dealer allows to convert anonymously even considerable amounts of money (Bosco and Sanarighi 1999). After purchasing the prepaid cards, the transfer to a bank current account is carried out through the activation and use of fictitious hot-lines. Moreover, it should be considered that it is possible to surf the Net by means of the most up-to-date cellular telephones, thus closing the circle of advantages offered by the Internet and by the anonymous prepaid cards. 
The reliability of online transfers is mainly due to the fact that transactions are now carried out using an encrypted language that can be decoded only by the holders of access keys. From the monitoring of criminal activities, it turned out that using the Net for laundering operations is, by now, customary; in fact, it is important to point out that the “Columbian cartels”, with their need to gather the gains coming from drug selling all over the world, are endowed with an efficient communication system able to collect money and send it to brokers (the financial intermediaries working for the cartel) and from the latter to “exchange saving banks”, which are nothing but unofficial banks. If in the past communication took place by means of encrypted messages via Fax, nowadays it passes through modems and computers: each operator has a PC, a modem and a communication program with a continuously modified encrypted code. In order to have an idea of the number of transactions which can be managed online, one should consider the “Fedwire” system, the main electronic funds transfer system in the United States, which connects the Federal Reserve Bank (Fed) branches to the 11,600 deposit institutions: well, according to statistics, it allows to carry out 250,000 transactions a day, for a money volume with an average value estimated around 1,000 billion dollars. Such volumes transit through the “Chips” system, an electronic funds transfer system managed by the New York clearing house association and used for International payments in dollars by means of electronic cheques; the main world banks use it for transactions ordered by their customers (Guandalini and Terribile 2002), and the number of operations is estimated around 150,000 daily transactions (Masciandaro 1999). There are more than one hundred electronic payment systems, characterized by a series of main and secondary nodes, and security is always ensured by encrypting codes of contents; this jungle of codes makes the operations of hiding the real identity of those who are carrying out the transactions easy for the launderers.",3

Banks have been growing geographically, expanding across national and regional borders. In addition, banks are becoming involved in many different activities. They have combined various lending products with trading and financial market operations. This paper asks two questions in particular: (1) how does diversification affect bank lending operations? and (2) how does the potential presence of a financial crisis affect the effectiveness of diversification? The importance of these issues is unquestionable. The subprime crisis that hit the financial sector in 2007–2008 appears to have had a major impact on the structure of the banking industry. Banks are increasingly forced to reevaluate their diversification strategies: do they want to choose a broad position or should they focus in their activities and remain geographically contained? Moreover, the regulators have to ask whether they want to encourage bank diversification or try to limit it. I analyze these issues in a framework of banking, in which banks’ main role is to monitor their projects (i.e., their borrowers). Monitoring improves the return of a bank’s projects and also contains their diversifiable risk. This captures the role that banks play in relationship banking: banks invest in borrower-specific knowledge that might be beneficial to their borrowers; see Boot and Thakor (2000) and Ongena and Smith (2000) for reviews of relationship banking. However, bank projects are also subject to an undiversifiable systemic risk: if a systemic shock occurs, all projects simultaneously fail. A systemic shock may be caused by a financial crisis in which suddenly bank assets are found to be worthless or the shock to the real economy that forces many firms in default. In this model, banks have incentives to shift risk and may stop monitoring their projects if monitoring is too costly. Without monitoring banks partially transfer the risk to depositors and the deposit insurer but keep the potential profits. Following Diamond (1984) I show that diversification limits the potential for the risk-shifting behavior of banks and commits banks to monitoring. More specifically, diversification limits the probability of large losses but increases the probability of small losses of bank projects. This puts bank capital at risk instead of deposits and the deposit insurer and makes bank monitoring more valuable for bank owners. I show that the presence of a systemic shock lowers banks’ monitoring incentives. That is, in an environment with a high systemic risk, banks expect low profits and monitoring costs are relatively high. Hence, banks have higher problems in committing to monitoring. In addition, high systemic risk also makes diversification less effective because the bank is hit equally hard by a systemic shock regardless of how well diversified it is. I also show that increasing inter-bank competition—that is, opening up locally segmented markets to cross-market competition—lowers banks’ monitoring incentives. The regulatory and strategic implications are immediate. If a banking system is stable, the systemic risk is low, diversification is effective, and it may be an optimal mechanism for banks to commit to monitoring their borrowers. However, diversification may be less valuable for banks in times of financial turmoil when systemic risk is high. In such an environment, banks may have higher incentives to refocus on their core activities and on their core geographical markets. My analysis also follows Bhattacharya et al. (1998) in showing that regulators should avoid directly limiting diversification. However, the regulators have to reevaluate the benefits of diversification carefully, especially as systemic risk increases. The presence of high systemic risk may limit the benefits of diversification: in this light, one can understand regulatory actions in the U.S. after the Great Depression, in which regulators limited the scope and geographical scale of banks. As a response to the Great Depression, the U.S. implemented the Glass–Steagall Act, which enforced tight control over banking activities. The Glass–Steagall Act separated the activities of commercial banks and securities firms.Footnote 1 U.S. banks were also geographically restricted; for example, by limitations on opening branches in different U.S. states (the McFadden Act). However, in the 1990s those regulatory barriers were removed. The Riegle–Neal Act of 1994 removed most barriers to interstate branching. The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act of 1999 lifted restrictions on the activities banks could undertake (i.e., combining securities and insurance with commercial banking). In doing so it allowed for the creation of a financial services holding company. Using the results of my analysis, one could argue that a perceived lower level of systemic risk increased the benefits of diversification and that removing barriers to diversification might be optimal. The current financial crises, however, may again raise thoughts about the benefits of diversification. As a response to high systemic risk, banks may again become more geographically contained and refocus on their core activities. The regulatory approval for takeovers of banks in trouble by their safer competitors may therefore be optimal only in the short-term. In the long-term, the benefits of giant financial institutions such as diversification may not overcome potential costs.Footnote 2
 I also survey some core results of the modern banking literature (following several surveys; e.g., Bhattacharya et al. 1998; Gorton and Winton 2003). I review the role that banks perform on their asset side and why bank diversification is important. In particular, I stress the information-acquisition and asset-transformation function of banks. I also discuss the marginal contribution of this analysis with respect to the existing literature on banking. This paper is organized as follows. “Model Specification and Main Analysis” builds a model and analyzes the impact of diversification on bank monitoring, including the effects of systemic risk and inter-bank competition. “The Role of Banks in Monitoring” discusses the financial intermediation literature on bank monitoring. The last section concludes the paper.",2

This paper aims at deepening the economic performances of the major banks of the People’s Republic of China and the main problems related to the entire Chinese banking system.

Lejour,Vladimir Solanic,Paul J. G. Tang,Male,Male,Male,Male,"We gratefully acknowledge comments by George Gelauff, Volker Nitsch and Theo van de Klundert. In May 2004, eight countries from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), along with Cyprus and Malta, joined the European Union. In January 2007, Bulgaria and Romania followed. This was the largest expansion in the history of the European Union, and reunited a continent that was split for almost half a century by the Iron Curtain. For ten countries this marked their transition from a centrally planned economy and a one-party system towards a market economy and a democratic structure. The enthusiasm in these countries was large in referendums voters approved entry by large margins, fuelled not only by political reasons but also by economic expectations. Many in the new member states hope that EU membership will pave the way towards economic prosperity. In 2001, income per capita in the twelve new member states and Turkey about 34% of the EU-15 average (measured in purchasing power terms). The income gap is larger than it was with earlier entrants, like Ireland, Portugal and Spain. More importantly, from the perspective of the new member states and the candidate countries, these earlier entrants have fared pretty well after their accession. Production per capita in Ireland is now one of the highest in European Union. Measured in purchasing power terms, Spain has also increased its production per capita from 74% in 1986 to 84% in 2001 of the EU-15 average, and Portugal has increased it from 62 to 75% in the same period. The enthusiasm in the new and candidate member states is not fully shared in the old member states. Political considerations have largely driven the process of shifting the Union’s border to the East. The income differences, however, give rise to several concerns. The first is that the income differences translate into different political priorities. The increased heterogeneity may hinder policy making at the European level. For example, the new and candidate member states could very well be less interested in pursuing climate change policies than the old member states. Second, the income differences may also give rise to (large) migration flows from new to the old member states. Third, the large income differences exert an upward pressure on the EU budget and give new impetus to discussions about the allocation of funds across member states. Of course, these concerns depend on the economic performance of the new member states after their accession. The concerns will become less when (the prospect of) accession proves to be the starting point for fast catching-up toward the average income in the EU-15. The EU countries both new and old thus hope for economic prosperity in the new member states. The central, important question is whether European integration does indeed stimulate catching up of the new member states and will indeed reduce the income differences. The economic literature does not deliver a clear-cut answer. The studies fall roughly into two categories. The studies in the first category derive from simulations the gains of the economic integration of EU membership. Typically, the gains are static. The studies in the second category use regression analysis to gauge the overall effect of EU membership on income (growth). Studies in the first category simulate models to calculate the effects of removing trade barriers between the national goods and services markets. More recent studies turn up with more pronounced effects. One reason might be that over time researchers find better ways to approximate non-tariff barriers. Breuss (2001) and Lejour et al. (2004) predict an average income effect for Central and Eastern Europe that is more than 7% of GDP. This effect is notable, but clearly not enough to close the income gap between new and old member states. The model simulations overlook for example the effects of better integrated capital markets, larger FDI flows or the dynamic effects of integrated product markets. Also, international trade in goods and services may facilitate the transfer of ideas and technologies and in this way contribute to higher productivity (growth) (see e.g. Coe and Helpman 1995; Griffith et al. 2000).

 The second category of papers uses regression analysis to directly estimate the effect of EU membership on economic growth. This does not confine the gains from membership to improvements in allocative efficiency, but rather considers the overall effect on production (growth). Henrekson et al. (1997) use panel data for 23 OECD countries and five time periods between 1970 and 1990 to establish the effect of EU and EFTA membership on economic growth per capita. They derive that EU membership raises economic growth for a long time by about 0.6–0.8% per year. The results are not always robust for alternative specifications of the regression. With a similar data set Vanhoudt (1998) did not find a permanent growth effect of EU accession. Badinger (2005) argues even that a large part of the trade integration does not follow from EU membership, but is the result of successful trade negotiations in the GATT and WTO. Crespo-Cuaresma et al. (2002) argue that the duration of EU membership has a positive effect on GDP growth per capita. Crafts and Kaiser (2004) stress the importance of the rule of law for the CEE countries and their economic performance. They include in a growth regression a measure for the rule of law. Crafts and Kaser conclude that economic growth per capita in the CEE countries can be about 4% in the medium term, if they move to EU standards of good governance. In this article, we reconsider the effect on EU membership on economic growth, with a particular focus on the productivity gains of integrating national markets into the European internal market. We employ a two-step procedure, following Frankel and Rose (2002). First, an estimated gravity equation for bilateral trade yields that EU membership contributes to trade, mainly among the member states. Second, trade openness is estimated to contribute to production (growth), in line with the results of a vast empirical literature on the link between the two. The two-step procedure has the important advantage that it allows us to empirically identify the effect of EU membership. Changes in membership do not occur often. It is hardly surprising that a dummy for EU membership in the growth regression turns to be statistically insignificant. Instead, the procedure uses the variation across bilateral trade flows (the gravity equation) and uses the variation over time (the growth regression) to identify the link from EU membership via trade openness to production growth. Institutional change is another important aspect of the EU integration. North (1990), for example, argues that institutions (in a broad sense) reduce uncertainty which in turn lowers transaction costs and contributes positively to economic performance. In all accession countries EU membership serves as an external anchor for institutional change (e.g. stronger protection of property rights). de Melo et al. (1992) talk about a tendency towards institutional convergence. Indeed, recent empirical literature supports a positive link between the quality of institutions and economic growth (see e.g. Hall and Jones 1999; Knack and Keefer 1995; Acemoglu et al. 2001; Easterly and Levine 2003; Kaufmann and Kraay 2003).
 Rodrik and Subramanian (2003) even claim that institutions trump everything else in explaining growth. Empirical work also finds a strong relation between the institutional quality and trade flows (see Koukhartchouk and Maurel 2003; de Groot et al. (2004; Jansen and Nordas 2004).
 De Groot et al. (2004) emphasize furthermore that differences in institutional arrangements may hamper trade among countries. In view of this literature, measures for institutional quality are included in both steps. Introducing these measures reduces the effect of EU membership on trade flows and the effect of openness on growth, but does not annihilate these effects. So, there are two relevant channels through which the accession countries are likely to benefit from EU membership. First, joining the internal market increases their opportunities to trade and raises their growth potential. Second, improving their institutions to meet EU requirements has—directly and indirectly, a positive impact on their growth potential. The empirical results support optimism for the new member states. First, EU membership is estimated to increase trade with roughly 50%. The effects for the individual CEE countries vary widely. To a large extent this variation depends on a country’s openness in combination with the intensity of its trade with the EU and on the quality of the institutions. Second, a 1% increase in openness, i.e. the ratio of trade to GDP, expands output by about 0.7% in the long run. Combining the two effects, the new EU members can experience on average an increase in their real income of roughly 40% in the long term. These results show that EU integration could significantly help in reducing the income gap between new and old member states. Relative income in the accession countries and Turkey could increase from 34 to 47% of the EU-15 average. That is a significant decline of the income gap, although much remains to be done for closing it. The rest of the article is structured as follows. Section 3 provides estimations results for the relation between EU membership on openness. In Sect. 4, we quantify impacts of openness on income. In Sect. 5, we combine the two regression results and estimate effect of accessing the EU on output for all the accession countries. Section 6 concludes.",4

The well-known Cox proportional hazards model and Cox regression model with a time-dependent covariate are applied, and the results are interpreted and compared. The parameters of the model are estimated from a large dataset with more than 450,000 observations consisting of all unemployment spells in Slovenia occurring from 2002 to 2005 as well as all ongoing spells at the end of the year 2005. In addition, the results obtained are compared with the results of the Cox modeling approach for four other countries: Croatia, Macedonia, Romania, and Austria.Footnote 1 The conclusions are relevant for the development of the labor market in Slovenia, where national economic transition has created extensive changes. Slovenia’s former communist political and economic system provided stability in the labor market by striving for full employment and equal wealth distribution. It required radical regulation of the labor market to provide jobs for practically everyone. The unlimited promise of employment was even a constitutionally guaranteed right in the former Yugoslavia (Vodopivec 1995). The transition to democracy created significant changes in labor demand and consequently a dramatically high increase in the unemployment rate at the beginning of the 1990s. Young people suddenly had no guarantee of finding a job after graduation. Because the high employment level in the former system was artificial, graduates were also unlikely to find a job easily. To achieve higher productivity, most employers turned to massive layoffs. Many older workers became unemployed and were also very unlikely to find new jobs. The relative advantage of highly educated workers increased. These employees had greater chances of changing jobs, they were less likely to be laid off, and they were more likely to find a job if unemployed. Following Slovenia’s economic transformation, the official unemployment rate peaked in 1993, when it reached almost 15%. It remained above 14% for 5 years and then started to decrease in 1998. In 2006, the registered unemployment rate dropped below 10% for the first time since the beginning of transition. According to Eurostat, the internationally comparable ILO unemployment rate in Slovenia was 6.1% in 2006, which is below the EU15 (8.3%) and EU25 (7.8%) average. Data gathered by the Slovenian employment office reveal the structure of the unemployed in recent years. The share of women increased from 46.7% in 1995 to 54.8% in 2006. The most common duration of unemployment spells in Slovenia in 2006 was less than 3 months, followed by unemployment spells that lasted between 1 and 2 years. Regarding age, the two largest groups of unemployed are workers between 50 and 60 (28.9% in 2006) and between 40 and 50 (21.2% in 2006). The largest share of the unemployed has no education or did not complete elementary school (32% in 2006), followed by those that graduated from a general upper secondary school (25.8% in 2006). In recent years, various survival analysis and duration techniques have gained popularity in the social sciences to model the length of unemployment spells and strike duration. Moffitt (1999) applies the usual econometric techniques in labor economics, including the proportional hazard methods and the duration models. The effects of education on unemployment characteristics are analyzed in Kettunen (1994, 1997) for Finland and in van Ours and Ridder (1995) for the Netherlands. McKenna (1996), Schomann and O’Connell (2002), and Pallage and Zimmermann (2005) deal with unemployment comparisons in the European, Canadian, and US labor markets, respectively, and Lauer (2005) compares France and Germany. Examples of duration model applications in labor markets can be found in Green and Riddell (1995), D’Agostino and Mealli (2000), Arranz and Romero (2003), Kupets (2006), Löfmark (2008), and Carroll (2006). Among other determinants of unemployment duration, these studies also explain the effects of gender and education on the length of unemployment spells for Canada, nine EU15 members, Spain, Ukraine, Russia, and Australia, respectively. Tatsiramos (2006) applies duration data techniques to examine the effects of unemployment insurance on the duration of unemployment in Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain, and the UK. The duration of unemployment in Denmark is also a subject of research in Frederiksen et al. (2006). The Cox regression model is employed to study the influence of various factors on the duration of unemployment by Boehm (2007) for Austria, Babucea and Danacica (2007) for Romania, Tevdovski and Tosevska (2007) for Macedonia, and Borsic et al. (2007) for Croatia. Slovenian unemployment is analyzed by Vodopivec (2004), Orazem et al. (2005), and Kajzer (2007), but the impact of gender, education, and age on the length of unemployment spells is not examined. However, Vodopivec (1995) does use a duration model to study the effects of unemployment insurance on the duration of unemployment. Domadenik and Pastore (2004) test the impact of education and training systems on young people’s participation in the Slovenian and Polish labor markets. Kaplan-Meier estimates are used to analyze the influence of age, gender, and level of education on the duration of unemployment spells in Slovenia by Kavkler and Borsic (2006). The rest of this paper is organized as follows. “Methodology” presents the basic notions and describes the methodological approach of the Cox regression models. The proportional hazards assumption is discussed and different approaches to testing whether such an assumption holds are stated. “Empirical analysis” addresses the major question on the effects of age, gender, education level, and region on the length of unemployment spells using the Cox proportional hazards model. The Cox regression model with the time-dependent variable age is also specified and discussed.",2

After reaching an inflation rate of almost 30% at the end of 1983, Portugal saw this value reduced to about 5%, by 1994 and has continued to see inflation fall to the present day. This disinflation process is associated with the adoption of a nominal stabilization policy of the Portuguese escudo, in line with its participation in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) of the EMS.Footnote 2
 In parallel with the credibility gains, the disinflation processes may also have led to costs in output and employment which are mainly due to the loss of competitiveness, and the consequences of real exchange rate appreciation. In the case of Portugal, the costs of disinflation seem to have been temporary. This paper is structured as follows. “The Portuguese Disinflation Process” presents a historical retrospective view of the disinflation process in Portugal, followed by the description of “Data”. “Co-integration” analyses the existence of a co-integration relation. The construction of methodology is described in “A Near-VAR Model for the Portuguese and German Economies”. “Simulation Analysis” complements the latter section, evaluating the results of a simulation analysis.

The European Union having launched the Lisbon agenda in 2000 committed itself to building the knowledge-based economy and becoming the world’s leading economy by the year 2010. The major European recommendations on the increase of business R&D expenditures, strengthening of university-industry linkages etc. are widely implemented in old and new member countries’ innovation policies. However, the specific characteristics of transition economies demand to deal with the global level of knowledge-based economy and the role of foreign-owned companies with an extent larger in Central Eastern Europe. The countries in Central Eastern Europe entered their transition period and faced the challenges of globalisation during the same period of time. Consequently the “crescendo” of global research networks and the transition of Central European innovation systems came about simultaneously. Multinational enterprises (MNEs) became the major actors in business R&D in these countries, university–industry relations are also led by MNEs. In our paper, we focus on the following research questions: What were the main motives for MNEs to invest in these innovation systems? Which innovation policies or tools strengthen R&D investment of MNEs and MNEs–universities cooperation? What are the characteristics of the new university-MNE connections in these innovation systems? In the first section, we look through the relevant R&D and innovation system literature to sketch main trends and general processes in R&D development. We introduce the trends of R&D internationalisation in the Czech Republic and Hungary. Then, we describe the development of innovation policies in these countries and highlight the efforts to foster R&D oriented FDI and to embed it into local economies. The last section provides case studies showing activities of university units established by MNEs. In the concluding section, research questions are answered.",23

Investments in human capital facilitate economic restructuring and growth and have the potential to alleviate the problems of poverty, unemployment and social exclusion. The need for increased investment in human capital is particularly important in transition economies, in which, prior to transition, the exceptionally low wage premiums for investment in education led to stagnation and even a decline in the level of human capital. Ample evidence exists on the change of the wage structures in Central and Eastern European countries during the transition process. There is some evidence for Croatia as well, albeit only a recent one (see e.g. Šošić 2004; Nestić 2005). This paper intends to extend the empirical studies of wage premiums for education in Croatia by accounting for the nonlinearities in return to education due impact of credentials, while controlling for other features of the wage structure such as tenures, economic activity and region of employment. The next section of this paper provides an overview of the labor market transformation in transition countries that increased rate of return to education. Given the lack of human capital, which is obvious despite the oft-cited educated labor force as one of the comparative advantages of transition countries, convergence in return to investment in education and in the level of human capital was needed as one of the foundations of the labor market transition. According to the results of empirical studies, such a tendency is indeed apparent in all Central and Eastern European transition countries, with the exception of the former East Germany,Footnote 1 in which fast-paced transformation reduced the return to education acquired in the previous regime. The following section contains a thorough investigation into the dynamics of the wage structure in Croatia over the past decade. We estimate the rate of return to investment in human capital, as well as the impact of credentials. A final section concludes.",4

Its development was supported by an advantageous economic policy, aiming at promoting export. However, this evolution remains fragile and tributary of internal and external challenges that the sector must face. Among the external challenges, the integration of the textiles within the general rules of the GATTFootnote 1. Indeed, the Multi-Fiber Arrangements, which consist of a system of quotas encouraging the importing countries which are developed and the exporting countries which are developing to conclude bilateral arrangements under which exporting countries commit themselves to limit their exports of the whole or a part of categories of textiles and clothing by respecting the imposed quotas, were definitively dismantled on 1 January 2005. With the elimination of the MFAFootnote 2 quotas, tariffs will become the primary mechanism for border protection of trade in textiles (WTOFootnote 3). It is generally accepted that in the long run, the reduction in trade restrictions will economically induce an increase in textile output. This will effectively improve market access for developing countries, and further change the world textile trade flows. Though not a signatory of the MFA, Tunisia is concerned by the consequent stakes of their dismantling, particularly on the European market to which Tunisia exports more than 70% of its textiles and clothing products. Indeed, through the successive agreements of cooperation then of association that Tunisia concluded with the European Union, and through its adhesion as well as the EUFootnote 4 to the GATT agreements, our country undergoes the consequences of the procedures of liberalization that the EU starts with the rest of the world. The primary objective of this study is to analyze and quantify the impacts of eliminating the MFA on the Tunisian textile and clothing sector: supplier of the EU in clothing. To lead this investigation we will present the Multi-Fiber Arrangements. Section The Place of the Tunisian Textile and Clothing Sector in the New Economic Context states the place of the Tunisian textile and clothing sector in the new economic context. Section Empirical Study sets out the empirical model, the data, and the methodology. Section Data discusses results and finally, and in the light of the finding, section Conclusion concludes and puts forward suitable measures to undertake to prevent the sector from relegating a lesser position.",

On the back of the oil price hike, Russia as the world’s second largest oil exporter (and the largest natural gas exporter) has increased its net exports dramatically. By the same token, however, this has the potential to raise inflation pressure due to a massive inflow of foreign currency earnings. Of particular interest to us is the relationship between oil price and macroeconomic variables such as real gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation in Russia. Since the early 1980s a large number of studies using a vector autoregressive (VAR) model have been made on the macroeconomic effects of oil price changes. Most studies, however, have focused on oil-importing countries (in particular, the United States), and concluded that oil price increases have a negative impact on economic activities (Hamilton 1983; Burbidge and Harrison 1984; Mork 1989; Ferderer 1996; Balke et al. 2002). Yet, there is no consensus in these studies to what extent oil price shocks contribute to the US economy. With regard to oil exporting countries, Mork Olsen and Mysen (1994) and Bjørnland (2000) found that Norway was positively influenced by oil price fluctuations, whereas Abeysinghe (2001) demonstrated that Indonesia and Malaysia were negatively influenced in the long run. Olomola and Adejumo (2006) showed that oil price volatility has no effect on output and inflation in Nigeria. As far as Russia is concerned, using quarterly data for the period 1995:Q1 to 2001:Q3 Rautava (2002) studied the impact of oil prices on the economy, concluding that a 10% permanent increase in oil prices leads to a 2.2% GDP growth in the long run. The aim of this paper is to empirically examine the effect of oil prices on the level of real GDP and inflation for Russia using the VAR model with extended sample periods. Different from Rautava’s approach, in light of the financial crisis, dummy variables for 1998:Q3 and 1998:Q4 are used as exogenous variables. The second goal of this paper is to analyze the effect of monetary policy through the interest rate channel. The rest of this paper is classified into the following sections: entitled “Empirical Framework”, “Empirical Results” and finally “Conclusions”.",5

Currently, a number of key factors limit the capacity of international disaster relief agencies in Asia to provide effective disaster relief and recovery. Ranging from political, cultural, legal and technical dimensions, these factors often result in poorly executed relief operations. If these factors can be overcome, disaster relief efforts will undoubtedly be better coordinated and more importantly, more lives will be saved due to the timely delivery of much-needed aid. Motivated by the need to improve the current system of disaster relief in Asia, we set out not only to conceptualize but to operationalize as well the key features of an effective regional disaster relief organization. The challenges that limit the capacity of international disaster relief agencies in Asia to provide effective disaster relief are significant; however, this paper demonstrates that many of these factors are indeed surmountable. It has only been 5 years since a number of Asian countries were devastated by the Asian tsunami, and the timeliness of our findings is again underscored by recent disasters in Sichuan, China and Myanmar. However, these three disasters are not isolated events but rather part of a rising trend in the number of reported natural disasters (see Figs. 1, 2). While the reasons for this increase in the number of reported natural disasters are unclear, the need for more effective and better coordinated disaster relief is beyond doubt.

Pelc,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The problem examined in this paper represents both a theoretical puzzle and a great policy challenge: how should Western powers, and especially Europe, deal with the global power shift resulting from the rise of countries such as China, India and Russia? Scholars generally agree that the stability of global governance is put at risk with the rise of a new superpower (Gilpin 1983; Mearsheimer 1990). It is no surprise, then, that the rise of China, especially, is being met with anxiety on both sides of the Atlantic. Political scientists since Carr (1939) and Morgenthau (1967) have considered the necessary conditions for a peaceful global power transition. Here I take up this same question in the current context: what should Europe’s role be in China’s transition to superpower status? I argue that part of the answer lies in the same institutional power binding instruments that allowed the United States to rise in power without threatening its allies following the Second World War, and especially following the end of the Cold War. To preview the argument, I find that institutional questions that are otherwise treated as mostly normative concerns—issues of legitimacy, distributional fairness, and institutional design—take on a very different meaning when considering power shifts. Europe has a strong material interest in addressing these current lacks, so that countries such as India and China have little reason to depart from current institutional arrangements. Small adjustments in the present would have lasting impact in deterring conflict in the future. In many ways, the period preceding a potential global power shift mimics the Rawlsian veil of ignorance: not knowing which position a given state will occupy in the future international system, all states—and especially current superpowers—will find it in their interest to bind themselves and each other to an existing arrangement, and ensure an equitable distribution of gains from cooperation. Before going on, it is worth briefly defining what is meant by an institutional arrangement. For the purposes of this paper, institutions are sets of rules, either formal or informal, arrived at through some form of international consensus, that place expectations on the behavior of states.",

Countries that are sharing their affiliation to this part of the African continent have always been linked to Europe and especially France. However this region is far to be considered as homogeneous. The puzzle of states that set the area is the most various expression of what it may be found in such diversified continent as Africa is. Finalizing the French Colonial Empire, which allowed a sort of compulsory similarity in treatments by the central power, those countries have started their new own step waving from the still feeling presence of France (and later the EU) to their African roots. To sum up, we will consider the region divided in two blocks, cultural and political: Maghreb and ECOWAS’ members. Due to its strategic position as a bridge between Africa and Europe and its related ties with the EU, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia are more predisposed and inclined to take in European strategies and policies than others. In the last decade, we were present at the significant development escalation which Morocco and Tunisia have realized so far, especially for tourism and third sector (service). All Maghreb countries have a special relation with the EU in several organizations and forums. EuroMed is a reality and Barcelona Process is going to amplify the importance of multilateral relations among the two shores of Mare Nostrum. The recent proposal by Nicolas Sarkozy to gather the European, Middle Eastern, and North African countries of the strategic Mediterranean rim into an economic community along the lines of the early EU has generated different reactions. Such a union, even if primarily economic, would necessarily involve the member countries in discussions of controversial issues like Turkish membership in the EU. It would bring Israel and its Arab neighbors into a new assembly that Sarkozy apparently hopes and could tackle the intractable problem of Middle East peace. The notion of regional cooperation in the Mediterranean is ambitious as North Africa is an important transit route for illegal immigrants heading for Europe and home to substantial natural gas reserves. This idea of anchoring regional cooperation in the fields of energy, security, counter-terrorism and immigration on a trade agreement, and creating a Mediterranean Investment Bank, modeled on the European Investment Bank, would help develop the economies on the eastern and southern edge of the region. Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia are definitely interested in this process and they are considering it as essential for maintaining growth and wellness the openness to European and International Market according to bilateral relations and multilateral agreements. Apart from Europe, which has the most important slice of import-export total percentage of the area, China has started catching the weight of being present in this growing markets. Far from reaching the strict sense of belonging Maghreb states considered to have with Europe, the “Asian Dragon” would spread its influence especially in Morocco, delocalizing Chinese automotive assembly production. In this sense, China would be not interested in drawing advantages from natural resources’ import, which lack in this part of Western Africa. This aspect is rather crucial in the Southern part of the region we are considering. Influenced by Europe and especially France, the ex-Communauté Française d’Afrique has recently shown a strong willingness in attracting new global players in the area. China of course, and at least a renovate Brazil, would balance the everlasting heirloom these countries have always been suffering. In 1975, fifteen countries (Benin, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Ivory Coast, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Togo) founded the Economic Community of Western Africa to achieve “collective self-sufficiency” for the member states by means of economic and monetary union creating a single large trading bloc. The CFA Franc is still a currency used in twelve formerly French-ruled African countries, as well as in Guinea-Bissau and in Equatorial Guinea while the French Treasury guarantees the free convertibility at a fixed parity between the euro and the CFA. As a result, these economies have been always considered as an Euro-Zone. Recently, a wind of change has passed across those countries. With the launch of the New Asian-African Strategic Partnership, China has expressed its intention to become a player in the region. As Chinese President Hu Jintao assumed, the “economic cooperation would be coupled with emphasis on infrastructure, agriculture and the development of human resources”. It will concentrate Chinese cooperative efforts in countries where it recognizes high potential, whether it is a matter of raw materials, potential markets or diplomatic influence. This Chinese “trade safari” is paying off now in oil and raw material imports and markets for manufactured goods. In South-Western Africa, ECOWAS has signed a comprehensive agreement with the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT) in Beijing on 26th September 2008. This agreement will provide the linchpin for attracting Chinese private sector investment into strategic sectors of West African economy. Both parties agreed in a Memorandum of Understanding signed by the President of the ECOWAS Commission, Dr. Mohamed Ibn Chambas and Mr. Wan Jifei, Chairman of the CCPIT during the ECOWAS/China forum to establish partnership in economic cooperation. The MOU provides for the establishment of a development fund, the China-Africa Development Fund Company which will be managed by the China Development Bank and provide capital to be used to intervene in the development of infrastructure, agro-industries, fisheries, industries, trade promotion and other private sector activities in West Africa. The CCPIT is required under the MOU to facilitate linkages between the public and private sector institutions in ECOWAS Member States and their Chinese counterparts in order to promote mutually beneficial economic relations. The Council will also facilitate the Chinese private sector development of agro-industries, including plantations and downstream processing facilities in West Africa. ECOWAS President also signed other MOU’s during the four-day forum, including one with Chinaways group, a Chinese company engaged in livestock development. The MOU allows the company to participate in the development of West Africa’s agriculture in order to contribute to enhance regional food security and the realization of the Millennium Development Goals of reducing by half those who suffer from hunger by 2015. In addition, it will engage in forestry, the development of plantations, food processing and related downstream activities, training, real estate and real project financing. There were also other MOU’s for engineering cooperation and infrastructure development. They are with companies active in the construction sector and require their participation in the development of regional infrastructure, one of the major priorities of West Africa for the forum. These are with the China Optimization Society of Capital Construction, the China Major Bridge Engineering Company and the China Gezhouba Group, the main contractor for the “Three Gorges” Hydroelectric project in China. They are required under the MOU’s to enter into engineering and construction projects in Member States including roads, railways, harbors, airport building and civil works development. ECOWAS members also signed an agreement with the Nanjing Municipal Peoples Government for the establishment of an ECOWAS official market to facilitate trade in goods produced by Member States in China. The agreement also calls for the reciprocal establishment of a Chinese wholesale market in Member States to enhance trade and investment between China and West Africa. To sum up, Western Africa is living in a dualistic way, as a Northern more developed and European projected area is setting against a Central-Southern part deeply concerned in finding an international breath. Apart from every extra-continental participation in the area, we ought underline that in future more strategic relations would be settled among ECOWAS and Maghreb. The key-role of this hypothesis is the strategic function of Morocco and Tunisia towards European markets and policies. This autochthonous approach to Western Africa development and future economy would be pushed by stronger and deeper economic and social relations among African Countries. Maghreb would spread its mature and more solid infrastructural system, coupled with its recognized accountability. ECOWAS’ members would supply the low demographic rate that Morocco and Tunisia will suffer in the imminent future and therefore take part in their economy. All these aspects would allow Sub-Saharian Western countries to develop themselves basing on a deeper regional economic approach.",

The law is a structure by itself but going deeper it is possible to find other legal structures chosen by legislators. These legal structures could be considered as models, connected to other models, containing models, contained in models employed to regulate the society and, at the same time, influenced by the society. The results brought by the utilization of these means are, for now, that the role of status in the Chinese society seems to be gradually decreasing and the economic and social conditions are improving. We will focus our attention on three, closely related, aspects: the company model; the limited liability model and the role of status. We will first analyze these models and their relations with the society in a historical perspective trying to let model–functions relations emerge. There will be an overview on how models changed and developed, reconnecting then these results to the Chinese development nowadays.

The discussion of CSR started in Japan in 2003. Although some believe that what triggered the discussion was a number of scandals centering around Japanese corporations in about 2000, at the same time others claim it was not connected with the impact of these scandals as, in the past, Japanese corporations had been involved in many scandals on the Japanese market. In the 1970s, environmental pollution created by corporations was a big issue. Nevertheless, discussion of CSR did not take place in Japan in that period. Why did it suddenly begin in 2003? There seem to be two reasons for this phenomenon. One is an expansion of the stakeholders for Japanese corporations not only within domestic but also abroad, because of its advance in the global market. The other motive is that foreign investors have had stocks, shares in Japanese market, after the breakdown of Japan’s powerful economy for some time. These two big changes stimulated CSR in the Japanese industrial world. In Japan, the concept of CSR is unclear and not fixed because the term is utilized in many different ways. The term CSR includes “compliance with the law”, “business ethics”, “social contribution”, “philanthropy”, “mecenat” and so on. So the impression is that the meanings related to CSR are spreading due to the proliferation of discussion. In particular, many students and scholars of CSR, and also the main economic organizations in Japan, recognize that at the basis of CSR lies in compliance with the law. And almost Japanese corporations themselves believe that the most important matter in CSR is compliance. However, an accident happened in Summer 2006 which has led to the questioning of whether compliance with the law achieves CSR or not. The mistake was made by one of the famous Japanese makers of gas appliances, which took no measures against the accidents with gas appliances that killed 21 people, although they recognized it because they were complying with the law. Hence, if we compare the current status of the CSR in Japan with that accident, we must recognize that the discussion for CSR tends to compliance with the law. The Japanese dimension of CSR is that one tends to compliance, and the other is diffusing in multiple meanings of the term. It is therefore important to focus again on the concept of CSR. In Japan, CSR simply means, “something good related with corporations”. The term is a new one for the Japanese. We believe that the new term requires a new meaning. The concepts for compliance—business ethics, social contribution, and so on—have existed in the Japanese market for a long time, and can be explained without the use of the term CSR. So, what is the new term of CSR in Japanese Governance?",

 In recent days, the Aral Sea is confronted with the crisis of extinction. The Aral Sea used to be the fourth-largest inland sea in the world in the 1950s. However, the altitude and basin area of the Aral Sea have been decreased drastically since the 1960s. In the current situation, the magnitude of Aral Sea has shrunk to less than one-third of its original dimension (Fig. 2), and some estimates forecasts “The Sea could completely disappear by 2015, if no preventive action is taken”.Footnote 2 This shrinkage derives from the increase of water withdrawal from Amu Darya and Syr Darya in the Soviet era, and the lack of regional cooperation for water resource management in the basin after the independence of the Central Asian states has exacerbated this problem.

UNEP/GRID-Arendal, Aral Sea: trends and scenarios, UNEP/GRID-Arendal Maps and Graphics Library, http://maps.grida.no/go/graphic/aral_sea_trends_and_scenarios (Accessed 20 June 2008) Furthermore, the shrinking of the Aral Sea engenders aridification in the delta between Amu Darya and Syr Darya, degradation of the eco-system because of desertification in this region, depletion of biodiversity, and socio-economical detriment such as the decrease of fishery population and health damage in costal society. Consequently, it is highly likely that this environmental problem causes economic, social, and humanitarian crisis. In order to mitigate crisis, integrated and cooperative water resource management in the basin is essential, and support from international community is desirable. The purpose of our research is to grasp the viable approach of the international community toward water resource management in the Aral Sea Basin. In order to achieve this purpose, first, we specify the background of the Aral Sea Basin Problem, and the previous approach to it. Second, we envisage the proposals of preceding studies, and then we present the possible approach to this difficult problem.",3

In the United Nations these are known as nongovernmental organizations or simply NGOs” (Willetts 1999: 1). As implied above, the influence of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the UN is a pivotal and highly interesting subject to study. The role of NGOs has dramatically changed over the last few decades and today more than 3,000 organizations have consultative status in the UN. Peter Willets describes “the new language of the 1990s”, establishing the notion of “social partnership” between states and NGOs, as “revolutionary” since it evokes an equality of status between governments and NGOs (Willetts 2000: 191–213. As Willetts states: “Almost all intergovernmental organizations now accept, as a norm of world politics, that they must have working relationships with NGOs” (Willetts 1996: 3). The United Nations is not an exception. As a matter of fact, in the last decades a great deal of emphasis has been made to improve and enhance the relationship between the UN and NGOs. It is self-evident that the influence of NGOs in the UN system has increased dramatically since the establishment of the organization: thousands of NGOs attend all UN conferences, they are extremely involved in the drafting of new conventions and their function as observers, agenda setters, and policy implementers is barely denied by anyone. Nevertheless, the relationship between NGOs and the UN is not exclusively a story of cooperation and mutual understanding. In fact, on more than one occasion NGOs have been criticized by governments and governments by NGOs. In the early 1990s former General Secretary of the UN Boutros-Ghali initiated the establishment of the Commission on Global Governance- a panel of 28 eminent personalities chaired by Ingar Carlsson of Sweden and Sridath Ramphal of Guyana. Their final report Our Global Neighbourhood was published in 1995. In the report, global governance is depicted as “a broad, dynamic, complex process of interactive decision-making that is constantly evolving and responding to changing circumstances (Commission on Global Governance 1995: 4). A new world order is described in the report, an order where nation states have no other option than to cooperate with non state actors and civil society, creating a “global neighbourhood” loyal to the catchphrase at the preamble of the UN Charter: “We the Peoples of the United Nations!”. As one of the many suggestions for reform, the report states that a broader involvement of the NGO community in the UN would benefit global governance. As a part of his UN reform in 2002, Boutros-Ghali’s successor Kofi Annan announced a special panel to target the relation between the UN and civil society. This was the Panel of Eminent Persons on United Nations—Civil Society Relations, with the task to study how the relationship between civil society and the UN could be improved. Their final report We the Peoples: Civil Society, The United Nations and Global Governance, published in 2004, expresses that “effective engagement with civil society and other constituencies is no longer an option - it is a necessity in order for the United Nations to meet its objectives and remain relevant in the twenty-first century”. Several suggestions are presented as to how the relationship between the UN and NGOs could be widened and made more efficient, for example by addressing North-South imbalances and facilitating the physical access of civil society to UN facilities. The report is largely known as “the Cardoso Report” because of Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the Chairman of the Panel. In spite of both Boutros-Ghali’s and Annan’s efforts to enforce ties between the UN and civil society, both NGOs and scholars continue to identify problems concerning this issue. This essay will analyze the relation between NGOs and the UN, offering new perspectives of study and making suggestions on new, tighter modalities of cooperation between them. Our starting point, as stated before, is the role that NGOs play at the UN. The reason why we want to draw attention to this subject, is that nowadays the common feeling diffused worldwide when thinking about the United Nations is perhaps that of “distance”. By distance, we mean the gap between the citizens of member countries and the UN bodies and institutions. This could also explain why, in the past and at present too, influential voices of the international community proposed the creation of a UN Parliamentary Assembly (UNPA). It is quite obvious that such an ambitious and revolutionary project needs time to be accepted and implemented. That is why we believe that the reform of the United Nations should start from its Peoples, involving them more in its decisional processes and in its affairs; this could be better implemented with the support of NGOs. The research questions of this study hence read as follows: What positions and arguments—against and in favour—can be distinguished concerning NGO influence within the UN? Is a NGOs’ enhanced influence on the UN decisions desirable? If so, how can it be enhanced?",1

But people disagree sharply on what kind of reform is needed and for what purpose. NGO leaders aim for a more democratic UN, with greater openness and accountability. Technocrats seek more productivity and efficiency from the UN staff. Delegates favour reforms that conform to national interests and promote national power. Idealists offer plans for a great expanded body that would reduce states’ sovereignty, while conservatives push for a downsized UN with sharply reduced powers. Agreement is exceedingly hard to achieve. Since the 1950s, the UN has faced a constant barrage of management studies, policy reviews, reform proposals and even actual reforms. Secretary Generals have carried out substantial changes in the Secretariat. Many reforms had hidden political agendas: they had policy goals, cloaked by technocratic jargon or universal principles. Only few representatives are willing to admit that the UN’s complex and inefficient machinery results from deep political disagreements among its members and between other contending forces in the global system. In a world divided by chasms between rich and poor, powerful and powerless, differences of interest are certain to shape all reform efforts and keep the UN a contradictory and divided institution.",

For instance, Thomas G. Weiss’ definition of global governance, whereby he quotes Rosenau: “systems of rule at all levels of human activity—from the family to the international organization—in which the pursuit of goals through the exercise of control has transnational repercussions” (Weiss 2005, p. 79) appears to describe the status quo of international society. Another view is from Anne-Marie Slaughter, who maintains that the new world order is already in place, characterized by a complex web of “government networks” where officials work across borders to uphold peace and order (Slaughter 2004, p. 1). Another proponent of global governance is Andrew Hurrell, who holds that we will only backslide if we continue to think of international society in terms of what he believes is an outdated state-based pluralism. For him, “the changes associated with globalization and the increased interaction and connectedness across global society have therefore undermined both the practical viability and the moral acceptability” (Hurrell 2007, p. 297) of this view. Instead, Hurrell believes that international society is now moving towards “a shared scheme of global social cooperation and to a meaningful global justice community” (Hurrell 2007, p. 317). But where is this “meaningful global justice community” in the face of persistent, even progressively complex problems that plague the world today? How are we to assume that global governance is already in place while a global food crisis afflicts the world, while a global energy crisis looms on the horizon and while the very real threats associated with global warming remain unresolved? In this paper, I will argue that at present, global governance remains a process far from ending instead of a foregone conclusion. I believe that global governance has not yet passed its period of transition, that there are still enormous challenges associated with its implementation and development through the efforts of the international community. Once these challenges are surmounted, I argue that tackling economic injustice, one of the world’s most pressing problems, can best be achieved through a system of global governance and I will discuss a few policy recommendations in this regard.",

The MDGs were drafted as the main objectives in order to gather efforts (policies and measures) that correspond to the needs of developing countries to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for the world (United Nations 2000). Even though the MDGs tackle the main economic and social problems in developing countries, nutrition is not addressed adequately despite its important role in achieving the MDGs. It is therefore crucial to mainstream nutrition by strengthening public-private partnerships, increased political and technical capacity and by achieving food security. In the first part of this essay the importance of nutrition to achieve the MDGs will be explained. Then we will discuss how strong public-private partnerships, achieving food security, and increasing political and technical capacity are important to mainstream nutrition. Finally, some recommendations and conclusions will be addressed.
 “Malnutrition is one of the most important constraints to achieve the MDGs” (World Bank 2006). In order to achieve the MDGs an adequate policy and investment must be set out regarding nutrition because malnutrition has critical effects on the millennium goals. Improving nutrition is essential to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger (goal 1) because undernourishment diminishes human capital formation and human development through effects on cognitive and physical development which poses a constraint on reducing the poverty gap. Also improving nutrition increases the income potential of the poor, in this direction, studies have shown that undernutrition is three times higher among the poorest income quintile. In relation to goal 2 (“to achieve universal primary education”) malnutrition negatively affects the probability that a child will go to school, stay in school, and perform well. It is also related to avoiding the cognitive damage associated with iodine deficiency in pregnancy, iron efficiency in infancy and protein-calorie malnutrition in preschool children. (United Nations SCN 2004). Relative to gender (goal 3), addressing nutrition empowers women. If women have no access to information they are not able to improve their nutrition and that of their children. Also, investment in girls’ nutrition helps advance the status of women. Malnutrition is associated with most child deaths (goal 4) and contributes to the increase of diseases in the developing world. Moreover, it compromises maternal health (goal 5) because of the increase in the risk of maternal mortality, particularly iron and iodine deficiencies pose serious problems. (World Bank 2006). Nutrition is indispensable to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases (goal 6) because the lack of it compromises antiretroviral therapy and increases the risk of HIV transmission from mothers to babies. Also, it raises the probability of tuberculosis infection, and reduces malaria survival rates: “Nearly 57% of malaria deaths are attributable to malnutrition” (United Nations SCN 2004, p. 17). Moreover, nutrition is dependent on food, but food security requires agricultural practices that agree with environmental sustainability (goal 7), adequate nutrition increases conservation by reducing pressure to use resources unsustainably. Finally, the private sector can contribute and has to take part in various food and nutrition issues (like food fortification programs) through the development of global partnerships (goal 8). Although efforts have been made to improve nutrition, malnutrition still persists and is widespread. In one way this is due to the lack of resources of families, which is related to the levels of poverty in developing countries, but it also has to do with informational asymmetriesFootnote 1 because people cannot tell when children are becoming malnourished or/and they do not know what food or feeding practices are best. Finally, sometimes food marketing may change or affect preferences in unhealthy ways. Partnerships provide an opportunity for improving nutrition by recognizing the qualities and competences of each sector (public-private) and finding new ways of harnessing these for the common good (Tennyson 2003). However, partnerships have different meanings for different constituents; there remains a general lack of consensus about what exactly partnerships are, what the role of private sector should or could be, and what are some of the common obstacles and best practices regarding nutrition. In this regard we will discuss what we think are the main topics in order to strengthen partnerships to mainstream nutrition. The public-private partnership has a positive impact in mobilizing private efforts to public goals. Moreover, focusing on Nutrition and taking into account that the issue is to seek a “comprehensive nutrition security based on an affordable diet of high nutritional quality” (United Nations SCN 2003), and also that food production and consumption patterns are shifting to more processed and packaged food, then we can see that there is a lot of potential for governments, food companies, scientific establishments to collaborate on ensuring adequate nutrition status. In this sense partnerships could be built to work on specific issues relating to technology development, food processing and marketing, food fortification, free market approaches with minimum price support mechanisms, standards, quality assurance, product certification, social communication and demand creation (United Nations SCN 2007). There are three areas where partnership could help mainstream Nutrition: direct funding (provision of cash as a grant), contributions in kind (non-cash inputs in the form of goods or services, including access to resources), and dialogues (exchanging information and/or trying to influence PSO practices). An example of direct funding is the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The fund was provided by the G8 government leaders and its purpose was to attract, manage and disburse funds through this public-private partnership to make a contribution to the reduction of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in countries in need (Richer 2003). But due to a lack of agreement on how to manage the structure of the fund, the disbursement of the grants was delayed. Participations in the decisions on the funds were centered on the better-off countries due to a lack of representation of the weaker countries and the World Health Organization (WHO), which derived into policy actions that were not coordinated with the other partners. These lead us to highlight the importance of a clear fundraising policy that aims to receive money from the donors as a whole and not for specific projects. For example, in the Global Fund the G8 governments decided on how to manage the structure of the fund and this ends up with different programs that were for better development outcomes aiming at different objectives without taking into account a main line. Moreover, the fund must define the main streams of actions in coordination with the government in developing countries and international agencies in nutrition. The contribution in kind partnership is exemplified by The global alliance for vaccines and immunization (GAVI). This was integrated by critical health professionals, policy makers and public interest groups, and its initiative consisted in facilitating access to vaccine services and accelerating the development and introduction of newer vaccines (Richer 2003). The problems that have arisen, by the full participation on decision-making from industry representatives, end up imposing conditions on recipients and focusing on technological issues to improve the pharmaceutical products rather than facilitating its access and attending their needs. Another example of this is Global health alliances like GAIN. Their main goal was to harness corporations to the cause of child well-being through a cost-effective food fortification plan in developing countries given the deficiencies of Vitamin A, folic acid and iron. However, the consequence of this has been that the policies did not address to the main objective; instead great part of the benefits were going to the corporations. For example, a Heinz company launched a fortified ketchup in Philippines, but at the same time it used breast milk substitutes in its products, so they are improving the quality of some products while are negatively affecting other products, which is contradictory with the main initiative of GAIN. Considering that the private sector is driven by individual incentives of profit maximization it is understandable that the companies want to take advantage of the new markets to increase its sales opportunities through developing countries, as we have shown in some of the examples. So the big challenge of successful partnerships is to give the appropriate incentives to the private sector to channel the efforts into a common aim. In other words, the partnership should work to a common public goal (which is to be the main one) and also as a positive externality of pursuing this common objective, which will bring benefits for the private sector to access to new market opportunities. Moreover, The Global Compact can illustrate the contributions in dialogue engagement which consists in a new high-level interaction where business representatives are asked to integrate nine UN principles into their day to-day practices and operations (Richer 2003). Nevertheless, the enforcement of these principles is not being carried out in practice. As a consequence, companies have taken advantage and have been using international organizations like the United Nation to clean or improve their image and reputation. As we have seen, partnerships engagements have different sort of risks: conflict of interests, private influences over public policy for their own interests, undermining of strategic direction to specific nutrition issues [“regarding private sector engagements as ends in themselves” (United Nations SCN 2007, p. 5)], loss of authenticity of the policy due to commercial interests, and funding that shifts the policy priorities and leads to fragmentation of public actions. Therefore, in order to implement an appropriate partnership these risks must be prevented. To do so the government, corporations, NGOs and the international agencies should guide these engagements through: Advocacy, communication and partnership building (United Nations SCN 2007), assessment, monitoring and evaluation, identifying key scientific and operational gaps, funding sustainability and coordination. Because of the lack of communication between partners nutrition products have not reached the most needed people. We can change this by informing the food companies about the risks they are taking if they do not address nutrition issues as a social duty. We can illustrate this with the fact that high levels of malnutrition in a country reduce the productivity of industries and, at the same time, its profits. An example of good practices of partnerships with well-articulated and targeted joint action is the salt industry which has increased the percentage of global iodized salt from 20 to 70% decreasing the mental retardation of children in the world (United Nations SCN 2003). We must not forget that Partnership building is a means but not an end in itself. So it is important to work on building high quality engagements while focusing on the main aim which is the capacity to generate useful nutritional programs. On the other hand, public authorities may enforce laws that can have a negative effect on the investments of the private sector in providing good quality of food at affordable prices. Instead the government should focus on the creation of frameworks for economical, political and social rights and generating political commitment to development (Tennyson 2003). Moreover, given the growing demand of food and the lack of resources that we are facing nowadays because of the increase in population and the energy problem,Footnote 2 the private sector should become aware and take part in the solution to this social problem by applying good business practices which consist in using private skills, technology and scientific research in order to address nutrition improvements. The private sector should not confuse this with putting the priorities of the private first, always looking to the main public objective of policy and building commitment from the private sector. Furthermore, monitoring and evaluating programs is a key issue because it allows the identification of the best practices in partnership creation and management. This gives information about the relevance and sustainability of the programs and serves as an input for policy orientation in other countries. International agencies and local governments in developing countries should not only be concerned with receiving funds from the private sector. First of all they should identify the benefits and the risk of the engagement in order to avoid conflict of interest and ensure that the public interests are the heart of this engagement. As we have discussed above, the participation of the private brings positive outcomes to the improvement of nutrition. In this sense it is needed to increase private sector engagement in the efforts to achieve a world free from hunger and malnutrition. Despite the risks and the problems that may arise from partnerships, we have to tackle what we think are the main topics to improve these alliances in order to eliminate malnutrition. Political and technical coordination and implementation are very important to address nutritional conditions. This is a valuable way of communicating which moves from advocacy-based communication to action-oriented communication (United Nations SCN 2003). Political mainstreaming in terms of Nutrition refers to laws and regulations that rules public budget allocation in projects and programs to improve nutrition (World Bank 2006). For the policies and strategies to work they should be the result of discussions and agreements among stakeholders regarding what they are able and willing to do, taking into account the availability of technical and human resources, and also considering from which sources will it be financed. On the other hand, Technical capacity refers to the implementation of the policy. Families’ lack of knowledge about nutrition, the quality of food and poverty in developing countries are among the main causes of malnutrition. So food supplementation, nutrition education and capacity building are important activities (technical mainstreaming) to put in practice to achieve nutritional policies (political mainstreaming). Food Supplementation is important. However, for the intervention to succeed it requires screening, targeting and monitoring. In this way it ensures the effectiveness of the program and targets the neediest. Moreover, it has to be supported with educational training to achieve behavioral changes in the fastest way. This could be illustrated by the schools that provide food to children and at the same time give nutrition education to women on how to cook and feed their young children. Additionally, building capacity by staff training programs helps to target and identify the objective population. In this sense capacity building arises as a complementary approach to achieve nutrition policies by a multi-sectorial training program which consists in training staff from key sectors: health, agriculture, education, planning, water and sanitation. Experience with nutrition policy making and implementation has been discouraging because of one of two reasons: some countries lack nutritional policies while others assume specific policies that have failed to decrease malnutrition; due to a lack of commitment and capacity (technical and financial) from the country itself. As a consequence most of the nutritional activities have been badly oriented. In relation with policy making, the weaknesses are: the establishment of general goals without building specific targets, the assignment of responsibilities and tasks, setting the mechanisms to achieve goals (plan investment); a lack of best practices overview, costs estimation of the interventions alternatives and the way of financing; the lack of commitment from the government policies; and policies are not linked to a monitoring and evaluation process, which could lead to scale up the wrong kind of nutrition programs. Political mainstreaming is the key to improving nutrition given that weaknesses in policies cause mismatches between the population’s need and the design of the programs. For example, many nutritional programs focus on food security and food supplementation where poor access to health services or poor child-care practices are the main causes of malnutrition (“food first mismatch” World Bank 2006, p. 89). Secondly, most undernutrition happens during pregnancy and the first 2 years of life; nevertheless many programs continue to expend large resources on children aged 3–6 years. For instance, the recent push in Africa for school feeding programs is another example of mistargeted resources and is particularly ironic in resource-scarce settings, where it has high opportunity costs. (“age-targeting mismatch” World Bank 2006, p. 89). Finally, data show us that malnutrition is concentrated among the poor. But many programs fail to identify them and so to reach either the poorest geographic areas or the poorest people in mixed-income communities. Therefore, the importance of project incidence analyses as part of program evaluations and the corresponding recommendations into the design of policies and strategies (“The poverty-targeting mismatch” World Bank, 2006, p. 89). For example, a recent review of nutrition in the context of the poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSPs) shows that among 40 countries, 38 had a micronutrient problem, but only 23 had specific activities to address micronutrient malnutrition. However, more than 90% mentioned food security interventions, even though in these cases food security may not be the major problem but the micronutrient. This reflects the lack of capacity to identify the main goal and the corresponding policies and activities. As a result effective nutrition policies need to reflect the country necessities, commitment and capacity to turn policy into action. Adequate technical and human resources solutions in the investments are important to transform policy commitment into effective nutrition actions. For example, Thailand was able to build up a successful multi-sectorial nutrition program because it was strongly committed to nutrition due to the appropriate management capacity. Moreover, a cultural tradition of community allowed it to expand to a national level (World Bank 2006). However, some countries may not be in the fortunate position of Thailand, so it makes sense to focus on alternative ways of achieving nutrition goals within one or two sectors. This implies a prioritization of the nutritional policies and goals. To do so a careful consideration of the trade-offs among the many actions should be made. For instance, in the cases where there is a great financial constraint, priorities should focus on the most cost effective intervention in nutrition (for example, provision of vitamin A), combined and coordinated with other social policies (like income generation or education) in order to spring better results. In this case, the tradeoff refers to the assumption of providing vitamin A instead of other interventions that might improve nutrition, which implies an opportunity analysis as well. Policy mainstreaming and coordination is a clue ingredient in order to generate the best possible outcome. Some other examples of tradeoffs with regard to nutrition are: food supplementation versus health care and micronutrient interventions; younger children versus older children; coverage versus quality. But the most efficacious approach may not be the most appropriated one, as some nutritional interventions might be essential while other may be desirable. Therefore, a participatory training approach like the Triple A process—i.e. “assess the problem, analyze its causes and take action” (UNICEF)—must be completed in order to improve the nutritional situation. This will help to identify the main causes of malnutrition, the type of intervention and amount of resources available to combat it. This is UNICEF’s conceptual framework which assists governments and helps to improve its capacity of targeting and success performance of programs. It is also a way of integrating the community. Finally, to increase political and technical capacity it is important to generate reliable data about the characteristics of the population in order to be able to establish objectives, formulate appropriate policies and be able to screen and target the potential beneficiaries. In relation to the identification of policies within countries, it is important to create the capacity to advise policy makers about the nutrition effects of programs. Another important step is to communicate the policies to all the actors that provide programs in this area (NGOs, international agencies) in order to coordinate efforts to eliminate malnutrition and emphasize its importance. Then the country must define the activities needed to achieve the main objectives of the policies, taking into account the financial restrictions and filling the technical obstacles that may occur. Among the activities, education and information campaigns should be carried out at all levels to raise awareness of the consequences that poor diet has been demonstrated to cause. Moreover, it is important that the government promotes the participation of different key sectors (agriculture, health, water and sanitation, education, economics, planning) in the overall nutritional strategy by providing them with resources and multi-sectorial training programs. Lastly, building the capacity of the public sector at all levels should be part of the overall nutritional strategy. For example, benefit-incidence analyses should be included in monitoring and evaluating the policies and activities. This joined with organizational leadership and appropriate financing helps scaling-up the best programs to address malnutrition (Sachs 2005). An important determinant of Nutrition is food security as we can see on the Fig. 1 where is shown that countries with higher food availability tend to have better nutrition. Differences in aggregate per capita food availability and percent child underweight levels Furthermore, food security is defined by FAO as: “A situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life” (FAO 2002). This view strengthens the relation between agriculture and nutrition and therefore is a key component to mainstream nutrition. In this sense food security involves adequate food supply, stable food supply and access (Haddad 2002). Consequently our recommendation to achieve food security contains three main topics: biotechnology, food trade policies (dumping, subsidies), and bio-energy products as impact on prices. Firstly, agriculture can reduce micronutrient deficiencies and malnutrition if farmers are responsible in applying the right techniques and fertilizers to the lands. Moreover, by adopting inappropriate policies and practices related to agriculture we can impact negatively on nutrition deficiencies. An important tool to improve good practices on agriculture is adopting technological change such as biotechnology and food fortification that improves the nutritional characteristics of food. Additionally, these would positively affect the outcomes of appropriate nutritional policies. Biotechnology has an important impact on food and consequently on nutrition. It has a potential to achieve higher yields, and the increase in productivity may lead to lower prices. Also, in the future genetic engineering can be used to improve storage and this will increase the food available (Junne 1991). Biotechnology can also help to eliminate unwanted components (toxic components) and is useful for the production of additives that increase the nutritive value of the final product or that improve its flavor, texture or appearance. In addition, food fortification must be adopted in order to avoid nutrition deficiencies, but they require careful planning in order to ensure appropriate food fortificants to enhance micronutrient status in the target population. In developing countries, food fortification is being recognized as an important tool for improving the micronutrient status of the population given that deficiencies in various minerals and vitamins, such as iron, iodine, folic acid, and vitamins A and D, are widespread in poor areas, and the consequences of these deficits are especially serious for infants, children, and women. However, the technology of food fortification has some concerns in relation to levels of nutrients, stability, characteristics of physical properties as well as acceptability by consumers, including cooking properties and taste. Even though this capability exists, there are many obstacles for developing countries to beneficiate from these advances. The frequently obstacles are: “weak linkages between international and national research institutions; poor communication between national research institutions and farmers; a lack of support measures (credit schemes, regular provision of improved seeds, demonstration plots and marketing outlets); and landholding structures which dampen the interest of landlords and tenants in introducing new technologies” (Junne 1991). On the other hand, nowadays food security has been affected by the weak performance of policies from the organization system which provide food. To illustrate, food trade policies, such as dumping, subsidies and discriminatory tariffs, have negatively affected the agricultural sector in developing countries putting at risk the lives of millions of people who die every minute because of the lack of food and malnutrition. Dumping refers to the situation when rich countries have an excess of food supply and they sell their food to developing countries at lower prices. This policy is very profitable for the rich countries given that the size of the market is large. However, it negatively affects developing countries by two ways. On the one hand, the small farmers cannot compete with the lower prices and because the mainstay of the economy depends on agriculture it affects a large part of the population by decreasing their income and at the same time their access to safety food. On the other hand, the population gets used to lower prices and when the flows of food from rich countries are stopped and the prices increase, the population suffers an unexpected reduction in their disposable income and as a consequence its food security gets compromised. Furthermore this situation is worsened when the product is an essential part of the diet of the population. So the governments in developing countries should pay attention to this issue. One way could be by controlling the flows of food by demanding fees from rich countries. In this way, the local producers do not decrease their production and can generate enough food and prevent hunger and malnutrition. Second, most of the subsidies are given to big producers instead of the small farmers who really are in need. This happens because the better-off producers have the power to influence the government in their personal interest and, moreover, small farmers represent lower profits to the economy so they are forgotten by the governments. Nevertheless, small farmers are very important for the population because they provide national consumption that reaches directly the communities rather than international consumption (exports) in which the food flows away from the poor countries to feed the rich. Thus we can see that there is no scarcity of food. The problem is an unequal distribution of food between the rich and poor given the unfair subsidies which eliminate national producers in providing local food and increase exportations of commodities, leaving the local communities without access to adequate food. So governments should encourage vulnerable consumers to buy local products to help them face the difficulties in the world food supply and demand. To illustrate, the government in Peru encourages the community to eat bread that includes potato flour to reduce costly wheat imports (FAO 2008) to reduce costly products imports that benefit local farmers and vulnerable consumers. Still we can see the unequal distribution of benefits at the world level where the preferences go more to the rich countries than the poor countries. This could be exemplified by the European case: “To illustrate how large and disproportional subsidies can be, in the European Union every cow has a subsidy of two dollars a day, while millions of Africans live on less than a dollar a day “(Lewis 2005, p. 18). Consequently, the poor have to be represented in the international trade discussions to design and implement fair subsidies which support and promote small farmers. On the other hand, prices on food (as a commodity) and processed food are different. These are the so-called discriminatory prices which consist of the reduction of prices on food and the increase of prices of processed food. Most of developing countries lack the technological capacity to obtain processed food; as a consequence they are not able to participate in this market. Therefore the government should incentivize local producers to achieve the next level of production in order to give the consumer a more elaborate outcome, which in turn pays a higher price. Thus one possible solution could be a system of subsidies and training to help farmers develop food technologies so that they can provide better food quality, like processed and packaged food, which have higher safety and hygiene. Moreover, the international community has started to warn the world of a food crisis caused by an increase in food prices. This increase is being caused by the discovery of alternative sources of energy (bio-fuel) and the increase of world demand on food in grant part caused by the growth of China and India in the past years in terms of population and purchase power. For example, in the next two decades, world population will increase 100 million people annually as an average and 95% of it in developing countries, with huge pressures on land and water use (FAO 2008). To illustrate the increase in the production of bioenergy products we can see the Brazil debate where they have an international commitment to feeding people and they are using a lot of their fields to produce bio-energy instead of food. As a consequence of the increase in world food prices, developing countries should increase their production in valuable crops for local farmers and poor consumers. One example crop that is gaining importance within the international community and developing countries is the production of “potato”. To illustrate why, potato is not a globally traded commodity so its prices are determined usually by local production costs. It is easy to cultivate because it needs small allotments and is adaptable to different weather conditions; it is rich in carbohydrate and protein which contributes to a good source of energy to the poor; and protects the environment given that does not consume large resources. For these reasons, potato crops are increasing in developing countries such as Bangladesh, Sub-Saharan Africa, mainly in Cameroon, Kenya, Malawi and Rwanda, and in South East Asia given its good performance. Moreover, India and China have become the largest producers with totals that have jumped from 16 million tons in 1960 to almost 100 million in 2006 (FAO 2008). Consequently the United Nations declared the year 2008 as the International Year of the Potato to promote potato as a staple food in the diet of the world’s population and its potential as a “food of the future”. Moreover,the Director of FAO, Jacques Diouf (Church 2008) stated that: “Potato (Solanum tuberosum) is in the frontline of the struggle against hunger and poverty in the world”. Thus, food security is vulnerable and as a result the international community has a challenge to ensure food security and at the same time protect natural resources. Therefore, by increasing the awareness of the benefits of potato crops the risk of food security for poor countries is reduced. Moreover, trade topics that go ahead the borders of the countries require agreements and commitments with the different stakeholders: the international community, government leaders, co-operatives and the small producers. As we have seen, biotechnology can positively affect nutrition policies, so research in this area and a network to share and propagate new knowledge must be established.",

Over the past few years, the growth of Euroland has really been stagnating. Since the beginning of European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1999, growth has averaged only 1.8%, compared with 2.8% in the United States and 2.5% in the United Kingdom (source: OECD, National Statistics Authorities). In 1990–2002, GDP growth per capita was higher in Euroland than in the United States (source: OECD, National Statistics Authorities). In more recent years, however, even per capita GDP growth in Euroland fell short of rates reached elsewhere. In the products being produced, 10 years ago, Europe and United States both produced about the third of the products being produced into the market around the world. Today, Europe’s share is down to 20% of falling and U.S. share is over 60%. There are several reasons for the sluggish economic growth. First, the market is saturating and there is fierce competition in the market. European’s weakness, difficulties to adjust to more intense labor competition, has been an important reason for Euroland’s lackluster performance in recent years. All European states had strategies to create employment. However, they did not work. The reason for that is that there are too may priorities in the system. It is the problem of delivery and decision making. Thus, the whole system is too complicated and too slow. Therefore, there is no sense of ownership, no sense of possession and no sense of responsibility. Secondly, the emergence of China and Southeast Asian countries as major suppliers of manufactured goods and the accession of Central European countries to the EU have increased low cost competition for European producers. With Europe wages sticky, non-wage labor costs high, and labor mobility very limited, low-wage competition from abroad has put upward pressure on unemployment (Keene 2005). Thirdly, the lesson we could draw from the past decade is that combine social justice with economic success. Job is the best social inclusion. Once we got someone into the job, then next is to get the one a better job, so raising skills and raising skills is also a crucial part of competitiveness. What we have to do is pursue other social and environmental goals but in ways that enhance competitiveness in stead of undermining or threatening to destroy it. That is where too often individual member states but also European Union as a whole has gone wrong in the past. Euro area annual capital stock growth allowed from about 3% during 1981–1990 to only 2% in 2003. Partly offsetting this, total hours worked stagnated in recent years after having fallen significantly during the 1970s. However, total factor productivity growth—which reflects the economy’s ability to leverage growth of capital and labor input through technology—fell by about one half since the mid-1990s. By contrast, total factor productivity growth in the United States almost doubled during this period (Blanchard 2004). Without a sizeable increase in productivity growth, it is hard to see how Europe trend growth can pick up to its past levels and narrow its gap with the United States. In a recent study, Deutsche Bank estimated Euroland potential growth at 1.75% in the annual average of 2003–2010 (Deutsche Bank 2003). This estimate was based on a contribution from total factor productivity growth of 0.6% points, from capital input growth of 0.7% points, and from labor input growth of 0.5% points. For this to materialize it was assumed that productivity and capital input growth stabilized slightly above recent levels, while labor input growth accelerated on the back of working-time extension, higher participation rates, and lower structural unemployment. Last but not least, we know pretty well that something needs to be done in order to improve performance and competitiveness. It means to accept the market rules. It implies to accept the environment where enterprises can perform in their best way. It means to accept competition as the most important element for the economy. The integration of lesser developed and formerly communist countries into a world market of goods and services, the fall of the barriers to international capital flows, and rapid technological progress led largely by the United States have put additional strain on the European economic model (Redwood 2005). Moreover, local governments may have different objectives. The objective, of Europe as a whole, is competitiveness, jobs and growth. Many of the local companies are putting controls of costs to hit of investments and jobs. The challenge of the struggle is how to implement the governance agenda when member states have different objectives. In all European counties, the agricultural sector has been under intense government management through the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU. Over time, direct government meddling in industry has receded. Britain has done better than the average of the European over the last decade. What they have done was that they combined a platform of micro economy stabilities with a whole series of structural reforms. The welfare security system brought unemployment to a low level and created an environment to bring into the employment, and at the same time, partly driving that, they see hundreds of thousands of establishments established. The importance of structural reform is clear from their experience. And they are not the only one get it right. Following the British example, continental European governments—especially Italy and France—have privatized a large part of their extensive industrial holdings. At the same time, however, governments have continued to redistribute income and fortify the welfare state. Hence, government spending in general and spending on social benefits in particular have remained much higher relative to GDP in Europe than elsewhere, notably in the United States. For instance, during 1995–1998, 29.1% of its GDP was used for social spending in France, while 27.4% in Germany and 24.5% in Italy, respectively. On the other part, United States spent 15.1% of its GDP on social spending and Canada 18.4% (OECD 2001). In his impressive economic history of the world, The Wealth and Poverty of Nations, David Landes traces the rise and fall of several European powers since the middle of the last millennium (Telo 2007). The question is how can we bring the European economy back to the track? The innovation and driving technology are very important in EU, people rarely talk a lot about it, but they are the key things that keep people with current living standard. Europe will never eligibly compete with the international low-pay labor. Europe has its tradition in front-edge technology, such as German has the top automobiles and Italy has elegant fashion in the world. Also, as structure reforms in the labor market, government really did a lot, but they are far from enough. Lastly, a more competitive governance system which is easier and more transparent is highly needed. If a country reforms one year by the other, it is very difficult for people to decide where the investments to go.",

The tumultuous debate on method is indicative of a manifest dissatisfaction with the neoclassical thought, itself an import from physics at origin, as dominant epistemological platform in economics. Its major theoretical corollary, namely that free market functioning through voluntary transactions is conducive to a social optimum, has been constantly questioned on such grounds as contradictory results of modelling approaches or lack of relevance of policy initiatives in diverse socio-economic contexts. Institutional economics has received so much credit among the proposed alternatives to the extent of even being commended as the exclusive solution to development (e.g. North 1990; Easterly and Levine 2002; Clark 2007; Pejovich 2008). Having gained the recognition of two Nobel prizes, to Ronald Coase and to Douglass North, the neoclassical pair has accordingly raised to the stature of introducing itself as the method of economic study. This paper’s thesis is that institutionalism reaches its own limits circumscribed by the original view of the logic of economic inquiry based on causation. Ignoring the external circumstances of the social whole by virtue of ceteris paribus postulation creates an epistemic vacuum as regards the most part of our understanding of economic evolutions. A social phenomenon, to which economic causation is only a part, requires an analytical framework embedded in historical specificity (historicity). A rival epistemology of that contour is not within the scope of this paper. I nevertheless attempt to scrutinize two major claims of the institutional literature that serve as organizing themes of the next section. First is the issue of validity of the institutional solution as an explanatory companion of neoclassical economics, which increasingly devolved into a methodological platform of its own. Second is the issue of relevance of comparability of economic performance based on institutional change over long periods of time. Failure to appear so would represent “a challenge to the fundamental logic of our approach” say Acemoglu and Robinson (2002). In guise of a practical corollary, the paper ends with a casuistic illustration from Eastern European transition economies and concludes that the uncertainties of transition, neither more obscured, nor more difficult than of any other historical system, are left as much puzzling in orthodox as in institutional recipes.",

The banking law is liberal; there is avoidance of extensive state ownership and government direction of the economy, reflected by the absence of dominant state owned-banks and by the limited use of directed credit programs, interest rate controls and credit ceilings. As a country with a population dominated by a 85% of muslims (World Population Statistics Website), Jordan was also affected by the resurgence that had taken place in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). Many parties were calling for the establishment of an Islamic bank in Jordan because they did not want to engage in Riba. For example in the mid-1970s almost half of the total commercial banks deposits were in demand or current accounts on which zero or minimal interest was paid. Accordingly, the Central Bank of Jordan issued the Shariah Law No. 13 of 1978, which had been created for the purpose of establishing Islamic banks, and as a consequence, the Jordan Islamic Bank for Finance and Investment (JOIB) was established in 1978, as a public shareholding limited company, with an initial paid-up capital of JD 4 million. Today, Jordan has succeeded in implementing a dual banking system, encompassing full-fledged Islamic banks operating side-by-side with conventional banks. Currently, two Islamic banks are doing business in the country, while efforts are spent to convert also the Industrial Development Bank. Throughout the years, Islamic banking has gained significance, and has been on a progressive upward trend. Since 2000, the Islamic banking industry has been growing at 15.54% over the period from 2000 to 2006 in terms of assets. As at end-2006, total assets of the Islamic banking sector increased to JD 2.037 billion, which accounted for 5.07% of the total assets in the banking system. The market share of Islamic deposits and financing increased to 7.26 and 5.64% of total banking sector deposits and financing, respectively. This paper examines the structure and performance of the Islamic banking industry in Jordan. The Jordanian Islamic banking industry is still in its infancy compared to a number of countries in the region and there is a trend in the financial services market that currently is not large in size, growing rapidly and has few players but not a market leader. The paper aims to document the success of the Islamic banking sector, but also to highlight some important areas where issues arise. The paper is organized as follows. “Development of the Islamic Banking System”, reviews the extent of banking industry development and its institutional structure. The following section offers in turn a brief review of the structure of Jordan Islamic Banking system in terms of assets, deposits and credit facilities. “Performance of Islamic Banks” examines the performance of Islamic banks in Jordan, where “Performance of Islamic Banks Listed in Amman Stock Exchange (ASE)” examines Islamic Banks listed at the Amman Stock Exchange. “Islamic Banks Market Size”, examines the market size of Islamic banks in Jordan, where “Major Players”, examines the performance of the major player of the Jordan Islamic banking industry. “Regulation and Supervision of Islamic Banks in Jordan”, examines the regulatory and supervisory framework. The paper concludes with a section on policy recommendations.",3

In the international debate preceding 1962 it was not customary to consider the whole of Chandler’s decisions as “strategy”: the work of Smith and Christensen (1962), only 1 year earlier, even though speaking of “business policy”, inductively analyses business “strategies” and their implementation but it does not provide a conceptual framework. Chandler explicitly introduces the concept and definition of “strategy” as a business’ choice of basic aims and long term objectives, the choice of criteria of action and the type of allocation of resources necessary to realise the aforementioned objectives.Footnote 1 “Structure” is defined as the organisational design with which the business is managed, specifying that such a design, whether formal or informal, has two aspects: the lines of authority and communication between the different administrative functions and those in charge; the information and data that flow through these. Chandler’s text therefore describes the relationship between strategies, structure and processes, identifying a direct connection of causality: the strategy determines the structure through changes in the organisational design. Chandler identifies the succession of four strategies: (1) expansion of volume and needs of administrative functions; (2) geographical expansion and distribution of the same function in more units that are further apart; (3) vertically integrated business even with decentralised functions; (4) divisionalised company. Scott (1971) introduces a model that considers the changes within the competitive context of the twentieth century and which differs from Chandler’s especially with regard to divisional structure and diversification strategy. Scott differentiates between “divisionalisation”, as a choice of an efficient structural typology, and “decentralization” as a policy measure of operating within the structure. Scott notes the presence of divisional structures that are crossed by diverse degrees of decentralisation, within the range of diversification strategies that are by nature always more financial and focused on the profitability of the group system. Channon (1973) highlights, in the British case, the low significance of the growth phase through vertical integration and proposes a model with three specific “strategic categories”, highlighting stickiness and resistance in the passage from one to the other: businesses with a sole product, businesses with a dominating product, businesses with various diversified productions. Following Chandler’s (1962) study on US industry and that of Channon (1973) on British industry, others have adapted the model to the individual national specifics (Suzuki 1985 for Japan, Pavan 1976 for Italy) definitively releasing the study of the “structure” from the rigid Weberian determinism and finally grounding it in the external institutional environment. The Swedish school, particularly with Uppsala’s model of internationalisation (Johanson and Vahlne 1977), brought attention to the importance of the cognitive processes on the incremental decision-making mechanisms and on the associated gradualness of the emerging courses of internationalisation. According to the Uppsala model, given certain cognitive conditions, businesses typically begin to expand internationally with direct export to a single country, through an agent; they later establish a sales subsidiary and finally, in some cases, a production establishment. The ensuing debate has challenged Chandler’s theoretical framework and the causal strategy–structure relation, suggesting that strategy can emerge, occasionally, from a given structure (Hall and Saias 1980) or as the result of a contextual development and emerging from interconnected structures and strategies. Despite that, the value of Chandler’s pioneering work in terms of initiating and systematising a new trend of research, that moved away from Weberism, still remains unquestioned. Researchers of the internationalisation of businesses have closely examined the subject of the relation between organisational structure and strategy (Stopford and Wells 1972; Franko 1976; Egelhoff 1988) pushing progressively forward towards a concept of the firm understood as an “organisation set” (Aldrich and Whetten 1981). Such a trend of research, that led to the definition of a “network” form (Tichy et al. 1979; Snow et al. 1992) has shown to be particularly suitable for research into the internationalisation of Italian businesses (Boari et al. 1989; Lorenzoni 1990) that are characterised by small sizes and by territorial systems that are well integrated (district, cluster, pole). Local and district systems in fact, prove to be the basic axis of Italian exports, even showing the capacity to experiment with new forms of organisation, like the multi-located district (Zucchella 2006). On the scientific level, the main contribution of Italian economists to the research of internationalisation is the analysis of the businesses’ starting “place”, whether these be districts or non-district local systems (Becattini 2000; Bellandi and Caloffi 2006; Dei Ottati 2003; Rullani 1997), rather than end “places”. Instead, the Italian business school has focused its research on the small internationalised company, identifying in it not only a transitory development typology, but a form of real presence in foreign markets (Pepe 1984; Cafferata and Genco 1997; Cafferata and Mensi 1995; Golinelli 1992). Recent Italian studies, using Uppsala’s model of internationalisation as a basis and taking into account the described specifics of the Italian reticular production model, have created a model of internationalisation in stages, based on the model of sub-supply; by analysing the processes of relocating the fashion sector towards Eastern Europe they encountered three different phases: (1) traditional sub-supply; (2) co-ordinated sub-supply; (3) relocation of the supply system (Camuffo et al. 2006). These studies highlight that the Chandlerian causal connection between strategy and structure remains unchallenged: the flexible and reticular structure of our small and medium-size industries adapts itself constantly and rapidly to the strategies of internationalisation of businesses. However, the evolutionary path of the strategy–structure relationship in the fashion sector does not follow the historical model of the great North American industries as described by Chandler for the motor and chemical sectors: Uppsala’s model of incremental and cognitive internationalisation appears to be the most suitable reference for the Italian “industrial networks” of the fashion sector (Johanson and Vahlne 1990).",1

Since its very establishment, it is commonly criticized for its insufficient level of public financing (Sheiman 2006, Dixon et al. 2004; Mossialos and Thomson 2001; Eatwell et al. 2000; Burger et al. 1998; Twigg 1998; Witter and Sheiman 1997). This imbalance in health care obligations and public financial sources within the new Russian health care system led to the deficit of “the Program of State Guarantees for Free Health Care”, a guaranteed benefits package to be provided to all Russian citizens. The roots of the problem are hidden in the very legislation of the health care system. On the one hand, the basic free health care package to be received in all Russian regions is set and almost annually revised on the federal level. At the same time, the 1991 law “On the Health Insurance of the Citizens of the Russian Federation” allows regional budgets to make their own decisions about the size of their payments for health care of the non-working population as well as for financing the regional network of health care institutions. The lack of mechanisms ensuring correspondence of regional health care financing to the federal benchmark figures set in the “Methodological recommendations of the Federal MHI fund for forming territorial basic package programs” became the key reason for the failure of receiving the due amount of resources from regional budgets. The deficit led to MHI inability to finance all health care expenditure of in-patient and out-patient institutions. Consequently, while medical staff salary, drugs and major communal services are covered by MHI, a number of other items (capital investment, housing and communal services) are either financed partly or non-covered. According to the State Treasury data, the share of health care expenditure in the consolidated regional budgets decreased from 18% in 1998 to 11% in 2003. This fall cannot be explained by diminishing regional revenues, since the latter increased in the same period by as much as 7 times. Bridging the gap between the volumes of free health care guaranteed by the federal legislation and financial resources within the health care system became the major challenge for insurers, providers and consumers. Indeed, in the first several years after the creation of the new health system, directors of the health care institutions regarded “the necessity to help their institution survive” almost as important as their primary responsibilities “to perfect the quality of health care” and “to provide consumers medical services of due quality” (Galanova 1999). A large group of head doctors even strongly advocated the return to the Soviet health system (Twigg 2002). MHI component of Russian health system faced dissatisfaction and lack of knowledge about its legislative and financial structure not only from consumers’ side, but from insurers and territorial health insurance funds managers (Reshetnikov 2006; Twigg 1999). Financial deficit in the Russian health care system is accompanied by ineffective spending due to the following groups of factors: structural imbalance in health care with prevailing in-patient, and not out-patient services; weak economic incentives for medical staff and health care institutions to provide effective health care; absence of an efficient competitive health insurance system, which would guarantee the rights of the insured (to choose the insurer and medical institution) and adequate insurer motivation (the choice of efficient medical institutions and effective ways of organizing health care provision); duplication of health care provision by ministerial (departmental) health care institutions, MHI institutions and the system of voluntary health insurance (VHI). In this context, Russian “Health care” national project was started in 2006 as the means to increase public spending and raise health care efficiency. One of the major measures of the national project was to increase salaries for doctors and nurses, working in the public preventive care and emergency care. This was aimed at emphasizing the role of primary sector by shifting the demand for health care from excessive in-patient sector to primary care, which was provided by out-patient institutions or general practitioner offices.Footnote 1 Physicians, dealing with specialized care in out-patient institutions were also able to receive additional salary for conducting check-ups and doing various preventive activities. Maternity hospitals received additional funding through a special mechanism of “maternity certificates”, monetary equivalents issued for each pregnant woman by the state. These sources were transferred to maternity institutions, and were spent on salaries and medical equipment. The rise of salary in health care sector was indeed the highly burning measure, since the level of medical staff wages in 2004 was only 54% of the corresponding average indicator in the industry and 67% of the average salary in Russian economy. Moreover, 38% of physicians and nurses received salary lower than subsistence wage. This inadequate payment in public health care institutions had an impact on decision of doctors, medical attendants and nurses to take extra jobs in public health care sector or to work in private sector (Galenko et al. 2006). Another important component of national project was provision of lacking equipment to all municipal out-patient institutions and a number of hospitals. The growth in public financing within national project was regarded as one of the stimuli for changes in health care effectiveness and quality. Yet, while increase in funding and targeted attention to certain issues within health provision usually do lead to better health indicators (Byrne et al. 2007) and have always been treated by Russian health providers as one of the mostly awaited measures (Twigg 2002), the fact that quality and efficiency monitoring was absent or nominal in the national project led to questioning the link between increased public funding and expected health outcomes. This paper proposes estimating effectiveness in the rise of public health care expenditure within Russian health care project by using the following health outcome indicators: Mortality of working age population (all men aged 16–59 and all women aged 16–54) from all causes, except for external. The usage of this parameter instead of usual proxies for health care quality (standardized or risk adjusted mortality rate) may be explained by the fact that national project was largely focused on preventive activities for working population—scheduled check-ups in municipal out-patient institutions and special treaties between enterprise and health care institutions. Mortality of working age population is an important indicator, related to labor market and overall economic performance (Twigg 2005). External causes (class XX, codes Vo1-Y98 in ICD-10) are omitted since they are explained by mainly social reasons.Footnote 2
 Infant mortality under 1. This parameter is usually regarded as the one, which is particularly related to the quality of health system. Life expectancy at birth. It is studied as one of parameters commonly presented in Russian normative analysis. Yet, the impact of health system performance in this case is only partial. Average number of illness days. This indicator is connected with primary care for working population within national project and labor market and worker productivity. Although the national project is being launched in 2006–2008, data availability allows analyzing structural shifts only for its first year. Therefore, such estimations must be interpreted with much cautiousness. Indeed, a certain time period and longitudinal data are necessary for figuring out the effects of policy measures. It is also that, apart from health system factors, regional parameters of population health depend on social, economic, behavioral and other indicators and have various forms of age-specific trends and lags (Gasnikov 2006; Shkolnikov et al. 1998). Nonetheless, a certain justification for the proposed analysis may be found in the fact that while 44–50% of medical staff considered the results of national project be visible only in a number of years, the share of those, who expected changes within one year was also relatively high (Pakhomova 2006).",3

The European Union and India Compared,October 2009,Matilde Cassin,Bruna Zolin,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"World energy consumption has been increasing more and more over the years; it is still now mainly satisfied by fossil fuels, raising a series of issues such as the scarcity of fossil resources, their growing cost, their impact on the environment in terms of greenhouse emissions and climate change. A solution can be found in renewable energy, which is unlimited and non-polluting energy, it has a much lower environmental impact than conventional sources of energy and several other benefits such as stimulating the economy (through research activities, new technologies development, etc.) and creating job opportunities. Renewable energy, in particular, could represent an aid to face the problem of isolation and resulting economic and social disadvantages in rural and remote areas of developed but, over all, developing countries, where the use of non-conventional resources can be a solution to provide electricity and services to resident populations, in a sustainable way (both from an economic and environmental point of view) and so could contribute to improve the standards and quality of life in these areas. More and more countries, in fact, are investing in renewable energy sources, even if the quota of worldwide energy consumption satisfied by them is still low (about 1.6% in 2006), but it is worth underlining that renewable energy data could be underestimated (sometimes and in some areas, in fact, renewable energies are used by households to satisfy their domestic energy needs). This paper analyses the role of renewable energy at world, European and Indian levels, paying particular attention to rural areas and focusing on a particular kind of renewable resource: the wind. Wind energy, in fact, has been the most dynamically growing energy resource in the last years and it can be used in rural areas in many ways, over all at village-scale to produce energy by mini-grids and hybrid systems but also for water pumping (both irrigation use and drinking water). Europe and India play an important role within the wind energy market: in 2008 the EU25 had the primacy in wind-installed capacity and India placed itself at fourth position. This makes it very interesting to re-enact and to compare the framework in these areas, analysing benefits and criticalities of this particular energy resource and bearing in mind that, for the future, it can be expected that wind energy will continue its dynamic development and recent studies have foreseen that wind energy, along with solar, would conquer a 50% market share of new power plant installations worldwide by 2019 (Energy Watch Group 2008).",3

16,3,Transition Studies Review,02 September 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-009-0104-z,Central America and its Perception of 2020 “Regional Integration” Aim,October 2009,Omar Appolloni,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Central American sub-region is composed of seven small and developing countries with a population of almost 32 million inhabitants and an area of 522,008 km2. There were social and political conflicts in some countries during the past decade that left an estimate of 250,000 people dead or missing as well as millions of dollars in losses or damage to the economy. After the well-known decade perdida (1970–1980), a period of political, social and economic crisis among any Central-American country, a severe wind of adjustments reacted against the general stagnation in the Isthmus and it went through a phase of economic recovery. However, this remarkable process has generated future-key and growing contradictions in the national economies in order to settle on the actual situation.Footnote 1 On one hand, this route was very slow. The rise of qualified new jobs and exports’ trend are dynamic, but not as much as imports, and this expanding economic gap faces to the dynamic family remittances, especially in three countries (El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras). On other hand, considering the regional level, after disagreements and divergences between countries on the process of integration, a period of rapprochement and cooperation started again in 2000. This new course was related to the prospect that the regional area should be incorporated into the globalization process and that this new effort could be more successful if done within a process of integration. From then on, the challenge to transform Central America into a modern and open sub-region depends on how a democratic culture, a transformation of the productive apparatus, and a modernization of the state are implemented in order to face globalization and to prevent conflict and promote security. One important aspect in Central America is a process of integration aimed to complement the individual efforts. Such a process is the dream of a “bigger country” for many Central Americans. Finally, Central America countries undertook a long journey of reforms with the belief that economic integration Central America was not an obstacle, but functional to the process of dynamic insertion into the international economy. The process of integration is not actually new in Central America. A common market was promoted by five out of the seven countries (Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) that provided several trade benefits. The new integration process and the creation of SICA (Sistema de Integracion Centroamericano) which not only involves trade but is also political, social, cultural, and ecological, was launched at the beginning of this decade.Footnote 2
 With that perception, Central American countries came to the several task in order to conclude FTAs with several area, especially USA, China and UE. However, due to the different velocity and depth with which countries adopted economic reforms and the internal dynamics of the political calendar, these negotiations were conducted on a bilateral basis. Although those agreements were almost with the same countries, they resulted in different forms, process, calendars and components. All what happened, it created a sort of “overlap of agreements’” where same countries were linked by different FTA. DR-CAFTA was signed between the Isthmus, Dominican Republic and USA but Costa Rica and Panama has special relations with it.Footnote 3 SICA pulls together the northern triangle (Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador) but Costa Rica and Panama are observers. Venezuela has bilateral relations and agreements with the Northern Triangle. Plan Puebla–Panama, an intergovernmental project of Mesoamerica Integration (South of Mexico and CA) has not shown its results yet. With European Union, the fifth meeting of UE–CA representatives was hold in Guatemala at the end of last October. UE-27 and Central America negotiated the future of their political and commercial relations. As European Commission members admitted, negotiations will be concluded at the and of April 2009. The bi-regional treaty’s approval has become extremely important for the European Commission after the paralysis of negotiation process with Andean Community (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Perù), the stoppage with ACP countries and the “looseness” with Mercosur (Argentina, Brasil, Paraguay and Uruguay). As for other region, the UE–CA agreement includes only a free-trade area terms of making without any control on civil society (UE does not put pressure on Central America State to conform their politics with the international conventions on human rights) and without any hint to indigenous rights, workers rights and environmental conservation. With Dominican Republic, Central America had signed a free trade agreement in April 1998, with different effective dates, and also various lists of products for access to markets, and different periods of remission rates. The implementation of the treaty is bilateral. Panama has signed an FTA with Central America, but it is only in force for El Salvador and Costa Rica. To conclude, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua have resumed recently negotiations provided on a bilateral basis. Since 1999, Central America and the Republic of Chile signed an FTA agreement, although actually it is only valid for Costa Rica and El Salvador. Then, the Region has carried out negotiations with Canada, but only Costa Rica has signed it. Some of the countries in the region have trade negotiations with the Chinese province of Taiwan, and some are in the process of a negotiation with Colombia. In all, the negotiations and the implementation of treaties are bilateral and none of them is valid for all countries in the region. According to that, also in these cases misalignments occur especially in intraregional commitments, at least in the case of tariff regulation. However, unlike the previous phase, the integration agenda of Central America today includes, in addition to trade issues, others directly related to policy, law, social aims and environmental protection. Its goals are more ambitious and formally around them there have been numerous government commitments, which involve a number of actions, institutional reform and construction, also calling, explicitly and implicitly, to the participation of a larger number of actors and stakeholders. The most important advances in integration have been achieved by the setting valid legal instruments and other measures to strengthen intra-regional trade, particularly through the establishment of a mechanism for dispute resolution, elimination of trade barriers (that has been regionalized), the modernization and simplification of customs services and the cut in the number of products excluded from the list of free movement in the region. These measures will contribute intraregional trade flows to exceed 4,000 million US dollars in 2006. This has improved intraregional investments, mainly in the sectors of financial services, hotels and restaurants, shops departmental stores and marketers of shopping mall consumers, airlines, food and beverage sector, among others.",1
16,3,Transition Studies Review,23 August 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-009-0100-3,Italy and ‘Balkan Greece’: Albanian Immigration in the 90s,October 2009,Giuliana Urso,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The current wave of immigrants coming from northern Africa towards southern Europe has been compared with the experience of Albanians migrating to Italy during the 90s. Although the pressure on the Apulian coast was much higher—in the 1999 it has reached 46.481 units, while the island of Lampedusa received 30.657 units in 2008–, the current flow recalls the same imagine of boat people trying to reach the Italian territory. In addition, the flow was mixed in both situations, that is to say it was composed both of irregulars migrants and potential asylum seekers. An in-depth analysis of the way Italy and Greece have reacted to the Albanian migration can be a useful instrument for a better understanding of the past and present position of Italy. The Albanian migration flow, counting around 800.000 emigrants out of a population of 3 million inhabitants, was one of the biggest in East Europe after the collapse of communism such to be considered ‘a kind of lab in which one can study all new migration processes’ King (2003). It was mainly directed to the neighbouring countries, Greece and Italy. Even if they showed some similar features—such as being unprepared or using a lot the regularization tool as well having a public opinion against the phenomenon—the two states had different responses to that migration: more European the Italian one, more Balkan the Greek one. Albanian migration was perceived by Greece as a temporary phenomenon and mainly a problem to solve, leading to a severe and strict approach. At the beginning of 1991 the government stated “Greece is not a country of immigration”, but even later, new laws were formulated as if immigration would last only a few days or a few months. Moreover the first concern for the Greek government was to keep the immigrants out and in this way it unintentionally opened the door to illegal immigrants. The lack of a real immigration policy—used to be the same as border policy according to Baldwin-Edwards—and the construction of an ‘illegal policy’ are hardly connected to a lack of preparation, but rather it could be considered as a real choice. In this way, from time to time, politics has been used instead of law. Reasons are to been found in economic, structural, historical and strict political fields. The immigration issue has been used as a diplomatic way to relate with Albania, for example with regard to mass deportations (in 1991 and 1992) that can be interpreted as a response of some action by the Albanian government. Difficult historical relations between the two states, the presence of big communities within the other State, the claim on the ‘North Epirus’ region can also be part of this policy of ‘exclusion and expulsion’. Especially with regard to the fear of a stable recognition of an Albanian community in the territory, the Greek response appears as a long term policy, planned to protect territorial integrity, ethnic homogeneity and national market. One key concept of the interview is the anti-Albanian feeling, the albanophobia, connected to the Greek unconscious fear that the own identity was under threat. The extensive Albanian migration was not only a matter of management, but to some extend, it has been perceived as a concern for ethnicity, for several historical reasons. The immigration procedures were focused on the holy principle of border’s inviolability that tolerated abuses on basic human rights by Greek border guards. Compared with the Italian way to cope with the Albanian migration, ‘Greece was much slower to respond to the rights of certain migrants, it was much slower to legalize, and it was also much slower to recognize the economic roles of migrants’. A behaviour more similar to the Balkan/Arab than to the European approach. Greece did not have a real, proper immigration policy, it wanted to keep the immigrants out and in this way it decided to open the door to illegal immigrants. Why did Greece prefer to have an “illegal policy” instead of a legal one? I think if you go back beyond the opening of the Albanian borders you see a particular pattern: you see in the 1970s and in the 1980s that the immigration procedures—I hesitate to say ‘policy’—were rather arbitrary. There is a 1929 immigration law which forms the legal basis for decisions, but, for example, there was a record of immigrants’ labour even in as far back as in 1970s of north-Africans, but no record in fact of what the Greek state did, just some general perceptions that there were recruited migrants who were working in depleted economic sectors. What we see in the 1980s is more and more occasional economic migrants, but especially asylum seekers from the communist block: quite a lot of Poles and Iraqi in the late 1980s, who came to Greece and were tolerated, some of them just stayed here, some of them tried to be relocated to Canada or America. But Greece always saw itself as a country which did not have immigrants. This self-perception is important, because they saw Greece—and to some extent still see Greece—as a country for Greeks, defined in this ethnic, rather than legal, sense. And the assumption was “these people come here to work, but 1 day they will go away again”. When the Albanian borders opened and Albanians came over in relatively large numbers, over a relatively short period of time, it was a new phenomenon, for several reasons. First of all, it was visible, while the earlier migrations had been more or less invisible; secondly they were not recruited or encouraged by Greece itself, they were seen as invaders. And then it opened up a new ethnic border, which was an old ethnic border between Albanians and Greeks, on this Greece-Albania border. Because previously the border was just sealed as were the other borders of northern Greece. It’s not something we are thinking about: if you draw an analogy with what happened with Macedonia, Greeks never complained and never thought of making a fuss that Tito named his Republic of Yugoslavia “Republic of Macedonia”, they saw it as something completely separate, they could just ignore it, and I think the same is Albania. When Albania became a main issue, it created a problem, it plunged Greece back into the pre-world war II period, and I think that explains a lot of how they have dealt with things. So they did not think about an initial immigration policy, they thought immediately “we must close the borders”, and that is exactly what 1991 law did, it tried to close the border, it did not try to create the way for Albanians—or anyone else, for that matter—to migrate legally to Greece. And this continues to be a big issue with Greek policy: they have a border policy, they do not have an immigration policy, they consider an immigration policy to be synonymous with a border policy. Slowly they are waking up to this, mainly through the existence of second generation immigrants, who have nothing to do with the borders. It is slowly changing, but from the period you are looking, up until the year 2,000, there was clearly no conception of an immigration policy. Can then the non-policy of Greece be considered as conscious response? I think I will answer that question by saying that in Greece politics has a primacy over everything. The role of the economy does not normally determine public policy and it is not a typical European position of course, and I think what you saw when the Albanians became an issue in the 1990s is that it was clear that they were providing some functional use in the economy, I think it became a big claim to the relationship between Greece and Turkey before the exchange of population, in this idea the State, the government of the time, the citizens as not the citizens, they are there as subjects, they are there as things to be discussed, they are not people’s right to run the country, in a way it is a denial of the concept of democracy. And I think you can see this also in the Arabic countries which have enormous amounts of immigration, and they view the immigrants as workers, they have not any rights. Again, it is a matter of State, of negotiating with another State, and the ordinary people do not matter. So I think in the Arabic countries there is the primacy of politics, and Greece has always done this, it does not matter where the politics come from, but there is always a primacy of politics over functional needs. They passed a law, in the 2001, which tries to give the impression, to the rest of Europe, that they have an immigration policy, but they have never implemented any of this, it is just a fictional idea. I speak about this in one article on employment immigration in Greece, the debate leading up to the 1997 legalization, and one of my colleagues collected opinions from State-actors and non-State-actors and analyzed them, and we used this collection for writing an article, and what became very clear is that the border regions were not only hostile to the presence of illegal immigrants from Albania, they were hostile to the idea of legalization of immigrants and they were hostile to any immigrants at all, they preferred not to have any change in traditional Greekness, should we call it. The ministry of Agriculture was very much in support of the legalization, but the minister of Interior, at that time, who came from one of the border regions with Albania, absolutely opposed that Albanians should be allowed to legalize, and he proposed an amendment that Albanians should not be allowed to legalize. This was then extended, because it seemed bad to leave out the Albanians, but all Balkan countries should not be allowed to legalize and at this point it became a ridiculous debate, and the Prime Minister said “we’re going to legalize everyone”. I think what it is clear in this debate is the sense of what a threat Albanians were to Greeks, and not the Bulgarians, who were simply included in the legalization program. But there are a large number of Greeks who absolutely opposed to any Albanian immigration to Greece. We are talking about people who lived in the shadow of exchanged population, and they thought integration of all minorities becoming Greek, becoming orthodox, etc. It is difficult to describe and I do not think there is anything comparable to this, I do not think you can find even a vague analogy. It is this particularly unique, it’s a Balkan country, basically. As far as who the immigrants are, we really do not know, I do not know how many of the Albanians in Greece came from outside the southern regions of Albania, I have no information on this, and of course it is quite important, because Albania is not a homogeneous country. But it is conceivable that the majority of Albanians in Greece are from the South of Albania and the majority of Albanians in Italy are from the North. But there may be some mix. Are there any other reasons to explain this non-policy? Is it only because Greece was unprepared to deal with such a wave of immigrants or are there also economical, political, strategic reasons? I think Greece had in common with Italy, Spain and Portugal, the “unpreparedness” as an issue, I do not argue otherwise, but I think the really important issue for Greece is this historical one, that this border was inviolable, it just was not a border really, it is not a normal border, and they did not know how to cope with this, and they had to create a functioning border, because the only real border that Greece has is with Turkey, and this is historically a disastrous border, so they had no experience of borders. If you look at every other European country which is not an island, you will see that they have experience of managing borders, how to get on with neighbours etc. So Greece has no experience of dealing with its neighbours in a civilized manner, their only knowledge of it was what happened in the period after the Balkan war in 1913 until the II world war, basically. This was a very difficult period, Greece was struggling to homogenize its ethnic population, to get rid of Muslims, to get rid of non-Greeks, to convince people that they were all Greeks etc. So it is an unpleasant memory of a bad part of the history of Greece. And the Albanians were blamed explicitly for this. Do you think the typology of Albanian immigrants in the ‘90s was the same in Italy and Greece? In the specific border region of Albania and Greece, there are a lot of Vlach, a certain number of Chams and quite a few other ethnicities which we don’t even know about, plus Albanians, plus Greeks and maybe all of the people who now call themselves Albanian or Greek, perhaps it’s quite a mix through all things. The Vlach, who in Greece have been assimilated or integrated very successfully into the Greek system, have relatives across the border in southern Albania, and the Vlach in southern Albania found it very interesting to claim that they were Greek. There is also some evidence that the Vlach always spoke some Greek, not particularly well, but they knew some Greek to communicate. Many other people who have come from Albania to Greece and claimed to be Greek, are really Vlach who want to be Greek, because it is a better status to have as an immigrant. And the question is interesting because if their identical relatives in northern Greece managed to become Greek after 1920, why should they not? But of course, this is not the official policy, the official policy is that there is such a thing as a Greek and the rest of them are non-Greeks, and in this way even the ethnic Greeks coming to Greece opened up the old difficult debate on ethnicity. And even what you might see as an “easy” immigration, of people of the same culture, ethnicity and religion, is actually much more complex, and this is partly for these reasons. The first is that they found it difficult to define “Greek” and they are trying now—I think—to say that you have to be registered as a Greek in Albania. I think some of this is the subject of some negotiation as well. The other reason, for not admitting, it was that they wanted the Greeks in Albania to remain there, for political reasons, for historical reasons, so they had more influence over Albania, they say “have some control over a part of the population”. And some people (a minority, I am sure) hold this idea of “Northern Epyrus”, that the Greek territory should be extended to cover part of Albania. I think this is because if you go back to the negotiations for the Treaty of Paris, the Greeks of northern Epyrus demanded to be released from Albania and allowed to join Greece, but they did not succeed in these negotiations. So there is a long history of this and I guess it just makes it very difficult: Albanians coming to Greece cause problems for Greek identity. Much more seriously than Bulgarian too, and even more seriously than Turks. Do you think that the way Italy and Greece were dealing with immigration is the same? No, and it is for this historical reason. Italy—whatever criticism we may make of its immigration policy—has largely responded as a European country, Greece has responded as a Balkan country, and there is a big difference. I do not think Italians feel threatened by the Albanian ethnicity, they might feel threatened in the same way as the British could be threatened by Albanians or other immigrants, but they do not feel threatened at the national identity level. The Greeks feel threatened in their own identity which is a much more serious feeling. And I think the other problem for the Greeks is –it is not a very polite thing to say–I do not think they are very conscious of their own history, so this sense of being under threat, was really mostly unconscious and they did not know how to express it, all they knew was that Albanians were bad people and they did not know why really, so they had to invent reasons why: “they steal”, “they smell”, whatever, and they were inventions, because when you actually interview Greeks about their personal experiences individually with Albanians they will tell you “yes, the Albanians I met were decent people of course, but they’re not typical: the real Albanians are disgusting people. The ones I have been lucky enough to be acquainted with are decent people”. So they make a big distinction between the general perception of the Albanians as a race or nationality, and the Albanians they met. And I think this is because there is a fiction created partly through the media, a very bad anti-Albanian feeling, the albanophobia, should we call it, and partly because of this Greek unconscious fear that their own identity was under threat. It is a sort of fear which is analogous to the fear of a burglar entering your home. I do not think this is the same thing as the Italians felt and I do not think it is the same thing as any other European country feels about illegal migration. People feel things about illegal migration, but it is a different feeling in the Greeks, it is a feeling about “they might be stealing our job”, “they might be causing problems to the welfare system”, “they might be committing crimes” etc., but the Greek unconscious fear was much deeper that this, it was almost a psychological issue, and of course they found justifications for it: the Albanians were stealing, so you asked them “but what are they stealing? Do they steal money from people’s bank accounts, for example? Do they steal valuable possessions from people’s houses?”. No, they steal food, they steal minor articles, just to survive. The people admitted that it was a matter of survival and they would admit, if you went on for long enough, that they would have done exactly the same thing. Why is this fear only of Albanians and not also of other immigrants? Just because of historical reasons or also because Albanians represent more than half of the immigrants in Greece? Well- speaking from a social science perspective - we certainly know that every country demonizes one major moving group, which is usually the most numerous and becomes emblematic of “bad immigrants”. In Greece they didn’t have to choose which immigrants, it was automatically Albanians, for several reasons. First of all, because the Albanians were the first to cross the borders illegally; secondly they came across in very large numbers; and thirdly they were demonized in the press, with allegations that they were real criminals, hard criminals being released from prisons. I looked for evidence of this, and I could find nothing. One thing which is not irrelevant is that, although the Albanians are not particularly interested in religion, nominally the majority of them are Moslems, and this makes a big contrast with the other two big immigrant groups in Greece which is Bulgarians and Romanians, both orthodox. It is not the major point, but it is an additional problem: “the Albanians are bad for several reasons, and by the way, they’re all Muslims”. You have said that the policy of Greece is a policy of exclusion and expulsion. Do you think today it is still the same? I think after so many years the Greek people have understood that Albanians are performing rather crucial roles in the economy. There are some questions about whether Greeks would like to do these jobs. Currently the debate is still at the low level. I think there is a recognition that the Albanians are crucial to the Greek economy and there is some recognition—the public opinion is divided—about Albanians’ possibility to integrate into the society. I think it is still a minority view that the Albanians can successfully integrate: I think there is a lot of prejudice at a social level. But the perspective is now that immigrants are essential, and therefore they have to remain in Greece. So this is a different policy from the one of the 1990s, but there are still problems, as you know, and the biggest problem is this: as I mentioned before, Greeks have a borders policy, but no immigration policy. So even though the immigrants are here they are no part of a coherent immigration policy, they are here because they are here. And the legalization is just the way to stabilize the situation. But on the other hand, Greeks do not want to give permit status to the Albanians. The political response is confused, the earlier political response, which was clearly there in the 1990s was to keep anyone out, then it became a matter of accepting the economic role of the immigrants, but as you know, the mass deportations of Albanians persisted throughout the 1990s, these were abolished only in 2001. The immediate expulsion by the Greek police, without legal permits, does not have any support from the Greek constitution and any international norms. And they have been using these things, they called them, in translation into English, “re-directions”. And of course this policy, which is a ready policy mechanism from 1991, is that you can, say, within a few kilometres off the borders, you can just throw people back into Albania. But, in fact, they were doing this from Athens, they were picking up thousands of Albanians in the centre of Athens and taking them back to Albania, without any legal process. We have talked about actors, who are the actors in the political scene in Greece? Someone claims that in Greece there is a cartel party system, so the real actors are the parties and there is no room left for public opinion or even for economy. Do you agree? We could talk about where the public policy comes from, I would go so far as to say that the real actors are the bureaucrats, because when we look at the formulation of immigration laws we find that the lawyers and the bureaucracy and the ministries were the people who were drafting almost all the original legislation. I suppose that the bureaucrats represented traditional Greece, they are the conservatives, and it takes some direct influence from the politicians and government over the parties to modernize, so there is a real conservatism in the policy-making, and the conservatism has peculiar effects. One of the conservative ideas, that the Greek bureaucrats seem to have, is the fact that they have translated all the laws from Italy and Spain into Greek in order to decide how to improve the Greek law, and what has been noticed, I looked to some surprise, is they are really genuinely proud that they have translated so much law into Greek. They believe that policy is the same as law, they believe that the written law is the policy, whereas from a northern European and an American perspective a policy is a sort of objective and the law is one aspect of trying to pursue these objectives. The implementation of law is deeply important, and the reception of the law by the public is deeply important, the funding of the boarding guard, the funding of the immigration department, all of these are equally important in policy. Don’t you think there is still, as at the beginning of 1991, the idea of immigration as a temporary phenomenon? Yes, I think you are right and, you know, the most important immigration to Greece ever was the exchange of population, but most Greeks do not know is that after the exchange of population was effected, the Prime Minister of the time, in the late 1920s - around 1927-negotiated with Turkey to try and send ethnic Greeks all back to Turkey. Now, let me say if you can do this to people of your own ethnicity then you can clearly treat the immigrants likewise, so I found it incredible of Venizelos to try to negotiate the return of the ethnic Greeks to Turkey after 1927 and it is remarkable. So I think there is never been any conception of an immigration policy, and it is still under development, I would say. Greece has been forced, especially by becoming a member of the European Union, to guarantee certain superficial human rights, but you will see from the report, especially the one on border problems, that the Greek border guards actually abused human rights. When you discuss this with Greek people, Albanians being shot and killed for crossing the border (and they were shot and killed simply because they passed the border, in the same way as the communist block killed people for trying to leave the communist block), I said to Greek people that I am shocked by this and I asked them what they think, and quite a large proportion—maybe as much as 50%—said “oh yes, of course, we must protect our borders”. To which my response was “yes, you have the right, and that is why you should protect your borders, but that does not mean you kill people when they try to cross it. They have rights, even as illegal immigrants”. And the Greeks come out very commonly, even the ones who do not approve shooting people, saying “no, illegal immigrants don’t have any rights”. They are very clear about this: “it’s our country, we have the right to shoot people if they cross the border into our country”. Can you see this nationalism, this identity issue coming up? Should such violations of human rights be carried out against people trying to cross the border to Britain, potentially the government would have to resign. It is such a serious breach of human rights, and such an insult to the perception of our country in international terms. But the Greeks do not feel this way, “people cross our borders, why shouldn’t we shoot them…”. It is strange, because the Greeks are not violent, as a nation they are much less violent than Italians. So, there is not protection for illegal immigrants in the law… The thing which is interesting is that one of the popular arguments made, about why illegal immigrants in Greece are not welcome and they should not be given rights, even if they are performing useful economic functions is “we didn’t invite them”, and they make a big contrast between ‘gastarbeiter’ to Germany and the Albanians in the Greek economy. And the reason I mentioned this is because maybe this is part of the problem: they do not want an immigration policy because if they have invited someone then they have to admit that they have responsibility for these people, whereas when they cross the border illegally Greeks have no responsibility for them. So again this is very Balkan, very Arabic even, it is a negotiation, a typical negotiation. It is not about managing economy, managing the country, it is about taking advantage of people and putting them in the weakest position, so the Albanians are in the weak position to having to cross the border illegally. So they don’t have any social or political rights, because if they are illegal they are at the borders of society and for the government they are not in the society. But at the same time Greece can benefit from their work… Exactly. I think that especially political rights is the issue. Social rights, it depends on what you mean. I think there is some basic social rights which are not particularly problematic for the Greeks, but one aspect which is not accepted still, I think, is that the Albanians should be a normal part of Greek society, that they should eat in the same taverns, the Greeks are sure that the Albanians are a lower social cast, or class, and they should not be treated in the same way as they. They say publicly that they are racist, I have spoken with more than one Greek, and they say “I can say this without any problem: I don’t want any Albanians here”, but just with Albanians, it is not a problem with all the other immigrants… Well, they do it with the Bulgarians as well in some way, but the Greeks consider themselves to be superior to the Bulgarians. The Greeks for hundreds of years considered themselves superior to the other Balkan ethnicities, and the reason is the language of the culture. Can it be also a security matter? Greece has always supported the nationalistic feeling and the idea of having a homogenous population as an instrument of defence from enemies at the border. I think you are right about this thing of the borders. And it is one of the strange things, because if the border is important then you might assume that the border should be secure, and if you want the immigrants to come and work then you should allow them to cross the border, that you control the border, that you can say “ok, you can have a visa to come and work”, but they have not done it. I think one of the reasons they have not done it is partly they could not do it, in the sense that the corruption of the Greek Embassy in Albania has been so extensive, with the selling of fake and semi-fake visas, that the whole thing is such a Balkan mess, caused by the Greeks, not by the Albanians. That the idea of organizing and having a border that people can cross, you want to know who is the border of your country, you want to control it, that is what every country does. But they do the opposite, they do not control it. They make a fuss about their border, then they do not actually have any real control. The same happens at the borders with Bulgaria, the Greeks make a big fuss about controlling it, but in the end they do not actually control it, it is completely arbitrary. This shows you, the Balkan nature of Greek society. It has nothing to do with laws, even nothing to do with money, it is entirely politics. Do you think the EU can play a role in the immigration policy of Greece? (Some years ago) I gave a lecture on “the application of the anti-discrimination law in southern Europe, structural issues”. Afterwards I went to a meal with the European Commission officials, and I asked them “how long do you think before these laws will really be effective in Greece? Do you see this can be done? What is the Commission’s opinion?”, an informal answer I got was “well, we consider Greece to be a disaster and our hope is that in about a 20 years’ time Greece might get some of the ideas of European countries”. They are very sceptical, because they recognize that Greece is just not functioning like a normal European country. Do you think it’s the same as in Italy? No, they know very well what is happening in Italy. And I think that Italy and Spain are making some progress, Spain more than Italy at this time, but Spain is doing a very corrective policy. Italy was, a few years ago, trying to be very aggressive with the Libyan roots of illegal migration, and was struggling with basically structural problems related to the nature of Libya, and the failure of the EU to conclude anything at all with Libya. And Italy was able to use, of course, its own historical link with Libya to do something. But not entirely satisfactorily, I have to say. But I think generally the immigration policy of Italy and Spain has been deficient, in the same way that they were not active enough in recruiting legal migration, and they have used regularisation as a policy instrument. There are various reasons for this, but I think it has very different character to the Greek one, and you can see it, I mean, Italy has not deported hundred of thousands of people without legal permits. It is absolutely unthinkable for the other European countries, to throw hundreds of people out of your country without any cause, I find it incredible. I do not know why the Greeks thought it was ok, I really do not understand it, but I think it indicates a different development of law, even, than that you find in Italy or Spain. What do you think Greece did less than Italy? Greece was much slower to respond to the rights of certain migrants, it was much slower to legalize, and it was also much slower to recognize the economic roles of migrants. And even now, Italy was one of the first European countries to really allow extensive family reunification. Italy looked more as a typical European country even though immigration was not such an old phenomenon for Italy. Greece has very small proportions of family reunification and basically did not allow it until the 2001 law, then quite a few were handed out over this period, from 2002 to 2004 roughly, and as soon I realized they clamp down on family reunification really aggressively, now they are asking about the minimum wage, proof of physical housing. They basically ask the immigrants to be in a much better situation than, say, the bottom 20% of the Greek population, and I find it rather racist, I do not find it acceptable. …and there is also some problem about the time that needs to pass before asking for this kind of permit. Yes, it is true, there are many problems. I reported this to the Council of Europe, and I think that they saw that large numbers of Albanians, up to 2002, and again, this fear of the Albanians taking over Greece re-emerged, this time when Albania has a new democracy. And they just withdrew the family reunification provision which was relatively normal by European standards. And Greece falls between these two things: if you want legalization of migrants, then do what the Arabic countries are doing: have single men or single women and give them fix term contracts to control that they do not have rights; if you think “we want people to settle, become Greeks” –because the Albanians seem to be going this direction: changing religion, taking Greek names etc.– so if you want that, then the family reunification and integration of family units into Greek society would be logical. But the Greeks do not do either of these things, they do some mixed combination, which is they do not like single men, but they do not like families either, they say that they want people to fix into the Greek society but they do not find any mechanism to do this. It is very confused and most policies seem to be contradicting each other, and I suppose the reason is they do not really know what they want. And I do not find that unusual in Greece, I do not think Greek ever know what they really want. Finally, do you think the EU can do something more to change this situation? I do not know, I made some petitions to the European Parliament, against the Greek immigration policy, for their illegal advertisements for employment, which according to several points of the law I claim are illegal, including discrimination grounds of handicapped, discrimination grounds for ethnicity, all sort of things. But I do not think anything will happen, I do not think the contracts will be cancelled, and basically I think Greeks will carry out this issue alone. They see Europe as a cash cow, it is a source of money, they do not see it as a source of enlightened governance of the society. So I am not optimistic on the point. Maybe some marginal changes, but on the whole I think there is a real issue of law, the meaning of law, implementation of law.",

Within this mantra of research intercultural management has been a favourite sub-topic. Why do management methods differ across cultures and how can we bridge differences to achieve holistic, perhaps even optimal, cross-cultural management? The contributions within this field are not modest. Numerous researchers have supplied valuable insight, most notably culture authorities such as Hofstede, Hall, Inglehart and Kluckhohn & Strodtbeck (for these authors most popular culture related contributions in their most recent editions, see Hofstede 2001; Hall 1990; Inglehart 1997; Kluckhohn and Strodtbeck 1961). These heavyweight contributions tackled broad cultural dimensions and, in many ways, set the pace and tone with which subsequent culture research agendas had to keep up with, however, they were not without criticism. In their wake lay countless arguments questioning validity, credibility and overall reliability of the results. Hofstede, perhaps having achieved the highest recognition for his culture research, has also borne the brunt of most of the criticism (see McSweeney 2002 for a thorough discrediting of Hofstede’s results). Accordingly, more recent research agendas have narrowed the scope to focus on more clearly defined cultural dimensions in the hopes to increase the validity of the emerging results. Within this field, significant progress has been made. Trompenaars and Woolliams contribute to the discourse by renaming and further developing most of Hofstede’s dimensions (e.g. Trompenaars and Woolliams 2003) Throsby (2001) revamps earlier developed value theories in order to unite the twin notions of economic and cultural ideals and Gulev proposes new theories on economic culture that address undernourished cultural dimensions such as trust and authority delegations that have veiled impacts on management behaviour (e.g. Gulev 2006, 2007a). However, even with the microscope zoomed in on specific cultural dimensions that limit, to some degree, the vulnerability of the results, the findings still leave much up to individual circumstances and impressions. This is a shortcoming that all qualitative social science studies will suffer from. By nature, the emerging results within cultural research are not neatly quantifiable and are subject to rigorous criticism from opponents who have justifiable counter arguments based on their own individual experiences. Accordingly, the richness of the field is its greatest advantage and simultaneously its greatest deficiency. It is with this outset in mind that the current contribution begins. Sometimes all we can do is ask ‘what are people’s impressions about management in their country of origin’ and leave the data in that form for the readers to process themselves. It is at this level the current article seeks to contribute to the management-culture discourse. The following is an account of individual impressions of management methods in a specific selection of countries mainly throughout Europe and it is based on indigenous impressions of people who have lived and worked within management in those countries.",

The risk of opportunistic behaviors is particularly elevated in relation to those types of financial products for which, besides the problem of the asymmetric distribution of the information, there is a lack of liquid and transparent exchange markets. It should be noted, moreover, that the general duty of the intermediary, sanctioned from European legislation, to behave fairly, honestly and in the best interest of the customer, does not turn out of simple declination. It claims, in particular, for the definition of interpretative guidelines on the conduct rules to be complied with by intermediaries in order to harmonize their behavior. As is known, within the European legislative framework such a function is remitted to the so-called level 3 measures. With reference to illiquid financial products, the Italian supervisory authority has taken part recently with the definition of precise rules of conduct that would have to guide the intermediary in its distributive policies, leaving, however, some open problems. This paper is organized as follows. In “The Investment in Illiquid Financial Products: Risks and Costs of Trading” we will examine the aspects of greater criticality related to the investment in illiquid products, in terms of costs and requirements of investor protection. In “Investor Protection and Competitiveness of the Financial Industry: a Difficult Equilibrium” we will discuss the main aspects concerning the level 3 measures adopted by Consob. In “The Open Problems” will be proceeded to a recognition of the main problems still opened. ""Conclusions"" concludes.",

The privatization of former government-owned establishments resulted in a period of turbulence in the labour market, affecting both the demand and supply of labour. While many unprofitable establishments closed down, newly privatized industries required skills that were scarce in the Albanian labour market. At the same time, an underdeveloped financial sector and infrastructure left little chance for success and even contributed to the economic failure of many new enterprises. Further, population movements both abroad (to as many as twenty different countries) and within the country (from rural areas to major cities) changed the composition of the local labour force and placed additional strain on both the domestic and foreign labour markets.Footnote 1 Finally, the transition period was prolonged by the civil unrest of 1997 that followed the collapse of many pyramid schemes that had emerged in the country.Footnote 2 While privatization and population mobility have been analyzed in the literature alongside other transition phenomena, the labour market dynamics in Albania have so far escaped academic scrutiny. The main reason for this vacuum in the literature is the limited availability of micro-data on the Albanian labour market. In addition, transition resulted in substantial growth of the informal sector in Albania, making it hard to document and quantify the developments in the local labour market.Footnote 3 Analyzing unemployment in Albania is important from a policy perspective, since a better understanding of the current problems in this area can guide the choice of employment policies and shape future labour market institutions and legislation. In a country with official unemployment rates that have fluctuated between 12 and 18% during the past decade, such policies are imperative. In addition, assessing the effect of job training in replacing outdated skills and boosting employment is relevant to other reforms, such as recent efforts to advance vocational education and apprenticeship programs in the country. From an international perspective, employment stabilization policies in Albania are important, since labour-market crises in the country have, in the past, spilled over into the neighbouring countries. Finally, evidence on the Albanian labour market would add to a growing body of literature on the effects of transition policies in Eastern-European countries. In this context, it should be noted that Albania is somewhat unique in its experience of transition. First, Albania entered transition as the poorest Eastern European country. At the same time, reforms were instituted faster than in most other countries in the region. Finally, Albania experienced extensive population mobility, both abroad and within. Therefore, designing policies to aid the labour market in Albania, in addition to the experience obtained from other transition economies, also requires detailed information on the specific and unique conditions present in this country. Employment initiatives were introduced for the first time in the Albanian labour market in 1999. The most significant development consisted of a number of “labour offices” established in major cities to facilitate job searching for job-seekers via employment counselling and contacts with potential employers. In addition, labour offices created opportunities for on-the-job training, and provided short-term vocational training to people with obsolete skills. While the decision to use these services remains voluntary, unemployment benefits and other economic aid are channelled through these offices and thus, provide an incentive for job-seekers to register and update their status regularly.Footnote 4
 This study summarizes and synthesizes the unemployment situation in Albania during the period of 2000–2004. Using a variety of data sources, including administrative micro-data from the newly established labour offices, this study profiles the Albanian job-seekers. The analysis finds that older, less-educated, and less mobile workers are more likely to be unemployed. These findings call for pro-active age-discrimination policies, and education reform.",
16,4,Transition Studies Review,18 December 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-009-0120-z,Governance of Tech Transfer: Recent Experiences in Some Developed Regions of Europe,February 2010,Graziano Pini,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Research, innovation and technology transfer (TT) are key words in all branches of developed economies. The UK innovation clusters, French pôles de compétitivité, and the excellent Italian industrial districts demonstrate the importance of private and public bodies joining forces to create and support technology platforms that merge science and industry (Cooke et al. 2004). However, public policy based on incentives and subsidies, in the past has proved ineffective, if not distorting (David et al. 2000; Jaumotte and Pain 2005), and the paradigm has shifted towards direct horizontal intervention. Financial support models have also changed, and funding tends now to be awarded according to the merits of individual projects; co-funding with banks imposes self-financing quotas and incentive packages have replaced non-repayable loans. The features of the modern knowledge economy pervade the interactions among institutions and hence the behaviour of firms and research institutes, which is introducing new factors, such as increasingly fragmented and dispersed information, increased numbers and rates of turnover of contacts, and different types of partners who are not well known and are remote. This means that firms are having to deal with an increasing number and complexity of relationships,Footnote 1 both vertical and horizontal, which is leading to higher demand for codified knowledge to enable it to be appropriated, recognizable, reproducible, reliable, transferable and affordable (reduction in its marginal cost). In relationships between partners this has led to quests for a common language and opportunities for sharing, such as the one that occur when a standard that enables the portability of data is agreed on. The more farsighted policymakers are focusing on the exchanges that occur between research (laboratories or workshops) and industry (factories), which are rendered more efficient by the imposition of governance structures that achieve synergies at the local level. Acting on only one of these factors in isolation is inadequate and produces results that are often ineffective. If one of the lead players is missing, or their contribution is weakened by the relationship between partners and external factors being distorted, this affects both the research system and the performance of the whole through-put chain. Policy intervention in the field of research and technology transfer (RTT) can only be effective when the economic performance within an industrial system implements structural change to make its implementation beneficial (Cohen and Levinthal 1989). This structural change must take account of factors such as firm size, nature of the industry sector (and hence sector diversification at local level) and the policies related to competition. For example, upsizing a firm in the European context occurs only as a response to external factors: it is achieved on the basis of networks, relations and membership of groups. Effective governance also depends on the concerted actions of various institutions, central and local, national and international, to achieve efficiency in the system of delegating and integrating policy implementation (Carlsson et al. 2002). Also involved are local-context factors (Porter 1998), which are instrumental in promoting the growth (in quality and quantity) of human resources capable of fostering innovation within the system as a whole (Florida 1999), and generating the creativity and social vitality that is the lifeblood of local industry. Regional and local policy on research, innovation and technology transfer is not divorced from other forms of policy, e.g. training and education and the creation of social capital; welfare and the environment; culture; tourism and promotion, etc. We want to study the intensity of use and validity of tools and policies activated for TT and implemented in different European territories. They fall into three broad categories: resources (human, organizational and financial), information (collection, dissemination and coordination) and institutional processes (formal rules). These include the new institutions that have been established to complement the work of the research community, universities and other public research institutions and business, and are designed to increase their synergies and the innovative capacity of individual actors or integrated players. Such institutions are referred to as “knowledge hubs” (Youtie and Shapira 2008) which act to produce and accumulate knowledge, and improve the exchange of knowledge, learning and innovation. The countries and territories that have found the best solutions to the problem of TT are showing the best performance and the greatest ability to tackle their problems.",

By consequence, defining and studying the phenomenon go through the most different thinking filters known in the specialist literature: economic, social-cultural, political, administrative and religious. In the economical view, Shleifer and Vishny (1993) see corruption as a problem related to the monopolistic market structure, not a competitive one, and recommend that policies should focus more closely on the phenomenon of corruption and not on the public sector itself. In a particular way, Al-Marhubi (2000) finds a significant relationship between inflation and corruption, which suggests that a high rate of inflation came with high corruption. For Wang and Rosenau (2001), corruption is the secret collaboration between public officials and private actors for private financial gains in contravention of public interest. Drehel and Schneider (2006) connect the shadow economy with corruption, as an inverse or direct relationship, depending on the degree of the state development. Based on a model of general trade policy and fiscal economic equilibrium, Carraro et al. (2006) shows that corruption affects economic growth with different intensities from one period to another (many studies refute this results). Moreover, connecting with economic growth, a couple of authors identify and analyze the inverse relationship between corruption and the level of social welfare. From this group we regard Svensson (2005). In the social-cultural sense, Nye (1967) considers corruption as a deviation from the formal duties of a public role, in individual compartmental approach: personal, close family and private clique. The definition summarizes a group of elements, such as bribery, theft, nepotism and misappropriation. Hungtington (1968) identifies different degrees of corruption, from one culture to another, with higher intensity in the modernization periods, corruption being a social pathology, according to Carvajal (1999). Husted (1999) describes a cultural profile of a corrupt country as one in which there is high uncertainty avoidance, high masculinity, and high power distance (without individualism, which is highly correlated with GNP per capita). Getz and Volkema (2001) revealed that uncertainty avoidance moderated the relationship between economic adversity and corruption, whereas power distance and uncertainty avoidance were positively associated with corruption. Nichols et al. (2004), based on a study that includes two states on different continents, argues that the corruption perception seeks the recent history of a population, determined by foreign domination, democratic change and transition periods. Barr and Serra (2006) see the corruption as a phenomenon set of preferences and rules, following the slogan “not engaging in bribery because it is harmful to society”. They conclude, concise, that the corruption is, in part, a cultural phenomenon. In the political-administrative approach, Hungtington (1968) reveals that the phenomenon of corruption is an effective absence of the political institutions and Rose-Ackerman (1978) shows that the decentralization of government decision-making power increases the risk of corruption, because the review and detection limits are confirmed. Tanzi (1998) accepts the definition of the World Bank, in which corruption is the simplest kind of public power abuse for private benefits, gifts, mainly related to the state monopoly and the way the government perceives the power. Simply, in a similar way, Rajib and Subarna (2000) develop a general definition of corruption, as an abuse of public power for private benefit. Referring to the quality of bureaucratic apparatus, Drehel and Schneider (2006) show that the better quality of the public institutions reduces corruption. In the religious perspective, a previous research has found that religion influences the tendency of the corruption phenomena. According to Devettere (2002), the high attention to virtue ethics is the most effective way to combat corruption. Moreover, religions, such as Christianity, may limit the effects of this global problem. Particularly, Paldham (2001) founds that the percentage of Protestants was negatively related to corruption, after controlling for known economic predictors (real gross domestic product per capita). Several years later, Jude (2004) considers that the percentage of Protestants within a nation will be negatively related to the level of corruption within a national economy.",4
16,4,Transition Studies Review,24 December 2009,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-009-0115-9,Optimal Logistics Networks: the Case of Italian Exports to Russia,February 2010,Vittorio A. Torbianelli,Marco Mazzarino,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Russia is one of the most interesting emerging export markets for Italian manufacturing companies. The chance for Italian companies to play an increasingly important role on the Russian market depends also on their capability of building appropriate distribution networks to support such markets, which are characterized by great distances to be covered as well as by several barriers and difficulties. In order to understand the general features that allow logistics networks to better support the internationalization process of Italian companies, it can be useful to refer to the concept of ‘excellence’ while focusing on the context of the Italian manufacturing goods industry. A deeper knowledge of the driving forces which, in general, allow Italian manufacturers to reach ‘excellence’ in international distribution and to consequently expand their role in European foreign markets gives also some important indications on the ‘logistics issue’ in Italian exports to Russia. In particular, a cost reduction strategy coupled with a ‘sufficient’ service level will probably become more of a crucial component of successful logistics network designing. In the first part of the paper, a critical analysis of some Italian case studies of ‘logistics excellence’ is outlined. One of the most interesting results of this analysis is that in some distribution networks the service level goals were too high (‘overperformance’) and the network design was too expensive and complex if set against a balanced needs analysis (of clients and logistics operators). The second part of the paper focuses on trade between Italy and Russia (and more specifically on Italian exports to Russia), and points out that a well conceived balance between service level and costs could be a strategic factor for the resolution of several problems affecting logistics networks that support trade between Italy and Russia. In the light of this, an analysis of the opportunities to innovate network designing for trade between Italy and Russia proves that successful logistics solutions could be built on a mix of more efficient rail–road intermodality (hybrid logistics approach) while using distribution centers and cross-docking points in a more flexible way.",1

Investment projects of companies usually have a time horizon of at least 10 years—with often longer horizons in the public sector. Long-term planning is necessary and the following issues have to be addressed: in which countries is investment including foreign direct investment particularly promising? Will per capita income rise strongly there? Which investment locations offer particular potential for the reallocation of (vertical) value chains? Long-term growth forecasts provide important—albeit not the only—input for investors in their decision-making. Furthermore, those responsible for (economic) policy are interested in long-term growth analyses as they can deduct concrete advice on how to act. For example: what measures can policy makers in Brazil take to achieve growth rates matching those of China? But also: which countries with increasing economic power in 2020 may also aim at a stronger say in global matters? Substantiated long-term forecasts are also of major importance for business cycle analysis: the growth rate of potential GDP is the starting point for all business cycle forecasts (Schneider 2005). A well-based assessment of potential GDP growth helps to answer the question whether strong economic growth in a country may lead to overheating and a subsequent slowdown. Long-term growth forecasts are complicated by the fact that the top performers of the last 10 years may not necessarily be the top performers of the next 10 years. Who would have imagined in 1991 that a decade of stagnation would beset Japan? Who would have forecast in the same year that an impressive rebound of the US economy was to follow? Simply extrapolating the past can not provide reliable forecasts. In addition, there is no automatism towards higher income. Low per capita income levels today are by no means a guarantee for above average growth in the future. If they were, why are there still differences in incomes today? Strong growth requires hard work via complicated processes. Country-specific starting conditions explain why there is no single “ideal” path towards economic success (Schneider 2005).",1

In 1994, the democratic government inherited an economy in deep structural crisis, trapped in a low-growth equilibrium, economic exclusion and underdevelopment (Nowak 2005). The government, led by the African National Congress (ANC) that came to power in 1994, has managed to create a stable, peaceful, and racially balanced political regime with an exemplary record of civil liberties and political freedoms. In the first 10 years, the pace of economic growth doubled, and inflation has been brought down to low and predictable levels. South Africa was readmitted in the International Organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), and started a liberalization of commerce and services. This was made possible by the progressive elimination of tariffs and through commercial agreements with both regional and international organizations (Hviding and Ricci 2005). South Africa plays a very crucial role in the African continent. This country provides more than a third of the 48 sub-Saharan economies’ total Gross Domestic Product (GDP). But despite the remarkable transformation that South Africa underwent with the democratic transition in 1994, levels of economic growth and employment generation have been disappointing and the economic structure is still dualistic. In the African context, South Africa can be considered developed, in particular, in terms of its sophisticated and well established agricultural sector, industry producing good quality raw material, efficient financial services and ICT sector, a good tertiary and technical educational system and a well established international trading regime, such as Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), EU Free Trade Agreement, WTO membership, Southern African Development Community (SADC) membership, and the Motor Industry Development Program (MIDP). On the other hand, the weaknesses which prohibit the South African economy from further growth are mainly unemployment, inflation, the low level of foreign direct investments (FDI) and saving, AIDS/HIV, poverty and inequality. South Africa’s unemployment rate is currently among the highest in the world. According to the Labour Force Survey (LFS), South African’s unemployment rate reached 23.6% in 2007. Gender differences in the South African labor market are pronounced. Male unemployment rates are lower than female rates. In addition, unemployment rate among black African people (26.8% in September 2007) was higher than among colored (20.6%), Indian/Asian (8.2%), and white people (3.8%) and is increasingly lower in the higher age groups. Discouraged work-seekers are an important element of the labour market in South Africa. People who fall into the “discouraged work-seeker” category differ from those regarded as unemployed (on the basis of the official definition) in one respect only—they did not take active steps to find employment in the month prior to the survey interview, in spite of their declared desire for work (Banerjee et al. 2007). The causes of this phenomenon are different. The 1994 democratic transition brought changes in the labour market. An increase of supply has not been supported by an equal increase of demand for labour (particularly low-skill labour). This shift in supply is an apartheid inheritance. The elimination of work restrictions and the introduction of civil and economic rights for all people have brought a significant increase of work participation rate. Black people, particularly women, who were previously discriminated against, created a growing mass of job seekers. On the other hand, the demand for work did not grow but, instead, it started to decrease. Many economists, such as D. Rodrik, believe that the deeper cause of this shrinking demand is the structural change that has taken place within the economy over the last 2 decades (Rodrik 2006). It consists in the decline of the manufacturing sector, which is more intensive in low-skill labour compared to services, which are capital-intensive. This is largely due to the introduction of new technologies stemming from international openness, with a subsequent increase of skilled workers in each sector and a more use of machines at work. The mismatch between supply and demand for labour could have been compensated by a real wage adjustment and informal sector growth. However, it was impossible because of the labour market rigidity, particularly for the importance of trade unions (Arora and Ricci 2005), the discharge practices and the legacies of the Apartheid regime, which made the informal sector first illegal and then difficult for black people to move to larger urban areas unless they already had a certified job. In the absence of sufficient real wage adjustment and informal sector growth, the decline in the demand for low skilled workers has resulted in high unemployment (IMF 2005). After the apartheid regime, in an attempt to bring inflation under control, the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) adopted a new monetary policy based on transparency and an inflation targeting regime, which was announced in South Africa with the presentation of 2000/2001 budget (Arora 2007). A target range of 3–6% was established for the annual average rate of CPIX inflation starting in 2002. The choice of the target would be a prerogative of the National Treasury. Following the sharp depreciation at the end of 2001, inflation peaked at 11.3% in October 2002. The subsequent appreciation of the rand, monetary tightening and continuous improvements in the SARB’s inflation targeting framework led to a steady decline of inflation and, since September 2003, inflation has remained within the official target range (Ricci 2005). The conduct of monetary policy, however, has been complicated by a variety factors. In 2003 the SARB, confident in the inflation positive expectations and in order to boost South African economic growth, adopted an expansive monetary policy, cutting interest rates. As a consequence the domestic demand increased significantly compared to the supply trends and the level of prices started to rise.Footnote 1
 In addition to this increase, other unanticipated events have had important effects on inflation. These include the recent sharp increases in petroleum prices, large fluctuations of the rand against other major currencies, but also the increase in food prices over recent years. Most of these unanticipated events or shocks tend to reflect exogenous factors which originated outside South Africa (IMF 2008). In the sum, inflation started to stand above the upper limit of the inflation target, either for the increase of domestic demand caused by an expansive monetary policy or for exogenous factors. Recently a new restrictive monetary policy, therefore, has been adopted to contain the inflation uplifts but it is still too early to evaluate the effect of this new policy. In order to assure economic and social growth, FDI and the national level of saving—be it public or private—play a crucial role in the country. Over the past 20 years the main determinants of private saving in South Africa have been commodity prices, fiscal policy, and financial liberalization (Harjes and Ricci 2005). At present the mean saving rate fluctuates between 14 and 16% of GDP, a level too low to covert all national investments. Therefore, foreign investments are fundamental for the South African economy. However, contrary to other countries with similar income and risks, most of the investments South Africa attracts are of portfolio rather then FDI. Between 1994 and 2002 the amount of FDI inflows was only 1.5% of GDP compared to portfolio investment that stands at around 3.5% of GDP (Ahmed et al. 2005). The unstable of South African currency makes this phenomenon easier to understand because its negative impact on FDI is stronger than on the portfolio investment. By definition, these are attracted by the stability of financial market, while FDI inflows require a stable political and economic environment, good infrastructure, market openness, a good labour market and positive expectations for the near future, qualities that are currently lacking in South Africa (Arvanitis 2005). Main investors are UE and USA, which are particularly attracted by services as well as the country’s natural resources. Table 1 shows an overview of the South African social and economic situation. The high percentage of adult HIV-prevalence rates is one of the most significant problems the South African government has been facing since 1994 (Horton 2005b). In all government programs, such as the Reconstruction and Development Program (RDP),Footnote 2 the Growth, employment and redistribution strategy (GEAR)Footnote 3 and ongoing Accelerated and Shared Growth Initiative for South Africa (ASGISA), the reduction of AIDS/HIV prevalence rates has been the main issue (WHO, UNAIDS, UNICEF 2008). HIV-prevalence rates in South Africa are strongly correlated with race, gender, employment, income, and education. Women have higher prevalence than men, due to biological and socio-economic factors and they tend to become infected at an earlier age (Horton 2005a). Lower levels of HIV/AIDS awareness, higher-risk sexual behavior, a greater prevalence of sexual violence, and a greater likelihood of economic distress and migration promote the spread of this disease. HIV/AIDS results in direct and indirect economic costs on households, business and the state. These costs include health care, lower productivity and absenteeism and additional recruitment and training expenditures. As a consequence, foreign people are discouraged from investing in a country where there is no prospective to create a good mass of skilled workers in the immediate future (Van Der Berg et al. 2007). With regard to poverty, the Human Development Report of 2007/2008 ranks South Africa as 121 of 177 countries considered, with a Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.674. Furthermore, South Africa ranks 54 in the Human Poverty Index (HPI). Taking into consideration literacy levels, life expectancy at birth and the GDP per-person, South Africa seems to be a middle—human developed country. To analyze the poverty and inequality of this country, the Gini coefficient has a crucial role. On a scale of 0–100, the rank of South Africa appears the highest among other countries considered by the World Bank survey (Fig. 1). 2004 for Brazil, China, India, and Mexico. 2003 for Chile and Turkey. 2002 for Indonesia, Hungary, Poland, and Russian Federation. 1999 for Netherlands and United Kingdom. 1998 for Korea.

This movement is one of the most characteristic within all East European countries since 1990. Greece is the principal host country of Albanian immigrants; according to the population census of 2001, 438,000 legal Albanian immigrants were registered in Greece, compared with 164,000 in Italy (Bonifazi and Sabatino 2003); those registered to other countries are estimated only at tens of thousands (Carletto et al. 2006). Immigrants’ remittances are one of the main parameters of immigration movement because of their importance to the economy of the sending countries. Immigrants’ remittances cover more than 10% of the Albanian Gross Domestic Product (GDP), averaging 13.9% of GDP during the period 1994–2007. The theoretical and empirical interest in immigrants’ remittances has focused on various aspects. The use of remittances in the sending countries has been examined on two parameters, the consumption use of remittances and the investment use of them. Some studies conclude on the prevalence of consumption, while other on that of investment. Airola (2007), for the case of Mexico, Koc and Onan (2004), for the case of Turkey and El-Sakka and McNabb (1999), for the case of Egypt insisted more on the consumption effect of remittances. Uruçi and Gedeshi (2003), Frasheri (2007), studying the Albanian case concluded on the prevalence of consumption for the use of remittances. The prevalence of investment is the conclusion in several other studies. Hamdouch (2005) for the case of Morocco, Leon-Ledesma, and Piracha (2004) for the case of Eastern Europe, Woodruff and Zenteno (2007), Zarate-Hoyos (2004) for the case of Mexico found that remittances particularly influenced investments. Several studies focused on the management of remittances and how they could improve the development of the economy of the sending countries. Glytsos (2002) found the management of remittances for development purposes insufficient in the case of Mediterranean countries. Bodeva (2005) in the Bulgarian case concluded on the prevalence of good economic governance rather than incentive measures to attract remittances into investments. Gubert (2005) for the case of Africa, Nyberg Sorensen (2004) for the case of Morocco and Koksal and Liebig (2005) for the case of Turkey concluded on the importance of financial institutions to channel remittances into productive investments. Effects of remittances on income and poverty in the sending countries of immigrants have been the object of numerous studies with diverse conclusions. Barham and Boucher (1998) in the case of Nicaragua found that remittances increase inequality of income. Koechlin and Leon (2007), from a sample of 78 countries, found that remittances may increase income inequality in the first stages of migration, but then remittances tend to lower this inequality. Acosta et al. (2006) using the example of Latin America countries, Adams and Page (2005) based on the study of 71 developing countries and Frasheri (2007) based on the Albanian case found that remittances reduce poverty. Osili (2007) examined the case of Nigeria and found that remittances created a financial source for investments. Sall (2005) based on the case of Sub-Saharan countries concluded on the contribution of remittances on the creation of countries’ infrastructures. In recent years there is an increasing interest on the role of networks of transmission of immigrants’ remittances. Nevertheless, there are still few studies focusing on this aspect. Karafolas and Sariannidis (2009) found that the development of the banking network of Greek and Italian banks in Albania favoured the growth of remittances of Albanian immigrants through the banking system. Karafolas (1995, 1998) found that banks from Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain created a banking network in countries where an immigrant population from those countries reside. Amuedo-Doranes and Pozo (2005) working on the case of Mexican immigrants, conclude that educated immigrants and those who have a network of friends and family in the host city, use the banking system to transfer their savings to Mexico. Those who are not legal immigrants and with a lack of documents do not use the banking system for this transfer. In another study using the sample of Mexican immigrants in the US, Amuedo-Doranes and Bansak (2006) found that banking had a limited positive influence on remittances. Orozco (2002, 2003) working on the impact of remittances in Latin American and South European countries found that transfer costs are lower when they are sent through regulated financial institutions; he also found that remittances in South Europe have a lower cost in comparison with Latin American countries. The paper tries to cover a gap in the literature on money transfer methods by examining the immigrants’ choice for the remittances channel in the case of Albanian immigrants in Greece. In particular, the paper is based on a sample of Albanian immigrants, permanent and seasonal, and tries to identify the choice of transfer method between banks, money transfer companies (MTC) and hand-carried transfer by their or a relative’s return in Albania. The paper investigates whether the cost of the transfer or the quickness of the transfer influences the money transmission method. The empirical results show that hand-carried remains the most popular method in spite of cost and quickness and despite the growth of the banking and MTCs networks in Albania; between banks and MTCs, permanent immigrants prefer banks and seasonal immigrants prefer MTCs. Following the introduction, the second section examines the evolution of total remittances of Albanian immigrants by distinguishing the parallel and the official network. In the third section the paper focuses on the networks created by banks and MTC in Albania and the cost of transfer through banks and MTC. Section four offers the data and sample used for this study. Empirical results are presented in section five while conclusions are in section six.",9

Emerging economies (EEs), such as low-to-middle per capita income economies, and transition economies (TEs), such as former communist countries, are experiencing a process of fast growth and institutional change in most cases. This paper aims first of all to explore the social sustainability and the quality of such growth in those countries. The economic growth that occurred in emerging and transition economies (ETEs) during the period 1995–2006 was, on average, 4.7%, and above the average world growth. The paper examines, in particular, whether, this growth resulted in income distribution, measured as a reduction of the Gini coefficient, and in a reduction of poverty, measured by a cut-off line of $4 a day. Secondly, the paper addresses important issues of the economic development process, such as the dynamics of life expectancy and education, and of human development variables more generally. In particular the paper tries to understand whether or not economic growth increased human development in ETEs. Such an issue is crucial to the identification of a process of economic growth with a process of economic development. In their widely quoted economic development book, Perkins et al. (2007) stress the difference between economic growth (understood as the rate of growth in goods and services produced) and economic development (which involves economic growth together with change in some human development variables, such as life expectancy, infant mortality, education, and other goals such as environment sustainability, political democracy, income distribution, participation, access to resources, etc.). Cypher and Dietz (2004) also make such a differentiation between economic growth and (economic) development. The latter “…encompasses a wide range of social and human goals that, while including the level of income and economic growth, goes well beyond this as well” (Cypher and Dietz 2004), p. 29. This differentiation must not be confused with that discussed among institutional economistsFootnote 1 who perceive economic growth as a static phenomenon and economic development as a wider perspective of development that includes structural and institutional change, social dynamics and cultural change (Myrdal 1974). However, it has to be said that these two perspectives of economic development (the one put forward by Perkins et al. (2007) and Cypher and Dietz (2004), and the other put forward by Myrdal 1974) would easily converge in the end because, as Myrdal (1974), p. 729 himself states, economic development would bring about improvements in health, education and other collective goods. Through a series of cross-country regressions, using OLS models, the paper assesses the type of development in a sample of 50 ETEs. Economic growth during 1995–2006 is regressed against poverty, inequality and human development variables. The main findings are that growth did not reduce poverty and that inequality increased, on average, among ETEs during this period. Moreover, economic growth occurred at the expense of an important human development variable i.e., life expectancy and an important indicator of political democracy, i.e., voice and accountability. The rest of the paper is organised as follows: “Growth, Inequality and Poverty: a Brief Review” presents an essential review on poverty, inequality and growth; “Institutional Change and Economic Growth in ETEs” analyses more deeply the institutional change occurring in ETEs, putting forward a model of development path (Fig. 1)Footnote 2; “ETEs: a Description of the Sample” describes the sample of ETEs; “Poverty and Inequality in Transition and Emerging Economies” shows the results of the OLS regression models on poverty and inequality in ETEs; “Conclusion” concludes the paper.

Brada,Arthur E. King,Chia-Ying Ma,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Poland’s transition performance stands out from other transition economies by virtue of the early recovery of its output following the “transition recession” as well as by virtue of the high rate of growth that the economy has sustained in subsequent years. While numerous factors such as the privatization strategy, the pace of liberalization of the economy and macroeconomic policies all have a role to play in Poland’s economic performance, in the end, production takes place on the factory floor, and it is in the behavior of firms in the early years of the transition that the seeds of increased production are to be found. A key issue for firms in all transition economies was how to obtain the necessary capital needed to restructure capacities and to finance inventories, wages and taxes, and, because Poland’s economy recovered quite quickly, lessons form Polish enterprise restructuring of both physical and financial capita would seem of particular value. In this paper we examine the investment behavior of a sample of 170 Polish firms over the period 1991–1993. In our work, we try stress two insights. The first is that the standard neoclassical approach to investment behavior, the accelerator model, is much more applicable to a situation where firms are seeking to increase their capital stock than it is to a situation where firms may be seeking to decrease it. The second is that physical capital accumulated through investment is but one of the productive assets deployed by the firm in its effort to generate profits. If returns to other assets, such as cash, trade credit, etc., change, then the firm will wish to alter the mix of assets in a way that is not captured well by the accelerator model and its extensions.Footnote 1
 Studies of early investment by firms in transition economies such as Anderson and Kegels (1997) and Lízal and Svejnar (1997) are based on accelerator or neoclassical models of investment.Footnote 2 The accelerator model assumes that firms wish to maintain a fixed ratio between their long-run output and capital stock; investment is thus driven by changes in expected future output, which create a need to change the capital stock to accommodate the new level of output. The neoclassical model (see, e.g., Bond and Meghir 1994) assumes that investment decisions are made so as to maximize the present discounted value of profits based on expectations about the future. Implicit in the derivation of this model is that the returns to other assets do not change, nor do the costs of the firm’s liabilities. In empirical applications, the model incorporates measures of adjustment costs or financial constraints in order to reflect the fact that investment does not bring the level of the capital stock to its new level instantaneously. While both of these models of investment are generally cast in a theoretical framework that appears neutral between investment and disinvestment, the rationale for the inclusion of financial constraints in both theory and applications is always cast in terms of increases in capital (see, for example, Konings et al. 2003; Hartarska and Gonzalez-Vega 2006). That is, the firm is assumed to be growing, and delays in increasing its capital stock to the equilibrium level are ascribed to the difficulties of obtaining sufficient internal and external financing to do so. This introduces a potential asymmetry in the model in that there may be no such constraints on disinvestment. Barring free disposal of physical assets, a firm seeking to reduce its capital stock can sell it off or, failing that, make no investments and reduce its capital stock through depreciation. Notice that the former option is quite unrelated to the kinds of financial considerations that determine the speed with which a firm can increase its capital stock; rather the speed with which a firm can sell off its capital stock depends on the market demand for its specific stock of equipment and structures. If there is no such demand, then disinvestment is limited to the level of capital depreciation, which, in turn, is a function of the capital stock, its age and composition and technological progress (Mathews 1959, Chaps. 4, 10). One of the notable features of the studies of investment in transition economies cited above is that, while they obtain significant and plausible coefficients for some explanatory variables, they actually explain very little of the investment behavior of firms. For example, Anderson and Kegels (1997) apply an accelerator model supplemented with financial variables to a sample of 961 Czech non-financial firms for 1993 and 1994. Their full specification over this sample yields an R
2 of 0.344, and only the coefficients of the financial variables are significant, with real variables thus playing no role in determining investment flows. Lízal and Svejnar (1997) apply a variety of specifications to a panel of 2860-4133 Czech firms for 1992–1995. Their results yield R
2s for this sample that range from 0.010 to 0.230 over their specifications. One reason for this inability of the accelerator model to explain the major part of the early investment behavior of firms in transition economies is that most of these firms’ behavior was governed by the desire to disinvest rather than by the desire to expand their stock of fixed capital. Moreover, in the conditions of the early transition, such disinvestment likely took the form of physical depreciation of capital rather than either free disposal or the sale of machinery, equipment and structures to other firms. Thus, the use of models based on the implicit assumption that firms generally seek to increase or maintain their capital stock and face financial constraints in doing so is unlikely to explain well the investment decisions of firms whose objective was to reduce their capital stock.",1

 As is well known, theoretical models usually look at this connection by postulating non-satiation and assuming a stable concave nexus between income and utility. The well-known rationale is that money is a means of exchange which can purchase an ample variety of goods and services. Even in the extreme case of contemporaneous satiation for all material goods money may still be regarded as very useful to conquer immaterial goods such as status, power and fame. As a consequence, its marginal utility should keep on being non-negative, even when individuals dispose of high income levels. This short premise explains why in this paper we decide to look not just at determinants of levels and changes in income but also at strong (weak) frustrated achievement. We define the latter as the circumstance under which positive changes in income lead to negative (or non-positive) changes in life satisfaction (Graham and Pettinato 2002). The concept of frustrated achievement has the advantage of being a simple and easily understandable way of looking at the dynamics of the income-life satisfaction relationship and testing the validity of the non-satiation hypothesis. In our frustrated achievement estimates the magnitude of significant regressors may be read as the impact of such regressors on the probability of overcoming the satiation point in the life satisfaction–income relationship. An observationally equivalent (and more sophisticated) rationale for the existence of frustrated achievement put forth in the literature is that the instantaneous income/utility function (which is assumed as having no satiation points) may change shape across time when some income related concurring factors (relative income, dynamics between monetary expectations and achievements) are at work (Frey and Stutzer 2002; Clark et al. 2006). Three findings of our research provide new original evidence in this debate. A first important result documents that, unlike what is measured in developed countries (Becchetti and Rossetti 2009), higher income is negatively and not positively correlated with frustrated achievement. This finding leads us to infer that individuals in transition countries are not in the upper side of a concave happiness-income relationship. Two other main results of our paper provide evidence in favour of this hypothesis and illustrate that there is something more complex beyond the simplified textbook concave life satisfaction/income relationship. More specifically, we observe that two income related factors significantly affect such relationship after controlling for income levels. These factors are the self perceived affluence status and the way income is earned (more specifically, the share of remittances and social assistance on total income). This last result may be interpreted also as a proof of the limits of the consequentialist approach to economics since what matters is not just the monetary outcome but also the circumstances under which the outcome is obtained. The validity of this interpretation is tested in the paper vis-à-vis alternatives identifying variables affecting future expected income in such factors. The choice of a transition country for our investigation is not casual. The advantage of working on a non-high income country is that of observing more variability in ways of earning income, with a higher impact of social assistance and measures against poverty and a specific role of remittances. In addition to it, our sample allows us to check whether frustrated achievement arises only for individuals who already achieved high living standards or also for those starting from much lower levels. The paper deals with all these issues and is divided into six sections (including “Introduction” and “Conclusions”). In the second section, we provide a short discussion of the income–happiness literature relevant to the focus of our research. In the third and fourth sections we show and discuss descriptive and econometric findings, respectively, while in the fifth section we evaluate the plausible interpretations for the role of the remittance share in our estimates. Section ""From Frustrated Achievement to Level and Rates of Changes in Life Satisfaction"" concludes by considering implications for frustrated achievement and life satisfaction in transition countries.",7
17,1,Transition Studies Review,30 March 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-010-0136-4,Review of CIS Stock Markets: Future Perspectives,May 2010,Fariz Huseynov,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"About two decades ago many countries had one national stock exchange dominating the market. Listing and trading took place through these markets. Relatively recent application of continuously developing technology has increased the integration of stock markets around the globe. Companies and investors gained more flexibility by choosing the market where to list and trade. This compelled stock exchanges to compete for order flow by offering investors lower transaction costs and for companies by offering them different sections to be listed. Automation of the transactions by allowing for electronic trading can serve as an example to technological advances and their impact on financial markets. For example, Jain (2005) finds that electronic trading enhanced the liquidity and informativeness of stock markets, and led to a reduction in the cost of capital in many countries. However, the impact of the market design on the financial markets is not the same everywhere. Market microstructure literature has studied the issues such as whether the fragmentation or consolidation of stock exchanges benefits investors the most. Recent developments in trading mechanism and increasing competition by electronic communication networks (ECNs) have provided the benefits of fragmentation. It is still debatable whether fragmentation increases the competition among stock exchanges and thus lowers the transaction costs, along with lower liquidity. Pagano (1989), Admati and Pfledreder (1986) and Chowdhry and Nanda (1991) show that assuming that the liquidity suppliers compete across the markets, one of several competing markets dominates others and draws most of the order flow leading to the concentration of trading in one venue. Mendelson (1987) and Madhavan (1995) theoretically show that fragmentation leads to reduced liquidity, higher price volatility and violations of price efficiency. Several studies find negative impact of fragmentation, such as Cohen et al. (1985), Porter and Thatcher (1998), while others say the order consolidation improves liquidity and pricing (Amihud et al.
2003; Hendershott and Jones 2003; Bennett and Wei 2006). However, Branch and Freed (1977) find that the reduction in spreads is higher due to the competition through fragmentation than the increase in them by the loss of volume. This is consistent with the later findings of Hamilton (1979) and McInish and Wood (1996). Several papers extend these studies to other markets, such as European and Asian markets. Several studies focused on the recent consolidation of stock exchanges in Europe, such as NOREX (combination of Stockholm, Copenhagen, Iceland and Oslo Stock Exchanges) and Euronext (Amsterdam, Paris and Brussels Stock Exchanges). McAndrews and Stefanidis (2002) conclude that consolidation of trading in many European countries could reduce the costs and complications of cross-border trading, despite the remaining regulatory and legal barriers. Former Soviet Union Countries of Independent States (CIS) launched their own stock exchanges several years after the collapse of Soviet Union. Unlike Baltic countries and Russia, other CIS countries have been relatively unsuccessful at developing liquid and functioning stock exchanges. Recently, international investors identified Frontier markets, third group of countries that does not fall into emerging markets category. Because CIS markets have potential to become a Frontier market (Morgan Stanley considers Kazakhstan and Ukraine in this group), a critical review of these markets is valuable from the perspective of the financial literature and practitioners. This paper aims to review the main stock exchanges of relatively smaller CIS countries: Armenia (Armex), Azerbaijan [Baku Stock Exchange (BSE)], Georgia (GSE), Kazakhstan (KASE), Kyrgyzstan (KSE), Moldova (MSE), Uzbekistan (TSE), and Ukraine (UKRSE). To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to provide the comprehensive analysis of these markets. Because these markets lack market liquidity, company and investor attraction, their critical analysis will enable us to make policy suggestions for future developments. Later, the paper discusses the possibility of regional consolidation among these markets and potential benefits of consolidation over the current fragmented markets. Throughout the paper we will refer to these eight stock exchanges as CIS Stock Exchanges. We obtain descriptive data for the period of 2003–2008 from Federation of Euro-Asian Stock Exchanges (FEAS) country reports. The next section provides a statistical overview of CIS Stock Exchanges followed by a review on the current trading mechanisms across the markets. The subsequent section discusses current problems and lessons suggested by small and emerging company marketplaces (SEMs) around the world, followed by a section on future prospects, and then a section on BSE follows and provides suggestions for further improvements. Finally, conclusion is given.",1

M. Wahid,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The existing literature on savings–investment relationship with its implication on capital mobility shows an interesting phenomenon of domestic dissaving for an open economy such as Pakistan. Weak institutional arrangements cannot stop capital mobility outside the boundaries in case of weak savings–investment correlation. Economic development in a small open economy depends on the availability of domestic savings (resources) and access to international capital markets to finance development projects. Public deficit that crowds-out the domestic investment also depends on the movement of capital outside territorial boundaries. This is due to the fact that foreign direct investment (FDI) is not desirable in most of the developing countries, as the cost of capital outflow sometimes exceeds the benefits of inflows. Sometimes FDI is associated with political strings for developing nations that also impair their capacity to finance its projects in subsequent years. High degree of capital movement within the country increases the availability of domestic savings for economic growth, thus, improves the capital efficiency. There are multiple positive affects associated with the internal capital mobility that includes lowering disparities among regions, better income distribution, and balanced infrastructure development. High degree of capital mobility within a country also affects the fiscal and current account policies of an economy to identify the burden of taxes on investment and economic cost of adjustment from negative exogenous shocks.Footnote 1 Economic growth depends upon capital accumulation that is stimulated through the mobilization of domestic savings and foreign capital inflow. The situation is entirely different in the case of a closed economy. Domestic savings are retained for domestic investment with a high degree of capital mobility internally. On the contrary, in an open economy, current account targeting policy in fixed exchange rate regime has steady unitary coefficient of savings–investment relationship. Flexible exchange rate may direct savings–investment coefficient of correlation to be less than unitary at the same time.Footnote 2 In the current global financial system, fluid movements of capital, internationally lower savings–investment association, because domestic investment is financed through a pool of foreign savings. Other factors such as government expenditures over tax revenues, excess of imports over exports, financial liberalization, exchange rate policies, and integration of world financial markets have significant affects on savings–investment relationship. The present study investigates what determines the savings–investment correlation in the globalized financial environment and to what extent domestic savings is able to finance investment. It is important to understand the implications on domestic economy in case of capital inflows. The study empirically analyzes the Feldstein–Horioka puzzle for Pakistan in floating exchange rate regime. In this paper, two major policy shifts has been analyzed in the context of savings–investment relationship. In the 1980–1981, the government has changed its fixed exchange rate policy to that of floating exchange rate. Similarly, the decade of the 1990s is considered as financial liberalization era. In theory, it is believed that capital mobility increases after the liberalization of the capital account.Footnote 3
 Relevant literature has two main strands about the Feldstein and Horioka (1980) puzzle.Footnote 4 In the decade of the 1980s, by using cross-sectional data, it has been argued that stronger correlation between savings and investment implies greater capital immobility at international level. Some studies suggest a brawny association between savings and investment [Feldstein and Horioka (1983); Penati and Dooley (1984); Feldstein (1983); Obstfeld (1986); Dooley et al. (1987); Haque and Montiel (1991); Tesar (1991); Feldstein and Bacchetta (1991); Sinha and Sinha (1998); Narayan (2005a, b); Ang (2007) and, Jiranyakul and Brahmasrene (2008)]. Later on, time series analysis has revealed mixed results [Miller (1988); Alexakis and Apergis (1994); Ho (1999, 2000); Schneider (1999); Boon (2000); De Vita and Abbott (2002); Ho (2003); Payne and Kumazawa (2005); Erden (2005); Kohler (2005); Bebczuk and Schmidt-Hebbel (2006); Grier et al. (2007); Mastroyiannis (2007); Murthy (2007) and Özmen (2004, 2007)]. After the 1980s, the theories evolved about savings–investment correlation have not supported the Feldstein–Horioka hypothesis and argues that other macro economic factors have also contributed to the prevalence of relationship between savings and investment. The factors included in the list are: size of the country, current account solvency, performance and structure of financial sector, endogenous shocks, growth rate of income, non-traded goods, immobile factors, productivity shocks, and the exchange rate regime. These factors could have influenced savings–investment correlation even if capital mobility occurs [for example see, Murphy (1984); Obstfeld (1985); Summers (1985); Engle and Kletzer (1987); Baxter and Crucini (1993); Coakley et al. (1996); Ho (2003); Kasuga (2004); Ang (2007) and Jiranyakul (2008)]. Sinn (1992) in his seminal work has used time series approach to investigate saving–investment correlation. Later, Afxentiou and Serletis (1993); Tesar (1993) and Alexakis and Apergis (1994) have analyzed savings–investment correlation by using country specific approach. In the literature, the saving–investment link has been analyzed by applying co-integration technique for long run association with short run dynamics. Short-run savings–investment correlation has been examined by Jansen (1998) who showed the speed of adjustment at which the variables return to the long-run equilibrium from short-run deviation. The study concluded that if a country can easily borrow or lend capital to fill current account imbalances in the short-run, this would have a positive impact on the degree of international capital mobility. Furthermore, Pelgrin and Schich (2004) identified a close relationship between savings rate and investment in long-run that is considered to be consistent with the binding of solvency constraint in which parameter estimated for the error-correction term was always highly significant. Rubio (1998) in his pioneer work has empirically analyzed the savings–investment relation by case studies of countries. He examined savings–investment relationship through error correction term to find out the degree of capital mobility from Spanish data for the period 1964–1994. Similarly, Pelagidis and Mastroyiannis (2003) employed error correction model (ECM) to find out capital mobility across borders. Schmidt (2003) examined the endogeneity of the Australian savings and investment rates and empirically highlighted the exogeneity of investment. The empirical evidence suggests an endogenous response on the part of the Australia’s savings rate to limit the potential benefits of the tax changes. Payne (2005) investigated the savings–investment relationship and the adjustment of the current account for Mexico over the period 1960–2002. Narayan (2005a, b) has found that savings and investment are cointegrated for Japan with the existence of correlation between investment and savings. In the same study, Narayan showed that the shocks to savings and investment have a permanent effect with long-run savings coefficient of 0.68 that implied a moderate rate of correlation. In case of Japan, the results were contrary to Feldstein and Horioka (1980) puzzle as savings and investment had co-integrated at each level. But for the Chinese economy, the Narayan (2005a, b) study presented a different set of conclusions. The savings and investment were correlated for China for the fixed exchange rate and for the entire sample period with the high savings–investment correlation that postulated that the Chinese economy was in conformity with the F–H hypothesis. The argument was valid as Chinese economy was a closed economy from 1952 to 1994. The data also indicated a relatively low foreign direct investment in China for the same period. Papapetrou (2006) investigated dynamic relationship between savings and investment in Greece during the period of structural changes with policy regime changes. Moreover, the study suggested that the degree of correlation between savings and investment had weakened during financial liberalization periods. Finally, Parker and Parker (2008) found no co-movement between savings and investment rates that simply confirmed the existence of capital mobility between Thailand and Malaysia. The literature has abundantly highlighted that correlation between savings and investment is unitary under fixed exchange rate regime. The effect of globalization on savings–investment correlation is strong, because each economy is integrated with the rest of the world either financially or politically. On the contrary, in flexible exchange rate regime, the association between domestic savings and investment is less than unity (Özmen 2004). Financial sector performance and economic policies by public sector have played a key role in determining the extent of correlation between savings and investment (Ang 2007). There is enough evidence in literature that provides empirical explanation of Feldstein–Horioka puzzle and discuss savings–investment correlation to quantify capital mobility internationally [Ang (2007); Coakley et al. (2004); Taylor (2002) and, Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000)]. It has been argued that for open economies, the financing of domestic investment is not a problem because well developed financial sector could borrow externally at a very low transaction cost.Footnote 5 The level of domestic financial intermediation varies from country to country and for efficient intermediation with international market, the level of financial development is important. For this reason, level of financial development and flexible exchange rate act as frictions to international financial integration among countries. The integration of global financial markets has compelled nations to move toward financial liberalization with reforms in basic financial structure. Developing nations with weak financial sector has to integrate with world financial markets that has further weaken its growth capacity. Pakistan has undergone fundamental reforms in financial sector and adopted flexible exchange rate policy since the 1980s. These two policy reforms have opened-up the economy with severe macro economic imbalances. It would be interesting to examine how these two policy measures have affected the economy in terms of savings–investment ratio in long-run and what are the short-run dynamics of savings–investment relationship in the context of Feldstein–Horioka puzzle. This study captures the magnitude of capital inflows that are invested to narrow the domestic savings–investment gap. In Pakistan, the issue has not been addressed yet, and no research has been undertaken to analyze whether Feldstein–Horioka puzzle is contributing to capital mobility internationally.",9

The echo of this giant geopolitical explosion accelerated the processes of disintegration in the contemporary world. The Soviet Union’s breakup brought about not only the collapse of the bipolar world and the bipolar system of international relations, but also the disappearance of perhaps the last empire in history. Ethnic, historical and political conflicts that always existed, in one way or another, in the Soviet Union, albeit hidden behind a cloak of the official doctrine that proclaimed the emergence of “the Soviet people as a new historical community of people,” came to light as soon as the centralized regime showed the first signs of weakening. The nationalist and anti-communist sentiments of the masses increased, being further stirred up by centrifugal aspirations of ambitious local elites who sought to gain full power in their republics and political independence from the center. The first and only president of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, tried to save the state by means of a new Union Treaty, to be concluded by the republics. However, its signing was thwarted by an anti-democratic coup in August 1991, after which the country’s disintegration became irreversible. The formal decision on the Soviet Union’s break-up was made by the leaders of the Russian Federation (Boris Yeltsin), Ukraine (Leonid Kravchuk) and Belarus (Stanislav Shushkevich) in the Belavezha Forest in December 1991. In place of the former superpower, 15 newly independent states were established, which were later recognized by the international community as independent international legal entities. These states included Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. This article focuses on the characteristic features of the transition period in the development of the post-Soviet countries, the peculiarities of their economic and political development, and the policies of major world powers towards the former Soviet republics. The study seeks to identify Russia’s role in the former Soviet Union during the transition period.",2

First, there was the food crisis where the prices for crops rose so high that many people in developing countries had difficulty in paying for their own food. So the media and the public in Western Europe demanded a more efficient use of agricultural production (Randerson 2008). As the year continued, the prices for oil rose to unseen and unimagined heights. As gas prices skyrocketed, the public was now calling for more efficient energy usage in cars and houses (Coleman 2008). Finally, the financial crisis hit the world, reduced high wealth to fractions and destroyed lots of confidence in the financial systems. Once again, the public opinion was quick to call for more efficient measures of regulation (Bayerisches Finanzzentrum e.V 2008). It seems that the criterion of efficiency is central in many aspects of our daily life. It is also critical in all those fields where people interact with other people’s resources. In this paper, we will look at the efficiency of EU-funds in a special context: support for young people. We will not concentrate on the question if the means are spent efficiently, but rather discuss if and how this efficiency can be measured and how good the approaches already carried out by the EU are. Our paper is structured in five sections. “Evaluation of the Youth-Program 2000–2006” analyzes the actual procedure employed by the EU and shows how the Youth-program was actually evaluated. “Efficiency” deals with the theoretical aspects of effectiveness and efficiency. We will present both definitions for the terms and propose a model with which we feel it is possible to measure the efficiency of the EU-funding scheme. “Calculation of the Effectiveness and Efficiency of Exemplary Projects” demonstrates the use of the model by showing the calculations for exemplary cases. We then compare the currently used methods of evaluation to our proposed model in “A Long Way from Theory to Practice”. Finally, we conclude by bringing together the issues discussed in the previous parts.",

17,1,Transition Studies Review,09 April 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-010-0131-9,The Value Relevance of Fair Value,May 2010,Adela Deaconu,Anuţa Buiga,Cristina Silvia Nistor,Female,Female,Female,Female,"Accounting has an essential purpose which determines its scientific structure: control over the economic value of the entity (Charrier 2005). The quality of accounting information is the condition under which users make correct economic decisions. Many studies confirm the fact that stakeholders make decisions depending on the quality of financial reporting (Hirst et al. 1995; Demsey 1989; Alexander et al. 2001; Maines and Wahlen 2006). The quality of accounting information is a complex and hard to establish concept. According to the internationally accepted accounting system of reference, relevance is one criterion under which quality can be assessed. This criterion can be measured through the differential analysis of the effect triggered by the implementation of certain alternative accounting models such as valuation models. At the moment, there are two models that compete and complete each other i.e. the historical cost model and the fair value model. With respect to fair value, approaches go from historical to social aspects, comprising both fiscal and economic implications. Moreover, fair value is considered both from a conceptual and implementation of techniques perspective. It is described in the academic literature, in regulations of professional bodies (accounting, asset valuation), in papers issued by public authorities and capital markets, in presentations given by accounting experts and renowned accounting firms. The studies mentioned above are theoretical, technical or based on empirical tests. More often than not, in the context of financial reporting, the role played by fair value is underlined by comparison to historical cost, which represents its alternative in the valuation of assets or firms. Fair value is designated as a paradigm, model, principle or valuation base. The following authors conducted studies that focused on the fair value model both from the theoretical and practical point of view: Casta and Colasse (2001), Holmes et al. (2002), Obert (2004). In addition there are accounting and asset valuation norms which have supported the usage of fair value: the norms of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), the European Directives, the norms of the International Valuation Standards Committee (IVSC). There is also another category of studies which is closer to our research as it has analyzed, through an empirical approach, the relation between fair value disclosed in financial reporting and the reaction of the market, providing solutions for measuring this relation (e.g. Barth 1994; Barth et al. 1992; Muller and Riedl 2002; Herrmann et al. 2006). Some studies are skeptical with respect to the benefits of fair value usage. Its main weaknesses are shaped by its volatility and the risk involved when stakeholders want to make relevant decisions. Other studies, in larger numbers, consider fair value more relevant than historical cost which would represent the main argument for the decreased trust in disclosed information (Lev and Zarowin 1999). The multiple advantages identified by certain authors can be summed up in the following attributes of the fair value: utility, relevance, transparency, superior accuracy of the entity’s result and cash-flow, the accountability of managers. All these advantages exist as long as fair value enables users of accounting information to make decisions and predictions in relation to their own actions. In this study we will develop these ideas to the extent in which this allows us to support the relevance and the importance of fair value with respect to accounting information quality assurance (Deaconu et al. 2008). Fair value is not generalized in any accounting system, it coexists with historical cost. Its stipulation in the professional standards, hence its implementation into practice and the academic studies on its impact, has started with the implementation of financial instruments, then has spread to investment property, investments in agriculture and other transactions which call for discounting and market comparison. In Romania the concept has been introduced into practice in 2001, when certain regulation for large firms was issued although market related values were requested less explicitly after the 1990s. At the moment fair value is explicitly stipulated for revaluation of tangible assets in the case of individual accounts and for financial instruments in the case of consolidated accounts (Ministry of Public Finance 2009). We consider the case of tangible assets more useful for our study, compared to financial instruments, taking into account the larger scale at which the former is present in the Romanian practice system. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: “Accounting Information and Fair Value” presents the content of the value relevance concept and suggests certain criteria for its assessment; “Value Relevance of Tangible Assets” reviews the findings of the studies on value relevance of tangible assets; “Research Design” presents the research hypotheses, the sample and the model considered for the analysis of the value relevance of tangible assets in the case of Romania, an emergent economy; “Tests and Results” elaborates on the applied tests and their results leading to the concluding final part.",2
17,1,Transition Studies Review,04 April 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-010-0132-8,Exchange Rate Policy in Serbia,May 2010,Nikola Fabris,Slobodan Aćimović,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The role of an exchange rate in the setup of monetary policy is no longer new and it still remains as a hot topic for debates among researchers. Over the last decade, global exchange rate arrangements have undergone momentous changes, with many countries revising their exchange rate policies. Compared to the end of 1970s, the number of the IMF members with the officially pegged exchange rates has halved, whereas that of floating has doubled. Within the group of pegged regimes, the share or hard pegs increased over the past decade, as a growing number of countries have adopted the currency board, joined currency unions, or formally dollarized (eurised). Frequent arguments in the literature are those that the only sustainable regimes are free floating and hard exchange rate commitments (Bubula and Otker-Robe 2002; Eichengreen et al. 1995; Obstfeld and Rogoff 1995). Naturally, apart from free floating and hard peg regimes, there is a wide spectrum of intermediate regimes which can be applied. The advantage of using the exchange rate as a nominal anchor lies in a higher probability that private agents will adjust fast. The exchange rate is much more transparent and, thus, more credible than money supply, or even an anti-inflationary commitment in general. It’s significance increases when the exchange rate is pegged to a certain currency, such as the euro, for example, rather than to the currency basket. The negative side of using the exchange rate as a nominal anchor lies in the fact that exchange rate targeting may cause the balance-of-payments problem and that, under such circumstances, the possibilities for conducting an independent monetary policy are limited. Many studies suggest that the inclusion of exchange rate term in the policy reaction function plays an improving role to the performance of monetary policy rules and enchances higher welfare of agent (Sek 2008). The history of currency pegs have often been traumatic, and not rarely has it led to a loss in foreign currency reserves and the abandonment of the currency peg. Duttagupta and Otker-Robe (2003) found that the median duration of a peg is 1 year. Klein and Marion (1997) on the example of Latin American countries shows that the median duration was 10 months. A number of studies have found that the abandonment of the peg is accompanied with deterioration in economic and political fundamentals. Masson (2000) has made different conclusion. By using the Markov chain, Mason has predicted that after a very long transition all emerging markets will have pegged rates. This hypothesis was rejected for the sample that included other countries. In theory, it is usually recommended that the countries depending on a single market should peg their national currency to the export market currency, while the policy of a flexible exchange rate is suggested for small open economies the policy, because it will facilitate the absorption of various shocks. Fixed exchange rate regimes are most often suggested under conditions of hyperinflation or high inflationary expectations in order to facilitate the lowering of the inflation rate. A numerous studies have shown that abandoning fixed peg was followed by economic and political instability in the large number of the countries. (Eichengreen et al. 1995; Duttagupta and Otker-Robe 2003). Klein and Marion (1997) found that the probability for dissolved peg decreases with an increase in a country’s openness. Duttagupta and Otker-Robe (2003) has discovered that emerging markets are more prone to crises, and that the probability of a crisis appearance increases with the duration of the pegged regime, indicating that the existing inconsistencies between exchange rates and other macroeconomic policies could increase with an increase in the time spent in a pegged regime. Ghosh et al. (2003) determined that fixed pegged regimes have the lowest probability of a currency crisis. Bubula and Otker-Robe (2002) came to similar conclusions, and she discovered that intermediate pegs have the highest probability of a crisis occurrence, and that this probability with hard pegs is lower than with floating regimes. The following table shows the results of Bubula’s research about the share of crises under hard peg regimes, intermediate regimes and floating regimes (Table 1). On average, nearly three-quarters of the crisis episodes occurred under intermediate regimes. They have broken down when the authorities have directed their policies towards domestic objectives, often as the result of the impossible trinity. Bubula has discovered that a crisis probability in intermediate regimes is three times higher than under hard pegs. However, this does not mean that floating regimes and hard pegs have been crisis free. The fixed peg affects trade if partners consider it to be a stable and a credible arrangement. It introduces the predictability element into foreign trade. Responsibility for inflation is shifted to the country the currency is being pegged to (Fabris and Kalezic 2008). The longer the fixed peg is sustained, the greater the effect on trade, as well as Egert and Morales (2005) have clearly shown in their study that an increase in the exchange rate volatility decreases exports, and this effect is even stronger in less developed countries. In case of shocks, such as oil price upsurge, the possibility to adjust over a change in the exchange rate is reduced, and the only option that remains is the compensation over an increase in wage flexibility. However, in Serbia, there is low wage flexibility mainly due to relatively powerful trade unions and employees rights inherited from the previous regime. Also, it should not be disregarded that Serbia was under the influence of speculative capital inflows. This short survey of the views of various authors concerning the exchange rate shows clearly that there is no consensus on the exchange rate policy issue. Furthermore, the choice of an optimal exchange rate regime is one of the major unresolved questions of international macroeconomics.",1

In 2002, the average hourly earnings in manufacturing in the new EU member countries were five times lower than the EU-15 average and half those of Portugal (the EU-15 country with lowest labour costs). Given that manufacturing employment represents around a quarter of total employment in the EU-27, these disparities are important on both the demand and supply side: on the demand side, workers’ income determines purchasing power and the catching-up process; on the supply side, labour costs influence investment, especially of foreign origin, as it can choose among alternative locations. There is now a large literature in the New Economic Geography (NEG) tradition that shows a positive link between manufacturing wage rates and both increased market access (for example, Hanson (1997, 1998) for NAFTA, Redding and Venables (2004) for a worldwide sample, Venables (2001); Brulhart et al. (2004) and Head and Mayer (2006) for Europe) and increased access to a pool of human capital (for example, Hunt and Mueller (2002) for Canada, Monastiriotis (2002) for the UK). The EU’s enlargements in 2004 and 2007 have increased both market access and access to a pool of human capital. Hence, they can be expected to have had a positive impact on manufacturing wage rates in the EU-15. This impact can, however, differ across EU-15 countries and manufacturing sectors. Whilst Venables (2001) and Brulhart et al. (2004) do not look at variations within the broad manufacturing aggregate and Head and Mayer (2006) look only at the EU-15, this note presents a simulation of the impact of increased market access to the new member countries on EU-15 wages for different manufacturing industries and both old and new EU member countries (EU-15 plus Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and Poland). It is found that extended market access to the new EU member countries is likely to favour larger EU members and challenge smaller ones, although within the latter some sectors may have gains.",

By the same token, the share of crude oil and oil products amounted to around one-third of its total merchandise exports, holding more than half of its gross domestic products (GDP) in the preceding year. Empirical and theoretical studies generally find that oil price increases negatively affect the macroeconomic activities in net oil-importing countries through the supply-side (production cost) and demand-side (income transfer) channels (Hamilton 1983; Burbidge and Harrison 1984; Mork et al. 1994; Rotemberg and Woodford 1996; Finn 2000; Jiminez-Rodrgiuez and Sanchez 2005). However, given that Belarus imports crude oil from Russia at below world market prices, taking advantages of its geographical position as a transit country transporting crude oil (and natural gas) from Russia to the European Union, oil-price rises can be expected to bring windfall gains to the country. Yet, no studies have so far examined the relationship between oil price and macro-economy in Belarus using a time-series technique. The aim of this paper is to analyze empirically to what extent oil price shocks affect the Belarusian economy using a vector auto-regression (VAR) model. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. “Data and Methodology” provides the empirical framework, and “Results”  presents the empirical results. “Conclusions” concludes.",1

Today, sustainability has become an important macroeconomic issue and an integrated framework is generally used to analyse the complex relationships between the environment, the economy and society. However, the theme of Sustainability has a long history and during the last few decades, many approaches have been proposed and pluralities of paradigm have been considered. Since the 1950s, the sustainability approach was based on “development” and “quality of life” (Truman 1949). Pollution, resource depletion and population growth became important issues relating to human well-being. In 1987, the World Commission on Environment and Development articulated the concept of sustainable development: “It is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (WCED 1987: 43). Based on efficiency gains and improvement in technology, it considers economic growth as the best way to resolve both environmental problems and distributional conflicts: “The concept of sustainable development does imply limits, not absolute limits but limitations imposed by the present state of technology and social organisation on environmental resources and by the ability of the biosphere to absorb the effects of human activities. But technology and social organisation can be both managed and improved to make way of a new era of economic growth” (WCED 1987: 8). Today many criticisms to this approach exist. The growing disparities between rich and poor countries and the impossibility of increasing efficiency and reducing consumption, according to the Rebound Effect (Greening et al. 2000), are some of the most important criticisms. At the same time, criticisms seem to translate the general principles of sustainability into operational analysis. Today a multitude of indicators exist and others can be proposed for every theoretical approach (Martinez-Alier 2004). Ecological footprints (Rees and Wackernagel 1994), IPAT (Ehrlich and Holdren 1971), MEW (Nordhaus and Tobin 1972) or ISEW (Daly and Cobb 1989) are some examples. Adopting an economic or ecological point of view, they translate the general principles of sustainability into operational definitions but, reducing economic welfare, environmental quality and social coherence into a single numerical value, they fail to consider the sustainability of complexity (Lopez-Ridaura et al. 2002). In quantitative measurements, disciplinary focus is adopted and a gerarchical level and misjudgements of equity exists (Mauerhofer 2007). At present the sustainability of an economy cannot be assessed with one indicator and several of them need to be considered (Munda 2005). In this context a new sustainability approach has been proposed: the Biophysical approach. Based on thermodynamic laws it considers that an economic system should have an optimal scale relative to the total ecosystems. It considers that ecological pressures and physical flows of energy and matter are important variables in the estimate of sustainability. Given that sustainability is a complex issue, a plurality of indicators should be used and the ecological dimensions of societies should be one of them (Munda 2005). Moreover, since sustainability has become an important macroeconomic issue, the total dimension of economy should be considered. In this paper, Material Flows Accounting (MFA) is presented as a biophysical indicator of macroeconomic sustainability. Based on a mass balance principle, it provides information about human and environmental considerations. By quantifying the physical dimension of economies, it allows us to compare between nations, analysing the sustainability improvement. The paper is structured as follows: in “The Biophysical Approach”, the theoretical framework of MFA is presented. “The Material Flows Accounting Methodology” describes the MFA methodology and in “The Italian Case Study” I consider the MFA of Italy in order to analyse the material input of the Italian economy. “Conclusion” offers a conclusion and argues that MFA, by quantifying the physical dimension of economies, is an important method for macroeconomic sustainability analysis.",

Moreover, these changes have encouraged liberalisation and privatisation. Consequently, there have been deep transformations in the reference frameworks, rules and motivations for service supply. Today, a large number of actors are involved in local public utility planning, making rules, providing financial support, supplying and controlling services. In various ways they contribute to define reference values, service concept, target users, supply mechanisms and image (Normann 1984). It should also be noted that the supply of public services takes place in a specific context. Services are not supplied in a true market system in which competition for customers among a number of firms is based on their price/quality policy. Rather, competition in public service supply is limited to the tendering stage. Once the contract has been awarded, service suppliers have exclusive, multiannual rights and operate according to specific, predefined rules. This probably is the main reason for the continuous increase in the number of control bodies, whose main role is to supervise public utilities activities to ensure that the regulations protecting citizens as consumers are applied. However, there is always the danger that, though controls may be carried out diligently and correctly, they would not produce the desired effect. This outcome may be the consequence of general factors related to control bodies (e.g. the choice of instruments and the use of control results), but it may also be the result of unrelated factors such as system relationships (e.g. incomplete or incoherent regulation, inappropriate interdependence between controllers and the controlled, and the erosion of control processes). The aim of this paper is to define and classify the above-mentioned risks by analysing international literature of the last 5 years and carrying out empirical observation. Finally, some guidelines will be suggested to help reconsider the control function.",

With 600 million people living in cities and metropolitan areas, China is the largest urban nation in the world (see Footnote 1). Economic analysis has repeatedly identified the economic benefits of urbanization (the so-called “agglomeration economies”). Cities are generators of wealth, employment and productivity growth, so that they are often considered the engines of their national economies. As globalization progresses, cities increasingly compete with one another to attract innovative investments and knowledge activities. That is why the pursuit of competitiveness in urban regions has become a major local and national policy objective. The urban transformation that is now underway raises, however, several problems: first, the question of environmental sustainability. This is a typical negative externality and the consequence of current consumption and living habits, which lead to an overuse of natural resources, ecosystem destruction and over-dwelling; second, inequalities and threats to social cohesion, due to inadequate and insecure housing and services, limited access to employment opportunities and income, in particular in suburban areas, where the slums growth rate is higher than in the general urban context (Véron 2006). Addressing such issues requires appropriate metropolitan governance. The aim of this paper is to identify its main features, according to a governance model. First of all, some preliminary definitions will briefly be presented. Secondly, the principles on which a good governance model should be based will be introduced. Particular attention will be given to the case of China, where the deregulation process, currently underway, has triggered a decentralization phenomenon, which gives urban areas much more autonomy and responsibility. Thirdly, the proposed model will be applied to urban water management. In the end, attention will be focused on the role of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in the implementation of metropolitan governance.",2

The fuel mix is dominated by fossil fuels, both for primary energy supply and for power generation (heat and electricity). For our scope, we only refer to the worldwide value, knowing that the data we are using may be very different on a regional scale. More specific data can be found in the EIAFootnote 1 and IAEAFootnote 2 reference (IAEA 2006; IEA 2008; IEA 2009). IEA has developed some projections of growth of Energy needs and supply, taking into account population growth, energy costs, and economic growth (IEA 2008). We will use two of these scenarios to develop our considerations (Reference Scenario, Rs; Alternative Policy Scenario, APs). Both the Reference and Alternative Policy scenario projections are based on conservative assumptions about economic growth in India and China. Globally, fossil fuels continue to dominate the fuel mix. The Rs assumes that there are no new, strong energy-policy interventions by governments. This scenario is intended to provide a baseline vision of how global energy markets are likely to evolve if governments do nothing more to affect underlying trends in energy demand and supply, thereby allowing to test alternative assumptions about future government policies (Fig. 1). The world’s primary energy needs in the Rs are projected to grow by 55% between 2005 and 2030, at an average annual rate of 1.8% per year. Demand reaches 17.7 toe (billion tons) of oil equivalent, compared with 11.4 billion toe in 2005. Fossil fuels remain the dominant source of primary energy, accounting for 84% of the overall increase in global demand between 2005 and 2030. Electricity use doubles, its share of final energy consumption rising from 17 to 22%. IEA considers the nuclear option just for electricity production, although it can be used for hydrogen production (thermochemical water splitting), extraction of non-conventional fossil fuels, cogeneration, desalination and district heating with excellent resultsFootnote 3. World primary energy supply in Rs. Other renewables comprises wind, tide and wave, solar, geothermal Nuclear power supply worldwide is projected to grow slowly over the projection period in the Reference scenario, from 2771 TWh in 2005–3275 TWh in 2030. This is an average annual growth rate of 0.7%, compared with 2.7% per year for total electricity generation. Installed capacity increases from about 370–415 GW. The most significant increases occur in China, Japan, India, Russia, the United States and Korea, with 83% coming from China and India alone. Because of the adopted assumption that existing policies continue unchanged, nuclear capacity in OECD-Europe falls from 131 to 74 GW—in large part due to phase-out policies in Germany, Sweden and Belgium, which result in the closure of all nuclear power plants in these three countries before 2030. The new plants in Italy recently scheduled are not yet taken into account. Very recent evolutions show interest in nuclear options in some countries. The APs analyses the impact on global energy markets of a package of additional measures to address energy-security and climate-change concerns. In APs, global primary energy demand in 2030 reaches 15,783 Mtoe, 11% less than in the Rs (lower fossil-energy consumption, resulting from the introduction of more efficient technologies, accounts for most of the energy savings in this scenario). Global energy-related CO2 emissions are 19% lower in 2030 than in the Rs, 27% higher than in 2005. Nuclear energy grows more than twice as fast as in the Rs: it is 27% higher in 2030.",

Not only because the sun is a cheap and renewable source of energy, but also because it is changing dramatically the concept of energy production from big power plants made by national governments or big companies to small production units affordable by single citizens. Since its first development, solar power has faced a progressive growth and it is quickly becoming an important item in today’s energy market. A wide spectrum of applications is offered by photovoltaic, from big power plants for factory centers down to mobile phones and electronic devices. This flexibility is a strength that photovoltaics does not share with any other energy source. Moreover, solar power allows the energy to be produced very close to the consumer, factually reducing transmission and storage costs, and reducing also the energy dispersion typical of these processes. Finally, solar power has a very low environmental impact, it does not pollute air and most of the panels can be directly recycled, not considering that it is a pretty safe technology which does not produce dangerous waste, such as nuclear plants. The photovoltaic, born in the middle of the 20th century, has evolved since then following market and technological advancements. The first attempt to commercialize solar cells was made using the so-called first generation solar cells, the conventional mono or poly-crystalline silicon based cells. The first application, due to the cost of making high pure silicon crystals, was in space exploration. Since then first generation solar modules have found applications in everyday life and are even today the most common solar cells. The diffusion of this technology has in recent years, using grid-connected photovoltaic systems, exceeded 280–300 MW. Despite these achievements, the main weakness of solar cell, the cost of high pure silicon, is still present and there is room for improvement, especially in the perspective of a reduction in the cost per watt of solar-electricity. There are very few chances that the production cost for silicon wafers could be further reduced. Moreover, there is an intrinsic limit to the maximum efficiency that silicon can achieve, principally due to its nature as indirect band-gap semiconductor which traduces to thick active layer of silicon to fully harvest sunlight (this limit is related to thermodynamic and energy conversion efficiency of the device, it is called the Queisser–Schokley limitFootnote 1 and it is of 33% efficiency for a single junction silicon cell). That is the reason why, since the late 1970s, research has moved in new directions and to new materials. This big effort produced the so-called second generation solar cells. The new concept was based on using new cheap materials, with direct band-gap, which allows reaching high efficiencies using thin layer of material. Examples of these materials are amorphous silicon (a-Si:H), Copper Indium Gallium (di) Selenide (CIGS), Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) and Copper Indium Selenide (CIS)Footnote 2. This new concept is currently a growing market. An emerging sector of research, nanotechnology, which is the skill of engineering at the nanoscale, is raising interest in the photovoltaic field. The interest is twofold: finding new smart materials which can increase efficiency with low production cost. Organic materials, such as polymers or single molecules, engineered at the nanometric scale, that is one billionth of a meter, could replace expensive semiconductors, especially due to their abundance and flexibility. Organic solar cells make the third generation and their technology is very close to maturity and to be commercialized. The technological limits of reliability and performance, however, should still face markets and policies that can support or oppose their development and diffusion.",6

Secondly, different types of regionalization are useful to understand the relation among States and their perspectives, approaches and future developments in this field. Finally, the actual “macro-regions” in the world allow a new analysis, in comparative terms, regarding the process of transition to development of many countries, due to the possible economic advantages and the historical and cultural homogeneity. Through three different examples, we will analyze how the use of the regional proximity factor has become a positive or a negative tool in the transition process of some countries in the world.",

The incidence of poverty is higher in terms of economic development growth, social standards, infrastructure, environment, and openness of the regions to other cultures. Most of the poor regions should be eco-protected. We are marching towards the development of these regions, but not at the cost of environmental degradations through industrialization or chemical damage. Keeping in mind the theories described above, the importance of our core study acquires a significant policy challenge. The strategy suggested here focuses on the process of incentives to the less developed regions towards urban and more developed regions, through a reliable framework of cooperation and strategic model. The new improvements put together a multidimensional approach that tries to take advantage from local and interregional cooperation, not only between less developed countries but also between their developed counterparts. For example, the conflict between eco-protection and poverty elimination has always been an unsolved problem in many countries and regions; especially for those less-developed ecological protected regions which have to pay extra attention to coordinating the relation between poverty elimination and ecological protection.",

Harmonization can be seen as a step towards the unification of law that seems more difficult, if not impossible, or even unnecessary to be achieved.Footnote 2
 We should also consider that the difficulties in reaching harmonization as well as the speed of the process and the intensity of the efforts are not equal among the different fields of private law. On one side we have the obligations-contract law and, generally speaking, the commercial law; on the other we have family law and property law. The reasons behind these differences are to be found, first, in the not uniform balance and weight of the influence of each Country’s political-economical institutions and cultural-historical traditions and, second, in the fact that the needs of harmonization emerging from the society do not have the same intensity in all the fields.Footnote 3

Section two will show that a study of working of strains of this model (its novelty lending to its limited applicability) in two states of India—functioning of local governance in Karnataka and the Joint Forest Management scheme in Chhattisgarh—have however thrown up puzzling queries not only about the functioning of this model but also on the manner in which we conceive of institutional design itself. The shift from government to governance parallels the ideological shift from state to market in India. Since the legitimacy of the state as a service provider is called into question, there is a search for local diversity, an appropriate ‘institutional mix’ in engendering democratic governance. However, weak states are the source of many of the world’s most acute problems, most prominently poverty. The role of the state, therefore, cannot be put in the same framework as that espoused by the neoliberals. Through an analysis of emerging trends in governance in India, I argue that there is no such thing as an optimal formal political institution; full specification of a good set of institutions will be highly context-dependent, will change over time, and will interact with informal norms, values and traditions of the society in which they are embedded. Using the conceptual-analytical framework of Judith Tendler’s and Peter Evans’ State-Society Synergy approach and Francis Fukuyama’s State building model, I show that knotting the two in the form of the Strong State Society Synergistic model could provide a very fascinating dimension to understanding governance. Moving along the path that led to the creation of this model, I examine three broad trends in streamlining governance to deliver the desired developmental outcomes. The first is the multi-stakeholder partnership of the state, the market and the civil society in alleviating poverty and the lead proponents of this school would be institutions like the World Bank (Multi-stakeholder model). The next trajectory is the State-Society Synergy approach that is predicated on building norms of trust and networks of civic engagement between the state and the community in engendering the desired developmental outcomes. This way of thinking about governance would benefit from the views of Peter Evans and Judith Tendler among others (Synergistic model). And finally a path that gains succour from the developments of the post Washington Consensus—one that argues for strengthening the state’s institutional capacity and questions the neoliberals’ insistence on shelving of the state—forms the third way of conceiving of institutional design (State building model). That institutions like the state matter in the present liberalized era undergirds much of the thinking on this model. Francis Fukuyama’s tenaciously argued case for state building structures the way this model is constructed. The following section will attempt to examine the viability of these three models in alleviating the lot of the poor in India. The study will then glean towards building up the case for a Strong State Society Synergy approach to help in extenuating indigence in India.",

Enlargement prospects together with deepening relations with other European countries provide even wider dimensions to that reality. Meanwhile, we are witnessing a growing awareness in large parts of the political and academic world and in public opinion of the need to establish a more complete and far-reaching Europe, in particular building upon and strengthening its intellectual, cultural, social and scientific and technological dimensions. A Europe of Knowledge is now widely recognized as an irreplaceable factor for social and human growth and as an indispensable component to consolidate and the European citizenship, capable of giving its citizens the necessary competences to face the challenges of the new millennium, together with an awareness of shared values and belonging to a common social and cultural space. The importance of education and educational co-operation in the development and strengthening of stable, peaceful and democratic societies is universally acknowledged as paramount. According to the law on higher education, one of the main priorities of the state policy is to assure academic freedom of study and research, provide and develop the necessary conditions for research, and bring the Georgian research system into line with European standards. Moreover, the law on higher education underlines the primary significance of the research within HEIs. The Academic Board of a HEI is entitled to approve the research programmes and determines the rules of evaluation of a research work. The law stipulates that funds for conducting a master and doctoral degree research will be taken from the state research fund on a competitive basis and in view of priorities determined by the Ministry of Education and Science of Georgia. Until now the basic factors facilitating mobility of teachers and staff have been the grant schemes supported by a number of international organizations. Currently the law stipulates that international cooperation and mobility of teachers is the basic precondition for ensuring high quality at HEIs. The ongoing reform envisages attaching great importance to constant professional development of teachers and staff; therefore, their participation in mobility schemes shall be supported at a state level. In Georgia everyone has a right to get free education in any state HEI regardless of gender, race, nationality, social and economic status, type and nature of activities, world views, belonging to parties, attitude towards religion, religious conscience, state of health, place of residence and other circumstances.

This paper seeks to provide a critical evaluation of public private partnerships and their ability to efficiently increase the level of public investment. It is often recognized that the rate of public investment declined in many industrialised countries from the 1970s though with some recovery in the past decade or so. Kamps (2006), for example, presents graphically information on public investment relative to GDP for 22 OECD countries over the period 1960–2000 with the vast majority of countries displaying downward trends and he estimates that the government net capital stock declined on (unweighted) average in those countries from 57.8% of GDP in 1980 to 55.3% in 1990 and 51.4% by 2000. This general decline has often been attributed to the relative ease of cutting public investment expenditure (as compared with current expenditure) when government budgets are under pressure. ‘Government budgets have come under pressure, and with that development have come two responses. One has been a desire to reduce the impact of infrastructure spending on government budgets, both as a means of minimizing government borrowing and as a way of protecting economically necessary but politically dispensable infrastructure expenditure from general budgetary pressures. The other response has seen governments turn to private capital markets for infrastructure funding’ (Grimsey and Lewis 2004, p. 30). The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (2001) remarked, with specific reference to South Eastern Europe, that infrastructure ‘is characterised as being outdated, inadequate to support economic growth, expensive to maintain and having regional imbalances. In light of restricted and shortfalls in public sector budgets, governments in the region have recently started to consider whether public private partnerships (PPPs) can be effective complement to financing infrastructure projects. This interest is primarily motivated by a desire to finance infrastructure projects off budget’ (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development 2001, p. 1). The perceived role of PPPs in some forms of public investment is indicated by the EIB (2008) when they write that ‘public private partnerships (PPPs) are gaining importance as vehicles to finance much-needed public infrastructure across Europe, accounting for well over EUR 200 bn of investment to date. Over the coming 5 years, in excess of EUR 100 bn will be invested in transport, health, education, environmental and other public investment projects through PPP transactions.’ The majority of the EIB-financed projects come from the transport sector to the extent of 80%. ‘The UK accounts around one-third of the EIB’s PPP project portfolio, with Spain, Portugal and Greece each approximately 15%. France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Turkey have ambitious programmes to increase the proportion of public investment financed by PPP and the EIB’s lending to PPPs in these countries is expected to increase in the future.’ (EIB 2008). It is debatable whether an investment project with subsequent operation by a private sector company but which is (at least part) funded by a public sector organisation such as the EIB should be regarded as a full public private partnership since funds are raised by a public body rather than by the private contractor. It does though retain the feature of provision of services by private sector company involved in the construction of the project, and the raising for funds by the EIB does not appear on the balance sheets of national governments. This is reflected in the following: ‘Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Vince Cable, who argues that the increased use of public funds undermines the purpose of the scheme, which was to access private sector loans and the disciplines in procurement and funding that go with them. … The increasing participation of the Treasury and taxpayer-backed institutions such as the European Investment Bank (EIB), Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and Lloyds Banking Group in PFI schemes highlights the circularity of the process’ (Milma et al. 2009). This paper provides an evaluation of a number of key arguments which have been advanced to the effect that public private partnerships (PPPs) would be an effective means of providing additional public investment. It also considers whether PPP is a more costly alternative than ‘conventional’ public investment, which is related to the question as to the overall impact of the use of PPP on the time profile of public expenditure and budget deficits. It then begins to consider whether PPP would be an effective way on supporting public investment in the new member countries (NMS) that is the countries joining the European Union in and after 2004.",2

Against this background, it is natural to look at the comparison between private and public financing in the provision of road infrastructure in terms of the likely size of this divergence. The post Keynesian approach in general (Eichner and Kregel 1975), and its monetary variant of the circuit, as developed notably by Parguez (1975, 1996, 2001) and Graziani (2003), can be used for the analysis of public investment policies in such disequilibrium context (Cingolani 2009, pp 6–15). In particular, the analysis of the monetary circuit is well suited to examine PPP, because it integrates the banking sector, the State sector, and the private sector, disaggregated into consumers (or users) and producers. Moreover, the circuit definition of money allows to discuss PPP in situations that under neo-classical modelling would be qualified as disequilibria, for instance where marginal distribution relations do not hold (factor prices are different from marginal productivities in real terms), and hence profits are different from zero, or when the productive capacity and/or the labour force are not fully employed.Footnote 1
 To discuss the effects of public and private provision of infrastructure it is indeed necessary to have a model with at least the two sectors distinguished. Furthermore, the case of real tolls cannot be analyzed separately from that of the shadow tolls and availability payments if the private sector is not further subdivided between enterprises and households and is distinguished from the State sector. Finally, to examine issues relating to financing, it is necessary also to break down enterprises between non-financial (corporates) and financial (banks) and introduce money, distinguishing between money creation by the State and money creation by the commercial banking sector. The model of the monetary circuit is built around the above mentioned distinctions. Money is defined as a liability issued by a third party (banking sector and/or State) that is used by the other parties (producers and consumers) as a mean of payment. Hence the model requires from the very start to have at least three sectors distinguished: producers, consumers and banks.Footnote 2 The working of the circuit can be illustrated fully with these three sectors without introducing the State, demonstrating that a monetary economy can integrate both outside money, created by the State, and inside money, created by the private commercial banking sector. “The Conceptual Framework” presents the general conceptual framework, focusing on Kalecki’s identity. “Money Creation and Mobilization of Existing Savings in an Accounting Model of the Circuit” further develops the analysis of PPP through an accounting model of the circuit that illustrates the effects of various combinations of private, public and mixed financing under different forms of PPP. This discussion underlines the causal role played by the exogenous expectations of producers in determining the level of effective demand and the corresponding monetary equilibria of the circuit. “Expected Profits: Equilibrium and Disequilibrium” discusses the microeconomic factors likely to shape the formation of these expectations and discusses their welfare implications in terms of a breakdown of the monetary demand projection in its price and volume components. “Summary and Conclusions” summarizes the argument and draws some policy conclusions from the analysis.",2

How this proper use is important and how it may change the results of CBA will be exemplified through two themes of special relevance to transition countries. They are presented in the case of transport, but their consequences are more general and apply to many other situations, as it will be easily acknowledged. The first issue is related to the proper account of competition situations. In many investment schemes it is often assumed that the cost saving provided by the new infrastructure scheme is integrally passed onto the consumer. This assumption would be true if in fact the downstream market was a perfect competition market, but it is rarely the case. In modes such as rail or air transport, liberalisation leads to imperfect competition where a few competitors act according to strategic behaviours, far from the conditions of equality between prices and marginal costs which is generally assumed. How large is the error? This is the first point to be explored. Another issue is related to conflicts between long and short term issues, exemplified by the case of global warming. In the current CBA analyses, the relative prices do not change much over the time span of the CBA, which rarely goes beyond 50 years and in the usual practice remains around 30 years; after that period rather arbitrary assumptions are made; for instance it is assumed that the world will be stationary, or a residual value is introduced, the value of which is rather arbitrary. This practice is innocuous when the relative changes in the far future are not important, but it fails to grasp important consequences when it is not the case and when the duration of the investment is much longer than the time span of the CBA. For instance, the current CBA of transport schemes do not give a significant weight to the long term environmental effects and especially to the GHGFootnote 1 consequences; the macroeconomic debates and arguments on this subject have no correspondence in micro-economic calculus. Extending the time span and taking due allowance to relative price changes in the long term may help to reconcile these two streams. This work aims at contributing to cast light on these issues will address the question of relative prices changes in the far future.",1

In addition, both cultural and geographical distance appear to have great impacts on international strategic management (Perlmutter 1969; Perlmutter and Heenan 1974; Hofstede 1980; Kogut and Singh, 1988; Barkema et al. 1996; Roth and O’Donnel 1996; Tihanyi et al. 2005; Quer et al. 2007; Jaussaud and Schaaper 2006, 2007). In this context, cultural distance refers to differences in national cultures between the countries in which multinational firms choose to operate. When cultural differences increase, transaction costs and operating costs also may increase, which likely affects the performance of multinational firms (Gomez-Meijia and Palich 1997), as well as the very survival of joint ventures (Li 1995; Park and Ungson 1997; Meschi and Riccio 2008. Yet to the best of our knowledge, the effect of distance, whether cultural or geographical, remains uncertain. Existing tests provide contradictory empirical results (Brouthers and Brouthers 2001; Shenkar 2001; Tihanyi et al. 2005; Slangen and Tulder 2009). Perhaps systematic empirical investigations of this question are not available because the cultural distance construct itself might not be able to capture differences across cultures (Shenkar 2001). Another reason might be the difficulty of collecting significant and reliable data to test the effect of cultural distance on international management decisions and practices. We have collected data to address these concerns. Specifically, to investigate the various potential determinants of international strategies of firms, we have drawn a sample of 759 Japanese subsidiaries worldwide from the Kaigai Shinshutsu Kigyô Sôran database (Tôyô Keizai 2004). With this unique data set, we can focus on a crucial question: Is cultural distance a major determinant of the international strategies of firms? We structure the rest of this article as follows: first, we review related theoretical and empirical literature and design a set of hypotheses to confirm the well-established effect of risk, as well as the poorly understood effect of distance. Second, we describe our methodology and data collection. Third, in presenting the results and discussion, we underline the ambiguous effect of distance (both cultural and geographic) on internationalization strategies, compared with the effect of risk. International management literature has paid close attention to three crucial issues: (1) the nature of the subsidiaries that firms establish abroad, whether wholly foreign owned or international equity joint ventures; (2) expatriation policies, which provide a main control mechanism over activities abroad; and (3) the combination of a wide range of control instruments that may be implemented in overseas subsidiaries. Taking in account the nature of our data, our contribution focuses on the two former issues. That is, we consider both the nature of the subsidiaries—whether joint ventures (JVs) or wholly owned subsidiaries (WOS)—and firms’ expatriation policies, as we summarize in Fig. 1. Conceptual model Establishing a subsidiary in an unknown market is neither an easy nor a riskless task (Abdellatif et al. 2010). Facing such challenges, many firms set up international joint ventures with local partners to benefit from those local partners’ experience and expertise in the local environment, as well as their ability to access various resources (e.g., distributors, local suppliers, state agencies, human resources). Although they lack these benefits, wholly foreign owned subsidiaries are easier to control and facilitate decision-making processes, because the company does not have to consider the local partner. As soon as they can, according to national regulations, and have enough experience in a country, many firms avoid JVs and develop new activities through WOSs. The development of multinational companies (MNCs) in China represents a clear illustration (Beamish 1993; Jaussaud and Schaaper 2006, 2007). Yet firms still resort more to JVs when the risk level increases. Involving a local partner in a JV offers a good way to manage high country risk (Beamish 1985; Kogut 1988; Abdellatif 2007), such as that related to the foreign environment (i.e., country risk) or high levels of information asymmetry between trading partners. With a focus on country risk, we propose: H1: Country risk levels influence a firm’s international strategies. The influence of country risk level on the kind of subsidiaries that firms set up abroad extends not just to WOSs versus JVs but also to the type of JVs, such as whether the firm holds a majority or minority share of capital (Beamish 1985; Kogut 1988; Abdellatif 2007). Therefore, we further specify: H1a: Country risk levels influence the nature of the subsidiaries that a firm establishes abroad. In Japan, Sôgô Shôsha, which refer to general trading companies such as Mitsubishi Corp., Mitsui & Co., and Itochu, often provide the capital and staff to establish subsidiaries abroad. This provision also reduces risk, because it provides experience and a network of relationships in the host country, particularly in risky areas (Miyashita and Russel 1994; Jaussaud 1999; Abdellatif 2006). Sôgô Shôsha help reduce, through their networks and experience in the host country, the level of information asymmetry between trading partners. Therefore, we also assert: H1b: Country risk levels influence the tendency of Japanese firms to engage in Sôgô Shôsha.",6

Bruna Zolin,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Whereas during the period spanning over the years 1974–2005, food prices on world markets fell by three-quarters in real terms, the sudden increase of food prices since 2005 seems to have started a new era of ‘agflation’. Although the changing food patterns in large emerging economies such as China and India and the increased land requirements for growing non-food crops aimed at the transport sector in developed economies explain part of this increase, the speculation in physical commodities market (such as corn, coffee, cocoa and wheat) may also have a role to play. The diminishing arbitrage prospects by investors in the currency markets, combined with the credit crunch and the housing crash, have caused a flight to food and energy commodities. According to FAO sources (FAO 2009), the food price index of internationally traded basic food commodities (base 100 in 2002–2004) fell a full 35 per cent between the peak in June 2008, to the end of April 2009. In May 2009, the index was 152.70 percent higher than the 2000 level. Because of the interaction between demand and supply, agricultural prices tend to be volatile and the activity of speculators can amplify these fluctuations. Agricultural products consist usually of basic food, and they represent the main component of rural incomes as well as the diet of poor segments of populations in developing countries. This means that high food prices hit primarily poor consumers, and that low agricultural prices hit poor farmers. The objective of this article is therefore to provide an analysis of the relationship existing between cereal prices and several variables such as population, income, exports, the exchange rate, and speculation, by using a linear regression analysis (see Section “Results–Explanatory Factors of Cereal Price Changes”). Specific emphasis will be placed on the speculative (or arbitrage) dimension in cereals markets (see Section “Speculation”). The time period covers the years June 2001–December 2009 and the analysis encompasses four major commodities, namely corn, rice, wheat and barley. The methodology used helps us explore the forms of the relationships between the different variables, and, more specifically, it gives an insight into the extent of speculation during this critical time period. The analysis will conclude with policy recommendations in the area of agricultural and commodity markets (see Section “Concluding remarks”). Beforehand, a few insights into the main demand and supply explanatory factors of agricultural commodity (cereals) prices will be scrutinized (see Section “Demand and supply drivers”).",3

The first is Bancor, the international currency based on 30 representative commodities proposed by J.M. Keynes; the second is the Special Drawing Right, the currency basket created in 1969 by the IMF to reform the international system of payments. The former failed to be adopted in the 1940s; the latter has remained a currency basket of limited use in the provision of official reserves. As a result, sovereign currencies still dominate official reserve holdings. The pressure coming from the events that started in 2007 proved the assertion that the problem with a sovereign currency is the conflict between domestic policy goals and troubles in the issuing country and the goals of the rest of the world’s countries using it as a reserve instrument and possibly as a nominal anchor. The Federal Reserve and the US Treasury implemented extraordinary expansionary policies from 2007 on and triggered similar initiatives everywhere. The ECB did much the same from 2008 to June 2010. The PBC reverted to a fixed peg in July 2008 which lasted two years. In June 2010 it is still too early to say whether the global crisis is really over, and whether the exit from the resulting extraordinary monetary expansion and the crisis of the euro might unwind existing international arbitrage flows of liquidity and thus dramatically increase instability in exchange rates. The extraordinary monetary expansion pursued everywhere and the risk of disruption in the existing pattern of exchange rates are increasingly believed to impair the role of the US dollar, the euro and any other national currency as a reserve currency. Adverse exchange rate movements would inevitably have an impact on the economy and on the primary objective of the central bank in all countries. The crisis and its consequences, therefore, have rekindled the old idea that the international system of payments is in need of a true reserve currency, i.e. an international currency effectively disconnected from domestic contingencies. Central banks, indeed, are reported to have made a U-turn in their attitude to gold and to be giving the metal a bigger asset role worldwide. The paper starts with a condensed narrative of the recent skirmishes between the four major currencies and aims to offer a few hints on how the swings reflect national interests and problems.",

A key to fostering the emergence of a harmonious society, as articulated by the current Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leadership, is increasing domestic consumption which in turn will help to absorb more products of local manufacturing, in the wake of American and EU trading deficits incurred because of burgeoning Chinese exports. In fact, China’s economic planners must balance a number of domestic and global priorities. China has often been referred to as the workshop of the world, producing cheap exports, and yet, induced by recent labour legislation, wage costs are rising, contributing to inflationary pressures. Higher labour and raw material costs may reduce the attractiveness of Chinese exports but economic growth, a factor in overheating, is a prerequisite for increased domestic consumption. Inflation, running at 6.9% in 2007, has been addressed by the Central Bank through six interest rate rises, taking the 1 year benchmark lending rate to 7.47% in 2007 (Sheridan 2007c). These measures will likely be reflected in lower growth, with the World Bank estimating that China’s growth will fall to 9.8% in 2008, contrasting with the double figure increase of recent years (Sheridan 2008). Higher interest rates will no doubt encourage savers and China already has a high personal savings rate but it is not intended that this be at the expense of domestic consumption. In addition, China is not yet a nationwide market and there are as yet barriers to its emergence. The country’s post-1978 economic reforms, especially the encouragement of foreign direct investment (FDI), have brought personal income and regional inequalities; the Southeastern seaboard has attracted manufacturing, in turn enhancing personal wealth, while the central and western regions, rich in natural resources but poorer in infrastructure, have lagged behind. According to China’s 2006 Statistical Yearbook, disposable income in that year was 18,645 yuan in Shanghai, but only 7,990 in Xinjiang (China Business Review 2007). A countervailing force, however, has been rising wages in the East, causing manufacturers, particularly in the textile industry, to relocate to the West. In turn, more balanced economic growth and personal consumption across China demand diversified locational production and rising personal incomes. Additionally, China’s distribution system may be seen as both cause and effect of economic inequality. Prior to reform distribution was state controlled and has been the last sector to be opened to domestic private and foreign investment. In tandem with globalization the creation of production bases in central and western China has served to highlight the legacy of state control: poor infrastructure and the paucity of logistical services. Manufacturers face challenges to competitiveness because of logistical and supply chain difficulties in the western region. The China Daily, for instance, reported that China spent a percentage of GDP on logistics double that expended by developed countries. Cargo costs were three times higher (Gezen 2005). For many commodities logistical costs in China have been 40–50% higher than they would be in the United States (Bolton and Wei 2003). China’s accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) and conditions of membership have since 2004 permitted wholly owned foreign companies participation in distribution, including logistics, their passage into the sector being facilitated by MOFCOM permitting in 2006 provincial level governments to approve licences for foreign invested commercial enterprises (FICEs). Simultaneously, however, foreign investors in distribution are being challenged by Chinese private as well as state firms, as the sector has been further reformed. Nevertheless, significantly, a barrier to more efficient nationwide distribution is the emergence of local and regional distribution systems, offering potential for provincial particularism, even if, as stated above, such authorities may also approve licences for foreign firms (Bolton and Wei 2003; Bassolino and Leow 2006). Foregoing paragraphs have focused on the question of establishing a nationwide distribution system which in turn requires a concomitant improved transportation infrastructure. The latter, however, is not only a priority for internal movement but impacts on China’s role as a major foreign trading power. Thus emphasis is placed on, for instance, inter-modal container transport, linking the railway, waterway, road and airline sectors. This is crucial for the passage of goods both by sea and across land. Ports like Shanghai access global trade; the development of transportation in Western China is pertinent to the Asia-Europe land bridge, through which may pass the energy and mineral resources to satisfy the insatiable demands of China’s industries. So far concern has been implicitly with freight movement in the Chinese national context. But the greater labour mobility and resulting rural–urban migration occasioned by reform have brought a new urbanization strategy to the fore. A growing population and consequent urban congestion demand improved road and rail transport networks within cities. Needless to say, environmental protection will need to be factored into transportation policy. The above are the concerns of this paper, with the next section discussing the objective of creating a comprehensive transportation infrastructure.",2
17,4,Transition Studies Review,25 June 2010,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-010-0176-9,Growth Patterns in the CIS-8: A Political Economy Approach,December 2010,Alexander Salhi,Andreas Kern,Martin Rößler,Male,Male,Male,Male,"The end of the Soviet Union led to a severe breakdown of the economies in the Caspian region. The massive fall in output, wide-ranging political conflict and social unrest shaped the policy agenda in the region. Nevertheless, these countries managed to successfully implement so called ‘first-round-reforms’ to control inflation and stabilize basic macroeconomic indicators. Given unfavourable initial conditions, the CIS-8Footnote 1 achieved reasonable GDP per capita growth rates. However, high remittances, resource earnings and international aid on the one hand, and low domestic savings and investment rates on the other, point to largely demand-driven growth. This creates the danger of inflation and a divergence of productivity and real GDP growth, putting sustainable development at risk. In contrast to the Central Eastern European Countries (CEEC), the Caspian countries were completely integrated within the economic and political system of the Soviet Union for more than half a century. Due to this striking difference, the CIS-8 faced a fundamentally different situation in the aftermath of the Soviet breakdown. Although the CIS-8 countries gained formal political independence shortly after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1992, they were still deeply tied to the former economic system (Aslund 2001). In the former Soviet socialist system the CIS played a minor role in the unified and highly centralized Soviet economy. Being systemically dependent on the central planning organs within the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA), the production system was widely operational and beyond the control of the highest decision-making authorities of member states and their council of ministers. Furthermore, the structure of the Soviet economic system was built on the creation of economies of scale, concentrated in industrial production. This in turn led to the establishment an economic structure based on extreme mutual dependency on intra-Soviet trade (Kornai 1992). As a result, exports and imports within the Soviet Union represented a large share of the GDP of these countries. Due to this integration in a centrally planned production process, the production of intermediate goods formed the bulk of traded goods within highly interconnected state enterprises. After the suspension of the CMEA, the central coordination institutions of these production facilities had to be replaced and reorganized. Given the high level of regional interdependence, the dissolution of the CMEA can be understood as a large external shock accompanied by severe price adjustments, the abortion of fiscal transfers and the loss of export markets. As a direct result, per capita output in the CIS-8 countries collapsed dramatically, dropping to 50% of pre-transition levels in some countries (Campos and Coricelli 2002). Having already been characterized by a lower level of economic productivity and per capita income before the transition process had even begun, some of the CIS-8 countries slipped further backwards on the development ladder (Borensztein et al. 1999). Compared to other Former Soviet Union (FSU) states the initial situation was especially unfavorable: small market size, low levels of capital stocks, industrial output, labor productivity and wages as well as higher per unit labour costs. Furthermore, the Caspian countries had to cope with underdeveloped infrastructure and lower educated workforces (Aslund 2001). However, the recent growth recovery has been remarkable in almost all CIS-8 countries. On the one hand, resource-rich economies have experienced high growth rates, driven by increasing returns from natural resource exports. Although these capital inflows have been widely concentrated in the resource exploiting sectors, their overall effect on short run economic growth has been impressive. On the other hand, resource-poor economies, such as Armenia and more recently Georgia, have ambitiously tackled institutional weaknesses. These structural reform efforts have increased entrepreneurial confidence and consumption, leading to an upturn in overall economic activity in recent years (IMF 2007). We conjecture that as a result two different growth patterns among CIS-8 countries have emerged. On the one hand, in the more open economic and political systems, economic growth seems to be driven by institutional and political reform rather than rapid capital accumulation. In fact, we argue that political and institutional reforms have provided the basis for the emergence of more liberal market structures. This has lead to a more efficient allocation of existing resources reflected in substantial gains in overall economic efficiency in these economies, especially a higher TFP growth rate. On the other hand, we argue that the more politically constrained, resource-rich societies choose to ‘pump’ up the investment volume in capital-intense economic activities, triggering a so called ‘level effect’ of economic growth. These level effects appear impressive, but can not be expected to translate into sustainable growth in the long run. In particular, resource wealth will not last forever and demand an economic diversification strategy to avoid the fate of resource-rich monoeconomies. In order to test our hypothesis we apply a fixed effects estimation with heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation corrected (HAC) standard errors. In order to underpin our argument we will first draw on a simple growth accounting framework to describe the catch-up process evident in the CIS-8. Building on a brief review of the literature, we test our hypothesis concerning the effects of political openness and quality of governance, capturing overall political and institutional reforms on GDP per capita and TFP growth patterns in the region. In this respect, our findings indicate that political openness and the quality of governance have a first order impact on recent economic growth performance in terms of GDP per capita and TFP growth. To put it bluntly, our findings provide some empirical evidence that more open economies allow for a more efficient allocation of existing economic resources, translating into economic growth. Therefore, we conclude that the politically rather constrained resource-rich economies cannot reap the full benefits of their growth potential from the process of enhanced capital accumulation. Against the background of this empirical assessment, in the last section, we will derive some political implications arising from different growth patterns.",1

MNEs develop and invest into R&D activities mainly in economically most developed countries (UNCTAD 2005); nevertheless, their R&D activities are significantly increasing also in post-communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe since the mid 1990s. The attractiveness of these countries has considerably increased since their accession to the EU in 2004 (Cadil et al. 2007). The R&D investment of MNEs into these countries represented a new trend in the R&D internationalization in the 1990s. In the context of the Lisbon Agenda, the issue of large private companies R&D activities and their localisation in the EU member states as well as barriers of localisation and further development of R&D activities have become very important in the European, national and regional political agenda. Therefore, R&D investments of MNEs can be considered as an important development factor of R&D activities and innovation in host regions. MNEs can positively affect development of universities, or regional innovation systems; moreover, they can have a positive impact on regional development and local companies by spill-over effects. The issue of localisation motives is one of the key topics in attracting and motivating MNEs to establish or enhance their R&D activities abroad. It is evident that localisation motives differ depending on e.g. corporate strategies, the scope and nature of R&D activities or sectoral specialisation on one hand, and on the level of socio-economic development of particular regions on the other hand. Therefore, we can expect there to be significant differences among localisation motives between the old and new EU member regions. In the old regions, MNEs have been operating for a much longer time, and consequently they substantially have affected developments of regional innovation systems especially by establishing linkages with local R&D institutions, universities and local based companies. In contrast, the new member states have opened their markets relatively recently. Their innovation systems have only been in the phase of creation, since the old (communist and therefore directed) systems had been destroyed by the economic transition having brought, among others, privatisation of R&D institutions and closing of many enterprises. In addition to different localisation motives between the old and new member states it is possible to expect that decisions on R&D localization differ according to sectoral characteristics and regional specifics. R&D in each sector is specific in terms of its demand for R&D inputs, scope and infrastructure. At the same time, each region differs according to its economic performance and innovation potential. Therefore, we compare R&D decisions at two levels: at the regional and the industrial (company) level. This paper is based on the FP6 project LocoMotiveFootnote 1 coordinated by TuTech Hamburg, aimed at identification of R&D localisation motives of MNEs in selected European regions. The paper uses results of interviews with R&D managers in the most important innovative MNEs operating in the EU. The interviews were conducted in eight EU cohesion regions. Hamburg, Øresund, Catalonia, Oxfordshire, Midi-Pyréneés, Etelä-Suomi represented the old regions, while Prague with Central Bohemia and Közet-Magyarország were taken as examples of new innovative regions. The surveyed regions belong to developed regions characterised by the high innovation potential and localisation of important universities and companies’ research centres. We can thus analyze whether there are different localisation motives in regions with relatively high innovation potential. The comparison at the regional level is based on the assumption that each region can be characterised by its specific economic environment and innovation potential which significantly influence the location of specific economic activities, being it R&D, situating company headquarters, or assembly activities at the two very extremes. We compared locational motives in history and at present in order to find out differences in location motives and identify main changes in time. Then we analysed main barriers of R&D investment. The structure of the approach to this comparison at the sectoral level is similar to the above description. First, the three most important industries for the interviewed companies were selected—ICT, chemistry/pharmaceutics and electrical engineering which also belong to the most important industries of the manufacturing sector at the EU level. Then, we analysed and compared historical and present localisation motives and barriers in each of the chosen sector and identified main similarities and differences in the old and new EU member regions.",

Politicians of many developed countries are committing to binding limits on emitted CO2 to slow down the whole process. As a consequence, companies have to adjust to new rules of game in order to reach the emissions target. This adjustment is of interest to economists as many questions arise. How costly is the reductions of emissions? Does it not harm country’s economy and competitiveness? Which industries and companies are affected most by the regulations? Why do companies not reduce their emissions voluntarily? Or do they? What is the impact of CO2 reduction on their financial performance? To answer the last question, we continue as follows. First, we briefly review recent literature on relation between companies’ economic and environmental performance in “Climate Change in Companies: Relationship between Financial and Environmental Performance”. We compare impacts of CO2 and local pollutants and investigate how much they are related in “Extension from Local Pollutants to CO2 Emissions”. We also analyze decomposition of CO2 reduction. “Introduction of the Emission Allowances Market” deals with the influence of the introduction of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and ask to which extent the system with traded allowances generates additional revenues for companies that reduce their CO2 emission. “Dataset: Czech Firms after Transition” describes the dataset of Czech firms. In “Empirical Models: From Environmental to Financial Performance and Back” we describe four models that empirically test the hypotheses derived in the theoretical section, and we discuss the results.

This can be explained by continuously growing oil prices. However, since then the current account as the share of GDP has fallen continuously, and despite record-high oil prices in 2007, at the beginning of 2008 the current account surplus was 5.9%, while in the last quarter of 2008 it slipped to 2.4%. The following questions attempt to be answered: do energy prices really affect changes in the current account of the Russian Federation? If not, which other determinant can explain these changes? In academic literature, very little attention is paid to factors that may affect changes in the current account of the Russian Federation. It could be explained by fact that during the considered period the current account of the Russian Federation indicated deficit only during the period from the second quarter of 1997 till the third quarter of 1998. This deficit is explained by the Russian financial crisis in the middle of 1998 which was triggered by the Asian financial crisis of 1997. For more than a decade the current account of the Russian Federation experienced surplus, averaged for more than 10% of GDP with the drastic fall to 2.4% in the last quarter of 2008 and slight increase to 3.5% at the beginning of 2009. Studies on current account determination generally include empirical works on countries suffering from current account deficit. Special attention in the literature is paid to panel studies, where countries are considered in special groups like, groups of transition countries, developing countries, industrial countries, or oil-exporting and non-oil exporting countries and many other. The purpose of these studies is to explain long-run, medium or short-run dynamics of current accounts by specifying comprehensive cross-country panel regression models. For example these studies include Khan and Knight (1983); Debelle and Faruqee (1996); Calderon et al. (2002); Chinn and Prasad (2003); Zanghieri (2004); Aristovnik (2007, 2008); Calderon et al. (2007); Herwartz and Siedenburg (2007); Morsey (2009) and others. Another type of studies focuses on country-specific models, generally employing vector autoregressive and vector error correction models. The purpose of these studies is to uncover the effect of shocks proposed by the theoretical and empirical literature determinants on current account balance. These types of studies include Dibooğlu (1997); Edwards (2006); Matsubayashi (2006); Gulzar et al. (2007); Bitzis et al. (2008); Camurdan et al. (2009); Kwalingana and Nkuna (2009) and others. Panel studies have advantages in making investigations over long sets of observations. However, by merging countries in groups some information which is individual to particular countries can be generalized, ignored and consequently lost in the analysis of the empirical results. The main objective of this study is to investigate what key economic factors can influence the current account and can cause a deficit, and to find out if energy prices are main determinants of the Russian current deficit as is proposed in the literature. The novelty of this study lies in the investigation of the current account of a country which actually experienced surplus for the last decade. However, significant decrease in the current account surplus in the period of growing energy prices indicates that there are some hidden factors that affect the current account of the Russian Federation. The current account determinants have to be investigated before unexpected crisis deteriorates the Russian economy, taking into account that in the last quarter of 2008 and at the beginning of 2009 surplus of the Russian current account had already slipped to the record lowest value for the last decade. The paper has the following structure. In “Development of the Current Account in the Russian Federation” analyzes the state of the Russian current account and of its determinants during the period from 1995 to 2008. In “The Theoretical Overview” presents the econometric methodology employed in the study. In “Data Description” describes the data. In “Empirical Results” presents results of the model estimations and their analysis. Finally “Conclusion” summarizes the main findings and draws conclusions.",5

Osipian,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Increasing scale and scope of corruption in the former Soviet Bloc, as well as numerous other countries, urges better understanding of the problem within the context of socio-economic transformations. The increasing gap between pay rates in private and public sectors of the economy urges public employees to seek other sources of income (Gorodnichenko and Sabirianova 2006). Rapid development of market reforms, privatization and increasing flow of financial resources have expanded a base for corruption. Public servants adjust their professional ethics and behavior accordingly by accepting bribes and numerous other benefits and utilizing their privileged position and control over the access to public services. Corrupt hierarchical structures can have negative impact on economic growth in several ways, including through corruption in the higher education sector, deterioration of human capital, rent-seeking behaviour, and high transaction costs of doing business in the former Soviet republics (Osipian 2009a). Different aspects of the negative impact of corruption on economic development, human capital formation and education are reflected in works of Ledeneva (1998, 2004), Ledeneva and Kurkchiyan (2000), Osipian (2009c, d), and Shleifer and Vishny (1993). In 1999 James Leach, Chairman of the US House Banking Committee, wrote that he had conducted a study of the most corrupt regimes, including the Philippines under Marcos, Zaire under Mabutu, and Indonesia under Suharto. Bad as these were, each was outdone by the “pervasiveness of politically tolerated corruption” in post-communist Russia (New York Times, September 10, 1999; Shleifer and Treisman 2003, p. 27). Studies show that perceptions of the public about corruption lead to an increase in the number of incidences of corruption and total volume of graft (Cabelkova and Hanousek 2004; Tumennasan 2005, Olken 2006). Contrary to expectations, development of a substantial private sector in Russia, Ukraine, China, and other countries leads to an increase in corruption (Osipian 2009b). Private institutions may be as corrupt as their public counterparts, which proves that not only public officials are susceptible to corruption (Osipian 2008c). This paper presents an overview of the research on corruption and develops models of corrupt organizations, including vertical structure, horizontal structure, and hierarchy. The former Soviet Union is taken to study evolution of organizational forms of corruption because the region is characterized by a high level of corruption and a process of rapid socio-economic developments and major changes in which new organizational structures are shaped.",21
18,1,Transition Studies Review,26 February 2011,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-011-0190-6,Debt–Growth Nexus: A Spatial Econometrics Approach for Developing Countries,September 2011,Siti Nurazira Mohd Daud,Jan M. Podivinsky,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Does external borrowing help to improve a country’s economic growth? Or it could be a burden that has to be paid for by future generations? External debt could be defined as a long-term and short-term debt that is owed by a country to non-residents (IMF 2003).Footnote 1 Based on standard neo-classical economic theory, capital-scarce countries should borrow abroad to finance domestic investment. In particular, governments borrow abroad to smooth domestic consumption or to undertake investment projects that could not have been financed by domestic capital. It is notable that all countries in the world are experiencing this phenomenon: a problem of capital-scarce resources. According to the CIA (2009) (as at end of June 2009), the United States ranks as the country with the highest level of outstanding external debt. With US $13,450 million of outstanding external debt, the United Kingdom ranks second, while Germany and 7 other highly developed countries monopolize the top of the list of countries with external indebtedness. China, South Korea and India, the three ‘catching-up’ economies, rank at 22, 23 and 25, respectively. As such, this development could explain the fact that neither the developed nor developing countries are immune from the capital-scarcity problem. In addition, the dual-gap theory, which is an extension of the Harrod–Domar growth model, has highlighted the motivation for the introduction of debt in a growth model. The model explains that the two gaps, namely savings gap and foreign exchange gap, could be inadequate and insufficient to support the expected level of growth. As such, the role of external or foreign borrowing in economic growth has been discovered even though it depends on the condition of the two gaps as to which is the larger––the savings-investment gap or the import–export gap. On the other hand, the role of external debt in economic growth has been questioned since it is associated with a high incidence of default, low economic growth and high levels of poverty. Furthermore, the worries about countries that are already trapped in the debt-overhang situation have underlined the urgency of analyzing this area. It is also important to investigate whether a country’s indebtedness is associated with a symptom of the debt-overhang position. The debt-overhang is a situation in which countries have a very high level of indebtedness which leads to a high debt service burden (Krugman 1988). As such, this results in a position where the stock of external debt is larger than the country’s ability to repay its debt in the future. In addition, the high level of debt service would crowd out investment and lead to lower economic growth (Claessens et al. 1997). The longer a country remains in the debt-overhang situation, the higher the probability of the country being in default.Footnote 2
 In addition, in the era of globalization the interdependence relationship among countries cannot be denied. Relationships through trade and knowledge spillover have highlighted the importance of analyzing the ‘neighbouring’ effect in the debt growth model (Rey and Montouri 1999). Consequently, any analysis that ignored the possibility of the neighbouring or spatial effect (if it exists) would lead to a specification error in the estimated model and, thus, to a misleading conclusion. The contribution of the paper is threefold. First, this study contributes to the small but growing body of empirical literature on debt–growth nexus. Secondly, this paper contributes towards the methodology front since this is the first attempt to analyze the relationship by using a spatial correlation approach. Moreover, no empirical study has been carried out to determine if location matters for the debt–growth nexus model. Besides that, this paper seeks to answer the issues of the debt sustainability position of developing countries; since the public debt represents more than 50% of long-term external debt for developing countries (short-term debt accounts for only 15% of total external debt), the negative effect of external debt on economic growth indicates the unsustainability position of governments’ debt in middle-income countries. Motivated by the key role played by external debt in boosting investment as well as economic growth, the aim of this paper is to analyze the role of external debt in economic growth. In addition, this paper also employs spatial econometrics methods to estimate whether the debt–growth model demonstrates that, in developing countries, economic growth depends on the growth of their neighbours. This paper is organized as follows. “Literature Review” reviews the theoretical model and empirical literature on the debt–growth nexus respectively. “Econometric Methodology” reports on data and methodology that have been used in the analysis. The empirical results are presented in “Results and Estimation”, and “Conclusion and Policy Recommendation” concludes the paper.",9

Airports, railways and a series of different other services have become entities listed on the capital market, therefore enhancing the opportunity of developing hybrid organization structures, but also transitional structures, all these offering from the researcher’s point of view high potential for developing different analysis. Researchers in the field emphasize the manner in which new structures are being born every day, with a strong tendency of orientation toward new virtual organizations (Kangis 1998 quoted by Kangis and Kareklis 2001), going beyond conventional political limits and offering new challenges with unique character in studying corporate governance. It is in the picture of these opportunities that we also frame the changes that have been made within the organizational structure of BCR Erste Bank in order to better reflect the extremely large geographical presence that was reached by the group. Considering the systematic expansion that has been taking place during the last few years within Central and Eastern Europe, the group has reached a level that imposes management’s centralization at higher level, as well as in the case of informational processes, all these considering the context of certain structures that should insure an efficient decision making process, but also a corresponding implementation of the decisions therefore made. Our analysis focuses on the Cluj Napoca regional corporate business center of BCR Erste Bank Romania. The reason for our choice is motivated by the fact that the Cluj Napoca regional center represents the pilot used by Erste Bank in testing all structural changes, new technologies and management and risk strategies. This offers an interesting research setting since the obtained results can be extended and put into good use when referring to BCR Erste at national level. Framing our analysis within current times, it became obvious the necessity to develop a bi-dimensional analysis of changes taking place within BCR Erste. On one hand, we must consider the credit institutions’ perspective and on the other the client’s perspective and the manner in which he perceives the chance intended by the bank, therefore offering a feedback on the degree to which the proposed objectives are also achieved. We will furthermore focus on performing an analysis of the impact that recent changes within BCR Erste have had on its clients. Considering the objective of reflecting the above-mentioned impact from the client’s perspective, our analysis is based on answers being given by the bank’s clients using a detailed questionnaire, developed in accordance with the objectives of our study. Beyond this first objective of quantifying the impact changes within BCR Erste had on its clients, we could say that the second objective was actually imposed by current realities. More precisely, we refer the circumstances characterizing the current financial crisis, whose implications we have also tried to catch as seen through the eyes of the bank’s clients. Moreover, the two fundamental objectives of the study are in the same time interrelated, allowing us to formulate our questions so that we have the possibility of a correlated and integrated interpretation considering the context of the responses collected through the questionnaire. In other words, beyond the fact that we had the opportunity of analyzing the changes that were implemented within the organization in real time, the current financial crisis made it possible for us to also study some particularities. We mean here the manner in which these chances have facilitated, from the clients’ point of view, their attempt to fight the negative effects of the crisis on the activities they developed in collaboration with the credit institution. Our motivation in developing this study is mainly to visualize the analyzed changes from the clients’ point of view, as they are the ones placed in the center of any credit institution’s attention. But, beyond getting this big picture we aim at integrating the obtained results within the decision making process and at shaping some perspectives on the direction that would be opportune to follow when considering performance and risks’ management within the banking system at national level. We consider that obtaining such information, presenting clients’ feedback towards how changes made within the organization have been translated in practice represents useful input for the decision making process. On one hand, it could be used in developing corresponding management strategies for the considered organization and on the other, we can also think at selecting some essential basic information that would also apply when considering the level of the Romanian banking system. When we think of developing corresponding management for the considered organization, we think of the necessity of considering a series of factors that act within an organization and also the capacity of correctly integrating the obtained data within the particular setting of the considered organization. Trade literature emphasized the fact that, at organizational level, understanding the culture’s particularity represents a unique experience that needs to be shared (Martin quoted by Per H. Hansen 2007). Even if an organization implies a series of shared values, we must not forget the reality reminding us that in the same time we are dealing with sub-cultures, confusions and lack of coherence. Moreover, any organization involves a series of cultural links that actually go beyond the limits of the organization per se the cultural observer must therefore aim at understanding the patterns of the meanings that link … cultural manifestations among themselves, sometimes in harmony, and sometimes through strong debates between groups, while sometimes even in networks of ambiguity, paradoxes and contradictions (Martin quoted by Per H. Hansen 2007). We therefore identify within trade literature three perspectives on organizations, as follows: The integration perspective describing the shared part of culture, starting with top management and going down to simple operators within the organization, underlining the existence of a certain consensus on certain values; The differentiation perspective that includes the existence of different sub-cultures within the organization. Implicitly, it might happen that top management has, for example a different cultural perspective from that of IT personnel. In this case consensus operates within sub-cultures that are particular to the organization, but not among them (in other words intra sub-cultures, but not inter sub-cultures); The fragmenting perspective that comprises those manifestations of culture that is incoherent, therefore having no consensus regarding the organization. Reality makes it that, very often, all these three dimensions coexist within each organization. All these represent the premises of a promising approach, but also requiring from our point of view, as Per H. Hansen (2007) also emphasized it, us to consider the dynamic of chance. This would be the context in which we must place organizational changes that took place within BCR Erste and also the results of our study together with what we might learn from it. As previously mentioned, implementing changes within BCR Erste took place in the same time with a series of events having the ability of making the process even more difficult through the necessity of confronting some circumstances brought by the world wide financial crisis. There is no doubt in our mind that those problems rising from the mortgage market in the USA, also triggering the financial crisis that was going to rapidly conquer the global economy, will generate major changes within the international financial system and not only. Since the manifestation of the financial crisis, standard setting bodies have been trying to find solutions for the problems that are currently being faced within the financial industry and the global economy. The G20 Summit that took place in London in April 2009 was confirming the fact that governments all over the world were is searching for solutions and adequate measures in order to prevent such events ever occurring again in the future. Markets must accept the necessity of a restructuring period that seriously considers realities concerning the impact of the current financial crisis. Meanwhile the concept of liquidity is nowadays receiving a completely different attitude and importance through banking paradigms than it did in the past when banks did not give sufficient attention to the need for diversification of finances (Choudhry 2009). Under these circumstances, we consider it necessary that all participants on the market to become aware of the dynamic of changes taking place within the baking industry and correspondingly adapt their organizational strategy and approach. The 2007–2008 crash represents the results of the interaction of a series of different factors, some actually being generated gradual since some years now. Even if these manifestations do not represent a novelty, being an inherent aspect of capitalism, we must not forget the role of governments, standard setting bodies and all market participants in correctly reacting to the current state of facts, aiming at correcting actions that are able to minimize the effects of similar unwanted events. Even if it is not a generally shared opinion within the international financial system (Choudhry 2009), we agree on the fact that one of the results of the current financial crisis will lead to a change in paradigms from the credit institutions’ point of view. Even if only time could confirm our opinion or not, there is no doubt in our mind concerning the necessity of change within banks’ strategy, as a consequence of the current financial crisis.",

These features have benefited many sectors of the economy, including the financial sector. They have stimulated the growth of the insurance industry as well as the banking industry. This paper examines the structure and performance of the banking industry in Egypt. The outlook of the Egyptian banking industry is positive and it is characterized by the dominance of state-owned banks resulting from the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) undertaking major banking reforms towards a more liberal system. The paper aims to document the success of the banking sector but also to highlight some important areas where problems arose. The paper is organized as follows. Firstly, we review the extent of the development of the banking industry and the industry’s institutional structure. The following two sections offer brief reviews of the state of development, structure and performance of the CBE and licensed banks. Then, we examine the institutional structure of the four predominant state-owned, commercial banks in Egypt, followed by an examination of the regulatory and supervisory framework.

Crosby-Nagy,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The external linkages, both formal and informal, between firms and selected agents have shown to create a “locus of innovation” when the knowledge that is transferred underlies a firm’s competitive advantage. (Malerba and Vonortas 2009) These loci of innovation, also called “nodes”, “social networks”, and “innovation networks” provide resources to firms (asset stocks) such as “social capital”, “technical capital”, and “commercial capital”. The use of asset stocks by firms is meant to result in increased returns to investment from research and development. The loci of innovation in the European context are primarily located in the Western part of Europe including Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, the Scandinavian countries and the UK. Looking at a map of global hotspots in the biotechnology industry from 2008 as an example, we can see Western Europe is dominant in innovation when compared to Central and Eastern Europe. Source: From Andersen, Jørn Bang, “Establishment of Nordic Innovation Centres in Asia?” by the Nordic Innovation Centre for the Nordic Council of Ministers, Copenhagen, 2008. Various levers control the presence of clusters of innovation. These include, but are not limited to: a country’s investment in research and development as a percent of GDP, quality of scientific personnel, and general business climate (Cassi et al. 2008). Few studies have focused solely on identifying the social networks of firms in Central and Eastern Europe. This is likely due to the paucity of scholarly research on the topic perhaps resulting from views of Central and Eastern Europe as being “catching-up” countries—focused primarily on the manufacturing sectors as opposed to the services sector. While it is true that several economies in Central and Eastern Europe can be described as catching-up, especially relative to Western Europe and most of the OCED countries, there are several that have a history of contributing heavily to European stocks of knowledge in certain industries; namely, the pharmaceutical industry (Radosevic 1999). The returns from obtaining external sources of knowledge in the pharmaceuticals industry are acquired through R&D partnerships and collaborations. The gains are increased access to stocks of knowledge. The purpose of this paper is to measure the importance of Central and Eastern Europe to drug research using network indicators. At the conclusion, we should able to identify the top locations for external sources of knowledge for firms within the pharmaceutical industry by country. The benefits of identifying the geographical location of innovation networks of firms in the pharmaceutical industry in Central and Eastern Europe are: provides justification for national and supranational R&D investment levels to policy makers; reveals the location of attractive investment opportunities for firms; reveals the relationships of firms to the region; and provides a reliable indicator of Central and Eastern European regional competitiveness. Thus, this paper will answer the question: which countries in Central and Eastern Europe act as external sources of knowledge to firms within the pharmaceutical industry? Results show: Top European pharmaceuticals fund papers with authors from Central and Eastern Europe more than American firms and some have R&D centers located directly in those countries. Overall, the upper percentage of total papers funded with a Central and Eastern European author by any one top performing Pharma corporation was only 6.6%. Poland was the leader in both total number of papers funded and by percentage of papers funded, followed closely by Hungary, Greece and the Czech Republic. Roche was the number one global top ten pharmaceutical corporation to fund research in Central and Eastern Europe. The rest of the paper proceeds as follows: first, background information about the nature of research and development within the pharmaceutical industry as well as research collaborations/partnerships is provided. This is followed by the presentation of the results and lastly an interpretation of the results with a final recommendation.",

Nonetheless, it would be worth mentioning that the consequences of trade deficit are worse for a volatile developing economy than for a stable developed economy. Therefore, developing countries are more solicitous about their trade deficits and are always finding ways to reduce, if not eliminate, the gap between their imports and exports. Exchange rate devaluation is one of the tools used by the developing countries to reduce the trade deficit. The conventional wisdom says that devaluing domestic currency raises exports and reduces imports as the former becomes cheaper for foreigners and the later becomes expansive for the domestic residents. However, it is a very sanguine deduction. Theoretically correct, this may not always hold empirically as it depends on export and import elasticities. In addition, the phenomenon of J-curve also comes into play in the short-run. Lastly and importantly, for improvement in trade balance, nominal devaluation should lead to real exchange rate devaluation or depreciation. The notion that real devaluation proceeds nominal devaluation finds empirical support as well (Vaubel 1976; Bruno 1978; Connolly and Taylor 1979; Edwards 1994; Kent and Naja 1998; Holmes 2004; Wahid and Shahbaz 2009). Interestingly, Shahbaz (2009) concludes this result for Pakistan. Subsequently, nominal exchange rate shocks are transmitted to real exchange rate, which in turn significantly affect a country’s trade balance. This raises the requirement of decomposition of the structural shocks into nominal and real exchange rate shocks. The study in hands is the first attempt in this regard for Pakistan using the Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) method. The SVAR method has been vigorously used to analyze the sources of movements in exchange rate (see, for example, Lastrapes 1992; Clarida and Gali 1994; Enders and Lee 1997; Rogers 1999; Dibooglu and Kutan 2001; Wang 2004; Hamori and Hamori 2007). Enders and Lee (1997) employed Blanchard and Quah (1989) approach for identification of structural shocks. This study also makes use of the same methodology for Pakistan. The study proceeds with the “Theoretical Model” and continues with “Data and Econometric Methodology”. Further the study deals with the “Results and Discussion”, and ends with “Concluding Remarks”.",1

Each of the V-4 countries joined the EU during the fifth enlargement of the union in May 2004. At present, these Central European countries aim to fulfill the EU convergence criteria (Maastricht criteria) and introduce the euro. This paper revealed the monetary policy preferences in V-4 countries. In particular, following Surico (2007), we investigate the asymmetric preferences with regard to the output gap in V-4. Surico (2007) introduced the linex loss (linear exponential) function that is different from the classical central banker’s loss function in terms of an origin-asymmetry. If the central banker optimizes under the linex loss, he obeys the nonlinear interest rate rule. We can obtain the asymmetric parameter (that is, the central banker’s preference) with regard to the output gap by estimating the rule. In this model, if the central banker prefers output expansion, the average rate of inflation increases. This paper proceeds as follows. In the section of ""Nonlinear Rule and Average Inflation Bias"", we provide and interpret Surico (2007)’s model. Then, in the section of ""Average Inflation Bias in the V-4"", we estimate the model in the case of the V-4 countries. As a result of this, we find that the central banks of all the V-4 countries have an asymmetry with regard to the output gap. Moreover, the estimation of the subsample after the fifth enlargement reveals the monetary policy efforts in Slovakia and Poland to introduce the euro. Following these discussions, the last section offers Conclusions.",

The main function of microfinance is to fight world poverty. Indeed, the primordial role of its institutions (MFIs) is to provide microcredit to the unemployed or low income individuals or groups who have no access to commercial banks. In the literature, this mission is often described as outreach. This concept––the social advantages of microfinance for poor people––is especially utilized to refer to the effort by MFIs to grant microcredit and financial services to an ever-wider audience (breadth of outreach) and particularly toward the poorest people (depth of outreach) (Conning 1999). Nevertheless, the social goal of MFI is very costly because targeting the poorest of the poor and meeting their particular needs will generally be more costly than giving equivalent services to the normal population. These higher costs may be drawbacks for the financial sustainability and efficiency. Thus, the outreach and sustainability goals may be conflicting (Hermes et al. 2008) There are two main streams of research concerning the goals of MFI. The first stream focuses on the social exigency of poverty reduction (defended by the Wilfarists School). This approach evaluates success by how well it realizes the needs of the poorest in the short term (Schreiner 2002). While the second focuses on the economic exigency of institution viability (defended by the Insitutionalits School). This approach evaluates success by how well it increases the frontier of the mainstream economy in the long term (Von Pischke 1991). The best way to offer financial services to the poor population has fuelled intensive debate between these two Schools. In sum, these two schools place the microfinance sector at “crossroads” In short, this paper extends prior study in two ways. First, it uses all financial ratios categories (i.e. profitability, efficiency and productivity and portfolio quality) in order to generalise findings considered. Second, it proposes and tests two new outreach indicators namely: the targeting of the poor (Target_POP) and the number of outstanding loan per women (NOLpW) in order to avoid some limitations in the previous papers. At a high level, this work contributes to providing a theoretical and empirical answer for the following question: What is the nature of the relationship between social performance (Outreach) and financial performance in the Mediterranean MFIs? This paper is divided into six parts. After the “Introduction”, section “Theoretical Background” discusses the arguments in theoretical framework. In section “Empirical Analysis: Data, Model and Methodology”, data, model and methodology are explained. The research findings are presented in section “Results and Discussion”. The “Practical Implications” section exposes some practical implications of the research results. Section “Conclusion” concludes and presents future research and limitations of the study.",6

Evidence from Nonlinear Models,September 2011,Samira Haddou,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Recent assessments of economic policies and performances in developing countries have underlined the crucial issue of the management of the real effective exchange rates (REER) which are the weighted average of a country’s bilateral exchange rates with its major trading partners. The REERs flexible exchange rate provides a “buffer against shocks” and helps to reduce “volatility” in interest rates. Several advantages were seen as substantial for countries that have properly managed their real exchange rate including sustaining export-led growth, promoting manufacturing exports, attracting foreign direct investment (Goldberg 1993) and assuring the achievement of a fast and sustained economic growth (see among others, Edwards 1988; Cottani et al. 1990; Ghura and Grennes 1993). The question of how exchange rates adjust is central to exchange rate policy since all countries, either with fixed or with flexible exchange rate, need to know the optimum level (equilibrium) exchange rate. The purchasing power parity (henceforth, PPP) theory is one of the many theoretical frameworks that has attempted to establish the equilibrium exchange rateFootnote 1 (see among other, Dornbusch 1982; Taylor and Taylor 2004), and many open economies macroeconomic models are built upon the long-run PPP hypothesis (see for instance, Froot and Rogoff 1995; Rogoff 1996). The PPP theory has attracted a great deal of attention and has been explored extensively in the recent empirical literature. The basic idea behind the PPP theory is that any short-run deviation of the exchange rate from its long-run trend, such as in an event of real currency depreciation, is adjusted in trade flows and then the exchange rate reverts back to the equilibrium level. In other words, there exists a deterministic long-run level of real exchange rate (the equilibrium rate) to which the observed exchange rate reverts back in the long run (Engle 2000). The REER mean reverting (stationarity) implies that PPP holds with respect to its trading partners. If the PPP does not hold, this would signal potential exchange rate misalignments in the domestic currency. There is a wide consensus among economists that misalignment, especially overvaluation, may widen commercial and current account deficits and deplete the economic growth (Telatar and Hasanov 2009). In order to explain the failure to provide evidence for the PPP, several studies have underscored the importance of the nonlinear adjustment processes towards the PPP. Nonlinearities are brought about by the presence of transactions costs (Dumas 1992), the heterogeneity of opinions in the foreign exchange market concerning the equilibrium level of the nominal exchange rate (Taylor and Allen 1992; Korhonen 2005), the speculative attacks on currencies, the presence of target zones (Krugman 1991), noise traders (De Long et al. 1990) or the heterogeneity of the interventions of central banks have been also advanced (Dominguez 1998; Villavicencio 2008). If the REER is governed by a nonlinear mean reversion mechanism, this would indicate that it would adjust to its long-run equilibrium non-linearly. Real devaluations will therefore affect trade flows in a rather nonlinear but predictable manner. Empirically, the identification of non-linearity in real exchange rates series is based on smooth transition auto-regression (henceforth, STAR) modeling. The appeal of this methodology is that it assumes that, subsequent to an exchange rate shock, economies move smoothly from one (exchange rate) regime to another. The extent to which the economy is in one regime or another where relatively moderate shocks give rise to a smoother adjustment between regimes is likely to be continent on the size of the shock. In terms of policy implications, the knowledge of the size of the shock as well as the speed of the transition is helpful for policymakers, especially when it comes to evaluate the impacts of shocks on the regime being pursued. In order to uncover the dynamic behavior of the REER and to better characterize the specification of the STAR model, it is therefore necessary to test for linearity of the model against the STAR specification via standard tests (see Teräsvirta (1994)). However, these tests do not take into account the presence of potential aberrant values that might influence the nature of the REER adjustment. The non holds in accounts of these outliersFootnote 2 can lead to the dismissal to wrong of the null hypothesis of linearity. It appears as if these atypical values can skew the evaluation and the forecast of the REER. Although nonlinear adjustment of real exchange rate was recognized for the industrialized and developing countries, little work has been done for Tunisian economy. This paper attempts to fill this gap by focusing on an under-researched country, namely Tunisia. In this context, this study is based on robust test for STAR type nonlinearity. This procedure has been adjudged immune against outliers and does not need a priori knowledge regarding their presence and/or timing (Escribano et al. 1998; Villavicencio 2008). The outline of the paper is as follows. “An Overview on the Tunisian Exchange Rate Policy” is devoted to an abridged Tunisian exchange rate policy. “The Smooth Transition Autoregressive Models of Real Exchange Rate” formulates the smooth transition autoregressive model and discusses how it can capture real exchange rate dynamics. “Data Sources and Econometric Methodology” presents and comments the estimates results. Finally, “Empirical Results” reports the main findings, the concluding remarks and some the policy implications.",

Sabiroglu,Samad Bashirli,Faiq Qasimli,Male,Male,Male,Male,"There are many channels through which natural resource revenues can negatively affect a national economy. The linkage between deterioration of terms of trade and low economic performance, as the result of national currency appreciation (Mikesell 1997; Reyes-Loya and Blanco 2008) is the most commonly accepted one among them. However, natural resources windfall also causes crowding out and resource movements effects (Gelb and Associates 1988), provokes wrong decision making in investment choices (Usui 1997) and increases rent seeking tendency (Baland and Francois 2000). An economic literature proposes several policy measures in order to avoid problems stemmed from utilization of natural resources incomes. Stevens (2003) generalizes abovementioned policy measures as followings: establishing natural resources revenue funds, diversifying economy, sterilization of income, optimization public investment policy and economic policy decisions. All of these, as was stressed by Rosenberg and Saavalainen (1998) make necessary adoption of a general approach (strategy) on management and exploitation of the natural resource incomes. It is obvious that this strategy must cover major objectives for the use of natural resources revenues and an expenditure mechanism. The subject of this paper is an expenditure mechanism of natural resource income in the case of Azerbaijan. The relevant literature (Basdevant 2008; Segura 2009; Leigh and Olters 2006; Baunsgaard 2003; IMF 2004) discussing a natural resource revenue expenditure mechanism often address Milton Friedman’s (1957) permanent income hypothesis. However, on the basis of the expenditure mechanism of natural resource revenues on permanent income approach the following insufficiencies are observed: Actually, the expression of “permanent” in original permanent income hypothesis (Friedman 1957) implies some next years (Carroll 2001), and even some papers stress that this period can cover 3–4 years (IMF 2007). According to the theory permanent consumption (Y

p
) is a function of permanent income (X

p
). Gujarati (2004, p. 46) states that “since data on these variables are not directly observable, in practice we use proxy variables, such as current consumption (Y) and current income (X), which can be observable. Since the observed Y and X may not equal Y

p
 and X

p
, there is the problem of errors of measurement.” From this point of view in terms of high uncertainty discounting life-long expected natural resource income for present day and formulating yearly revenues based on permanent income hypothesis may be inappropriate from a fiscal policy perspective. Even if government decides how to use oil incomes, it cannot define future oil prices. Due to this it is necessary to formulate reference price for forecasting expected oil revenues. We observe that regardless of the fact that volume of proved reserves and extraction period are not appropriate, constant real expenditure theory proposed as a standard approach. It can be noted particularly in case of Azerbaijan (Bandiera et al. 2008; IMF 2003). It is clear that for Azerbaijan, as a newly independent transition country, marginal utility of natural resource revenues in first years is higher than following. From this attitude permanent income principle based on the expenditure mechanism does not justify itself as an optimal one. It is stressed that permanent income approach guarantees fair distribution of natural resource wealth between present and future generations (Clausen 2008). In this context we can note that fair distribution could also be provided by other mechanisms. Consequently, if permanent income principle, presented as a standard approach, does not have high chances to be applied in reality, other mechanism can be considered instead. The purpose of this paper is to point out possibility of finding optimal mechanisms on the use of natural resource revenues in the case of Azerbaijan. Optimal mechanism must: provide fair distribution between generations; be able to be revised for short terms (every 3 years) against uncertainties; provide expenditure stability and sustainable financing from fiscal policy stance; adequately define discount rate; include mechanism of formulating appropriate reference price for revenue forecast against oil price shocks; have elasticity feature of consistency with non-oil incomes. The second section of the paper appraises possible oil and gas revenues of Azerbaijan and defines appropriate discount rate. The third section tests various revenue utilization mechanisms, such as: real constant expenditure, nominal constant expenditure, stable diminishing expenditure and stable rate diminishing expenditure models. The fourth section explains the statistical methods in order to calculate crude oil reference price for the midterm fiscal planning. Conclusions and proposal are made in fifth section.",2

Resentments grow especially at times of signing of new stand-by and monitoring programs with the Fund or even during routine consultation meetings, which are obligatory for members under the article IV. What explains the actual and rhetorical defections of political elite in developing countries from the IMF programs even in times of severe economic difficulties? Scholars have focused on “domestic audience costs” of participating in IMF programs.Footnote 1  While agreeing with the literature, this paper will take a step further by arguing that the lack of political will can be attributed to the desire of governments to maintain political continuity at the expense of economic growth. As commitments to IMF programs require governments to make changes generating institutional, social and political consequences; governments choose to delay an agreement with the Fund, whenever the program is likely to disrupt the tight government-business linkages through institutional reforms or economic policies. It should be noted here that in this paper our focus is on vocal opposition to the IMF in countries whose economies are in a relatively more favorable condition to oppose IMF settlements. We are aware of the limitation that unless a country has some economic strength to rely upon, it is not easy for that country to stand against a Stand-By Agreement (SBA). Thus, the non-cooperative attitude towards the Fund and its principles can be displayed by certain countries only. It is beyond the scope of this paper to make an argument on the political rationale of defection for all relevant countries. Although several examples of defection from Malaysia to Serbia are examined, the paper is mainly limited to the discussion of the case Turkey to unpack the causes of lack of political will to conclude a SBA with the IMF. In the pursuit of making its points, the paper is divided into three sections. Taking political ideologies adopted in different countries as given, the first section will explain the Malaysian case in relatively more detail to demonstrate the political causes of the Mahathir government to oppose a SBA in the light of government-business relations in this country. The second section will include what makes the ruling political elites in Latin American countries “Mavericks of the Twenty-first Century” in their relations with the IMF. The third section of the paper will be devoted to the Turkish case to discuss the recent approach of the Turkish government towards the IMF. The main objective of this section is to unpack the causes of defection from the IMF-steered programs at government level since 2008. The paper will also shed light on the likely economic consequences of not concluding an agreement with the Fund for Turkey. Finally, the paper will conclude by arguing that for countries that need to harmonize interests of different segments of society and economy, what is said and done may differ considerably. The mavericks can re-change their current rhetoric in favor of IMF and conclude a new stand-by. As this paper suggests, the mavericks may be just after more favorable terms of agreement with the Fund. IMF Stand-By Agreements do not always guarantee private bank loans to countries in financial need; nor do they determine amounts of private loans to be given to countries or the lending conditions. Nevertheless, multinational private banks always prefer to base their risk assessment on the Fund’s seal of approval as a reliable reference before they lend out to indebted countries. The banks hold the opinion that the Fund can assist them in making prudent loan decisions by transferring to them the information that the Fund collects in the course of its consultations with its members. Some reports are supposed to be confidential.Footnote 2 Yet, in many instances they are selectively disclosed to banks in informal ways. After all, market conditions of countries are usually the overriding factor for banks to decide whether they should lend or not. It is safe to argue that when the markets are liquid, banks tend to pay attention to the Fund’s advice only in marginal cases, given their desire to make profit through lending. When money is tight, however, they may not be willing to give out new loans even in the face of the best recommendations from the Fund. As for the IMF, the Fund almost always offers agreements to its members at times of dire need to help them meet the requirements or expectations of private banks. Whether the country in question accepts the offer or not is a different matter. The conditions, the duration, the coverage of a Stand-By provided by the IMF and what it promises in terms of financial benefits and structural programs vary based on the conditions of the aspirant country. What about those leaders that raise their voices against the IMF and begin bashing the Fund, once their economies begin to recover-although economic circumstances are still unfavorable? In this paper, we will refer to these defectors as “Mavericks” and they are numerous in the developing world.",

Few of them are time series and some are cross sectional studies.Footnote 1 Most of the studies have been conducted under Prebish–Singer (PS) hypothesis.Footnote 2 Prebish–Singer hypothesis state that primary product specializing country’s terms of trade will weaken over time compare to the countries that produce manufactured goods. Lutz (1999); Hadass and Williamson (2001); Cashin and McDermott (2002a) amongst others have found evidence supporting the hypothesis. In contrast, large number of studies has been done to find Harberger–Laursen–Metzler (HLM) effect.Footnote 3 According to HLM effect the unfavorable shock of terms of trade results in a fall in country’s real income and aggregate saving, resulting in a deterioration of its current account balance. Arize (1996), Cashin and McDermott (2002b), Otto (2003), Bouakez and Kano (2008), Hamori (2008), Misztal (2010) amongst others have proved both significant and insignificant impact of change in terms of trade on trade balance. Figure 1 shows the relationship between terms of trade and economic growth for a sample of 94 countries. From the scatter diagram there is no clear sign of any relationship between terms of trade and economic growth. On the other hand, Fig. 2 represents the relationship between volatility of terms of trade and economic growth for the same 94 countries. This scatter diagram is also not providing any clear indication about the relationship between volatility of terms of trade and economic growth. Terms of trade and economic growth for the sample of 94 countries Volatility of terms of trade and economic growth for the sample of 94 countries From above scatter diagram analysis and the review of previous empirical studies, we are not coming up to a concrete conclusion about the effects of terms of trade and its volatility on economic growth. However, the international trade theories clearly explain the positive effects of term of trade on economic growth. Thus, this study intend to re-examine the effects of terms of trade and its volatility on economic growth using a new data set on developed and developing countries and applying more rigorous econometric techniques.

Bolocan,Cristian M. Litan,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The framework for banks’ capital adequacy represented by Basel I has been revised in order to answer to global challenges, among which can be also considered the economic and financial integration of several transition economies in the European Union. An upgraded framework is Basel II, which is based on three pylons: the minimum capital requirements, improved banking supervision and, respectively, ensuring a higher discipline on the banking market. The main purpose of the Basel II framework is to determine the banking industry to implement more efficient risk management practices. According to Medema et al. (2009), one of the main differences between Basel I and Basel II is the fact that the latter increases banks’ possibilities to use internal risk assessments as inputs to capital requirements. This comes as a sign of normality from the side of the financial regulations, especially for transition economies in which banks orient their business to very specific areas (e.g. small firms, or large firms, or different activity fields, etc.), and therefore universal risk assessment instruments are impossible to be constructed. Duffie and Singleton (2003) define the following risk categories to which a bank (a credit institution in general) can be exposed: credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and systemic risk. In this study we focus on the credit risk and its implications on a proper adequacy of the capital of a credit institution. More precisely, we are interested in how to provision the credit portfolio of a bank in close relationship to the expected default probabilities (PDs), for the firms already credited and which actually form that portfolio. As noted by Medema et al. (2009), the portfolio of loans consists of loans to businesses (small, large, retail, etc.) and loans to individuals (mortgages). Carling et al. (2007) points out that the main difference in the approach to determine PDs for loans to businesses and loans to individuals is represented by the fact that for the formers, external ratings are often used by the western credit institutions (e.g. Moody’s, S&P’s ratings, etc.).Footnote 1 However, many of the businesses in Central and East European (CEE) countries usually lack of such ratings, hence banks need to estimate PDs both for individuals with a loan and for businesses loans. The banks may implement such estimations by means of a logit model (Medema et al. (2009)). Dwyer and Stein (2006) note that the validation of PD models for loans to businesses should be concentrating on measuring discrimination and calibration. Taking into account that the situation described in the former paragraph occurs for an important percentage of firms in some CEE transition economies, then, in many instances, the banks are forced to act as for individuals when dealing with businesses. The banks may use a logit model to estimate the PDs, while the validation should not only be restricted to the PDs, but also to the parameter vector (Medema et al. (2009)). In this paper we study the implications of estimating the expected PDs for the firms that are already part of a credit portfolio of a bank (or a credit institution in general, like a leasing company), on the provisioning process of that portfolio. The estimation of PDs is conducted by means of a logit model, on a representative sample of companies, part of the real portfolio of the year 2008, for an important credit institution in Romania (i.e. within the top five banks as size). Financial and balance sheet data for the year 2008 are available for the companies in the sample. The provision coefficients implied by the expected PDs of these firms are compared to the coefficients imposed by the banking practice and authorities’ regulations. In comparison to the fixed provisioning coefficients suggested by the regulating authorities for each credit class, our provisioning application based on the logistic estimation of PDs results in a higher risk aversion for those credit classes of superior financial reliability, respectively leads to a risk underestimation for the company classes of lower reliability. We argue that this feature could be independent of the particular choice of the sample. Additional to our main goal, our logistic estimation of the PDs tries to follow the validation steps suggested by the literature. Our results show the importance of the solvency as predictor of the default probability, as well as the negative effect of the services sector. This comes as no surprise since starting with the middle of 2008, in Romania the crisis mainly affected the mentioned sector (followed by the constructions and real estates sectors, etc.). The paper is structured as follows. In section “Methodology” discusses methodological issues. Section “Data and Econometric Model” presents the data and the econometric model. Section “Results, Short Application in Provisioning the Credit Portfolio” presents the results and section “Discussion, Conclusions and Further Developments” draws the conclusions. Some of the tables and figures are relegated to the Appendix.",

This crisis found its origin in the strongly speculative behavior of the banks in a context of liberalized finance. Left the United States, this crisis was propagated to the world financial markets, which made fear a general economic recession. This transmission of the crises from one country to another (or from one market with another) is often described as contagion. The latter is the subject of a debate in the theoretical and empirical literature in particular in the process of transmissions international nonrelated to fundamental qualified in the literature by the “shift contagion”. Thus, the most problematic question which rises is not interested in explaining the causes of the shock propagation between related markets, but rather to result in exploring the mechanisms under unclaimed with the transmission of the crises between countries nondependent by the fundamental ones, in are simpler term, the relations between the countries during the crisis period they the same ones at the time of the stability period? From this question, one can distinguish between two concepts which have be subject of confusion on two plans theoretical and empirical with to know by fundamental contagion or interdependence (definite according to Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999), Glick and Andrew (1999) as being transmission of the shock via the channels real, financial or political…) and shift contagion (according to Masson 1998), i.e. the contagion takes place via the behavior of the investors and the other agents financial like the intentional investors. The objective of this study is to provide a logical explanation to the sub-prime crisis by giving a clear answer to the next mostly asked question: Does the transmission of this crisis on the BRIC countries was it only an act of a “shift contagion” or a simple interdependence between the markets? Indeed, our methodology consists first of all, to apply a correlation test of the daily index of security prices corrected skew of the heteroscedasticity during the period [01:04:2005; 12:31:2009]. Then, one will use the non-linear ECM in order to detect the asymmetry on the level of the term of error in the ECM model.

The pioneer work on the relationship between government size and trade openness is Cameron (1978). Cameron argues that public spending should be higher in more liberalized countries since it functions as risk-reducing instrument by taking control of a larger share of country’s resources. The intuition is that if more open countries are vulnerable to external demand and supply shocks and are associated with increased level of economic inequality then a big government may be better able to provide stabilizing role and to compensate the external risk by providing insurance and consumption smoothing through redistribution or other forms of social plans. In literature, it is known as the compensation hypothesis (see Rodrik 1998, Schulze and Ursprung 1999).Footnote 1 Another explanation given for this relationship is that integration into world markets increases specialization within an economy. Increased specialization, in turn, implies less diversification and hence greater exposure to the risks arising from volatility in the global economy. To hedge against these risks, states that are open to world markets increase public expenditures to compensate losers (Katzenstein 1985) and expand the size of the non-exposed public sector (Rodrik 1998). Alesina and Wacziarg (1998) suggest a different link for theoretically positive relationship between trade openness and government size. According to them the intuition is that high openness means that country size is small and small countries have high government consumptions. Thus, the countries which have high trade openness also have high government expenditures. Devereux (1991), Anderson et al. (1996) and Epifani and Gancia (2008) point to a further channel of influence. They argue that in an open economy, the costs of taxation can be exported if changes in public spending influence the terms of trade. Since governments behaving non-cooperatively do not internalize the cost of taxation that trade imposes onto foreigners, they react to market integration by increasing public spending. All it indicates that globalization may actually protect or even promote public inefficiency. Thus, these studies point to a positive impact of trade openness on public expenditures. However, opponents argue that countries that open up their economies to international trade are likely to have a predilection in favor of free markets and prefer smaller governments. Therefore, open countries go on for laissez-faire arguments and limited taxation to maintain price competitiveness and attractiveness for foreign investment and human capital, or at least to prevent domestic firms from relocating. According to conventional wisdom, integration of markets should reduce the effectiveness of domestic policies and put competitive pressure to reduce government activism. Since a large public sector may cause a loss of international competitiveness (Alesina and Perotti 1997), it may lower the demand for exports and employment, and favor the outflow of mobile factors (Gordon 1983; Wilson 1987; Persson and Tabellini 1992). Now according to tax competition theory, this suggests that more economic integration will tend to reduce tax rates, possibly leading to smaller governments and a downsizing of the welfare state. In literature, it is called efficiency hypothesis (see Schulze and Ursprung 1999). To be brief, the basic tenet of compensation hypothesis is that citizens would demand more public expenditures in response to increased trade openness. While the basic tenet of the efficiency hypothesis is that governments may collect less taxes and can hardly run budget deficits in response to increase in trade openness. The reason is that mobile factors may easily disapprove of unpalatable tax policies or lax budget policies by moving abroad. This would ultimately lead to a tighter expenditure policy. The net effect of the opposite forces of the compensation hypothesis and of the efficiency hypothesis is therefore rather uncertain from a theoretical point of view and it is basically a matter for empirical investigation. Thus, the ultimate impact of trade openness on government size is theoretically blurred. Rodrik (1998) first conducted a detailed empirical investigation of the relationship between trade openness and government size. Rodrik concluded that there is a positive association between openness and the size of the government. He suggests a unidirectional causality that goes from openness to government size. Based on this evidence he argues that there may be a degree of complementary between markets and governments. Moreover, he suggests that the causal relationship between trade openness and government size can be explained by the compensation hypothesis. More dependency on foreign trade means that domestic economy is dependent to some extent on the development of its trading partners, which, in turn, gives incentives for government to provide social insurance against international competitiveness. The results of some other studies are in accordance with the findings of Rodrik e.g. see Commander et al. (1997), Garrett (2001), Balle and Vaidya (2002), Adserà and Boix (2002), Albertos (2002), Bretschger and Hettich (2002) and Kueh et al. (2008); all these studies support the compensation hypothesis of Rodrik. Similarly, Epifani and Gancia (2008) argue that globalization may have led to (inefficiently) large governments. Recent contributions, however, have challenged this result, suggesting that either the size of governments has not changed to mitigate the effects of greater openness (Islam 2004) or that causality from trade openness to government size is not supported by data (Molana et al. 2004). Similarly, Benarroch and Pandey (2008) find no evidence of a positive relationship. Rather, their causality tests show that larger government size leads to lower openness, the opposite of what Rodrik finds. Liberati (2007) and Clavallo (2007) also tested the compensation hypothesis of Rodrik but the findings do not support the hypothesis. They conclude that government size has not changed to moderate against greater external risk, or that causality does not run from trade openness to government size, or that openness leads to less volatility. Alesina and Wacziarg (1998) and Garen and Trask (2005) conclude that country size is the key and small countries are more open. They find only weak evidence in support of compensation hypothesis. Abizadeh (2005) argues that as small open economies liberalize their trade, the size of government decreases. Iversen and Cusack (2000) show that trade openness does not has any effect on government transfers and government consumption. Thus, there is now a growing empirical literature that shows weak evidence regarding the robustness of and validity of how Rodrik (1998) rationalizes his findings. As it stands, therefore, the empirical literature on the relationship between trade openness and government size is not conclusive, as different studies support a positive relation, the absence of any relation or a negative relation. The lack of consistent findings suggests that the relationship between government size and trade openness may be idiosyncratic, requiring further study of country events to uncover systematic links, if any. Literature on the relationship between trade openness and country size is scant in Pakistan as this issue has not yet received any attention. This paper tries to fill this gap to some extent as this the first study of its type which is conducted in Pakistan. In this paper we examine whether there exists evidence of any association between trade openness and government consumption in Pakistan using regression analysis. Previous studies use cross-section data and generate sample points for individual countries by averaging over time. In doing so, important information regarding heterogeneity and short run dynamics are lost. Therefore, we will use annual time-series data for Pakistan for the period 1947–2009. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section “Openness and Government Expenditures in Pakistan” provides a brief history of trade openness and government expenditures in Pakistan. The methodology is discussed in “Methodology”. Section “Data and Empirical Results” presents the empirical findings and discussions. Section “Sensitivity analysis” gives the sensitivity analysis. Final Section concludes the paper.",6

Mohsin,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"One of the important facts of modern financial theory is that stock returns are affected by arrival of new information. This fact has laid down the foundation for a rich literature investigating the role of information in financial markets. One important aspect of this literature focuses on the effects of microeconomic announcements on various markets including currencies, bonds and equities. Monetary policy announcement is one of the important macroeconomic announcements and there have been eight regularly scheduled meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) per year since 1981 in America. Similar is the case of UK and other developed economies. A lot of studies have been conducted to analyze the impact of monetary policy announcement on aggregate and sectoral stock returns. In Pakistan, these meetings were conducted on irregular intervals but from 2005 onwards, monetary policy committee of the central board is conducting regular meetings. To the best of our knowledge, no body has analyzed the impact of monetary policy announcements on aggregate and sectoral returns in Pakistan. Thus the use of stock market returns should help to identify a direct and immediate effect of monetary policy and improve our understanding of transmission mechanism. Stock markets play an important role in assessing the economic conditions of any economy. Exchanges help in mobilizing savings for investment which in turn benefits for several economic sectors such as commerce, agriculture and industry, resulting in a higher productivity levels and stronger economic growth. With this role of the stock market, stock returns can significantly affect the performance of the financial sector as well as the entire economy. Stock markets are notoriously sensitive to changes in monetary policy. But this sensitivity may vary across different economies. Andersen and Bollerslev (1998), Jones et al. (1998), Berry et al. (1994) Mitchell and Mulherin (1994), Ederington and Lee (1993), Cutler et al. (1989), Roll (1988), Bomfim et al. (2000), Kuttner (1999), Roley and Sellon (1998), Thornton (1996), Jensen and Johnson (1995) and Reinhart and Simin (1997) measured the financial market’s reaction to monetary policy actions by following event study approach. Bernanke and Kuttner (2005) established the linkage between monetary policy shocks and stock returns. They highlighted the fact that market participants take their financial decisions by considering the expected policy actions. Bernanke and Kuttner (2005), Poole and Rasche (2000), Berument et al. (2007), Bredin et al. (2005), Gregoriou et al. (2009), used Kuttner’s (2001) futures methodology where federal funds rate changes were decomposed into expected and unexpected interest rates to analyze the impact of Monetary Policy shocks on US stock returns. This study is an effort to add to the literature enlightening the impact of monetary policy announcements on stock returns by analyzing the Pakistani stock exchanges. Pakistan is an emerging market and not been much studied. This study will be a value addition in this regard. Objective of this paper is to analyze the impact of monetary policy announcements on the stock returns in Pakistani market. As a first step of our analysis, we analyzed the impact of monetary policy announcements on aggregate stock returns by using event study methodology. Aggregate stock returns were measured as the first difference of the natural log of the daily closing value of the KSE 100 index. We constructed the economic impact of event by using stock returns observed over relatively short time period. A 31-day event window is employed, comparing of 15 pre-event days, the event day, and 15 post-event days. A 250 trading day period prior to the event window is used as the estimation window for each event/announcement (MacKinlay 1997). Returns were estimated by using ARIMA (p, d, q) on the estimation window. Abnormal returns were calculated by taking the difference of actual returns and estimated returns from 1998 to 2010. T test was applied to check the null hypothesis that event has no impact on the aggregate stock returns in Karachi Stock Exchange. Then, we decomposed the interest rate in anticipated and un-anticipated components by Hodrick–Prescott filter because unlike the developed economies, short term interest rate future contacts were not available in Karachi Stock Exchange. Secondly, we checked the impact of anticipated and un-anticipated interest rates on aggregate stock returns through multiple regressions and Engle–Granger co-integration by taking monthly data from 1998 to 2010.",3

Although its hazardous form has been present for many centuries, it was first recognized as a social problem with the introduction of factory system in the late eighteenth century in Great Britain. Since then, it has become the focal point of the researchers, scholars and different organizations. International labor organization (ILO), and UN General Assembly not only tried to remove its curious form but also suggested different policies to discourage it. Different definitions of child labor lead to controversy among different groups and organizations. International conventions define “child labor” as activities such as soldering and prostitution (New International Magazine 1997). Whereas, UNICEF (1997) give tentative definition of child labor as “the regular, full-time employment of children under a legally define age in factories, stores, offices, etc.”. There is also a disagreement about the estimated values of child labor and the labor force participation rate of children aged 10–14 years suffer from both statistical and conceptual problem (Neumayer and De Soysa 2005). Statistical results of international labor organization (ILO 1996, 2002) and Human Rights Watch (HRW 1996) state that there are 250, 211 million children (18% of children aged 5–14 are economically active world wide) and 115 million working children in India alone while 13 million in Pakistan, respectively. Asia has the largest number of child worker; the percentage of child labor is highest in Africa. UNICEF “state of the world’s children report” says that although the exact number is not known, it is surely in the hundreds of million or 158 million children that are globally involved in labor as shown region wise in Table 1 below. This huge difference in the estimated values of child labor in UNICEF, ILO and HRW may be because of different definitions of child labor. Statistical figures prove that child labor is the problem of both developed and developing countries. After its attack on India and Bangladesh, Pakistan is going to become the victim of child labor with increasing rate and exploitative forms such as small work shops, household work, and causal mining. However, the contribution of world organizations, economists and researchers is worthwhile in order to eradicate child labor. Different constitutions pertaining to this problem have been passed by the UN General Assembly (1989), Footnote 1 ILOFootnote 2 (the minimum age convention 138) and Islamic republic of PakistanFootnote 3 that can play a vital role in controlling child labor, if implemented. Some economist suggest to boycott the products manufactured in industries involving child labor, while at the same time some of the researchers believe that boycotting product manufactured through child labor may force these children to turn to more dangerous or exhausting professions, such as prostitution or agriculture (Ranjan 1999, 2001). According to some researchers international policies such as trade sanctions is the best tool to eradicate child labor (Grossmann and Michaelis 2007) while other scholars believe that child labor can be removed by promoting the trade. In fact, it is this controversial link between trade liberalization and child labor that provide motivation for this study. However, different studies are conduct on regional base that provide best policy option for that region. Since, Pakistan is also blamed for child labor and remained a victim of trade sanctions; it also deserves a separate research to find out the determinants of child labor. The objective of this study is to trace out empirically the relationship between child labor and globalization along with some other important aspects in Pakistan. The study is defined in six sections, second section explains the brief review of literature, third section is about the description of the model while fourth and fifth sections elucidate the variables and interpretation of the results, last section also recommends some policy implications.",1

Due to the importance of innovation for business and economic growth, research on determinants of innovation development attracted considerable attention in the literature (e.g. Atuahene-Gima 1995; Chandy and Tellis 2000; Danneels and Kleinschmidt 2001; Hult et al. 2004; Laursen and Salter 2006). One stream of literature explores internal factors that drive innovation (Cohen and Levinthal 1990; Trott 1998; Conner and Prahalad 1996; Eisenhardt and Martin 2000) while other focuses more on external factors. Importance of external factors for innovation development is introduced in literature in early market pull models of innovation (von Hippel 1978). Another notable example comes from Porter (1990) who finds strong competition, demanding customers and aggressive suppliers the factors that affect firms’ capabilities to innovate. Notwithstanding the importance of innovation for economic growth, both the literature and the analysis of the available data have revealed that in the case of transition economies, the innovation activity is rather subdued. This is in particular evident in transition economies that lag in their development behind more advanced transition countries. In such cases, it is important to analyze what the dominant factors leading to innovation in the lagging countries are, in order to be able to adjust relevant policies. Without innovation capacities increases, the lagging countries would not be able to create lasting conditions for sustainable growth. In this paper we analyze the innovation propensity of firms and investigate their determinants in EU candidate countries. Specifically, we compare four countries: Croatia, FYR Macedonia, Montenegro and Turkey. Both Croatia and Turkey belong to the group of catching-up countries, according to European Innovation Scoreboard 2009 (EIS 2009)Footnote 1 meaning that innovation performance of these countries is below the EU-27, but increasing over time. The average growth rate of innovation performance in catching-up countries over 5 years is 5.5%. Turkey is among moderate growers while Croatia is slow grower. The number of patent applications in these countries also indicates low level of innovativeness. For example, Eurostat reports average of 113.94 patent applications to the EP per million of inhabitants for EU-27 average in year 2006, while the comparative number for Croatia is 7.77 and 2.57 for Turkey. The latest available Eurostat data on applications to USPTO repeat the story. The average for EU-27 countries is 40.37; Croatia had 2.74 and Turkey 0.11 patent applications in year 2003. To the best of our knowledge, the determinants of innovation propensity have not yet been quantitatively analyzed in the literature for the specific group of countries, mostly due to the limited data sources. Due to this reason, our analysis encompasses both external and internal factors of innovation development. Since the countries have expressed their interest to join the European Union, the analysis of their innovation activity is also important from the aspects of future joint innovation policy. Thus, the results of the analysis performed in this paper should contribute to the literature as well as to the discussion on policy design. The structure of the paper is following. Model and Data presents the data used and proposes the analytical framework. Estimation Results and Discussion reveals the results of empirical exercise. The last section sums the conclusions.",4

These legal systems have now to deal with an era of unprecedented religious diversity producing paradoxes that stress the issue of secularism. We are in other words witnessing the deconstruction of traditional Western religious uniformity. At the same time, the phenomenon of globalisation is leading to an increasing blurring of the line between the public and the private sphere. Religious creeds are becoming ‘more and more deprivatised’, in a sense, seeking a greatly increased role in the public space as well as the political arena, in the other. As a result, the reconciliation of constitutionalism and religion through secularism is becoming increasingly difficult and, at times, harshly contested. The debate about the presence of religious signs (crucifix, headscarf, niqab, kirpan etc.) and places of worship in public spaces, including urban spaces, are clear examples of that. All this also explains the intensive process of updating the State’s legislation in religious matters, like family law matters. In 2001, for example, the Portuguese Parliament approved a new Act regulating freedom of religion. France has just redefined its relation, including the financial aspects, with Islam. In 2006 Spain implemented new laws for financing religious creeds. Norway has hanged its ecclesiastical regime, in which there is no longer an established Church. In Canada, after the 2006 Supreme Court’s sentence about Multani’s case (Supreme Court of Canada 2006)—which dealt with freedom of religion guaranteed in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms—according to some polls, up to 91% of Quebecers of all origins disagree with the Court’s decision allowing the kirpan at school. These are clear evidences of the fact that many—and perhaps very important—legal instruments created for carrying out secularism in “monocultural” societies (where there was at least a consensus over the basic constitutional law) do not meet any more the needs of a changed Western multicultural community; precisely because those instruments have been clearly tailored on traditional creeds’ requirements and, therefore, they are not able to meet the demands of current age of diversity. After brief considerations about the freedom of religion principle, deeply connected with the conceptions of separation and collaboration between the secular State and Churches (par. 2), in this article I will analyse two case-studies, France (par. 3) and Canada (par. 4). In particular, I will point out to some specific legal approaches, namely the French laïcité as well as the joint governance approaches and relative instruments which have traditionally carried out secularism in Canada in family law matters. I will try to demonstrate that, as in the past, even in a contemporary constitutional system questions related to secularism seem to consist in the imperative balance between the universal need for a peaceful coexistence and the equal protection of specific religious–cultural rights: not only the rights of a group to be different, but also the individual rights within these groups, considering that individual rights include equality for all before the (secular) law. From here stems the more pressing tension—or dilemma—between “unity” and “diversity”, which poses a crucial question: can the “machinery” of contemporary constitutionalism recognise and accommodate cultural–religious diversities?

Apart from the common goals of democratization and marketization observed in other areas (Karl and Schmitter 1995; Linz and Stepan 1996), the post-communist countries were characterized by state and nation building (Hall 1996; Kuzio 2000). The latter bring to the fore two concurrent issues. On the one hand, there is a re-emergence of ethnic identities suppressed under communism through propaganda and repressive means. In the aftermath of regime change, people sought to rediscover themselves, to identify values shaping their identity, and thus ended up with specific claims in the beginning of the 1990s (Gherghina and Jiglau 2011). On the other hand, such feelings were fueled by remnants of conflicts and territorial disputes in the pre-communist period. Such a context raised problems to those countries characterized by increased ethnic, cultural, and religious pluralism. The usual suspects for potential sources of conflict in the region and as challenges to democracy were the Hungarians in Romania and Slovakia, the Turks in Bulgaria, the Russians in the Baltic States, and the complex ethnic mosaic in Yugoslavia. However, with the significant exception of the war in Yugoslavia, the ethnic relations in none of the other states turned into significant and persistent scales of violence. Focusing on the former countries of the Warsaw Pact countries, Horowitz (1993, 19) indicates an empirical negative correlation between the degree of democratization and the ethnic divisions in society. The ethnically homogenous Hungary, Czech Republic, or Poland made faster progress compared to the divided Bulgaria, Romania, or Slovakia. On the same note, Podoba (1996, 285) claims that political and economical reforms are easier to implement in those states where ethnicity is not a salient issue and where political and social forces that would gain ground by using a nationalistic, anti-minority rhetoric are marginalized. Based on these perspectives, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slovakia appear as relevant cases for the study of ethnic representation. Apart from the troubled transitions—Bulgaria and Romanian often falling behind the post-communist group—they are characterized by geographically concentrated and mobilized ethnic minorities: the Turks in Bulgaria and the Hungarians in Romania and Slovakia. The ethnic parties formed are relevant actors on the political scene since 1990 until present, obtaining parliamentary representation in all national legislative elections. Despite a similar electoral success, the ethnic parties display divergent paths of representation. This article analyzes these trends and thoroughly explores the development of these ethnic parties in a comparative perspective. In doing so, our qualitative study uses process tracing to illustrate the behavior of each ethnic party within the domestic party system and to illustrate their roles in the transition to democracy. The unit of analysis is the ethnic party and their development is traced from 1990 until the most recent elections from 2010 in Slovakia. This exploratory study is the first systematic attempt to compare the longitudinal development of the ethnic parties in CEE and one of the first relevant attempts to conduct a comparative case study on the most relevant ethnic parties in post-communist Europe, most of the literature concerning them being composed from single, longitudinal, case studies. The first section of the paper reviews the literature about ethnicity and conceptualizes this key term with a focus on the CEE region. Each of the following three sections represents a short case study for the ethnic parties, pointing out the main elements of their existence in the last two decades. The fifth section compares the three cases and includes a thorough discussion of their similarities and differences.",4

Many scholars devoted attention to the ongoing changes that characterize the so-called local production systems in their opening-up process. Such studies entailed a variety of perspectives, some of them of a pure economic nature, others comprising economics and management, but significant contributions mixed sociology with the above disciplines in what is probably one of the most useful frameworks to understand the governance of inter-firm relations, namely the Global Value Chain (GVC) approach. Since the end of the 1970s, scholars have highlighted the relevance of local production systems as key drivers in the rapid industrialization of some Italian regions, lead by a thick web of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) embedded in bounded geographical spaces. Yet, this topic has attracted further attention in the last decade since many Italian industrial districts, especially those specialized in low-tech industries, have suffered from a fierce competition by emerging economies. This determined a progressive erosion of market shares firms could retain at domestic and at international level, leading sometimes to foreclosures and to the unexpected inability of local production systems to act as a buffer for those unemployed workers living locally. Some policymakers attributed this socialization of losses to the strategy of district lead firms as they abandoned local suppliers for foreign ones, causing a rapid rise in local unemployment, especially among low-skilled workers. Therefore, if Italian districts are no more able to reintegrate locally a great deal of workforce is because of the architecture of global production systems, networks and the inner structure of both absolute and comparative advantages. It is instead much more appropriate to look at the benefits the local system may obtain by its opening-up through lead firms and to their capability in socializing not only the losses but also the gains arising from internationalization. In the last decades, in addition, the mainstream literature on industrial districts has progressively shifted its attention on the evolutionary paths followed by Chinese industrial agglomerations. Since the economic reform process inaugurated in 1978, industrial districts have deeply contributed to the Chinese economic development by enhancing competitiveness and income levels, promoting new entrepreneurial opportunities and accelerating industrialization and urbanization. The peculiarities of Chinese industrial agglomeration, together with their uneven geographical distribution and their fast-growth tracks have acted as important incubators for SMEs, attracting the attention of several scholars. In particular, some studies have stressed the influence of lead firms in pushing SMEs towards higher growth rates, through learning by doing and by imitating opportunities. Even if it is believed that leading enterprises largely determine the structure of Chinese industrial districts, it is possible to highlight that the international development of SMEs is mainly driven by social and ethnic connections between local industrial agglomerations and foreign markets. The evolution of Italian and Chinese industrial districts shares a set of common features, although their international spread has been characterized by different paths. The present contribution indeed stresses that these development tracks can be represented by an image and its mirror reflection. In particular, the driving forces exerted by larger district firms mainly determined the international spread of Italian SMEs, which sometimes suffered from a loss in those traditional characteristics historically featuring the milieu (for example, and to some extent, social cohesion). Conversely, the transnational expansion of Chinese district SMEs is just partially determined by lead firms, but mostly by ethnic drivers, namely social capital and embeddedness. This paper is organized as follows. Section “The Italian Example: From the Traditional District Model to the GVC Framework” describes the theoretical shift from the traditional study of the district based on Marshallian economies of scale to the GVC framework once dealing with internationalized firms. Section “Lead Firms: A Threat to Social Cohesion Within Industrial Districts?” provides an assessment of the possible threats to social cohesion determined by Italian lead firms that commit to exports and/or FDI. Section “The Chinese Example: The International Evolution Through Ethnic Layers” depicts the role played by Chinese industrial districts in pushing the growth of their national economy, attracting FDI inflows thanks to the thick web of ethnic networks, whilst “Industrial Districts in China: What Role for Lead Firms?” stresses the relevance of Chinese lead firms in fostering the outward projection of SMEs. Section “Ethnic Chinese Networks and Cultural Determinants” underlines how lead firms are linked to the Chinese ethnic networks, and, in this respect, “Embeddedness and Social Capital: Mutual Trust and Knowledge Diffusion” describes how forms of competitive advantages are thus created and developed when embeddedness and social capital interact. Finally, the section “Conclusion” offers some conclusions.Footnote 1
 Many Italian and international scholars applied Marshall’s (1890) seminal contribution on the role of external economies of scale to provide explanations for an empirical and relevant phenomenon, i.e. industrial districts. The Florentine School initiated by Beccatini (1979) contributed to a vast and rigorous study of local production systems, placing emphasis on the interaction between two elements within a bounded geographical space: the presence of a community of people and a community of firms. In such a context, the aim of general community benefits prevailed over self-interest behavior. However, the architecture of local production systems deeply changed in the last decade, indeed the picture drawn above is to some extent obsolete. The emergence of new global powers in the competitive arena determined a reassessment of the role played by small, medium and large firms. In fact, the empirical scholarship recorded a sensible decline in the number of small firms, as some of them died, while larger companies purchased some others. Firms became, on average, larger (Grandinetti and Nassimbeni 2007) mostly to cope with foreign companies that were achieving increasing internal economies of scale. Many medium and large-sized firms have been pursuing an upgrading path as they concentrated in-house resources on higher value activities, such as branding, designing, licensing, while saving on strictly manufacturing phases that were outsourced or off-shored. An appropriate research tool is thus needed to study this brand new kind of firms and their local and international organization. Useful applications and interesting insights may derive from the GVC approach (Gereffi et al. 2005) that describes the relevant reorganization of the division of labor within specific sectors on a global dimension. In particular, this scholarship emphasizes the role of few firms in setting the governance and coordinating the inter-firm networks on a wide scale. The management of business-to-business relationships may rely on alternative mechanisms, where hierarchy or market approaches are just two extremes of numerous possibilities. Development and upgrading of GVCs may positively affect the growth of local manufacturing firms and systems (Humphrey and Schmitz 2002; Schmitz and Knorringa 2000) in terms of employment (dimension and composition) as well as product, process or functional innovation. By looking at the Italian empirical evidence, scholars isolated two different strategies leading district firms to face with the challenges of globalization (Crouch et al. 2001). The first group is made up by few firms featured by high-qualified competencies, oriented towards excellence and with a worldwide reputation. Firms, instead, that opted for a redefinition of business strategy by product upgrading or by investing in brand and sales channels compose the second group. These paths often require break-through innovation and significant investment efforts, in terms of both value and specificity, assets that district firms do not usually have. Of paramount importance is indeed the shift from a focus on marketing to the control of the manufacturing. This may occur in different ways and at different stages according to the speed of a firm’s internationalization. In the early stages, even lead firms may look for suppliers of cheap inputs without any additional requirement to the counterpart. However, once the production network established abroad has become wide and complex, the lead firm will likely look for those vendors able to supply quality goods and additional services up to international standards. Such selection affects the whole portfolio of a company’s suppliers and it may lead to a substitution of local vendors with foreign ones, if the former are not able to meet lead companies’ requirements. Lead firms may thus decide to vertically integrate by acquiring local suppliers, a choice that could threaten the internal cohesion of the district, but it may also be a stimulus for upgrading, through product, process or functional innovation. If it is the case, smaller firms acting as suppliers for a larger company preserve their independence and may provide with their goods not only the district, but also a wider territory, both nationally and internationally. What seems more challenging from our perspective is to provide a precise assessment of lead firms’ behavior in Italy and to the best of our knowledge, just few scholars devoted attention to this issue from the perspective depicted above (Chiarvesio et al. 2010; Giansoldati and Salmasi 2010), sometimes tackling it in indirect ways.Footnote 2
 Chiarvesio et al. (2010) performed a very detailed analysis on Italian district firms, by merging the results of an ad hoc survey with data retrieved by the Research Department of Banca Intesa. The survey focused on 45 industrial districts in Italy, out of 199 identified by ISTAT (the Italian National Institute of Statistics) and explicitly considered four typical “Made in Italy” industries, namely home furnishings, engineering, fashion and food. Within the selected sample, authors focused only on larger firms, and picked their characteristics not only using the survey data but also integrating them with face-to-face interviews. To understand firms’ strategic orientation in the process of internationalization, authors considered two drivers of analysis, namely “the degree of a firm’s control over foreign markets in terms of commercial power and the geography of sourcing that is the relevance of sourcing and/or the presence of FDIs outside the district. Based on cluster analysis, four main models of firms emerged: (1) traditional local firms; (2) traditional local firms with commercial outlets abroad; (3) firms with upstream suppliers; (4) open networks” (Chiarvesio et al. 2010). The “open networks” typology deserves particular attention. It resembles lead district firms that adopted the most complete model of internationalization, i.e. companies able to integrate a strong and direct control on final markets worldwide with a remarkable international extension of the supply chain and manufacturing activities. Yet, the success of “open networks” firms also depends on the local supply base they can rely on. According to Chiarvesio et al. (2010), local networks of suppliers are still important (56%) as they can guarantee flexibility and speed in manufacturing processes. More than half of “open networks” firms developed FDI (versus 11.8% on average) and international supply chains in addition to local ones. Most importantly, just 10.9% of “open networks” replaced internal activities with foreign ones and only 30.4% of them replaced local suppliers with foreign supply chains. This evidence is useful to understand the impacts of “open networks” on district dynamics. In fact, through FDI, firms broaden and strengthen the local value chain internationally, by melting local capabilities with skills and knowledge available in the global economy. District-based lead firms present different features from district firms that are not leaders. This obvious statement found confirmation in a recent study performed by Giansoldati and Salmasi (2010), who applied the heterogeneous firm framework (Melitz 2003) to distinguish Italian district firms that internationalize (either through trade flows or FDI) from those that do notFootnote 3 within a sample made up of 500 firms. The empirical strategy looked first at the average value of selected firm variables, namely turnover class, size (in terms of number of employees), human capital endowment, registered trademarks, existence of a R&D and design department, together with a series of performance indicators, such as ratio of earnings on added value and productivity. Results of the descriptive statistics show that internationalized firms, present higher turnover levels, employ, on average, a higher number of workers, which are usually more qualified than those employed by mere domestic firms. In addition, internationalized firms are more likely to have a dedicated in house R&D department, and are normally able to deposit a slightly higher number of trademarks than their nationally bounded peers. As far as performance variables are concerned, the ratio of turnover on added value is consistent with the previous results, but no clear-cut evidence is found for productivity (computed as the ratio of sales on the number of employees). Recent scholarship asserted that a range of circumstances, as those reported in the above section, may undermine both social and economic vitality of industrial districts, which obviously depend on the interactions between two major subsystems, i.e. a community of people and a population of firms. The emergence of lead firms is one of the possible threats to this well-known reassuring picture, as companies may substitute the industrial district as coordinating instances and cost scrapping as a strategy that bypasses quality enhancement undermining the industrial district as a system (Ramazzotti 2010). However, this is not always the case, as lead firms often pursue a very complex set of strategies that encompass not only costs saving but also quality improvements. Indeed, most successful lead companies shifted the core of their activities to high value added functions, whilst retrieving resources from repetitive unskilled tasks. It is thus clear that such a strategic option may affect local employment of low qualified employees, but the company as a whole will benefit from increasing economies of scale and, therefore, from higher returns.Footnote 4 Thus, a policy intervention is needed to find the appropriate and feasible way to socialize not only the losses deriving from internationalization, but mostly, the gains from opening-up internationally. This should be a likely outcome of the two distinct strategies firms may choose to follow when coping with foreign fierce competition. The principal alternative to such destructive competition is the high road of constructive competition, based on efficiency enhancement and innovation; i.e. “through economic gains that make wage gains and improvements in social conditions feasible, as well as safeguarding workers’ rights and providing adequate standards of social protection” (Sengenberger and Pyke 1992). Starting from the premises that internationalized lead firms abroad are more likely to be in better “shape” than their domestic peers, it seems reasonable to look for appropriate strategic and administrative measure to tackle the economic and social cohesion issue. In particular, it is worth calling for a political regulatory plan able to restore some of the features of the “competitive” nature of district inter-firm relations. To follow this “high-road”, public policy cannot just play a supplementary role, but it must change the incentive structure and the institutional and choice contexts to modify that path. In this respect, social cohesion and trust within business and industrial relations are crucial to compare the Italian district experience with the Chinese one. Such a comparison lies on a fertile theoretical ground provided by the GVC approach. Indeed, among the five governance typesFootnote 5 supplied by Gereffi et al. (2005) the relational value chain seems appropriate to catch common features of both Italian industrial districts and Ethnic Chinese networks, as they actually are networks characterized by complex interactions between buyers and sellers, which often lead to mutual dependence and high level of asset specificity. Such a web normally shows up when traded good specifications cannot be codified, transactions are complex and supplier capabilities are high. Tacit knowledge is exchanged between the parties, pushing a lead firm to outsource some fragments of production and gain access to complementary capabilities provided by the supply base. Relationships between the parties are managed through reputation or family and ethnic ties, and they are handled through mechanisms that impose sanctions on the party that breaks a contract. As we shall notice in the following sections, this latter argument represents one of the key features that characterizes operations and regulations of ethnic Chinese networks. Chinese industrial agglomeration has a long history. Pottery and porcelain production districts have been developed around the town of Jǐngdézhèn since the Suí Dynasty (589–618), while silk producers have created particular forms of agglomeration in the city of Wújiāng for hundreds of years (Han 2009; Sun et al. 2007). Nonetheless, the development of industrial districts has attracted the attention of many scholars since the implementation of China’s economic reform in the late 1970s. Industrial districts in China have grown with a rapid pace in the last decades. Since 1978, Chinese path towards reform has pursed growth, development and competitiveness through a three-tier process, based on marketization, decentralization and globalization, that has reduced state control over the economy, empowered local opportunities and strengthen international economic relations (Wei 2007). Institutional changes, low-cost labor advantages and a set of pervasive incentives and constraints contained in the reform framework have unlocked the opportunities of industrial agglomeration by attracting FDI inward flows mainly to coastal regions (Wei et al. 2007). As stated by Rawski (2005), due to the relevant differences that characterize Chinese regions, the process of capability building is influenced by a geographic determinant. FDI, industrial exports as well as the progressive increase in manufacturing capabilities are mainly concentrated in China’s coastal provinces (Chen 2009). In particular, it is possible to identify three main economic areas: the Běijīng Hub (BJH), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Pearl River Delta (PRD). BJH consists of the municipalities of Běijīng and Tiānjīn, YRD comprises the municipality of Shànghǎi and part of the provinces of Jiāngsū and Zhèjiāng, and PRD consists of Hong Kong and the province of Guǎngdōng. Wang (2008) stressed that more than 90% of industrial districts in China are concentrated in the coastal provinces and in their neighboring areas. Coastal regions of Zhèjiāng, Guǎngdōng, Jiāngsū, Shāndōng, Fújiàn and Hébĕi host 414 industrial agglomerations, 77% of the total amount of industrial districts analyzed in his study. With reference to their size, Wang (2008) suggested that each agglomeration on average comprises 923 firms, with sale revenues of 5 billion Yuan and 51,883 workers. Regional differences influence the degree of provincial specialization and industrial agglomeration. In particular, Zhèjiāng and Jiāngsū provinces host 44 districts specialized in textile products. Garment districts are mainly concentrated in Guǎngdōng, while ceramics and glass products are widely distributed across the country, particularly in Shāndōng, Hébĕi, Fújiàn and Guǎngdōng (Wang 2008; Prodi 2006). The uneven geographical distribution of industrial agglomerations in China has followed the unequal distribution of economic development between inner and coastal regions. Chinese authorities have been promoting the progressive relocation of SMEs and the creation of new industrial districts in the Western regions to push the economic growth towards those areas. As a consequence, SMEs can benefit from local government incentives and from lower labor, land and environmental costs (Wang 2008). Industrial agglomerations have been significantly contributing to the Chinese economic development, by improving competitiveness, creating employment opportunities, increasing income levels and promoting the dual process of urbanization and industrialization. Besides, the development of industrial districts in China has pushed towards the creation of new entrepreneurial activities, playing a central role in driving the rapid economic growth of several provinces (industrial districts produce nearly half of total GDP of Zhèjiāng, Guǎngdōng and Jiāngsū). Furthermore, Chinese industrial districts have represented one of the most important attraction poles of FDI in the last decades. Low labor costs, liberal policies, political stability and improved infrastructures have contributed to the increase in FDI inward flows (Kueh 1992). However, although the regulatory framework for FDI has been gradually enhanced since the implementation of the “open door” policy, property rights and contract laws are still weak, corruption and legal uncertainties affect the local market whereas language and cultural differences create additional barriers to foreign investors (Han 2009). Thus, it is believed that cultural constraints have a deep impact in influencing FDI sources. In particular, Han (2009) and Fan and Scott (2003) stated that the strong and pervasive ethnic and cultural ties of China with neighboring Asian countries, namely Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and overseas Chinese in other countries have heavily influenced the spatial aspects of FDI flows and have represented a fundamental determinant in the evolution of industrial districts in the Chinese coastal regions. In spite of the peculiarities of Chinese and Italian industrial districts and their evolutionary paths, several scholars also stressed the existence of many common characters between them. In particular, Wang (2008) suggested that both share a small family-based firms background, a deep functional specialization along a specific value chain and both contribute to shape the GVC. Fan and Scott (2003) and Wang (2001) argued that some features of the flexible specialization of the “Third Italy” model, namely the close and specific relationship among firms, low barriers to entry and exit as well as external economies created by a thick web of interlinks, can also be observed in Chinese industrial agglomerations. Bellandi and Lombardi (2009) highlighted that the two models reveal strong sector similarities, mainly in terms of local development factors and in the combination of regional competencies. Nonetheless, the two authors considered that cultural distance and specificities based on local traditions deeply affect the above-mentioned relationship. Moreover, they focused on the differences in terms of social relations within the district. In the Italian case, inter-firm cooperation is based on social cohesion which consists in the involvement of economic actors in order to better achieve their own goals and involves trust and confidence (Ramazzotti 2008). In the Chinese case, the social network is based on family ties, guānxì and other cultural determinants that represent an alternative and complementary way to implement profitable transactions. Several scholars highlighted the role of lead firms in pulling smaller enterprises towards virtuous paths within the district and alongside the value chain (Ramazzotti 2008; Beccatini and Rullani 1993). This influence can also be found in Chinese industrial agglomerations. Nonetheless, due to its economic, institutional and cultural peculiarities, such a relationship is characterized by specific meanings within the Chinese market. SMEs have been playing an important role in the development of industrial agglomerations in China, although local governments have mainly focused their attention towards large-scale firms within industrial districts. Indeed, SMEs have to face several problems related to bank loans access, land use, water and power supply together with the creation of a wide and deep network of profitable business relationships. This is why SMEs can benefit from the presence of larger firms within the district (Han 2009). As suggested by Wang (2008), leading enterprises largely determine the future of Chinese industrial districts and enhance knowledge and information diffusion, employees’ training and business management skills. Following the leaders, SMEs can grow rapidly through learning-by-doing and by imitation, taking advantage of the peculiar features of industrial agglomerations. Thanks to large-scale opportunities and closer links with government institutions that characterize leading enterprises, and State-owned enterprises (SOEs) in particular, SMEs can easily access to specialized inputs and wider market opportunities reaching higher levels of efficiency, labor productivity and product quality. Lead firms within industrial districts are able to stimulate Chinese SMEs to join GVCs, in particular, thanks to their networks based on social capital and embeddedness levers (Wang 2008). This suggests that locally embedded cultures, norms, values and social relations are able to deeply influence not only the dynamism of agglomerations in China, but also FDI and export decision. Private Chinese SMEs are nurturing global ambitions and are planning strategies to go abroad following the example of large SOEs (Miroslawski 2008). In particular, we argue that Chinese cultural determinants and ethnic networks have a deep impact on the development paths pursued by Chinese SMEs abroad. Several scholars highlighted the role played by ethnic networks and cultural determinants in influencing Chinese FDI flows (Han 2009; Bellandi and Lombardi 2009; Wei 2007; Fan and Scott 2003; Wang 2001). Ethnic networks may be considered as clusters of interpersonal linkages, acting as bridges that help overcome formal and informal economic barriers and create inner markets for more competitive strategies abroad, by means of kinship, friendship and same-origin ties. Ethnic groups are made of individuals who voluntarily endorse unwritten rules and conform to behavioral codes that are widely accepted by the community as a distinctive feature. Every economic decision is socially determined. It is also socially monitored and, in case of infringement, socially punished, by ostracism or even the expulsion from the community. The concept of ethnic networks is strictly related to the sharing of a common cultural background nurtured in a specific location. Nonetheless, the issue seems much more complex and has to be analyzed in terms of Chinese social relations and cultural factors. The significance of family and group ties, the concepts of guānxì, “face” and harmony, Confucian ethics and philosophy deeply characterize the Chinese socio-cultural framework and influence individuals’ and group behavior as well as interpersonal and business relationships. These cultural determinants are deeply embedded in the overseas Chinese communities and represent a steady and strong bond with the motherland. Ethnic Chinese can generate distinct social business networks, which play an important role in the development of a region (Han 2009). Hence, the progressive integration of Mainland Chinese SMEs into these networks can be anticipated (Miroslawski 2008). There are approximately 60 million overseas Chinese, mostly living in Southeast Asia where they make up a majority of the population of Singapore and a significant minority in Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Vietnam. As many others ethnic groups living outside their country of origin, overseas Chinese have developed several associations, both formal and informal, traditionally based on kinship, linguistic ties and same-origin bounds. Originally, they were born for helping and assisting the community, in particular the neo-immigrants. Later on, these networks gradually evolved into basic information and knowledge centers. This has somehow eased up the possibility, for some Chinese SMEs, in connection with the gradual opening up of China to the market economy, to gain access to organizational resources, capabilities, capitals, information and lower transaction costs through mutual trust, reciprocity and protection that ethnic networks are able to provide (Miroslawski 2008). The existing networks of overseas Chinese can be considered as keys to unlock the opportunities of local markets and business communities for Chinese SMEs. Therefore, ethnic networks can accelerate the internationalization of Mainland Chinese companies. Nevertheless, even if we recognize the existence of cooperative links between overseas Chinese networks and Mainland China firms, we should not underestimate the role played by competition between them. In particular, as stated by Yeung (2006), Mainland China export-oriented industrialization together with a surge of outward FDI after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, lead to a rising competition between national exporters of manufactured goods and overseas Chinese companies. Indeed, Mainland China low-price competition eroded market shares and profits of ethnic Chinese firms in their home countries, as well as in their export markets. Paradoxically, much of the abovementioned Mainland China exports spread from companies established by ethnic Chinese capitalists from East and South East Asia. In order to better understand the impact of ethnic networks in the internationalization process of Chinese SMEs, ethnic networks will be discussed by using two main core concepts, namely embeddedness and social capital. These two elements provide a logical framework that is able to underline the influence of ethnic networks in terms of growth and competitiveness. In particular, we suggest that embeddedness provides a form of allocation efficiency and social capital can be considered as a strategic evolutionary condition for creating new competitive advantages for Chinese SMEs abroad. Embeddedness defines a situation in which the behavior of individuals of a social group is characterized by a high degree of cohesiveness. Therefore, it is believed that individuals, not only do not take decisions independently from one another when some assets are not available for free, but that they also respond in a different way to diverse contexts. Embeddedness allows to gradually integrate individual choices with socially co-determined results (Granovetter 1985). This would provide a sort of compromise between individualism and a form of egoism, influenced by other people’s fortune, dependence, gratitude, admiration or trust. As a consequence, ethnic networks may help to prevent or, at least to reduce, some transaction costs, information asymmetries and organizational failures that derive from cultural differences in institutional settings. Nonetheless, embeddedness should be integrated by the concept of social capital in order to better take into consideration the dynamics of socio-economic systems and understand the main advantages for Chinese SMEs. Social capital can be interpreted as an additional intangible asset generated by the individual involvement in ethnic networks. This concept creates the opportunity to benefit, without additional costs, from the abundance and the reproduction capacities of resources generated by two main phenomena, namely networking and knowledge sharing. Networking arises from a flexible, decentralized, and coordinated system of production able to provide cheaper products and services, thanks to a vast array of economies of scale and scope that cut across institutional barriers and create sub-systems of rules, which are partially protected from external threats. Knowledge sharing represents an additional advantage that ethnic networks are able to reach. Ethnic networks, thanks to the firm ties between their members, are able to change the regime of knowledge use. Being replicable at very low costs, knowledge is in itself a re-productive resource. If a piece of knowledge is utilized many times, its use-value can be very high. A new value-multiplier can be considered as the result of all the possible utilizations of a certain idea. Hence, the faster and the larger the diffusion of knowledge, the greater the use-value generated for a society (or a community). The members of the ethnic network are, therefore, able to apply and adapt free knowledge to a very large number of problems and this process will create advantages for the entire network. The embeddedness and social capital layers that characterize the relationships between ethnic Chinese networks and Mainland China can create profitable environments for Chinese SMEs. In particular, thanks to the before-mentioned cultural bridges that ethnic networks are able to generate, Chinese SMEs can take full advantage of the processes of factor accumulation of Chinese groups and their specialization in some industries, usually characterized by lower financial, normative and technological barriers. Through them, SMEs can easily find all the information necessary to choose a suitable destination, raise the needed capital, activate the first contacts to build profitable business relations and enjoy a certain degree of protection in the new environment. Ethnic Chinese networks are also very efficient in creating a wide net of information based on knowledge and trust. This would lead to a better match between demand and supply of labor with the right skills and to a better relationship between employer and employee at least at its initial stage, when neither knows each other, and therefore they must rely upon the available institutions. Finally, ethnic networks are also helpful in overcoming the problem of information asymmetries in an agency relationship (Ambrosini 2006) by supplying SMEs with easily accessible information that suddenly become a public good. Sharing cultural factors and a common language is of course of great importance to prompt the generation of inner markets. This situation strengthens business opportunities by creating barriers to exit and generating an incentive for ethnic firms to hire ethnic workers. However, ethnic Chinese networks are influenced by Chinese cultural universe and its linguistic mixture. The difference between Mandarin and Cantonese, for example, and the vast arrays of local languages and dialects spoken in inner China, contribute to the creation of a broad range of sub-communities. This internal fragmentation of languages and cultures is thus able to produce new sub-hierarchies. Nonetheless, it is also able to provide new horizontal connections that enrich the available pool of knowledge, by means of specialization and a mutual exchange of information. Gould (1994) and Rauch and Casella (1998) stressed these aspects, by arguing that this kind of networks promotes the development of bilateral trade, by supplying market information and an easy way to compare the quality of services, in order to find the most suitable distributors. By endorsing evidence from the analysis of dispersed ethnic groups, Kotkin (1992) confirmed that the wide geographical dissemination of Chinese entrepreneurs represents a core element in the process of building mutual business opportunities. Weidenbaum and Hughes (1996) suggested that the members of the “bamboo network” and the leading businessmen know each other personally and do deals together, with information spreading through an informal network rather than through more conventional channels. Even if we recognize the power of ethnic networks in leading Chinese SMEs international development, we acknowledge that the gradual intensification of trust relationships within an ethnic network may strengthen its insulation and build up barriers to entry that may become detrimental for further competing with the outside world. This represents a danger for growth as stressed by Grabher (1993) with the concepts of “ties that bind” and “ties that blind”. Yet, many elements of separation remain, as ethnic firms still hire Chinese workers only, and prefer to deal with Chinese firms as sub-suppliers. Therefore, this situation needs to evolve from “embeddedness only” into “connectedness for growth” by enhancing social capital. To be able to survive and possibly extend its scope, a community needs in fact to re-distribute its benefits to itself, at least to some extent. Better relationships based on networking and mediated by trust contribute to the creation of incremental value and further competitive advantages within ethnic Chinese networks by reducing the risk associated with intra-network transactions. As a consequence, reciprocity and trust are able to strengthen horizontal connections and, by this way, to turn business opportunities into another form of social capital that builds upon internal segmentations. Therefore, by enhancing the overall pool of information available, new opportunities are generated for Chinese SMEs, as a result of new applications, or new developments, of existing economic ideas, in terms of products, processes, services, product characteristics and applications (Pine and Gilmore 1999). Even if ethnic Chinese networks keep a strict relationship with a particular economic and socio-cultural background, we should not minimize the importance of the degree of openness of the network. On the one hand, a closed network is deemed to progressive weakness, if it is not contaminated with innovations and ideas coming from outside (Maggioni and Bramante 1995). On the other hand, an open network represents a fundamental resource for a wider and deeper exchange of information with external markets. However, these network extensions can be organized following different patterns. In Italy, for example, several scholars underlined the importance of lead firms, which act as meta-bodies, in interfacing the local excellence with external markets and complementary competitive advantages (Grandinetti and Tiberi Vipraio 2001). In the Chinese case, we argue that ethnic networks represent fundamental attraction poles for Chinese SMEs. Beyond this role, we would also like to suggest that they act as important deterrents against rule infringements, thanks to social monitoring and community ostracism. In particular, (Greif 1989) argued that ethnic Chinese networks can provide a very efficient set of sanctions against opportunistic behaviors. This is also confirmed by Weidenbaum and Hughes (1996): when an agreement is not honored, the entire Chinese community would not do any business with the rule breaker. Ethnic networks, by means of kinship and family ties, are able to support Chinese SMEs abroad by providing financial resources, creating and disseminating a huge amount of knowledge and managing information interfaces between local competence and global markets opportunities thanks to a flexible integration between network knowledge and global competitive advantages (Grandinetti 1999; Beccatini and Rullani 1993).",2

On the one hand, the world economy became intensely geopolitical in character: a fragmented political space, which tripled the number of borders between nations in the past 50 years (World Bank 2009, p. 97). On the other hand, the world grew ever more integrated, facilitating increased flows of persons, goods and services, and capital. The recent resurgence of regional agreements, based on preferential concessions among member countries, has only reinforced the trend towards a polarized globalization. How could we make sense of these contradictory evolutions of present-day globalization? What are their implications for the future of international relations? This paper aims at contributing to a better understanding of the emerging pattern of integration in the world economy. The focus here is on the territorial configurations of a societal development. Authors like Krugman (1991) or Ohmae (1995) proclaimed the end of the nation state as the geographical unit of analysis, but were less successful in finding a proper replacement to account for the territorial limits of development. The existing analytical setting confusingly concludes that areas of growth are “relatively rich for reasons that have to do more with culture than with geography” (Krugman 1991, p. 95). Political economy theorists are not used to map territories of development because there is no primer of the kind. Statehood and geography matter for development, yet a pure geopolitical approach seems incomplete in an increasingly interdependent world economy, where goods and productive factors moving relatively unhindered engender less visible (and quantifiable) linkages in the form of global value chains, regional productive clusters or social networks within areas of variable geometry. A mounting scholarly trend (e.g. Porter 1990; Krugman 1991; Enright 1993; Martin and Sunley 1996; Ricart et al. 2004; World Bank 2009) suggests that contemporary economies’ growth is intimately linked to a complex web of territorial evolutions originating in sources as diverse as agglomeration, distance, exchanges or culture. From this viewpoint, phenomena across territories and populations and not necessarily between or within countries supposedly hold the key to understand today’s economies. As this paper argues, a world view based on ‘nation states’ may gradually have to give way to ‘contexts of development’ as the analytical framework which more appropriately accounts for the interstitial fabric of historical, social and cultural linkages between atomized actors (countries, firms, and individuals). The strength of the new vision rests on varied lines of interdisciplinary thinking; no discipline claims exclusive right to a new paradigm. To be sure, such claims in fact exist. Economists, for example, produce a generalized ‘theory of optimal country size’ (e.g. Alesina, Spolaore, Warcziarg 2005) based on a trade-off between the economically viable size of country and politically acceptable heterogeneity of multiple jurisdictions. However, the modelling confines conclusions to abstract configurations of polities and ex post views of the geography of development, while key factors of historical evolution such as social or cultural values are conspicuously absent. We look at the modern views of identity patterns in the modern economy and attempt to illuminate the factors that could explain the new logic of inter-regional commonality in an interdisciplinary context. The argument is advanced in two sections. We begin with an overview of contemporary thought to emphasize the need of embracing a broader analytical perspective for a reliable representation of the spatial configurations of economies. The ‘nation state’ has considerably lost its explanatory power once new theories appeal to a considerably larger set of determinants to account for a country’s development. To figure out this set of circumstances we propose a three step exercise evolving around ‘contexts of development’ by emphasizing analytical constraints related to identifiers, core functionalities, and policy scope. Paper’s key insight implies that drawing contexts boundaries is deemed necessary to organize a qualitative assessment to reveal the contextual origins of development and, ideally, to capitalize on them by suggesting tangible policy implications.",

N. Simões,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"Over the past 30 years the world has witnessed an unprecedented movement towards democracy in many countries (see e.g. Papaioannou and Siourounis 2008). At a time when political freedom is increasingly a precondition for providing financial support to developing and transition countries, the identification of its costs and benefits is of major importance to the definition of efficient economic policies and to the economic and social development of any country. The relationship between political freedom or democracy and economic growth has been comprehensively analyzed in the literature but remains controversial (see e.g. Barro 1999). While some studies contend that there is a negative effect of democracy on economic growth, arguing that the economic and social goals of democracy are often incompatible with economic growth (see e.g. Heo and Rubenzer 2004), others suggest a positive relationship based mainly on the positive effects of democracy on physical and human capital accumulation (see e.g. Saint-Paul and Verdier 1993). There is also no consensus on the direction of causality with time series studies showing that the pattern of causality differs significantly among countries (see e.g. Narayan and Smyth 2006; Tang and Yung 2008; Uysal et al. 2010). Furthermore, the relationship between democracy and economic growth can occur through different channels and might depend on other growth factors that influence and are influenced by democracy (see e.g. Tavares and Wacziarg 2001). It is thus not surprising that empirical studies have reached ambiguous results (see e.g. Barro 1996, 1999; Papaioannou and Siourounis 2008), depending on the sample, time period, and estimation methodology used, pointing in this way in the direction of country-specific approaches that apply time series methodologies to enhance our understanding of the sign and direction of causality of the relationship between democracy and economic growth. This paper applies the above approach to the case of Portugal for the period 1960–2001. Portugal represents an interesting case study since it has recently undergone transition to a democratic political system. We investigate whether moving from a repressed political system, as was the case prior to 1974, towards a democratic political system enhanced or not economic growth. To test the direction of causality between democracy and growth we apply Granger causality tests and analyze impulse response functions within a VAR model with four variables: output growth, physical and human capital accumulation, and an index of democracy. We also investigate in this way a possible channel through which democracy influences economic growth, the accumulation of human capital. The results suggest that causality between democracy and economic growth in Portugal is bi-directional. As for the impact of democracy on growth, while in the short run democracy has a negative effect on economic growth, in the long run this effect becomes positive. Democracy also leads to an increase in educational attainment which in turn implies more economic growth. Economic growth in Portugal seems thus to have been both a cause and a consequence of democracy, with democracy having a positive long-run effect on economic growth, both directly and indirectly, due to its positive influence on accumulation of human capital. The remaining of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a brief review of the literature on the relationship between democracy and economic growth. “Empirical Methodology, Data and Results” presents the VAR model, the data used and the results from the Granger causality tests and impulse-response functions. The last section concludes.",3

The reasons of the downturn are widely acknowledged and can be ascribed to unstable fundamentals, weak institutions, and delayed structural reforms as well as to unfavourable external shocks.Footnote 2 Much less known are, instead, the reasons of growth reversal in the subsequent period. In the 1990s, indeed, many Central and Eastern European Countries entered a new political and economic process. The collapse of central planned economic systems and the fell of the Berlin wall, which signed the end of the communist regime, have boosted deep economic, political and institutional reforms aimed at improving competitiveness and allocative efficiency, categorized as the transition phase. It was expected that after some short transitional GDP contraction, the new system based on market liberalizations would have led to recovery and faster growth. On the contrary, the process has evolved along different paths across countries and regions. The severe economic transition already occurred in Central Eastern Europe (CEE) was much more devastating and prolonged for both the groups of SEECs and of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), which still exhibit many cases of unsuccessful transition. Although the entire group of transition economies of Eastern Europe includes 25 countries, in this paper we examine specifically the Albanian economy and comparator SEECs. For the Albanian economy the initial years of transition have been rather dramatic. Notably, GDP decreased for three consecutive years 1990, 1991, 1992 (reaching only 60% of GDP in 1989) but the transition was even more striking when in 1997 the establishment of financial pyramid schemes boosted a social and political crisis as well. The conflict in Kosovo provoked a further critical phase which resulted in the new crisis in 1999 in which all the countries in the region were hit even those not directly involved in the conflict. The new transition phase for Albania started in 2002Footnote 3 when for the first time the GDP level exceeded that of 1989.Footnote 4 It is worth noting that Albania is the only country in South East Europe (SEE) which has increased its own GDP level since 2000 achieving a value of 116.3% in 2002 and a value of 163.0 in 2008. Some other economies in the region are at an average of 80% or less of the initial GDP, others have just recovered (Croatia and Macedonia), whereas countries of Central Europe and the Baltic’s are at an average of more than 150% of their initial GDP levels (EBRD Report various years).Footnote 5 However, against this recovery, it should be recalled that Albania still is one of the poorest country of the region and of the whole group of transition economies. Although the analysis of growth determinants and performances of transition economies should be related to the period of high growth, we believe that transition is best viewed as an ongoing process that started at the beginning of the 1990. As regards other SEECs, the Balkan war ended in 1999 and much of the countries experienced massive economic and political disruption. Real output declined by 35%. Since this date, however, these countries recovered rapidly and many factors contributed to better functioning of markets and economic growth.Footnote 6 Again, even if growth patterns of SEECs have evolved in the last decade, by recording faster economic growth than CEECs, their GDP levels after almost 20 years from the start of the transition are just one third than that of the CEECs where economic reforms were most consistent and influential. Therefore, the scope for these countries to grow faster is still significant, especially after the contagion effects of the financial crisis that has slowed markedly the GDP growth rates showing the vulnerability of the whole region. Our aim in this work is to investigate the growth of this group of countries, partly neglected by the literature on transition economies and cross-country growth estimates. Indeed, the reason for this neglect was motivated by short historical series of the data as well as their reliability. In the last period, however, data quality has improved and many empirical studies have focused on this group of countries (Grey 2000; Liebscher et al. 2005; Stokovic and Skuflic 2006; Uvalic 2010). Overall, a huge literature has explored the growth factors of transition economies as a whole and what emerges is that standard growth factors have had a weak impact on growth (Campos 2005; Merlevede 2003; Iradian 2007). Earlier studies have attributed either to structural reforms, as supported in different papers by Fisher and Sahay (2000) and Fisher et al. (1998), or to initial conditions (De Melo et al. 1997, the main drivers of growth in transition countries, whereas others attribute to tight monetary policy to combat inflation, as well as to external shocks, the poor growth performance in most Balkan countries (Grey 2000). Since most of the studies concerning the SEECs are primarily descriptive, we contribute to this literature by adding further empirical evidence for Albania and other countries in the region. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. After providing in “A Theoretical Overview and Some Stylised Facts” an overview of the macroeconomic framework of growth which discusses the main variables to be included in our model, in “Data and Methodology” we will present empirical evidence on the impact of key factors on real income per capita growth rates. When lack of data does not allow us to conduct growth regression analysis our empirics will be based mainly on charts and tables of data. The last section concludes.",

Among the internal threats, the most serious are corruption, poverty, and the underdevelopment of democracy, as well as both overt and latent ethnic conflicts. In certain regions, such as the South Caucasus and Central Asia, hostilities can be easily transformed into the interstate conflicts, thereby adversely affecting a highly fragile security system. In this context, two recent tragic events in the post-Soviet space must be noted: the August, 2008 Russian–Georgian war and the ethnic disturbance in Kyrgyzstan in June 2010. Although the aftermaths of both events were different, each offered vivid evidence of the destructive strength of the ethnicity factor in those areas plagued by simmering ethno-political conflicts. For the first time since the proclamation of the independence of Kosovo, as a result of the Russian–Georgian war in August 2008, a new revision of the borders in Europe occurred that legalized the violation of a sovereign state’s territorial integrity—namely, that of the former Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic. The Russian recognition of independence of Abkhazia and South Ossetia transformed the Abkhazian and South Ossetian conflicts from ethno-political, intra-state armed conflicts (as at their onset in the early-1990s) into exclusively inter-state and territorial ones. However, one cannot consider the partly recognized independence of these state entities as the final resolution. Rather, they have entered into a prolonged latent stage; this situation also must be seen to some as a consequence of the revision of the state borders. Moreover, the ethnic component of both conflicts acquired additional strength and spread more widely. To overcome and demolish stereotypes of the enemies dominant in Georgian, Abkhazian, Ossetian and Russian societies, long term and massive effort of all involved parties will be needed. In the meantime, the Russian–Georgian war of August 2008, in the area of the South Ossetian conflict, demonstrated clearly the fragility of peace in the South Caucasus. Any violation of the military and political balance reflects not only on the South Caucasus security system, but also on that of the countries adjacent to the region. In the case of the Kyrgyzstan, a new wave of bloody clashes between the Kyrgyz majority and the Uzbek minority in June 2010, which must be seen in the context of internal political instability and the conflicts between the Kyrgyz clans for power, demonstrated the ways in which the ethnic factor can be manipulated namely redirecting public dissatisfaction externally: representatives of the ethnic Uzbek minority were designated an internal ‘external’ enemy. This inter-ethnic conflict failed to develop into inter-state hostilities and at first glance did not damage the Central Asian security system; it was stopped without external intervention. However, it had grave and dramatic consequences of a dimension no less than those of the Russian–Georgian war: It demonstrated the dangerous depth of the existing ethnic conflicts and the threat of their extension throughout the vulnerable region. These examples indicate the impossibility of attaining enduring peace in these conflict-ridden areas without an understanding of the mechanisms that trigger the ‘image of the enemy’. This article analyzes the trends and mechanisms that give rise to this image. It does so by reference to the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, one of the most complicated, hard-to-solve, and long-lasting disputes in the European area.",4

Bruna Zolin,Adriano Rasi Caldogno,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Although agriculture has lost much of its importance over the last decades, especially in terms of macroeconomic indicators, such as percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), employment rate and gross value added (GVA), rural development is still a European priority, particularly with regard to utilised land, population and social and environmental aspects. In addition, rural and agricultural developments are crucial for the reduction of poverty and famine, achievement of food and energy security, conservation of employment rates in agricultural and related sectors together with the consolidation of land and the preservation of natural resources (European Commission 2010a, b). Starting from the Agenda 2000 framework (European Council 1999), Rural Development Policy has become the second mainstay of EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The current strategic approach (2007–2013) is included in a single regulation and its validity is extended to all European Union member states. The main objectives are to improve the competiveness of agriculture and forestry (economy), the environment and the countryside (environment), the quality of life in rural areas and to encourage diversification activities (territory). The strategy is based on different levels of rurality, expressed in three axes, and it is the same across the entire surface of the European Union. The current European delimitation of rural areas is the result of the application of OECD methodology [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) 1994a]. According to this methodology, the level of population density is the common and only criterion adopted. This indicator can be interpreted as a direct function of attractiveness: the higher the population, the more attractive an area and vice versa. Other methods and other criteria, i.e. related to the agricultural sector, are not considered (such as the weight of the agricultural sector in GDP or in the employment rate). Therefore, the European Union surface is classified into three categories as follows: territory which is essentially rural (50% of the population is concentrated in communities with a population density of <150 inhabitants per square kilometre), relatively rural areas, where between 15 and 50% of the population lives in rural communities, and the remainder is essentially urban. Although rural areas have been analysed in many countries and using different approaches, there is no single internationally recognised definition [Biggs and Ellis 2002; Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) 2001]. The crucial point is that any common demarcation might be seen as an artificial imposition. In fact, the current Member States have different economic, social, environmental and territorial contexts (European Commission 2010c). For the identification of specific and appropriate rural development policies, each State might need to define what is rural and what is not. In fact, despite a slow but progressive convergence process among the 27 European Union member states, there are still significant disparities between urban and rural areas (Zolin 2007) and among regions within the countries. These disparities are extremely large due to dissimilar conditions, such as landscape, weather, climate, accessibility, socio-economic conditions, infrastructure and peripheral position. Since the first edition of its structural funds reform (1988), the European Union has invested a large amount of resources towards alleviating these differences (accentuated with EU enlargement) and guaranteeing a minimum level of population in the under-populated areas and an adequate standard of living for the rural inhabitants. While longstanding rural–urban disparities and disparities within regions are (and were) at the centre of the European rural policy (Zolin 2011), new threats (and in a certain sense opportunities) come from other factors outside the EU such as globalisation, the information revolution, the current economic and food crises and the political instability of the Arab world. Building on previous experiences in the field of rural development policies and the socio-economic consequences of world turmoil, the communication of the European Commission on the CAP towards 2020 (European Commission 2010a) has adopted balanced territorial development as its objective within the CAP. This objective aims at: supporting rural employment and maintaining the social fabric of rural areas; improving the rural economy and promoting diversification; allowing structural diversity in the farming systems, improving conditions for small farms and developing local markets. The EU consists of 27 countries with a large variety of cultures, economic systems, and population sizes (European Commission 2010c). This makes it difficult to supply the same instruments to all the European countries (OECD 2003, 2006). Moreover, due to the recognised distortions created by current OECD methodology, the European Commission has decided to adopt a relatively new typology of predominantly rural, intermediate and predominantly urban regions (Buckwell 2009). This Chapter aims to assess and compare the current and proposed strategies and methods of classification for urban and rural areas. The analysis will take into consideration the European socio-economic situation (population, economic development, and employment), the agricultural and forestry sectors (GVA, employment, land use, farm structure, and productivity), the levels of diversification and the quality of life (gainful activity, material and immaterial infrastructures) and the state of the environment (land cover). The final aim is to evaluate whether both current and new strategies are coherent with territorial needs and whether the inherent territorial disparities require a tailored definition and policy. The statistical parts of this note are mainly based on data collected by Eurostat. At the time of writing, 2007 data are the most recent, except for bed places (2008) and age structure of population (2008).",5

This is particularly significant in the post Soviet regime, when the nation has distanced itself from state-mandated output and investment targets by freeing-up markets and allowing a market-clearing prices allocation system to evolve. A key aspect of Yeltsin’s “privatisation” initiative was the freeing-up of commercial and industrial enterprises from direct state control by allowing major corporations to become privately owned through a mechanism of management buyouts and issuance of vouchers and shares. The objective of the programme was to enable private economic agents to decide on the optimal level of production and investment, which would have led to an improved firm performance. However, as is generally accepted, such reforms led to a severe economic contraction due to the absence of a well-defined and enforceable property rights system, which is necessary for the emergence of efficient market institutions. The absence of the latter facilitated the ability of various ruling elite groups, such as the new business quasi-owners and local bureaucrats to engage in extensive asset-stripping. For instance, the managers of Soviet enterprises were able to attain large ownership stakes in the newly privatised companies at subsidised rates due to their superior knowledge of the Soviet bribing system, which prospered during the Yeltsin era (Shleifer and Vishny 1998). Managerial ownership became concentrated, and the new “owners” seized assets and subsequently sold them to their own private businesses (Rapaczynski 1996; Alexeev 1999; Black et al. 2000; Sonin 2000; Kuznetsov and Muravyev 2001). The “loans for shares” scheme is often referred to as the most scandalous in the history of privatisation (Hedlund 2001). Banks and other financial institutions provided government with loans in exchange for shares, which were treated as collateral in the case of government’s default on repayment of debt. Unsurprisingly, after the default, auctions for such shares were held in a non-transparent way, where banks with close political ties to the government obtained top bidding positions (Appel 1997). Also, such auctions restricted the number of bidders in order to keep share prices artificially low. As a result, shares of Russia’s most desirable firms were placed with a very small number of banks for significantly less than they were worth (Dyck 2002; Puffer and McCarthy 2003). In turn, such banks colluded in wealth redistribution, as they reallocated resources to favoured industries and individuals instead of acting as intermediaries between borrowers and lenders (Thomson 2002; Spicer and Pyle 2003). Local and regional government officials also managed to gain control over many corporations (Guriev and Rachinsky 2005) and used their increased power to pursue wealth-tunnelling agenda. In summary, it can be argued that the new class of quasi-owners was uncertain about its future income claims, hence it increasingly favoured shorter, when compared to the social optimum, investment horizons, an extreme case of which was asset-stripping. Such practices led to a dramatic fall in production and extensive capital flight (Stiglitz 2002; Hoff and Stiglitz 2004; Ross 2004). Stiglitz (2002) believes that as privatisation occurred without the essential prerequisites, such as a well-defined property rights system, it did not offer incentives for effective private ownership—instead it offered an incentive to “grab” the resources and engage in the tunnelling of wealth. Consequently, following a period of economic stagnation, the Putin regime re-introduced an active role for the state in the economy in order to constrain wealth diversion by corporate insiders and local bureaucrats. Significantly, although it can be said that at present many Russian corporations can be defined by ownership and corporate governance characteristics similar to that of Western corporations, there is also an important difference in that the central state, without re-nationalising the firm, often has a major ownership stake as well as corporate governance presence. While a strong property rights system still remains Russia’s long-term goal, the new partnership between the central state and private investors may have acted as an effective substitute to constrain wealth-tunnelling behaviour, as is demonstrated by improved performance of Russian firms during the Putin regime. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. “Corporate ownership in Russia” examines literature which focuses on immediate post privatisation corporate ownership trends as well the re-emerging role of the central state with the advent of the Putin regime. “Corporate ownership in Russia” provides detailed ownership data for firms which traded on the Russian Trading System (RTS) stock exchange over the 1998–2006 period, signalling that the central state did indeed become a corporate co-partner in firms defined by high hold-up costs. The section also presents a rationale for the government’s role in firm ownership structure and its corporate governance.",2

Efforts at formalizing economic and trade cooperation have been ongoing ever since. And as of January 1998, 17 Arab countries were members of the Greater Arab Free Trade Area (GAFTA) agreement. Algeria later joined the agreement in 2005.Footnote 1 This paper aims at estimating the counterfactual value of trade that Algeria would have had with the GAFTA members had it joined the agreement in 1998. I use the now renowned gravity approach to model bilateral trade between the GAFTA members. Techniques from the microeconometric treatment evaluation literature are typically used to answer such questions that involve counterfactual estimations. Recently, these techniques have been applied to study macroeconomic questions. The idea is that standard OLS regressions suffer from an endogeneity problem that does not allow proper causal inference. A number of methods have been introduced to deal with the problem of selection bias in observational data. These include matching estimators, difference-in-differences regressions, regression discontinuities and instrumental variable estimators. These techniques, despite being instructive for a number of reasons, are still not able to deal with a major endogeneity issue of OLS estimates—unobservable country heterogeneity. Therefore, panel data set-ups using within-country (i.e., time-series) information have been suggested to control for unobservable time-invariant country characteristics, that can be eliminated by taking time differences. Building on the above, this paper will apply synthetic control methods (SCM); a recent econometric tool developed by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and extended in Abadie et al. (2010). SCM are close in spirit to the matching estimators and difference-in-differences models, but rest on weaker identification assumptions that allow the effects of unobserved confounders to vary with time. The synthetic control is basically a linear combination of untreated countries. These comparison countries are selected based on their similarity to the treated before the treatment, both with respect to relevant covariates and the past realizations of the outcome. In our context, after a regime change (e.g., GAFTA agreement) takes place in Algeria, SCM can be used to estimate the counterfactual situation of this country in the absence of the regime change by looking at the outcome trend of the synthetic control. The paper is divided into four sections. Section “Gravity Model” will present the model. Section “Synthetic Control Methods” will present the results and their interpretation. Finally, section “Conclusion” will conclude.",13

The developing countries can make economic progress by capital accumulation through profitable investment projects by giving equal opportunities to local and foreign investors. The process of globalization enhances the importance of the FDI for developing countries. The FDI is considered as an engine for economic development, employment and productivity improvements through technological and managerial spillover in developing countries (Lipsey 2002). The objectives of economic development can be realized without opening the door for foreign investors. Therefore, the attraction of foreign capital is main priority for policy makers. However, the developing countries could not attract FDI inflows at the level achieved by transitional countries. The literature highlighted various economic and noneconomic factors that determine the inflow of FDI (Gunseli et al. 2004; Martin and Wachtel 1993). Market size, population, capital formation, infrastructure facilities and productivity of factor of production and trade openness etc. are the main economic factors that influence the behavior of investors, hence determine the amount of FDI inflows. Recent literature emphasis the importance of political uncertainty factors in attracting FDI. Political uncertainty or political risk is generated by number of factors like institutional quality, internal and external conflict, military and religion involvements in national politics, socioeconomic and investment conditions of host country in determining the inflows of FDI. Political risk can be accessed by considering all these factors in host country environment (Jun and Singh 1996). Busse and Hefeker (2005) have identified the importance of political risk as precondition for FDI inflows in host country by analyzing data on 83 developing countries. Thomas and Worrall (1994) have pointed that institutional risk can become a serious threat for investment contract enforcement signed between multinational corporations (MNCs) and host country government. In this way, the return on capital can be deteriorated in those countries having more chances of political risk. Thus; instead of focusing on traditional economic determinants, it become important to equally consider the political factors for FDI inflows. Another strand of literature focuses on macroeconomic policy uncertainty in developing countries that may limit FDI inflows from developed countries. The macroeconomic policy uncertainty may include the uncertainty regarding monetary policy, fiscal policy and exchange rate policy. The literature highlights various channels through which macroeconomic policy uncertainty may affect FDI inflows. It is generally argued that higher inflation, indicator of macroeconomic policy uncertainty, makes it difficult for MNCs to predict prices in host country (Fisher 1993). A persistent increase in fiscal deficit in host country is another important channel that may increase uncertainty about fiscal policy and results inform of high taxation rates. A high taxation rates results in high input cost of capital and thus reduce the profit margin for MNCs and finally this reduction adversely impact FDI inflows in host countries. In developing countries, FDI flows have raised after 1980, tremendously. FDI flows have increased from US $10,100 millions in 1986 to US $87,124 millions in 1994. In 2007, FDI flows in developing countries were around US $500 billion. FDI flows have also improved in South Asia on the average US $968.27 millions in 1989–1994 to US $49,176.6 millions in 2008 (UNCTAD 2010). South Asian countries like Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have introduced a wide range of incentives for local and foreign investors. These countries provide facility to foreign investors in avoidance of double taxation, foreign investment protection under the rule and regulation and removing restrictions for foreign investment in different sectors of economy. The share of FDI in South Asia as compare to other regions of the world remains low (Ghani et al. 2010). Now, question is why FDI inflows in South Asia remain low as compare to other region of the world. This is the question that required theoretical as well empirical investigation for South Asian Economies. Ghani, et al. (2010) pointed out that the major bottlenecks faced by South Asia economies in attracting FDI are low institutional quality, bad infrastructure and high cost of doing business etc. Law and order situation has generally deteriorated in recent years that ultimately increase the transaction cost for business. Similarly, regulatory quality is very poor that is challenging issues in South Asia. The poor regulatory quality also increases the transparency problems and processing problem sin business operation. In addition to, macroeconomic policy uncertainty including increase in the inflation rate, persistent budget deficit and exchange rate fluctuations increase the cost of doing business that counter the gains from FDI in terms of volume in South Asia. Theses considerations raise the importance to analyze the role of political and macroeconomic policy determinants for FDI inflows in South Asia. Based on this background, the prime objective of this study is to analyze the role of political risk as well as macroeconomic policy uncertainty in determining the FDI inflows in South Asia. To achieve this objective, we have assumed oligopolistic and imperfect competition environment in host country for theoretical model formulation.Footnote 1 More specifically, we also identify empirical links among political risk, macroeconomic policy uncertainty and FDI inflows.",10

It has also been a much debated topic within development studies. These structures have had a profound impact on economic development of a number of nations in the past. Industrial cluster in Italy have been studied extensively and are still a dominant element within the Italian economy. In Asia, countries like Japan, Taiwan and Korea (Aggarwal and Relations I. C. f. R. o. I. E. 2008) have also experimented with special economic zones at some point in time. More recently, the SEZs in China (Nishitateno 1983) have been at the center of the debate on economic development. This strategy of economic zoning in a particular area has not been a recent phenomenon in India. India was the first Asian country to establish a Export Processing Zone (EPZ) in Kandla (Gujarat) in 1965. These zones however did not kick-start the kind of industrial development that the government had hoped for. With an unclear policy, negligible incentives, strong administrative control and weak infrastructure these EPZ gave mixed results with a rather unimpressive performance. Only eight export processing zones were set up across seven states during the period 1965–2000, locking the area of 2,521 acres with 95,000 people employed. In 2000, the SEZ policy replaced the EPZ policy which stimulated the SEZ activity. Between 2000 and 2005, 11 new SEZs were set up. However the scenario transformed completely after the SEZ act was passed in 2005. As of December 2008, formal approvals were given to 552 SEZs across 23 states. Of them 274 across 16 states were notified. Of the 274 notified SEZs, 101 reported some economic activity Aggarwal (2010). Pyke et al. (1990) defined an industrial cluster as a socio-territorial entity which is characterized by the active presence of both a community of people and a cluster of firms in a bounded area. With the coming up of SEZs across the world, a new found interest has gained a lot of momentum in this field. (Graham 2004); Abraham et al. 2010) among many others have studied the issue of SEZ as an Economic (Wei 2000; Wong and Chu 1984), phenomenon studying the role of FDI that comes in with the establishment of SEZ. (Sampat 2010) has focused on the negatives impact that an SEZ in the local regional occupational patterns and the debate of its contribution towards economic development of the region (Kadir 2010). Scrutiny of the location of the SEZ and its contribution towards a sustainable competitive advantage for any particular SEZ has also been the focus of many debates like (Dhingra et al. 2009) and (Makabenta 2002).The location of the SEZ has been frequently discussed within the economics and management literature. The economic benefits of an SEZ are said to encompass both the state and the firms within the cluster. While for the firm, localizing within a cluster would mean greater contact with supplier resulting in a streamlined supply chain, as well as the economic benefits from fiscal incentives the governments can hope for a increase in exports and an increase in competitiveness which would drive innovation. It would also mean more spill overs which could be taken up by other smaller firms often outside the. Karakaya and Canel (1998) found that the location of the firms is critical contributing factor to the competitiveness of a firm. Other empirical studies show that SEZ that are located in a developed area have more chances of being successful that those that are located in poor area with less industries. Mukhopadhyay and Pradhan (2009) analyzed the relationship between the effect of SEZ on the initially underlined objectives. Their results indicate that the SEZ worsen infrastructure and the cost of SEZ are real while the benefits are not so substantial. The explanatory variables used by them however were indirect as share of urban population, extent of literacy and share of Schedule tribe and Scheduled casts were used. In the present study we extend the analysis by using latest data on direct variables to understand the match or mismatch between the objectives and effect of establishing an SEZ in India. It would also look at a macroeconomic framework under which a country comparison between India and China has also been done. This is important since the SEZ phenomenon in India is primarily inspired by the Chinese model. However, as we see in the proceeding sections their do exist striking differences between the Indian and the Chinese model. While the literature is abundant on policy oriented (Aggarwal 2006, 2011), often prescriptive studies, few have empirically tested whether the motives behind setting up an SEZ have been realized or not. In this paper we look at the case of India and investigate if the purpose behind setting up these economic enclaves is being realized. The objectives of setting up SEZ in India according to the Ministry of Commerce, Government of India are: Generation of additional economic activity; Promotion of exports of goods and services; Promotion of investment from domestic and foreign sources; Creation of employment opportunities; Development of infrastructure facilities. The aim of this is study is to empirically test, with the available data, the extent to which the SEZ Act has served it’s propose. The following section provides an overview of the data available and outlines the econometric methodology used. Section three would outline the results and interpretation of the econometric analysis as well as the Strategic insight into the development of SEZ in India. This would include a discussion on Size effect, National Competitive advantages and comparative advantages that SEZ can offer to the Indian economy. Section four would conclude the study with relevant findings and policy implications.",4

Each of these aspects not only prompted an academic effort to shed light on the theory and empirics of transnational corporations,
Footnote 1 but also determined a vibrant debate amongst policymakers. This is indeed true as labour market issues and trade policies are considered. The relocation of some kind of activities from high-income countries to low income ones to take advantage of factor costs savings, labour especially, has prompted a significant concern amongst low-skilled workers in the developed world. It was just this argument, together with the heterogeneity in the related academic empirical evidence, that pushed policymakers to ride popular fears and suggest measures for protecting domestic employment and supporting firms that are not engaged in the delocalisation of production, especially in times of economic and financial turmoil. In this respect, the spread of MNEs determined a significant re-definition of the ways goods and services are transferred internationally leading to cross border intra-firm or arm’s length transactions, and affecting the ways in which production and distribution networks are built and managed. Indeed, MNEs are key players to understand the extent a territory is internationalised, although the diffusion of (vertically or horizontally) integrated firms across nations is just an option in a continuum, featured also by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In fact, as far as US and Japan are concerned, the texture of internationalised firms is made up mainly of large MNEs that not only conduct operations but are also engaged in distribution, whilst maintaining high value-added functions in the headquarter country. Conversely, firms from continental Europe are mostly of small and medium size and committed to internationalise through arm’s length transaction and forms of non-equity agreements.
Footnote 2
 The present investigation does not rely on the traditional approach that studies the behaviour of aggregate FDI, but instead looks at such phenomena through firm-level data, something now widely applicable thanks to the recent availability of micro-level data on foreign affiliates of Italian firms, i.e. Outward Foreign Affiliate Statistics (OUTWARD FATS).
Footnote 3 Given these brief premises, the aim of this paper is to focus on Italian foreign affiliates and trying to reply to a set of questions emerging by the analysis of country-, sector-, and firm-level data (although with a certain level of aggregation), namely:
 Is the international expansion of Italian firms driven by cost-saving reasons? Or is it attributable to a market seeking motive? Is there evidence supporting both motives? Does such organisational forms vary according to selected industries? To what extent intra-firm transactions are preferred to arm’s length exchanges? Does this ratio vary on the basis of the chosen sector and the country the affiliate is located in? To what extent do firm-specific characteristics matter on this respect? To what extent the so-called Made in Italy productions determine different forms of internationalisation? Are they associated with a vertical structure of the firm or do they push to deverticalisation? Do these results hold for all countries?  In order to match these questions with pertinent answers, we structure the paper as follows. Section “Literature” provides the theoretical background of the contribution, reviewing the relevant literature on the outward projection of firms, Sect. “The Data” describes the dataset, whereas Section “The Empricial Strategy” specifies the empirical strategy. Section “Facts on the Italian Modes of Internationalisation” highlights the results and checks for the validity of hypotheses, whilst Sect. “What about Made in Italy?” focuses on the industrial spread of Italian foreign affiliates. Section “What Role for Local Systems of Production?” supplies conclusions and lines for future research",1

Among the mostly debated issues may be the connection between military spending and economic growth, which has been studied extensively since the seminal work of Benoit (1973, 1978). While a large body of the literature focuses on the relationships between military spending and economic growth, the empirical findings on the effect of higher military spending on economic growth are rather mixed. While a group of scholars (Benoit 1973, 1978; Kennedy 1974; Atesoglu and Mueller 1990; Mueller and Atesoglu 1993; Sezgin 1997, 2000 and Yildirim and Sezgin 2002) argued that defense spending is positively related to economic growth. Another group of scholars claims that defense spending hampers economic growth because of its opportunity costs (Frederiksen and Looney 1983; Dommen and Maizels 1988; Jeong 2000; Dunne and Nikolaidou 2001). In contrast to the above groups, the third set of studies found some mixed and or insignificant results; Biswas and Ram 1986, Alexander 1990; Mintz and Huang 1991, Kollias and Makrydakis 2000). Recently there are a few empirical studies relating to the military expenditures and other macro variables such as real exchange rate (Bergstrand 1992), the black market premium (Bahmani-Oskooee and Goswami 2006), unemployment rates (Kinsella 1990; Payne and Ross 1992; Yildirim and Sezgin 2003; Huang and Kao 2005 and Tang et al. 2009), investment rates (Smith 1977), inflation (Nourzad 1987) and government budget, total deficit, the GNP growth rates, inflation rates, and government budget deficit (Özsoy, 2008). This paper is an attempt to broaden the scope of this issue by examining the relationship between military expenditure and black market premium for the time period 1954–1998 in Greece that is not only one of the weakest in the European Union but is also the highest military spender in NATO and Europe, employing ARDL approach to cointegration proposed by Pesaran and Shin (1999)and Pesaran et al. (2001). The balance of the paper is organised as follows. In “Theoritical Framework” and “Data and Methodology”, we discuss the theoretical framework together with a brief overview of the literature and the econometric methodology. In “Empirical Results”, we present the empirical results. The final section concludes.",1

A major part of this population, coming from Albania, was due to the illegal inflow of immigrants that was almost uncontrolled. The Greek governments of that period tried to manage this migration phenomenon and adjust the entry, residence and social integration of immigrants by voting several legislative measures. By two laws, the Law 1975/1991, followed by the Law 2910/2001, Greek authorities aimed to protect country’s frontier and control illegal immigration. The legislative efforts became more systematic and detailed during the next decade 2001–2010. The first step was the vote of the Law 3386/2005, (Journal of Government 2005), completed by the Law 3536/2007, (Journal of Government 2007); the target was the registration of the immigrants and refugees, the fast issuing of residence permits, the organization and link between administrative bodies related to immigration. The Law 3386/2005 is the regulatory framework of the actual Greek policy on the procedure for the invitation of third-country nationals for work. Third country is considered a non-European Union country. This procedure permits the entry and residence of third-country nationals to work for a specific employer, a determined time period and a specific kind of occupation. Immigrants’ work is divided into dependant and seasonal work. Seasonal occupation concerns more than 80 % of invited workers. The main group of seasonal immigrant workers is the Albanian workers. Thus, the examination of the seasonal workers in this paper refers almost solely to Albanian immigrants. Greece is the principal host country of Albanian immigrants. More than 430,000 Albanian immigrants were legally registered to the population census of 2001 while in the second most important host country, Italy, only 164,000 were registered (Bonifazi and Sabatino 2003), and only some tens of thousands to all other countries (Carletto et al. 2006). As a consequence, Greece is the main sending country for Albanian immigrant remittances. Total Albanian immigrant remittances reached, in average, 13.9 % of the Albanian GDP the time period 1994–2007 (Karafolas and Konteos 2010). Albanian immigrants are the largest legal foreign community in Greece followed by the Bulgarian community that counts approximately 35,000 immigrants in Greece (Gropas and Triantafyllidou 2005). The paper focuses on the entrance of immigrants, on the basis of the demand for immigrants from the employers in Greece for the time period 2005–2010 that is characterized by the new legislative framework of the Law 3386/2005. The paper analyses the evolution of the demand and tries to examine the factors that influence this evolution. Are these factors institutional or circumstantial? An explanation can be searched on the structure of demand by prefecture and category of demanded job. Therefore the paper analyses the demand for dependant and seasonal work by prefecture.Footnote 1 This examination permits to have a more qualitative approach of this movement. The objectives of the paper differentiate it to all previous studies on the immigration movement in Greece even those related to employment issues. No studies examined the effects of the new legislative framework on the evolution of the immigration movement. Vaiou and Xatzimihalis, (1997), examined the role of immigrants in the Greek labor market focusing on the low labor cost. By examining the case of two prefectures, Imathia and Pella, they notice that historically the immigrant population was composed at the beginning from Polish and Bulgarians which in the beginning of 1990s’ were replaced by Albanian immigrants mainly due of the lower cost. Examining the case of the prefecture of Kavala, Karasavoglou et al. (1996) conclude that 80 % of foreigners have seasonal occupations and only 20 % have a permanent work. Most of them were employed in the agriculture sector. On the decade of 2000 a study on the employment of Albanian immigrants in the town of Salonika (the second most important town in Greece), found that 30 % of Albanian immigrants work in the real estate, 24 % of them work in the small industry and 9 % of them work as auxiliaries. The employment at these areas grew up contrary to the decline of jobs in the agriculture of this region (Lamprianidis and Lymperaki 2001). In another study, Kavounidis (2002) found that 34 % of immigrants work in the real estate sector, 26 % of them at cleaning and domestic services and 18 % at the industry as workers. Examining the employment on the agriculture sector and particularly in three prefectures of the regions of Peloponnese, Crete and Epirus, Kasimis et al. (2002), observed that immigrants, Albanian on their majority, tend to replace Greek workers on heavy works. The paper is organized as follow; after the introduction: “The Procedure for the Invitation of Immigrants Based on the Law 3386/2005” examines the procedure for the entry of third-country nationals under the new legislative framework; “The Evolution of the Demand for Third-Country Nationals for Dependant and Seasonal Work” discusses the evolution of the employers’ demand for those immigrants, mainly Albanians, while the last section provides the “Conclusion.”",2

Some Evidence from a Crises Environment,November 2012,Maurizio Polato,Josanco Floreani,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Securities exchanges play an important role in producing liquidity for securities and providing settings for efficient price discovery. Therefore, they fulfill a fundamental function in enabling the flowing of funds from savings to investments. Aside this public function, demutualized exchanges (in particular, listed ones) behave as profit maximizing entities operating in an even more competitive landscape. As pointed out, this was the main rationale for exchange demutualization (see, among others, Grossman and Hart 1986; Steil 2002; Aggarwal 2002; Serifsoy and Tyrell 2006). Obviously, the competitive landscape has been rapidly changing during the last years as new competitors (i.e., electronic communication networks) enter the market. These entities are quite different from traditional exchanges but perform the same functions in a more efficient manner. Increasing competition together with cyclical downturns put pressures on exchanges’ profitability. Therefore, exchanges increasingly react with mergers in order to expand their operations beyond national boundaries and widen their business model. Such developments disclose a new field of research with reference to the economics of exchanges. Whereas the traditional literature encompassed both governance and microstructure issues, the speeding up of consolidation in the industry coincided with a growing body of research dealing with mergers and alliances between stock exchanges. Increasing competition is viewed as the main reason for exchanges to list and negotiate alliances (Fleckner 2006). Other research provides a fine theoretical analysis of the economics of exchanges grounded on network economies’ theory. As pointed out by prominent research, the exchanges industry shares the typical features of network industries (Economides 1993) so as alliances among stock exchanges permit to exploit economies of network, both direct and indirect. This is both a problem of competition and coordination. Competition should be promoted since users should have the right to access all the services related to exchange trading, choosing for each the provider offering better conditions. Coordination is assured as long as exchanges adhere to common standards (compatibility) granting equal access to users (Economides and Flyer 1997). One would expect that by increasing overall liquidity mergers would benefit both exchanges and investors. Shy and Tarkka (2001) find that as long as the cost of access to stock-exchange services remains high, the alliance is able to increase investor utility and raise the profits of exchanges and intermediaries. Andersen (2005) added a further scenario to the analysis by considering a situation in which there is a monopoly stock exchange and by introducing the effects of network economies deriving from increases in liquidity. The findings showed that the consolidation of network externalities leads to an increase in the demand for trading services and a rise in profits for both stock exchanges and intermediaries. Moreover, the pricing of exchange services does not appear to be affected by network factors. Obviously, to the extent that mergers lead to a business diversification, the economics of exchanges is substantially affected. It could be questioned if a more diversified business model coincides with gains in efficiency. Schmiedel (2001) assessed the conditions of economic efficiency in European stock exchanges between 1985 and 1999, while a year later the same author (Schmiedel 2002) examined gains in the productivity between 1993 and 1999 of both stock exchanges that focus on their core business and those that also operate in derivatives and post-trading activities. On the contrary, Serifsoy (2007) adopted Farrel’s notion of technical efficiency and applied his analysis to a sample of 28 stock exchanges. The findings showed that diversified stock exchanges were less efficient than exchanges focused on the conventional cash market. To our knowledge there is a lack of studies investigating the value drivers of exchanges. What are exchanges actually worth is a still opened question. Polato and Floreani (2010) addressed the issue by an in-depth analysis of exchanges value at light of recent mergers. They found that those mergers were settled at multiples incorporating expectations of great increase in volumes traded and profits, in line with previous high growing rates. It was questioned whether such mergers leaded to a stable equilibrium. Now, in the aftermath of the crisis a new wave of consolidation is taking place at a transatlantic level. In this paper we intend to derive multiples for the most recent mergers and compare them with those observed in pre-crisis mergers. We argue that the reasons leading exchanges to merge does not reflect the mere need to counteract the competitive threats coming from rivals or the strains on volumes traded stemming from the crisis. Rather, the forces reshaping the industry structure respond to the strategic goal of reinforcing control over the overall international flows of capital. The paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses the nature of competition in the exchange industry. Then we analyze the most recent mergers in the aftermath of the crisis deriving the related multiples; next we compare such multiples with those at which pre-crisis mergers were settled and derive some implications as for value drivers of exchanges. Finally, we sum up.",

This will be particularly indispensable in considering environmental problems in transition economies, where massive environmental pollutions occurred during the former communist era and have become a serious burden and impediment to sustainable economic development for the present generation. Environmental issues dating from the previous regimes have remained abundant and have resulted in serious risks to the regional and national economies, in terms of polluted lands, poor water quality due to the discharge of toxic wastes, and degradation of ecosystems. The environmental pressures in the transition economies involve environmental liabilities of the previously state-owned companies. The Soviet system placed great emphasis on heavy industries, giving environmental concerns a minor priority when compared with the need for industrial development. After the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), various mines, chemical factories, and sludge damp sites were shut down without appropriate treatments. As a result, the transition economies have had to start their new regimes facing great environmental challenges in the form of high levels of air pollution caused by inefficient industry and transport, increasing drinking water pollution due to industrial discharges and the deterioration of plumbing, and soil contamination due to the hazardous waste in the closed facilities. Moreover, the pollutants on such sites extend beyond the immediate area of the site, affecting adjacent land and property, with some pollutants being widely transmitted to other areas via ground or surface water. During the process of the regime change, which included privatization, land contamination emerged as a primary environmental concern because inherit environmental pollutions substantially discouraged investors’ motivations to purchase lands. To date, a number of research articles have examined governmental policies and firms’ behaviors in relation to the privatization and remediation of the lands (for example, Boyd 1996; Bluffstone and Panayotou 2000; Earnhart 2004; Bluffstone 2007). These studies imply that governmental initiatives on auditing, disclosure of environmental information, and remediation activities are crucial for the success of privatization. Although the previous research agrees on the responsibilities of the government entities, the roles and opinions of the taxpayers who financially support the governmental entities have not been explored fully, apart from de la Motte (2007), who described public participation in the process of privatizing Poland’s water systems during the 1990s. Moreover, regardless of the land privatization goals, remediating polluted land and improving the quality of the environment are essential to reduce health risks for the residents. Because the environmental issues occurred in the Soviet era and have remained a serious environmental burden in the current era, the cause-and-effect relationship among generations needs to be taken into account. Elderly citizens who lived under the previous communist regimes and caused the environmental liability issues, even unintentionally, may now feel responsible for the current environmental pollutions associated with the past regimes. Therefore, elderly citizens may have bequest intentions to create and preserve a better environment for the next generations, which inclines families with children to be willing to pay for environmental improvements. By contrast, however, elderly citizens have a relatively lower life expectancy compared with the younger generations and, therefore, they will benefit less from the environmental improvements. Younger generations, on the other hand, have less responsibility for the environmental liabilities but higher life expectancy, which means they receive greater benefits from environmental improvements. Suitable cost allocations for funding environmental management actions need to be analyzed in the context of these different generational issues, the complexity of which are delaying the clean-up process in transition economies. Therefore, although the issue of allocating the costs of environmental liabilities is highly relevant to policy making, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, empirical analyses have not examined this point. Identifying the implications of the optimal intergenerational cost allocation is the aim of this paper. The objective of this study is, therefore, to determine citizens’ preferences regarding the cost allocation among generations. As the research highlights the cost allocations among generations, other household characteristics are also accounted for. The case studies that applied the choice experiment approach were carried out in the western part of Siberia, Russia. If statistically significant relations were observed between the preferences and environmental managements, the research could yield policy implications for solving intergenerational environmental issues from the perspective of citizens’ preferences. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section “Environmental Liabilities in the Former USSR Countries and their Relation to Generational Aspects” reviews the empirical literature on environmental liabilities in transition economies and sheds light on the intergenerational aspects of these issues. “Survey Details” and “Estimation Procedures” then provide information on the surveyed region and the methodologies applied in the research. “Estimation Results” presents the estimation results, which are then discussed in “Discussion”. “Conclusion” concludes the paper.",

After the fall of the Berlin Wall ‘optimism’ grew both in theory and practice of international relations; power relations and state dominance in international affairs would give way to international organizations, collective security, peaceful settlement of disputes, and economy would become the main driving force of international relations. However, this has not yet come to pass. Moreover, it is the opposite that we are witnessing nowadays; so, realism and power relations endured. Still, ‘the new world order’ argument was correct in the role of economy—an aspect argued already by two realists: Kindleberger (1969) and Bull (1977). After the end of the Cold War economic relations became more important than ever; furthermore, economic power factor overtook military one as the most important one. Strange (1996, p. 189) wrote that power had shifted sideways from states to markets. However, the argument that economy took control of the international affairs over the state is not convincing. Economy does not happen in a vacuum; markets and corporations are not independent creatures—the hidden hand of the market cannot function without the hidden fist (Friedman 2000, p. 464). Furthermore, it is our belief that economic and politics are two sides of the same coin, i.e., the struggle for power (Simoniti 1997, p. 49). This article will focus on the economy; moreover, brief political references and applications will also be made at the end. Another important idea present at the end of the Cold War is ‘declinism’ and declining hegemon—the United States of America (Kennedy 1989). Declinists drew heavily from the ideas of ‘Rise and Fall’ realism (Gilpin 1981), Hegemonic Stability Theory (Kindleberger 1969) and Power Transition Theory (Organski 1958). Entering the new millennium also declinism lost its momentum. But, since the 2008 financial crisis, and a new decade on the horizon, declinism has been reviving again. This last wave of declinism argues that the US is losing its dominance and China is overtaking it. And the geoeconomic centre of power is in transition from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The goal of the article is to put the latest declinism to the test—is geoeconomic centre shifting, and is the US economic power in decline? The raw economic data about the contemporary economic power (GDP, GDP per capita, government debt, investment-savings ratio, research and development (R&D) expenditures, high technology exports, and trade balance) of China, the US, and the EU will be presented. Thus, the contemporary status of the geoeconomic centre of power will be deducted. Furthermore, from the presented data the contemporary state of the US will be determined. On 20 September 2012 the former US president Clinton (2012) was a guest at The Daily Show where he stated that the colossal US government debt is currently not a problem, since the interests rates are close to 0 %, when the interest rates will go up then this will become an issue. This short-term pragmatic mind-set represents the motive for the article. Since the audience of The Daily Show are mainly young people, an imminent question based on Keynes (2000, p. 80) from the title: “In the long run we are all dead” seems to be very relevant and linked to the discussed topic. Clinton’s argument was that the US does not have to worry about its debt, since the international financial community still has faith in it. If the US is really in decline then such a perception will soon be changed and consequences will be dire. If the US is in decline then ‘The long run’ is going to be at hand.",

The shock on the United States financial market was a starting point of severe financial turbulences. More notably, the current crisis which quickly spread into other market segments and countries is already seen today as one of the biggest financial crises in history (Ackermann 2008). Several studies try to answer to an essential question: What caused the current crisis? Many answers to this question circulating in the media. Obviously, there were many factors that contribute to this financial crisis such as the excessive use of credit, in particular in the housing market. The reasons directly related to financial institution liquidation such as the excessive leverage seems to be the most important. Overall, most of the advanced explanations ignore the behavioral elements of the crisis. Behavioral finance provides alternative explanation about global financial crisis. This explanation may be derived from psychology of judgment and choice such as the impact of overconfidence cognitive bias on the rationality of financial decision makers. Several studies show that investors do tend to have periods of irrational exuberance or excessive optimism that pervade financial markets. Overconfidence bias leads investors to be too certain of their views, a tendency that frequently results in their underestimating risk. Indeed, one of the main causes of this financial crisis is the excessive liquidity which leads to the enormous credit expansion. Having short memory investors become irrationally overconfident that liquid market would continue indefinitely (Shefrin 2009). Several studies suggest that overconfidence constitutes an important reason for excessive price volatility. Benos (1998) proposes a model in which the aggressive exploitation of overconfident traders’ profitable information, jointly with conservative trading strategy of rational traders, conducts prices to vary strongly in one or the other direction. In their model, Daniel et al. (1998) show that overconfident investors increases prices volatility at the time reception of private signals. The originality of this study is to investigate whether overconfidence bias can explain excessive volatility witnessed during global financial crisis in developed and emerging financial markets. We consider a large set of country including developed markets (US, Canada, France, United Kingdom, Swiss, Australia, Hong Kong, Japan) and emerging markets (Brazil, Mexico, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, India and Kuwait) because, unlike previous financial crises, the US subprime crisis highly influences developed as well as emerging markets. The methodology here considers various empirical frameworks. First, this study examines the behavior of the index prices and volatilities for all sample period and during subprime crisis period. Then, this study employs an EGARCH model to study the leverage effect. Finally, this study estimates the conditional variance of EGARCH model by introducing two components of trading volume. The first component, due to past stock returns, is relating to investors’ overconfidence. The second component is unrelated to investors’ overconfidence. Following this introduction, Sect. 2 presents the literature review. Section 3 describes empirical data. Section 4 studies the behavior of index prices and volatilities. Section 5 examines the effect of overconfidence bias on market volatility. Section 6 provides concluding remarks.",19

A change in the exchange rates has two effects on the flow of trade—price effect and volume effect. The price effect implies that currency depreciation will cause imports to be more expensive and exports to appear cheaper in the short-run for the domestic buyers. The balance of trade may deteriorate in the short run due to the time required for the exports and imports to adjust to the new exchange rate. Krueger (1983) has claimed that there are certain goods which have already been purchased or ordered at the time of the devaluation, and the short run is dominated by the completion of old contractual obligations. As the quantity of trade begins to respond to the depreciation, it is believed that the so-called “volume effect” of currency devaluation will reverse the trade balance movement and eventually improve it. Dornbusch and Krugman (1976) argued that there would be a perverse negative response of the trade balance to currency depreciation, followed by a larger export elasticity that would improve the balance in the long run. The phenomenon of the domination of the volume effect over the price effect in the long run is the Marshall–Lerner condition. If plotted over time, the trade response graph yields a J-resembling line, thus the J-curve terminology. Conventionally, the J-curve has been estimated using ordinary time-series econometrics. In particular, the Johansen approach to cointegration and the error correction modeling (ECM) have been widely used. Gupta-Kapoor and Ramakrishnan (1999) estimated the J-curve for Japan employing the Johansen-Juselius method. Bahmani-Oskooee and Alse (1994) studied the relationship between the trade balances and the real effective exchange rate (REER) for many countries using the error correction methodology. Halicioglu (2008) examined the Turkish J-curve with the Pesaran’s autoregressive-distributed lag model (Pesaran et al. 2001). The Engel–Granger approach has also been used by various researchers. The majority of studies have employed aggregated data. Beginning with Rose and Yellen (1989), however, there has been a rise in disaggregated, or bilateral, estimation. Some of the more recent J-curve studies include Onafowora (2003); Hacker and Hatemi (2004); Narayan (2004); Moura and Da Silva (2005); Bahmani-Oskooee et al. (2006). For a thorough literature review, consult Bahmani-Oskooee and Ratha (2004) who provide a very extensive analysis on the J-curve literature from 37 articles for the 1973–2003 period. The main motivation for undertaking this research study is that no empirical work on the Azerbaijani J-curve has been done before. The case of Azerbaijan is particularly interesting because the country experienced an export-driven economic and credit boom in the mid-late 2000s when the nation was expanding at record-breaking double-digit rates. The national currency, Manat, was steadily appreciating during the late 2000s while oil-dominated exports were rising at the same time. For this very reason, only the non-oil segment of the Azerbaijan’s total exports will be examined in this paper, since the oil component puts exogenous pressure on the domestic currency to appreciate. This would have an exactly inverse relationship with the exchange rate, and we would prefer to avoid it. Overall, establishing a relationship between the Azerbaijani trade balance and the Manat would carry practical significance for the nation’s determination of optimal monetary policy as well as for the national strategies on industrial diversification. The focus of this paper is to establish a connection between the trade dynamics of Azerbaijan with the Euro-zone (Euro-17), Azerbaijan’s major trading partner. We are using monthly data, obtained from various reliable sources, for the 01:2006–12:2009 time interval. Our a priori expectation is that there exists some long-run relationship between Azerbaijan’s balance of trade, which is represented as the difference between the Azerbaijani exports to the Euro-zone and the imports from the Euro-zone, and the real bilateral exchange rate (RFX). There are five primary variables in the model described in this study: exports (X), imports (IM), real bilateral exchange rate (RFX), domestic aggregate demand (Yaz), and foreign aggregate demand (Yeur). Exports are Azerbaijan’s non-oil exports to the Euro-zone, denominated in Manats (see Fig. 1). Imports are Azerbaijan’s total bilateral imports from the Euro-zone denominated in Manats (Fig. 2). Azerbaijan’s non-oil exports to the Euro-zone Azerbaijan’s imports from the Euro-zone The model examined in this paper is about functions of demand, domestic and foreign. Based on the approaches from literature, economic reason, and availability of data, real gross domestic product (Yaz) has been taken as a proxy for domestic—Azerbaijani—demand (Fig. 3). It seems that real GDP is the most suitable, and also obtainable, proxy for the gross demand of a single country. Foreign demand is approximated by the industrial production index (IPI) of the Euro-zone (Yeur). Given the nature of the trading partner, which is a composite of 15+ countries, a weighted and indexed proxy is required for demand approximation. Several literature examples have suggested using the IPI for bilateral estimation with a complex partner (Gupta-Kapoor and Ramakrishnan 1999). Values for the Euro-zone’s IPI have been reindexed, assigning 100 for January 2006 (Fig. 4). Real gross domestic product of Azerbaijan Industrial production index of the Euro-zone The exchange rate in this study is the real bilateral exchange rate of Manat for Euro (AZN/EUR) (Fig. 5). It is said to be bilateral since it is Vis-à-vis one partner. With such definition, an increase in the exchange rate’s value represents a real depreciation of the currency, since more Manats can now be exchanged for the same amount of the Euros. The exchange rate has been accounted for inflation; it’s adjusted by the consumer price index. The numbers have been indexed similarly to the IPI series. The numbers for exports and imports were taken from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS). Real GDP of Azerbaijan and the real bilateral exchange rate were taken from the Central Bank of Azerbaijan statistical database. Euro-zone’s IPI comes from EUROSTAT. All the variables are real, and in a monthly format. The share of the Euro-zone accounts for approximately 50 % of Azerbaijan’s aggregate foreign trade. Real bilateral exchange rate between Azerbaijan and the Euro-zone A traditional trade balance model will now be estimated with two equations, one for exports and one for imports, via the Johansen approach and a vector error correction model (VECM). Preliminary unit-root tests, needed to determine if the series are non-stationary, will be performed, and the results will be presented. The cointegration equations will show the long-run relationship between exports, imports, and the exchange rate. It is expected, for the Marshall–Lerner condition to hold, that the sum of export and import elasticity’s from our two equations will exceed one. In the end, an impulse response function (IRF) will display the short-run dynamics of the trade balance in response to the exchange rate innovations, yielding a J-curve demonstration. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The section “Methodology” presents the model and econometric methodology. Section “Results” reports the empirical results. Section “Discussion” discusses the inferences and implications derived from our findings and finally the paper concludes with the section ""Conclusion"".",8

Basel I and Basel II, which were regulating international banking system starting from 1988, were unable to overcome problems that rose as a result of this financial crisis. It was not merely a financial crisis, it became the first global crisis of regulatory system. The reason we call it regulatory crisis is because many banks which met the requirements of Basel II, and which had acceptable capital adequacy ratio, announced bankruptcy (Cullen 2011). The list of such banks included Northern Rock, Merrill Lynch, etc. As a consequence, it became obvious that business risks were not properly addressed by the existing regulation. The aim of the research is to identify whether regulatory measurement of banking risks according to Basel II Standardized Approach provides a framework that allows an adequate reflection of these risks in banks’ capital requirements. In order to achieve our aim we will test the following hypotheses: Risk weights assigned to an asset according to Basel II Standardized Approach, contradicts risk-return correlation (according to the latter, between assets with an equal profitability, an investor will chose less risky asset), Assets, including sovereign assets, cannot be risk free, Rating of an issuer of a financial instrument does not fully and timely reveal all the information about the risk attached to a financial instrument. The study will be conducted through analysis of European government bond market, investments of international banks in these bonds, and financial and economic problems of some European countries. We will also provide a new method of measurement of banking risks by linking it to the market driven factors.",

N. W. Azman-Saini,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The launch of the European monetary union (EMU) in 1999 was one of the most important events in the history of the international financial system. After a long convergence process that appeared in the early 1980s, European leaders decided to create a single European currency to meet financial integration and rapid development. The formation of EMU has improved the opportunities for these countries to be a fully integrated continental financial market comparable to that of the United States. Introducing a single currency was expected to re-shape financial markets and financial institutions and promote deeper and more liquid markets for monetary assets that could be an attractive place for external investors (Portes and Rey 1998). It was also anticipated to be an attractive vehicle currency for international asset trade, permitting further expansion in the size and scope of financial markets (Papaioannou and Portes 2008). In the case of EMU, it may have a positive impact on the financial market depth and the competitiveness of the market environment (Galati and Tsatsaronis 2003). It eliminates the exchange rate risk, which is known as a major obstacle for any financial integration. Financial integration is a situation in which financial markets become increasingly intertwined and similar. It may likely spur the development of a domestic financial sector due to higher competition with sophisticated or lower-cost foreign intermediaries. The financial integration may also result in financial deepening and increase the access of households and firms to financial markets and intermediaries located beyond their national borders. The requirement to harmonize in national regulations will promote convergence to the best international standards and will improve domestic financial development (Jappelli and Pagano 2008). In general, theories suggest that forming the EMU may increase the level of integration in the European financial market, which in turn has positive impacts on financial development. According to the well-established theory of growth, at the aggregate level, enhancing financial development may boost regional output. Schumpeter (1911); McKinnon (1973), and Shaw (1973) the three major studies on the finance—growth nexus, argued that efficient financial sectors will allocate funds to the most productive sectors, which in turn may stimulate innovation and improve productivity. Nonetheless, since the lunch of EMU, the economic performance of the euro has been weak relative to that in the US and EU countries outside the euro area (e.g., Denmark and Sweden) (Barrell et al. 2008). The disappointing performance of the economy is a cause for concern among politicians and economists. This phenomenon raises questions. Is enhanced financial development caused by the formation of the EMU related to growth? Is the diminishing economic growth in Europe attributed to a decline in the financial-growth relationship? The present study attempts to examine and compare the relationship between financial development and economic growth in selected European countries prior to and after the EMU was formed. Similar studies on this relationship have been carried out. For example, Rousseau and Wachtel (2011), and Lartey and Farka (2011) examined and compared the relationship in two periods: prior to and after the financial crisis. Zhang et al. (2012) studied the relationship change between the period prior to and after the accession of China into World Trade Organization (WTO). To the best of our knowledge, however, no studies have compared the changes at the nexus of financial development—growth in Europe prior to and after the EMU was formed. The remainder of the present paper is structured as follows. “Literature Review” reviews prior literatures on the topic. We turn to the selection of data and methodology used in the present study in “Data and Methodology”. “Results and Discussion” includes the empirical results and discussion, and “Conclusion” offers concluding remarks.",

In fact Estonian economic agents are the heaviest users of electricity in the Baltics: final consumption per capita amounted to 19 GJ in 2009 whereas the respective numbers in Latvia (9.7 GJ) and in Lithuania (9 GJ) are two times lower (Estonian Institute of Economic Research 2010). Estonia’s higher electricity consumption can be explained by historical reasons—90 % of the country’s electricity production is covered by domestically available oil shale; and hence has substantially lower production costs (and in a regulated market also lower retail sales prices) than all other Nordic and Baltic countries. Use of oil shale in electricity generation however produces large amounts of CO2 (1 tonne CO2 per MWh), meaning increasing price on CO2 emissions quotas can potentially double such electricity producers’ operating costs unless companies are willing to switch to alternative technologies (Kleesmaa et al. 2011). In 2010—according to a prior-agreed schedule with the European Commission—Estonia had to open its electricity market to free competition for all users whose yearly consumption exceeds 2 GWh. As Estonia is interconnected to Finland and hence the NordPool Spot power exchange, to Russia and via Latvia all the way to Lithuania and Belarus the changes in 2010 meant that all Estonia-based large-scale consumers were able to either switch to market-based pricing (by daily purchasing from the power pool) or request fixed-price contracts from any of the regional power suppliers. As the entire electricity market opens in Estonia in 2013 a lot of uncertainty remains. Without new approved investments domestic oil shale plants will experience a number of generator shut downs over 2016–2023 period. Increasing capacity of interconnectors—existing 350 MW submarine cable from Estonia to Finland will be complemented by a new 650 MW cable in 2014 (Elering 2012a)—will bring Estonia’s currently lower electricity price level closer to Finland’s. It is therefore likely that Estonian and Finnish electricity prices, which currently differ 15–20 %, would become equal within the next few years (refer to Table 1 further below). On the other hand consumers’ electricity costs are not only made up of direct energy rates, but also grid distribution and transmission fees and excise taxes e.g. for pollution and/or subsidising renewable energy. These add-on costs vary substantially country-by-country and consequently also impact total costs of using electricity. Regional competitiveness of Estonian companies is largely dependent on costs as exports are often the only way to grow due to a small domestic market. High quality is taken for granted in both high and low value added industries; hence cutting costs becomes an important differentiator when competing with other Baltic and Scandinavian companies. Along with labour and material costs energy costs determine eventual production costs and depending on industrial sector their share of total costs can vary significantly. Thus the article focuses on identifying importance of electricity costs across Estonian industrial sectors and analysing potential change of competitiveness for its companies after full opening of electricity market in 2013. This article is structured as follows. The following section discusses theoretical insights to highlight why electricity cannot be supplied at generation cost and how firms use it. It is argued that no clear understanding exists in a small open EU country like Estonia today. Following section presents the research methodology including the overall framework as well as data collection methodology. A discussion follows, highlighting key issues for evaluating electricity cost importance and implications for economic policy-drafting. A concluding chapter assesses Estonian large-scale electricity producers’ position in the regional context.",

Humans depend on a number of natural systems for their survival and for the stability of their societies.Footnote 1 According to Haldén, political systems will not change because of climate change, rather they will be asked to interpret it by adopting suitable and effective policies to handle it (Jackson and Sorensen 2010). In fact, there are three reasons for believing that policy analysts would be good in assessing this problem: This is a large-scale problem: it is global and affects directly all citizens. The governance is problematic as well because it requires the alignment of 150 countries. This is a problem primarily driven by knowledge: we reached an understanding of an inexorable natural reality; this is a totally different approach than the international relations we have had so far. Knowledge has a weak influence on International Relations due to the fact that people can easily avoid what they cannot address. As claimed by the IPCC the emission of greenhouse gases, primarily results from the consumption of fossil fuels (which global capitalism has relied upon as its main source of energy supply) and this has been the primary factor behind the observed increases in global temperatures.Footnote 2
 World CO2 emissions 1971–2010. Source: International Energy Agency (2012) The first question that one must answer is what motive a government would have to seek to control its own country’s GHG emissions? The costs must be borne domestically and up-front. The benefits, if any, occur in the distant future and accrue mostly to foreigners. It would seem reasonable that no government maximizing its own wealth and power would act in this way. The realities of global political economy imply that for the foreseeable future, GHG control efforts are likely to remain ineffectual. For many countries, economic development may be better than attempts to control GHG emissions as a strategy for coping with climate change.Footnote 3
 China, equally concerned about its rapidly growing energy needs and the economic threat of a carbon-constrained future, also objected to any binding emissions’ reduction commitments. Having kept a low profile in climate politics during the 1990s, China is now willing to assert its position and use its growing veto power, now that its future emission trends are of critical importance. In fact, the growth of heavy industry is the main force behind rising emissions. It would remain a powerful driver of GHG growth even if all new investment used the most efficient world-scale technology.Footnote 4 State owned banks are funding the rapid growth of heavy industry. These banks pay little or no interest to depositors, but they also demand little of those borrowers with government backing. The point to be stressed is that the source of high GHG intensiveness is not energy policy per se, though distorted prices there do add to the problem.Footnote 5 Rather, the problem is anchored in capital markets, and it cannot be excised without reforming those markets. The United States’ total CO2 Emissions is equal to 5,410 million metric tons per year, almost a quarter of the world’s total CO2 emissions. The U.S. is the only country to have signed up to the Kyoto Protocol and then backed out of it. Despite a lack of co-operation with the international community on climate change, in U.S. there is a patchwork of state and local level programs and policies (i.e. New York State and New Jersey have put in place targets for the reduction of CO2 emissions and 134 US municipalities are taking part in the International Cities for Climate Protection Campaign). The top emitting countries of 2010 are China and the United States, as shown in Graph 2, which together account for about 40 % of the global emissions of carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas. It seems necessary for both countries to adopt efficient policies to reduce emissions in accordance with their global obligations.Footnote 6
 Top 10 emitting countries 1990–2010 CO2 emissions. Source: International Energy Agency (2012) A methodological shift seems to be necessary due to the inefficiency of the agreements reached by the international environmental diplomacy in order to tackle the problem of climate change. This paper analyze the geopolitical problems involved in climate mitigation and discuss alternative trends to adopt in order to meet the emission reduction in the United States, China and Europe. The target imposed by the international community of reducing the CO2 emissions can be achieved through a social change, towards an economic system to be sustainable with climate stabilization.",1

Anikin,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Modernization rhetoric is still popular in Russia even despite the 20 years of reforms have passed since disintegration of the Soviet Union occurred in early 1990s of the last century. What does remain a stumbling block for Russia in overcoming this transition shift? To answer this question one should identify the mode of socio-economic development that Russia has stuck in. There are a few analytical ways how to do this. One of the most functional and apprehensible amidst them is a labour potential approach (Fairbairn 1967). In many aspects labour potential of the population is determined by occupational structure evolution of which in any country tends to be an actual subject area of analysis the prospects of a country’s social and economic development especially when transition ones are concerned. The given paper consists of two main parts. First one is devoted to aim of constructing an analytical schema which represents the relationship between type of socio-economic development and occupational structure. Another part considers the changes in occupational structure of Russian population over the transition phase between 1994 and 2010 in accordance with regarded theoretical framework. This kind of analysis is aimed not only to evaluate the chances of Russian population to successful modernization but also to prove that occupational structure could be a relevant indicator of a country’s mode of social and economic development.,6

Several theoretical and empirical studies underline the role of geographical proximity and the importance to analyze spatial distribution of economic activities and the formation of agglomeration economies. It is proven that agglomeration economies play a significant role in regional economic development, regional growth, and influence industrial location choice and the level of productivity of firms. The expansion of the knowledge-based economy, the ongoing globalization and the pressure on economic actors in every region to develop their innovation capacity draws the attention to the potential hidden in knowledge-intensive industries (KIIs), even more interestingly in transition economies. For this reason, detailed insight into spatial distribution of KIIs is essential for policy makers to achieve effective innovation and regional policies at subregional, regional and even at national level. Due to the growing interest in KIIs, we found it necessary to examine the pattern of their co-location even in Hungary. The study is structured into three main parts. After exploring the relevancy of geographical proximity and distinguishing spatial concentration from agglomeration, we present our methodology. Measures use various methods and indicators of spatial econometrics and statistics, and rely basically on the model of Ellison-Glaeser and Moran. The last section demonstrates the empirical results on a restricted circle of KIIs. It is expected that some KIIs are more localized, and it may be attributed to the knowledge-intensity of the industry.

Affecting economic growth through the channels is realized by functions of financial intermediaries. The functions include the provision of means for clearing and settling payments to facilitate the exchange of goods, the provision of a mechanism for pooling resources, services and assets, and the subdivision of shares in various enterprises, risk management, resource allocation price information to help coordinate decentralized decision making in various sectors of the economy, and the means to deal with the incentive problems created when one party of a financial transaction has the information that the other party does not, or when one party acts as an agent of the other Merton and Bodie (1995). In transition countries, the link between financial sector development and economic growth in transition economies seems to be ambiguous at best (Krkoska 2001; Berglöf and Bolton 2002). They note most investment in transition countries has been financed from cash flows and foreign direct investment has substituted domestic financing. Even in central Europe, where financial sectors tend to be better developed than in Southeastern Europe countries, the banks have sometimes concentrated on granting loans to the public sector. The level of loans granted to the private sector is still considerably lower than the EU average. For these reasons, one might infer that emerging domestic financial sectors have only modestly affected economic growth in transition countries. The aim of this paper is to examine empirically whether relatively larger, more efficient banking sectors play a growth-supporting role in economic growth in transition economies. We concentrate on banking sectors as they typically have dominated financial intermediation in transition countries. We apply the fixed-effects panel model and at a first stage we use the ordinary least squares estimation method. In order to control for endogeneity at the next stage we estimate parameters of the model using the two stage least squares method. In both cases we control for other determinants of economic growth. The paper is organized as follows. “Literature Review” highlights literature on theoretical and empirical findings between banking sectors and economic growth. “Data and Methodology” presents methodology and data, which we incorporate in the analysis. The results of the empirical research are given in “Empirical Results”. The paper finishes with some concluding remarks and suggestions for the future work that are outlined in “Conclusion”.",2

Investing in people has proven to be the safest way to ensure the survival of an organization and to ensure future competitiveness. All of the other resources of the organization are important and useful, but human resources and its management are very important and very valuable in dealing with the unknown. Human resources competence is based on organizational communication. Effective organizational communication will provide performance at the human resources level. People represent the active resources of the organization because of their potential, experience and passion, their development initiatives and their active contribution to increasing the organizational efficiency and effectiveness. Without the actual presence of men, it is simply impossible for an organization to achieve its objectives. Human resources are unique in terms of their potential for growth and development and their ability to know and overcome limitations. Human resources communication represents a functional organizational communication based on respect and understanding of the audience interests. Man is simultaneously subject, object and purpose of various activities while being creative and resource-consuming. Human resources are also the only inexhaustible source of creativity, solutions and new ideas, original and valuable. All this potential can only grow if there is a very well structured organizational communication. People have the human potential needed to create material and spiritual goods of a higher value, to meet new requirements or to respond better to old requirements. People design and make goods and services, control quality, make decisions and establish or develop, above all, goals and strategies. At the same time, it is noteworthy that all people have created and destroyed civilizations and used ingenious natural resources but also created real disasters in the ecosystem. Today, human resources create new networks and collaborations at different levels of different organizations in the world. Human resource management decisions vary from one organization to another, from one subdivision to another organization or country to country, because decisions must comply with their needs and because the relative importance of the functions or activities of human resource management is not the same in all cases. Human resource management activities in the preparation and adoption of decisions involving personnel must assess situations morally or ethically and legally and need to make a series of choices or selections with regard to the human factor which are often very difficult. It is for this reason that organizational communication strategies can develop new forms of interaction between the members of an organization. The decisions to hire more people with some skill and experience to develop, promote and fire staff are just some of the decisions whose direct effects are relevant for any organization. In all organizations it is necessary to consider the fundamental moral and ethical principles such as accountability, equity and creating an ethical value system reflecting social acceptability. Since in human resource management there are many situations in which honesty and integrity are deeply involved, ethics as a set of rules or moral obligations, which must be subordinate to actions and our decisions, help us determine what is right or wrong behavior, good or bad, just or unjust, moral or immoral. The organizational communication context is one of the structures which can develop human resources management.",1

The small open economy model of monetary and fiscal policy is estimated. A Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR-henceforth) is used in order to identify the monetary and fiscal shock on real GDP and prices. Other objective in jointly analyzing fiscal and monetary policy is the omission of fiscal variables from SVAR that only analyses monetary policy may lead to inconsistent estimated coefficients and thus generate erroneous conclusions as to the effect of monetary policy. Monetary and fiscal policy and their effect have conventionally involved great interest from many researchers. However, the questions of the suitable monetary and fiscal measures have become more pronounced especially during the global financial crisis. Most of the studies in countries in transition have analyzed either the impact of monetary or fiscal policy on real economic activity. It is important to analyze jointly the monetary and fiscal policy in order to assess the interaction of their effect on real GDP and prices. Regarding monetary policy, the theory and the empirical evidence (based on the Structural Vector Autoregressive) have established that there are several channels through which the effects of monetary policy are transmitted to real economic activity (though much of this evidence comes from developed countries). In contrast to the conventional theory and empirical evidence from developed economies, both the theory and the empirical evidence pertaining to countries in transition suggest a potential weakness and a potential instability of the conventional channels (the short-term interest rate and the base money, and, through it, the money stock) of monetary transmission during transition because of structural and institutional deficiencies—in particular underdeveloped financial systems and higher dollarization. In addition, as transition is a dynamic trend marked by permanent qualitative changes, the literature suggests that the monetary transmission mechanism is an endogenous or dependent variable with regular features that is changeable over time. This point to a need for ongoing research to further analyze the effect of monetary policy on real GDP and prices in order to assess the relative cost and benefit associated with introducing a more active monetary policy. Concerning fiscal policy, I include an analysis of its macroeconomic effect for several reasons. Recently, in the literature on structural VAR, some consideration has been given to the investigation of the macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy (e.g. Blanchard and Perotti 2002; Fatás and Mihov 2003, 2004; Mountford and Uhling 2009; Restrepo and Rincón 2006; Rarytska 2003). Since the foundation of the Euro Area, there has been a growing interest in the reinvestigation of fiscal policy as their only instrument for stabilizing business cyclical fluctuations. Other reason for reinvestigation of the macroeconomic effect of fiscal policy is to determine whether fiscal policy can be considered as a complementary instrument of monetary policy in achieving macroeconomic stability during the financial crisis. With respect to the countries in transition, little attention has been devoted to the macroeconomic effect of fiscal policy, even though these countries are interesting for their variety of types of economic growth. Moreover, the effect of monetary policy is more rapid; though it may be less effective than fiscal policy in those countries in transition with underdeveloped financial systems. Often both sides of the budget are changed (increasing/decreasing government spending and reducing/increasing tax) in order to promote economic growth, as is the case in the Republic of Macedonia, which is the topic of my empirical research. Therefore, this suggests a need for ongoing analyses of the effects of fiscal policy within the monetary SVAR model in order to assess their impact on real GDP and prices. The novelty in this paper is that for the first time I analyze jointly monetary and fiscal policy in the Republic of Macedonia. To the best knowledge of author, there is no published serious study which jointly analyses monetary and fiscal policies in transition countries, while monetary and fiscal policies have been analyzed separately. Therefore, in this paper, I focus on identifying the effects that the monetary policy and fiscal policy have on real GDP and prices in the Republic of Macedonia. Based on the data from 1997 to 2009, my empirical research is supported by empirical testing using the most-used methodology, such as SVAR. The theoretical and empirical literature concerning SVAR, both in the developed countries and the countries in transition, provides the foundation of my empirical research on the Republic of Macedonia. The reminder paper is organized as a follows. Section II explains the reviews the literature on the effect of the monetary policy and fiscal policy. Section III econometrics model for testing the effect of monetary and fiscal policy on real GDP and prices. Section IV conclusions.",2

A large number of countries across the globe have turned to decentralized approaches to public decision making.Footnote 1 The main rationale behind decentralization is to make governments more efficient and democratic by increasing their responsiveness to local needs (e.g. Shah 1998; Oates 1999). However, the empirical evidence on the responsiveness of decentralized governments to local needs suggests a mixed picture. Some studies show that decentralized systems may lead to citizens’ preferences being reflected in policies (e.g. Rosenzweig and Foster 2003; Faguet 2004). Others find negative evidence for local governments’ responsiveness (e.g. Slater 1989; Samoff 1990). The significance of the institutional context and incentives in determining the scope and efficiency of local governments’ activities is emphasized by a number of studies (e.g. Zhuravskaya 2000; Andersson et al. 2006). Many governments and donor institutions promote local development programs as instruments for sustainable development (e.g. World Bank 2001; UN-HABITAT 2005). Representing one of the key components in the decentralized governance of economies, their scope and the extent to which they reflect the local needs could be largely predictive of the success of subsequent stages of decentralized governance. Therefore, these programs provide an interesting subject for policy-oriented research. This paper represents a case study of a specific transition country, Armenia, and studies the local development programs adopted in the initial stages of its decentralization process. The Law on local self-governance adopted in 2002 mandates the heads of local governments to prepare 3 year development programs to guide the development of communities for the duration of their terms in office. Firstly, this paper discusses the targets defined in local development programs prepared by 217 Armenian communities for the years 2003–2005. It does this relative to perspectives on good practices in local development programs which proclaim comprehensiveness in the choice of issues that programs should cover. I demonstrate that in contrast to this view, a large share of Armenia’s local development programs are directed to local infrastructure development projects, with projects directed to local business development and other targets taking a relatively small share. Given the choice of priority directions in local development programs, I furthermore attempt to identify the role of the local need in the choice of priority directions of local development programs. This is done for the case of drinking water infrastructure projects, one of the most highly prioritised program targets. Some evidence of responsiveness of local development programs to local need for drinking water is found. It is suggested that regional media circulation may be one factor contributing to the responsiveness of local development programs. While decentralization has been at the forefront of the political and economic transformation reforms of Armenia, there is yet no study which empirically examines the scope and responsiveness of development priority choices by local governments using a relatively large sample of communities.Footnote 2 This paper is a first step in that direction. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. “Data” introduces the data used in the study. “Scope of Local Development Programs” presents an overview of the scope of local development priority choices by Armenian local governments, while “Responsiveness of Local Development Programs” explores the responsiveness of development programs to local needs for the case of drinking water infrastructure projects. Final section is “Conclusion”.",

After all, prevailing form of foreign investment entails its service by economy of a country. Over the last decade, emerging economies substantially deepened their international financial integration. This is evidenced by their international investment positions, namely the growing stocks of international assets and liabilities. Many countries encouraged capital flows, eliminating restrictions, deregulating domestic financial markets and improving economic environment and prospects through market-oriented reforms. In particular, during the 90s majority of transition countries of Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America countries eliminated restrictions on international financial transactions and at the same time loosened the regulation of financial transactions in domestic markets. According to Prasad (2011) if earlier for emerging markets international capital flows were seen as a destructive force that increases volatility and causes devastating crises, rather than promoting economic growth and helping to diversify risks by increasing investment opportunities, now there are changes that suggest that emerging economies may be in a better position to take advantage of capital flows, but they face a new set of risks. Previously, foreign liabilities of emerging economies mainly consisted of debt. Currently foreign direct investment (FDI) and portfolio equity investment combined are dominating in foreign liabilities structure. In 2010, the share of FDI and portfolio equity investments accounted for more than half of the total liabilities of countries with emerging economies as Prasad (2011) highlights. By contrast, in developed economies portfolio debt (such as bonds issued by governments and corporations) and bank loans together still account for the major part of foreign liabilities. Earlier short-term external debt denominated in foreign currencies represented a significant threat to emerging economies. These countries had to deal not only with the risk of not being able to refinance the debt in the event of loss of sentiment of international investors, but also to further problems of depreciation, which increased the cost of debt in local currency. In a study of the impact of short-term capital flows on national economies, Rodric and Velasco (1999) argue that countries with short-term liabilities to foreign banks that exceed reserves are three times more likely to experience a sudden and massive reversals of capital flows. According to the authors it is the proportion of short-term external debt to reserves, and not the ratio in relation to GDP, which affects the severity of the crisis. FDI and portfolio equity are considered more desirable forms of capital inflows since external liabilities of the countries are increasingly denominated in their national currencies. If the value of these investments falls either because of domestic factors or through currency depreciation (or both), foreign investors take on part of the capital and foreign exchange risks.",11

Hartwell,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Economic transition, and specifically the transition from communism to capitalism undertaken by many countries after 1989, was never at its heart merely about economic growth or increased investment. The true goal of transition was a systemic change of institutions from those that facilitated a planned, communist economy to those that were suitable for a market economy. However, progress made during the first decade and a half in the majority of the transition economies of Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union appears to have stalled or even regressed with the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007–2008. Property rights, the judiciary, and especially financial sector oversight and banking sector institutions have seen deterioration in their quality and protection in many developed countries over the past 5 years, especially in the United States and the older countries of the European Union. Given that many economies were attempting to approximate western (and specifically EU) institutions during the transition, are they now aping the general decline in market-friendly institutions in the “developed” world? This paper will examine the state of political and economic institutional development in 28 transition economies from Poland to Mongolia, and attempt to discern which specific institutions, if any, have suffered the most over the past 5 years. This paper will break new ground in the examination of institutions, tracking institutions on a monthly basis as well as annually. This will provide high-frequency lessons for practitioners on the importance of various institutions and how their policies can negatively or positively impact institutional development. Moreover, we will track which countries in the transition space have seen the most institutional regression, while highlighting the countries that have weathered the institutional degradation that has characterized so many of the OECD and EU countries. Are there reasons why institutional deterioration occurred in certain countries? What are the root causes and policies behind changes over the past 5 years, and are there commonalities across the various transition countries? Finally, this paper will examine the effects of institutional regression across the transition space with an eye on how institutional change has impacted economic growth and investment. Using a streamlined but rigorous regression model, we will ascertain if movements in institutional quality since the onset of the global financial crisis have impacted the real economy in transition countries. It is anticipated that particular political institutions such as executive constraints and economic institutions such as property rights will have the biggest effects.",3

In our opinion, the traditional methods of analysis and forecasting FX rate in most cases don’t take into account its’ heterogeneous nature, and forecasts are made on the assumption of homogeneity of the series, which obey the normal distribution. For instance, it is very popular in many countries using value at risk (VAR) analysis for estimating the loss caused by changes in FX rates. VAR shows the potential loss on foreign exchange portfolio with some level of confidence. Recommendations for using this methodology are contained in the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, “International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework” (Basel II: International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards 2006). In order to ensure the high significance of foreign exchange risk it’s enough to consider that by 2012 the average daily turnover of the global FX market was 5 trillion US dollars, increasing after the global financial crisis by about $2 trillion, and the share of financial institutions in the foreign exchange market increased from 20 % in 1998 to 50 % in 2012 (Bank for International Settlements 2010). Moreover, the statistics on financial crises over the past 40 years shows that the most common form of crises are currency crises. Since 1970, there have been 218 currency crises in the banking system (Laeven and Valencia 2012). In this paper we wanted to show that the modern methods of forecasting the exchange rate based on the historical data series are getting more and more inaccurate. In order to take into account the above mentioned we analyzed the FX rate EUR/USD at the time of the release of important economic news, built Pareto curve for currency pair USD/AMD, after which we built predictive models based on historical data and Markov chains. So the structure of the paper can be described by the following steps: Study of the behavior of FX rate immediately after the origin of significant events. Construction of the Gaussian curve and Pareto curve for USD/AMD currency pair. Creation of predictive models based on the historical distribution based on the historical distribution of the series including AR model with trend and model ARIMA. Creation of a simulation model for forecasting the exchange rate USD/AMD using the Monte Carlo methodology. Creation of predictive model based on Markov transition probability matrix, consisting of sample values of the historical series data. The study of changes in exchange rates at the time of the onset of important events shows that the market is now losing “long-term memory”, and begin chaotic movements in the foreign exchange market. At that time, the exchange rate and its changes are not normally distributed. This is the very period of chaotic movements when the main changes in the exchange rate happen, that determine the basic path thereafter. In our opinion the use of VAR analysis to estimate the potential losses is quiet superficial method, since it does not take into account the complex nature of the rate formation, all values of rates (mainly for 250 working days) have equal weight, trends and ejections are not considered separately and also other factors are not taken into account. These statistics, as well as the tendency of preservation and strengthening of high volatility of world currencies give rise to the search for more reliable approaches to the measurement of the foreign exchange risk, and forecast of the rates of national currencies.",

Different schools of political thought have different views on how to understand democracy and how to evaluate progress and failure in the democratic development (Huntington 1991; Dahl 1971, 1989). Striving to unify these different views, political scientists often resort to statistical data, which can be analyzed mathematically. There have been attempts to quantify the essentially “qualitative” data such as evaluations of the functioning of government, political freedom, civil liberties, etc., based on both “hard” data (e.g., legislative bills and official reports) and on expert assessment of political process. Quantified and averaged, this data becomes ratings—in particular, ratings of democratic development in countries around the world. One of the first and most popular such ratings is “Freedom in the World” issued by Freedom House on a yearly basis (Freedom House 2006–2009). This rating provides long-term statistics of democratic development from 1973 up to now. It is widely used by analytical organizations and in academia (for example, see Tilly 2007). Other ratings of freedom and democracy include those issued by the Heritage Foundation, the Economist, USAID, World Bank, etc.; see also Nikolaenko et al. 2009 and Melville 2009. Ratings often get criticized for how they aggregate data on different aspects of democracy. To quote Scoble and Wiseberg (1981): 
\([\dots]\) the sum of a civil liberty score of 4 and a political liberty score of 2 is the same as the sum of a civil liberty score of 2 and a political liberty score of 4 even though the substantive interpretation of these different combinations is different. Indeed, averaging the values of different parameters may often be misleading. In our work, we propose a representation based on formal concept analysis (Ganter and Wille 1999) that avoids mixing together incomparable factors by unfolding linear rankings into hierarchical structures. In section “The Freedom in the World Rating and the Underlying Data”, we describe the data behind the “Freedom in the World” rating that will be used to illustrate our approach. Section “A Short Introduction to Formal Concept Analysis” introduces main tools of formal concept analysis. We then show how it can be applied to the “Freedom in the World” rating in Sect. “A Multidimensional Rating Based on Concept Lattices” and how it helps analyze democratic development in temporal perspective in section “Dynamic Analysis”.",1

M. Jawed Akhtar,Behzad Karimzadeh,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"The determinants of banks’ profitability are many. They are either internal or external factors. The internal determinants originate from bank accounts and therefore could be termed as bank-specific determinants of profitability. The external determinants are variables that are not related to bank management and are imposed on banks exogenously. Among these exogenous factors are macroeconomic indicators and policies, legal environment, technological innovations, the state of international economy and politics. All these factors will affect the operation and performance of financial institutions in an open economy (Lin 2007). Foremost important changes in Indian banking sector began since 1991. It was from then that a policy of liberalization and deregulation were launched to take advantage of globalization of financial markets. A revolution that took place in the USA markets in mid 1970s and in the UK markets in mid 1980s. The two events are described as the big bangs in financial markets. Indian economy and financial sector were also affected by these events. As India opened its economy and began the process of liberalization of its financial sector the pace of change was much greater than was expected. That has radically transformed the operational environment of the banking sector. Prior to financial reforms, Indian banks were operating in highly regulated environment. Profitability was a secondary consideration. The main objective of banks was regarded as a public service, although implicitly. Their profitability was not considered as an important yardstick to judge their performance. It was for this reason that 14 major banks were nationalization in 1969. Accordingly, the emphasis was on enhancing branch network in rural and semi-urban areas. Banks had to undertake several other responsibilities that private banks in a free market economy would not undertake. For instance, they had to finance fiscal deficits and facilitate the development of certain public ventures. This state of affairs left not much room for competition. The liberalization reforms, however, brought greater competition among banks as barriers to entry have been sharply reduced (Guruswamy 2012). Due to these reforms Indian banking system has witnessed a remarkable rate of growth. These developments compounded with entrance of new private and foreign banks have changed banking environment in India. This study is an attempt to investigate the profitability of banking sector in India in the light of aforementioned changes. The central objective of this study is to show the relationship between banks profitability and the factors that determine the level of profitability of Indian banking system. In respect to this connection we will indentify and critically examine the main internal and external factors that affect banks’ profitability in India.",19

This model globally suited western powers which they see as a shield against radical Islamism. Within these countries, authority was fortified by an international support and by a social pact which insured economic growth, employment and emergence of middle class. After the 9/11 attacks, US policy geared towards encouraging Arab regimes by reinforcing their repressive systems against individual freedom. Additionally, the Arab world missed the euphoric growth period of the 1970–1980s which saw the taking off of Asia and Latin American countries. Economic liberalisation initiated within the structural adjustment program failed to generate benefits to Arab population and the bad politico-economic choices allowed only for adjustment policies. The economic crisis which hit the world in 2007 greatly affected emerging countries’ economies (Trabelsi 2011). Mediterranean countries whose economies are strongly linked to the European Union could not help themselves from being greatly affected by this crisis. The increasing economic problems and regional disparities are the main reasons responsible for deteriorating the social conditions and encouraged population to take it to the streets to protest against their governments revealing thus the political fragility of all these countries. The era of the Arab democratic transition has started. It is a transition that aims at preserving and promoting dignity and the fundamental rights of the people, insuring social justice, favouring collective economic and social development, reinforcing social cohesion as well as national peace and creating a convenient environment for international peace. This paper will be structured as follows: the first section will be devoted to democratic transitions in the world. The second section evaluates the impact of the transition on democracy, corruption and economic growth and this by examining countries which knew political changes. The third section focuses on transition in the Arab Spring countries. The main challenges will be examined in the fourth section. Finally, the fifth section will be devoted to conclusions and recommendations.",2

Sabiroglu,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"This paper analyzes the relationship between public expenditure and economic growth in Azerbaijan from 2001 to 2010. During this period, the real value of gross domestic product (GDP) has quadrupled, and the volume of government budget expenditure, which is greatly affected by the higher oil prices, has increased about 15 times in terms of USD. There are two contrary hypothesises are dealing with the direction of causality between government size and economic growth. Well known Keynesian approach considers public expenditure as exogenous factor, which is cause of economic growth. On the other hand, Wagner’s hypothesis predicts that public expenditure is an endogenous factor as a consequence of a growing economy. Using time-series, cross-sectional and cross-country analysis the abovementioned two hypothesises have been empirically tested both for developed and developing countries. Although these studies have covered a wide spectrum, researches on oil exporting countries are very limited and generally found mixed results (Asseery et al. 1999) or no evidence (Burney 2002; Babatunde 2011) to support Wagner’s law. The oil exporter countries differ from the others in many respects. As Burney (2002) states, in these countries ‘receipts from oil exports are the main source of public revenues and public expenditure is believed to be an engine of economic growth and the only fiscal policy instrument that is used by the authorities for stimulating economic activities in the country.’ Wu et al. (2010) by utilizing a panel data set for categorized 182 countries, including Azerbaijan, and covering the period from 1950 to 2004, found bidirectional causality between government size and economic growth, with the only exception for the low income countries that government spending is measured by share of GDP. To control heterogeneity sample countries firstly have been divided into OECD and non-OECD groups, and then also classified as high, middle and low income groups, according to the World Bank Atlas method, for further investigation. 
However, as Quah (1993) suggests, cross-sectional and cross-country studies with underlying assumption of homogeneity of all economies in relation to growth path gives results that are difficult to interpret, due to the varying policies and implementation patterns. Further, Abu-Bader and Abu-Qarn (2003) argue that cross-country growth regressions do not capture the dynamics of the relationship between these two variables and country specific factors are likely to influence the causal nature. It is also important to take into consideration that oil price impact on the economy in case of oil importing and exporting countries differs significantly. Research conducted on the relationship of oil prices with different macroeconomic indicators can be divided into three groups. The first group is concentrated on oil importing countries which cover the majority of the economies; the second group investigates the case of oil exporting countries; finally the third group studies the impact of oil prices on the global economy. In contrast to oil importing countries generally high oil prices induces economic growth in oil exporting countries. Rautava (2004) examines the sensitivity of output and fiscal revenues to changes in international oil prices and the real exchange rate of the national currency; furthermore, results indicate a strong dependence of fiscal revenues on output and oil price fluctuations, in the case of Russia. Notwithstanding, Beck et al. (2007) reveals that oil prices do not translate to economic growth as previously. This research studies Azerbaijan economy, as an oil rich country which tripled its GDP from 2001 to 2007 and demonstrated significant nonoil economic growth rate during the crisis and post crisis period (15.9 % in 2008, 3.2 % in 2009, 7.9 % in 2010 and 9.4 % in 2011). According to the statistics of the recent years approximately half of GDP, 70 % of total government budget revenues and 90 % of total export of the country belong to oil and gas sector. The paper aims to provide empirical research to identify the long and short-run relationship between public expenditure and economic growth in Azerbaijan, including the impact of oil prices. The results are of great importance to understand the magnitude of oil impact, and using time series econometric techniques the research concentrates on the validity of Wagner’s hypothesis in the oil-exporting economy. The second section of the paper explains the methodology, provides data analysis, long and short-run relationships among variables. Analysis of the empirical results and conclusions are made in the third and fourth sections, respectively.",4

The small open economy model exchange rate pass through is estimated. Two econometrics methodologies such as Structural Vector Autoregressive (SVAR-henceforth) and Vector Error Correction Methodology (VECM henceforth) are used in order to identify the short and long term effect of the exchange rate on real GDP and prices. The question of the optimal monetary regime for small open economies is still unanswered. There is no optimal monetary regime; it depends on the circumstances of the country. Economists have not been able to determine whether these countries should use floating or fixed exchange rates. As to, the countries in transition, the exchange rate has often played a fundamental role in macroeconomic stabilization. From 1992 to the end of 1995, the government of the Republic of Macedonia did not have a clear platform regarding macroeconomic stability, which often led to conflict between monetary and fiscal authority. For example, the National Bank of Republic of Macedonia (NBRM henceforth) attempted to stabilize the economy via stabilization of exchange rate, which necessary required a higher interest rate, thus affected the budget adversely and the NBRM was pressured to the lower interest rate. Since 1995, the NBRM is applying monetary strategy of targeting the exchange rate, i.e. the stabilization of exchange rate, has proven very successful at reducing the rate of inflation. From 1996 to the 2010, the rate of inflation has been single digital number. The Republic of Macedonia, in particular, has faced many systemic changes, such as the liberalization of the capital account in 2005, becoming a member of the World Trade Organization in 2002, and gaining candidacy status for joining the European Union in 2004. Under such circumstances, any investigation of exchange rate regime must address a seemingly incompatible trinity: the liberalization of capital movement, fixed exchange rates, and independent monetary policy (Obstfeld 1998; Mishkin 2003). Moreover, Levy-Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2001) claims that for non-industrial economies, a “long” peg (lasting five or more years) is associated with a lower rate of inflation than floats, but at the cost of a slower rate of growth. Recently, the issue of exchange rate regime has become more pronounced since the liberalization of the capital account took place. Therefore, the monetary strategy of targeting the exchange rate could easily become a target of speculative attack (sudden large capital inflows), which in turn could lead to negative impacts on real economic activity due to increases in and fluctuation of the interest rate and fluctuation of foreign exchange reserve—foreign exchange reserve being important for international liquidity. On the other hand, the solution of simply shifting the exchange rate from a fixed exchange rate to a more flexible one, depreciating the domestic currency in order to settle the problem of deficit in the current account, and thereby promoting fast economic growth, could easily disturb macroeconomic stability without any real short-term economic benefits. This suggests a need for ongoing analyses of the effects of exchange rate policy on real GDP and prices in order to assess the relative costs and benefits associated with introducing a different exchange rate regime. Although the role of the exchange rate regime is limited in influencing economic growth, the role of such regimes in affecting economic growth—especially the costs and benefits of introducing a different exchange rate regime (one using inflation targeting)—has received growing attention in the Republic of Macedonia. Therefore, in this paper, I focus on identifying the effect that exchange rate regime in real GDP and prices in small open countries in transition. Based on the data from 1997 to 2010, my empirical research is supported by empirical testing using the most-used methodologies, such as SVAR and VECM. The theoretical and empirical literature concerning SVAR and VECM, both in the developed countries and the countries in transition, provides the foundation of my own empirical research. The reminder of the paper is organized as a follows. “Review of Literature”. “Econometric Model for Testing Short-Term Effect Exchange Rate on Real GDP and Prices” describes an econometrics model for testing the short term effect of exchange rate on real GDP and prices. “Econometric Model for Testing Long-Term Dynamic Effect Exchange Rate on Real GDP and Prices: Vector Error Correction Model (VECM)” presents an econometrics model for testing the long term effect of exchange rate regime on real GDP and prices. “Conclusions” provides the conclusions.",
20,3,Transition Studies Review,07 November 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-013-0290-6,Effectiveness of Specific Monetary Policy by the Currency Board,November 2013,Kamelia Assenova,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The IS–LM framework for macroeconomic analysis observes, as known, the equilibrium on the goods and money market together. In standard IS equation the aggregate demand is positively related to its components—consumer expenditure, investments, government spending and net export. In standard LM equation the real money balance is positively related to a transaction variable and negatively—to an opportunity cost. The change of different components of IS or LM equations could be moved the amount of aggregate demand, respectively the aggregate supply. The IS–LM framework has been criticized by many researchers during the last years as Tobin (1969), Barro (1984), Brunner and Meltzer (1993), King (1993), Lucas (1972), Sims (1992). McCallum and Nelson (1997) divided the weakness of IS–LM model, taking the opinion that “the analysis is fundamentally misguided”, because it creates the impression that real output movement and levels are really manipulatable by the monetary authorities. Here is not discussing the IS–LM model by the orthodox Central Bank and a weakness in this case. It will be presented the situation when the monetary authority works under the rules of Currency Board and conducts the specific monetary policy. Below it will be discussed the weakness of IS–LM model by the Currency Board. It suggests that more of lacks of the model don’t work by the Currency Board due to specific conditions in this case and it will be try to demonstrate the activities of monetary authority influences on the level of aggregate output in the country. Here it will be discussed the weakness presented by the paper of Bennett McMallum and Edward Nelson as following: 
 “IS–LM analyses presumes a fixed, figid price level” (already cited). Under the Currency Board the amount of money and deposits by the monetary authority are covered with the foreign reserve currency. Due to it new issue of money is possible only by the inflow of foreign currency. It keeps the expansion of money supply in the country. Because it the price level is stable and characterizes with low index of inflation. “It does not distinguish between real and nominal interest rate” (already cited). In the country with orthodox Central bank, the activities of monetary authority influence on the level of money supply and it is a reason to be changed the price level. In this case the differences between real and nominal rates could be enough high and predetermine the decisions of economic agents. By the Currency Board, the differences between real and nominal interest rates are smallest and it will be presented below in the case of Bulgaria. Two main interest rates—basic and on the interbank market—are on the low level after the introduction of the Currency Board in Bulgaria. “It does not recognize enough distinct assets” (already cited). In the case of Bulgaria, it is not finding the different and profitable investment possibilities. The undeveloped stock market in the country is with small volume of trade (around 150,000 EURO per day). The risk of real sector stays high and due to it the investments in the corporate securities and stocks are not preferable. Other alternate is a government security. The needs of the Government are not high during last years and the Ministry of Finance does not expand new issue of securities. Due to this reason the bank deposits stay as a main alternate investment possibility. Below it will be observed the change of deposits in the Bulgarian banks. “It permits only short-run analysis” (already cited). By the Currency Board there is not actively monetary policy. The monetary institution loses more of the instruments of such policy. In case of Bulgaria, it keeps only minimum required reserves. The changes of money supply depend on the market forces and follow the same of money demand. The fluctuation of the economic activity is not significant. The more important instrument to influence on the economic growth is a fiscal policy. The reducing of tax and the growth of government spending are limited, in the first case, from needed revenue of budget, in the second case—from the value of GDP. But as it known from financial theory, early before the government spending to lead to 100 % of GDP, the process will be stopped. In case of Bulgaria by the small amount of GDP and the difficult recovery from the global crisis during the last years, these fluctuations could be denied. 
 “It treats the capital stock as fixed” (already cited). This argument is acceptable. But in the case of Bulgaria, the investments in new physical capital are not enough and it not strongly influence on the economic fluctuations. “It is not derivable from explicit maximizing analysis of rational economic agents” (already cited). The Currency Board creates the predictable stage on the market for long period of time and it permits stable situation for the economic agents and their expectations. All these notes allow to be discussed the specific monetary policy by the Currency Board and its impact on the aggregate supply in the case of Bulgaria. As it wrote above, by the Currency Board the monetary base and money supply depend on the market forces. They adapt to changes in the balance of payment at any given time. The mechanism of growth of money supply is different in terms of the banking system with Central Bank and this with Currency Board. By the Central Bank, the banking system growths the reserve money usually associates with an increase of net domestic assets due to the purchase of government debt or lending to the commercial banks. The Bulgarian version of the Currency Board (introduced July, 1, 1997) differs from the typical one. Its characteristic suggests the differences in the comparison with the standard mechanism of money supply under a Currency Board as a follow: 
 The main feature of the Currency Board in Bulgaria—one of the Departments in former Central Bank, provides the coverage to the monetary liabilities with foreign reserves of the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) excepting those to the international financial institutions. The standard approach provides coverage only available local currency. The balance of international reserves excised of 100 % coverage of the monetary liabilities of an independent monetary authority at the time of introduction of the Currency Board. It is shaped like a deposit of the Banking Department of BNB by the Issue Department, and its size at any time determines by an independent monetary authority on the residual principle. The control of money supply by the Currency Board in Bulgaria depends on fiscal policy. It could be omitted by the politics using intense fiscal reserve, because this element is a significant part of the liabilities of Issue Department. The amount of deposits of other economic agents by the Issue Department has a very low percentage, 1.2 of total liabilities in the opening balance and may low affect on the monetary base. The fiscal policy contributes to the stability of the monetary base in the medium term and with the rules of the Currency Board when, ΔDg = 0 (ΔDg − change of government deposit). Under the law of Currency Board, no the instruments directly to affect the government deposit and such of other institutions. BNB could potentially offset the effects of fluctuations of fiscal reserves on the monetary base by the change of the minimum reserve requirements for banks or bank loans through their role as lender of last resort (in Bulgaria by the Currency Board only—by systemic risk). However, both instruments of influence are not flexible enough, there are with temporary lags and not allow smooth control of money supply. As a result by the introduction of Currency Board in Bulgaria occurred following changes in money supply: 
 to enhance a trust in Bulgarian bank institutions and as the result the deposits returnes to the banking system. The increasing trust of bank customers and economic stability have been the most significant influence on the dynamics of less liquid components of money supply as time and savings deposits. Observed increase of deposits in foreign currency by the commercial banks, leading to an increase of money supply. The decline the trust of economic agents to the banking system led to a withdraw on deposits in foreign currency, maximizing in November 1995. The increased confidence is illustrated by the index of dollarization of the economy (turnover ratio in BGN and foreign currency). The high values this ratio shows escaping from the local currency. It reaches its maximum value 0.75 in February 1997. After it, decreases smoothly and starts increasing of confidence of foreign investors. Increase of the assets of Currency Board following the return of large amount in foreign currency from abroad in recent years, changes the money supply too. Most of this reserve currency covers the increased money supply. Inflation rate measures by consumer price index remaines at low levels, allowing to realize and actually increase the real money supply. The relative underestimation of the local currency when introduced Currency Board, with the strengthening of dollar on the international markets led to a positive balance of trade surplus in 1997. It is not due to absolute growth of exports. The reason is a significant decrease of imports as a result both the strengthening of dollar and because of limited domestic demand. Thereby providing the foreign currency flow ensures the coverage of the increase of money supply. This trend does not maintain in years due to a growing negative balance of payments and current account. By the sharp changes in the available reserve currency, BNB could not respond and not sterilize the monetary dynamics, causing a turbulence in the money market and also affects economic growth. The threat for the action of the Currency Board is the banking crises. The liquidity difficulties and crises of commercial banks by Currency Board is very possible (example—the crisis in Argentina). In the situation of progressive decline the trust of the householders in the state banking institutions in the mid-90’s, the foreign currency deposits in commercial banks decreases significantly. Such withdrawing would be eroded the coverage of deposit liabilities with reserve currency. Run on deposits in BGN, would result in a short period to the banking crisis.",

This issue is especially important for emerging economies, such as Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), since in these countries bank credits remain the leading source of capital (Fungacova et al. 2010b; Drakos and Konstantinou 2005). Therefore, determination of the sources of the banking system fragility and the impact of market power on financial stability are critical. There are two main views in the literature on the type of relationship between competition and financial stability: competition–stability and competition–fragility. The competition–stability view states that more market power results in greater bank risks as higher interest rates charged to customers make it harder to repay loans. In contrast, according to the competition–fragility point of view, the presence of the excessive competition may undermine the stability of the banking industry since smaller banks in more competitive environment are more prone to undertake higher risk. As a result, there is an ongoing debate on the type of relationship between the market structure and fragility of banking system since there is no theoretical or empirical consensus on the role of competition on banking stability. There are two different approaches regarding banking fragility in empirical studies: macro and micro perspectives. In the macro perspective, banking fragility contributes to the risk of systemic financial crisis (Beck et al. 2007; Schaeck et al. 2009; De Nicolo and Kwast 2002). From the micro perspective, bank fragility is defined as a probability of failure of an individual bank (Fungacova and Weill 2010a). The relationship between market power and financial stability has been investigated extensively for developed economies with more advanced regulatory frameworks. However, it is well-known that banks behave differently under different institutional settings, implying that the results obtained for developed countries may not apply to the transition economies (Mirzaei et al. 2011). In addition, the regulatory efforts undertaken in transition countries might differ from the ones in developed countries as they might pursue quite different objectives (Agoraki et al. 2011). There are only a few papers that have looked into the market structure of the banking system in the set of transition countries (Drakos and Konstantinou 2005; Fungacova et al. 2010b) and investigated the effect of the market structure on the banks’ stability (Fungacova and Weill 2010a; Yaldiz and Bazzana 2010; Agoraki et al. 2011). The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of the bank’s market power on the credit risk-taking attitude of Kazakhstani banks and overall bank stability. Analyzing this question is especially important for the Kazakhstani financial system as it has been going through considerable structural changes lately. The subprime crisis of 2007 adversely affected both the macroeconomic situation in Kazakhstan and its banking sector, resulting in the collapse of the banking industry in 2008. Three of Kazakhstan’s ten largest banks, including BTA Bank and Alliance Bank, were bailout by the government in early 2009. Since then, the industry has shrunk and been restructured, with loans dropping to 39 % of GDP in 2011 from 59 % in 2007. More than 30 % of Kazakhstani banks’ loan portfolios were overdue by more than 90 days at the end of 2011 (see Fig. 1). Problem loans, including nonperforming and restructured loans, were 50 % of total loans in 2011. Additionally, the banking sector has a relatively high concentration in loans to risky real estate and construction industries that was 25 % of total loans.
Footnote 1
 Overdue loans as percentage of total loans in the banking sector of Kazakhstan As a result, several measures have been undertaken by the Central Bank of Kazakhstan in order to improve the stability of the banking sector in the country.
Footnote 2 First, the Central Bank of Kazakhstan is planning to gradually increase the level of bank capital and promote the consolidation of small and medium-size banks in the sector. Table 1 shows that the country’s five largest banks control 71.8 % of total bank assets and 74.8 % of total loans, indicating that smaller size banks have little influence on the industry’s performance and risk profile. Consequently, the consolidation of small and medium-size banks might lead to higher competition in the banking industry and change the market structure. Second, the Central Bank of Kazakhstan proposes, if necessary, to decrease the share of foreign banks’ capital in the banking sector to the level of not more than 50 % of the total bank capital of the industry. The market share of foreign banks has increased by 8.6 % since 2007 for the three-year period through their mergers and acquisitions with local banks. De Nicolo and Loukoianova (2007) state that the risk profile of foreign banks is larger on average than the risk profile of domestic private banks.
 The aims of this paper, therefore, are three-fold. First, we analyze the bank competition in Kazakhstan by measuring the market power of Kazakhstani banks over the period of 2007–2011. In line with the most recent studies on bank competition (Berger et al. 2009; Fungacova and Weill 2010a; Fungacova et al. 2010b; Jimenez et al. 2010) we measure the level of market power by utilizing the Lerner index. Second, we analyze the relationships between banks’ market power and credit risk—taking behavior in Kazakhstan. The research employs overdue loans to total loans ratio to measure the bank credit risk-taking. Finally, we analyze the impact of greater bank’s market power on the overall stability of the banking system in Kazakhstan. This research will help to determine the market power of each bank and assist the policymakers to decide on the optimal level of consolidation in the banking industry of Kazakhstan for insuring the financial stability in the country. The remaining part of the paper is structured in the following way. In section two, we analyze the scope of studies that have been done on these research questions, introducing two opposite views on the existing problem. In section three, we define our data, sample, dependent and independent variables, and methodology. Section four discusses the major empirical results and section five concludes.",10

Our hypothesis is that the current EU recommendations regarding financial/economic efficiency criteria may lead to an inefficient allocation of public funds. Our recommendation for reforming the current allocation mechanism is based on the adaptation of private project evaluation rules and on the joint application of academic literature and international practice. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the two-step allocation mechanism of the EU. In the last section, we demonstrate the recommended methodology through a short example. Our methodology may increase social welfare through a more efficient fund allocation both at the member state and community level.",
20,3,Transition Studies Review,30 October 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-013-0289-z,Could Mediterranean Civil Society Revitalize the Ancient Agora?,November 2013,Laura Bergnach,Antonella Pocecco,,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"The history of the basin is a “long journey over the seawaters towards civilisation, from one civilisation to another, comprising landing places, conquests, learning, inventions, enlightenments, exchanges” (Goffredo 2000: 36—our translation). Metaphorically, the image of ancient agora well describes this space of meeting and exchange of ideas, where public interests and individual aspirations confront themselves in a continuous dialectic (Aligisakis 2001a: 26). The heritage of contact seems to play an important role, conferring prestige to the basin because it allows the organisation of symbolic references around universal reasons. The generically perceived magnificence of the past eventually configures a unity of style, a custom, a certain way of being and thinking, a conception, a model of relations among different groups, conforming to the ability to compare oneself with the other, which configures the Mediterranean habitus. There is, in the concept of agora, an embryonic form of participatory democracy that can be updated by enumerating the main aims and be considered as a viable theoretical framework for identifying the major problems in Mediterranean societies, articulating the current issues, and empowering the disadvantaged or marginalised area. In this sense, the merit of Barcelona Conference was essential because, for the first time, it was able to convey together three important issues of the Mediterranean in a unique process (Maïla et al. 2008: 105). Process that covers development and trade area, security and political cooperation, and a dynamic Mediterranean civil society that was considered as essential player for reaching a rather acceptable stability in the region and giving to this area a new “centrality”. In this process, civil society appears one of the crucial elements, a propulsive factor for the construction and edification of democracy, “custodian” of collective memory of every single part of the society. In other words: a keystone in the process of revitalizing the ancient agora. As a matter of fact, since 1989, the term civil society has become a constant and often improperly used refrain in a lot of scientific texts and political discourses. The concept of civil society has been increasingly employed for political or demagogical purposes, losing its hermeneutic potential and becoming a “fashionable” concept (Pocecco 2005). Retrospectively, the “Arab spring” has known the same enthusiasm and related disenchantment, possibly generated by the great expectation of analysts concerning the role and actions of the Mediterranean society. This misunderstanding has influenced the perception of the civil society as a “perfect condition”, a sort of golden age of every democratic society, in which social solidarity/cohesion constitutes essential and incorruptible feature. The constant appeal to the concept of civil society seems specifically due to its supposed capacity of synthesis between common good and individual aspirations (Seligman 1992). Accordingly, mythical images of nonviolent opposition—boycotts, protests, strikes, and other forms of disobedience—became fashionable symbols of democratic change too (Yom 2005). Indeed, the enthusiasm concerning civil society could be due to a confusion caused by different approaches to the concept itself, rising different definitions rooted in alternative in the social and political sciences, in effect very hard to be reconciled. In order to overcome this problem, we intend at least distinguish between two main meanings of this term, which we will call: political conceptualisation and sociological conceptualisation. The political conception of civil society, linked with the Anglo-American tradition of so called liberal-democratic theory, emphasises on civic institutions and political activity as an essential component of the emergence of a peculiar type of political society based on the principles of citizenship, rights, democratic representation and rule of law. This construct of civil society is criticized, considering that this interpretation implies a dichotomy between higher developed societies (characterised by a powerful civil society) and less evolved ones (characterised by a weak or non-existent civil society). In this sense, it seems very hard to establish empirically which are “truly” or “really” civil societies opposed to “pre-civil”, “uncivil” or “anti-civil” societies: in other terms, opposing the “weak” civil societies in contexts where the rule of law is still far from being applied, to the “strong” civil societies in a situation characterised by well-founded democracies. We should reckon the endemic variety of civil societies, their ways of expression, their specific actors and goals, which deeply typify its spaces of interaction and mobilization: every civil society, geographically and politically located, is being deeply rooted in its specific environment and strictly linked to its cultural frame and heritage. Moreover, a problematic aspect is related to the regional diversity of the Mediterranean area; looking at the history and today’s events that affect the Southern shore, we should remark that the collective imagination tends to paint the Arab world as a unified entity. North Africa is perceived as an homogeneous entity, structured around a strong majority religion (Muslim), a population of Semitic origin, and only one Semitic language (Arabic), a relatively homogeneous geography, a unique culture shaped by over fourteen centuries (at first Muslim empire, then the Ottoman Empire). The reality is multifaceted and evidently more complex, characterized by ethnic and tribal differences, language differences, presence although in minority of non-Muslim religions, important differences even within Islam itself, last but not least from a differentiated socio-economic development by country and sub-regions. In this way, we could question how much ethnic, linguistic, religious heterogeneity and fragmentation contributed to hinder a “common social” growth (Hamaui and Ruggerone 2011: 100–101). The sociological conception looks at civil society as an intermediate associational domain, placed between the State, on one side, and the basic units of society on the other (in general related to institutions, associations that do not belong to political, but cultural or economic sphere), they are directed by social organizations with some degree of autonomy and voluntary participation of their members. The conceptual pair “state/civil society”, as understood by the sociological literature, is commonly used to determine the differentiation of the State from civil society; while when considering this distinction, we turn to the consciousness that this definition contains some problematic aspects. At first, the question whether all types of intermediate association may be “virtually” included in this notion of civil society, therefore this distinction doesn’t look so much inappropriate, in fact its nature of descriptive term, which focuses on autonomy from State and internal solidarity, implies some ambiguities because it might be equally applied to organizations like, we could give a negative example, mafia and underground economy or, a positive one, like women’s associations. [Aligisakis (2001b): 25] wonders whether civil society sounds as a “chameleon concept”, stressing on its complex polysemy. The prevalent notion of civil society is excessively optimistic and disregards ambiguities and conflicts inherent to the real civil society. Also the relationship between individuals and community within civil society seems not automatically guaranteed; on the contrary it appears to be one of the most critical aspects of every theoretical vision. Another objection refers to the level of structuring the associational context, taking into account that it may be changeable both concerning time and space. Indeed, some social aggregations, at the beginning totally unstructured and spontaneous, became sometimes able to make a lot of pressure to the authorities rising a mass-mobilization, and they might reach, afterwards, a more or less permanent organization and recruitment capacity. We observe that Mediterranean presents very interesting and original examples which give rise to a number of effects about their inclusion or exclusion from civil society—one for all, the case of civil society animated by religion vs. a secular civil society.",

Çule and Fulton (2013) report that governance strongly influences the business environment, because an economy with a high concern for compliance with the law, an adequate level of bureaucracy and efficient control of corruption is expected to provide a business environment characterized by economic performance. According to Price et al. (2011) there are numerous governance studies that have deeply argued the link between stronger governance systems and a more effective allocation of economic resources, which in turn contributes to the sustainable economic growth. Knack and Keefer (1997) report the idea of the importance of institution as powerful determinants for economic growth, while Rodrik (1997) highlights the same idea referring to the role of governance institutions for the economic success and growth. Same opinion of strong relationship between various aspects of governance and key elements of growth performance was also highlighted by Acemoglu et al. (2001) and Rodrik et al. (2004). There is a rich literature that explores the relationship between governance indicators and different development outcomes, but few investigate the direct link that might be identified between quality of governance and competitiveness (see for example, Ng and Gujar 2009). This brief paper intends to fill that gap, presenting empirical evidence to support the hypothesis of the impact of governance indicators on country global competitiveness, while at the same time recognizing there are cross-regional differences in the explanatory power of these governance variables on the country global competitiveness.",1

In the light of global economic crisis this topic is gaining in importance because adequate early warning systems for banking crises might help economic policy holders to make timely decisions in order to prevent occurrence of banking crises. Very high costs of systemic banking crises impose the necessity for early warning systems. Therefore, it is necessary to work continually on their development since that would significantly contribute to strengthening banking supervision process and to decreasing probability of systemic banking crises. Since there is no early warning model for banking crises in Montenegro the basic motive for this research is a great importance of these models, primarily for the stability of banking system as well as for the entire financial system. As Davis and Karim (2008) emphasize logit models are more adequate for use as global early warning system and signal approach is more suitable as early warning system for a specific country. Initial assumption of signal approach introduced by Kaminsky et al. (1998), is that economy behaves differently in the eve of financial and banking crisis, which manifests in evolution of certain economic and financial indicators. Systems of indicators are dynamic mechanisms for monitoring structural vulnerability of financial systems. The objective of the work is to create an early warning system for systemic banking crises in Montenegro using signal approach and simple logit regressions as robustness check. Development of Montenegrin banking sector is characterized by enormously high credit growth in pre-crisis period. Montenegro is one of the European developing countries that had the fastest economic growth. Therefore, real growth in Montenegro reached its peak in 2007 when it was 10.70 %. Period of credit expansion in Montenegro is characterized with high level of foreign direct investments that gave driving force to economic expansion. At the same time there was expansion on capital market and on property market as well. Considering that demand for real estate was inflated bursting of bubble was quite expected. Credit expansion in Montenegro was enormous and although it significantly contributed to economic growth, evidently that three-digit credit growth rates were based on unrealistic basis. Namely, many countries have experienced similar crises and scenario is less or more same everywhere. Unsustainable credit expansion sooner or later will result in bubble bursting and will eventually bring economy into recession and greater credit expansion and boom implies more prevalent credit contraction and deeper bottom of the crisis. Therefore, in Montenegro credit stagnation has started in the fourth quarter of 2008. The remainder of paper is structured as follows. “Methodology and Availability of Data” describes methodology for creating early warning system and availability of data. In “Implementation of Signal Approach” composite indices are created on the basis of indicators with the best performances that are selected using signal approach. In “Robustness Test with Logit Regression” robustness of these indices is checked using simple logit regressions and their reliability is compared applying technique of Bayesian model averaging. “Interpretation and Discussion” includes interpretation of results and discussion, while concluding remarks are in “Concluding Remarks”.",
20,3,Transition Studies Review,22 October 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-013-0294-2,Drivers of Regional Competitiveness in the Central European Countries,November 2013,Imre Lengyel,János Rechnitzer,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the course of the years many concepts of regional competitiveness were formed which spring from diverse opinions (Barkley 2008; Bristow 2010; Dijkstra et al. 2011; Kitson et al. 2004; Lukovics 2009). From an economic point of view, the competitiveness of territorial units, i.e. countries and regions can be measured by the total factor productivity, as Krugman (1994) says. Porter (2008, 3) states “Competitiveness depends on the productivity with which a location uses its human, capital, and natural resources. Productivity sets the sustainable standard of living”. In regional science it can be considered generally accepted that the competitiveness of regions, cities is more than the productivity of inputs, since it essentially means a regional economic development, as a result of which the average standard of living in the region improves (Camagni 2002; Camagni and Capello 2010; Malecki 2002). Competitiveness of regions and cities may be well described by the widely recognized definition of Storper (1997, 20): “The ability of an (urban) economy to attract and maintain firms with stable or rising market shares in an activity while maintaining or increasing standards of living for those who participate in it.” Built on this approach, the standard notion of competiveness is widely accepted as (EC 1999, 75): “the ability of companies, industries, regions, nations and supra-national regions to generate, while being exposed to international competition, relatively high income and employment levels”. In other words “high and rising standards of living and high rates of employment on a sustainable basis” (EC 2001, 37). The European Competitiveness Reports also adopt this approach (EC 2008, 15): “competitiveness is understood to mean a sustained rise in the standards of living of a nation or region and as low a level of involuntary unemployment, as possible.” Since the notion of regional competitiveness can be seen as refining that of economic development, it can be often be observed that proposals for improved competitiveness combine traditional means of endogenous development with strategies based on regional policies. There are a number of attempts to define the model of regional competitiveness (Huggins 2003; Martin et al. 2006; Porter 2007; Snieska and Bruneckiené 2009). The pyramidal model of regional competitiveness seeks to provide a systematic account of this standard means of EU and to describe the drivers of improved competitiveness (Lengyel 2004). This model has been adopted by many authors in international literature (Berumen 2008; Gardiner et al. 2004; Parkinson et al 2006; Resch 2008; Sinabell 2011), since “this model is useful to inform the development of the determinants of economic viability and self-containment for geographical economies” (Pike et al. 2006a, 26). As it can be perceived in the pyramidal model, “more recent analytical review has sought to identify the interrelated factors that driver competitiveness” (Pike et al. 2006b, 112). The pyramidal model is established on the basis on the inputs–outputs–outcomes relationships (Lengyel 2009; Gardiner et al. 2004; Parkinson et al 2006). Outcomes are the standard of living, the prosperity of any region depends on its competitiveness. Outputs are the revealed competitiveness indicators: labor productivity, employment rate and household income (wages). Sources of competitiveness, inputs are drivers of competitiveness with a direct and short-term influence on economic output. In the renewed pyramidal model there are five drivers of regional competitiveness (Lengyel and Rechnitzer 2013): research and technological development, human capital, productive capital and FDI, traded sectors and clusters, social capital and institutes. In our study we will proceed to analyse the competitiveness of 93 NUTS2 level regions of 8 Central European countries with the help of an empirical database, using multivariable statistical methods. After introducing the database, we are going to investigate into the common revealed competitiveness indicator. Not only revealed competitiveness categories shall be analysed with the help of multivariable statistical procedures, but also the background processes described by the factor analysis and the multivariable linear regression model.",9

Still, one issue has remained mainly unexplored, despite its relevance: Chinese monetary policy. This can be attributed to the specifics of the Chinese economy. Namely, there is large difference between the rate of return to capital in China, which is estimated at around 20 % by Bai et al. (2006), and the People’s Bank of China (PBC) interest rate, which is, roughly, 5 %. As a consequence, the PBC interest rate is unlikely to be an effective instrument for affecting the economy. In addition, the Chinese financial system, unlike the systems in developed countries, is dominated by big state commercial banks. These two facts than imply different monetary policy transmission, and consequently, different way of conducting monetary policy than in developed countries. Specifically, China uses both conventional monetary instruments, like the interest rate and the reserve requirement, on which official data are available (called quantitative instruments) and ‘unconventional’ instruments, like the ‘window guidance’ (giving instructions to the commercial banks on their credit activity) and selective credits, on which data are not available (called qualitative instruments). It is well acknowledged in the literature that the qualitative instruments may be more important for conducting monetary policy in China than quantitative instruments (Goodfriend and Prasad 2006). The absence of data on the qualitative instruments is then another reason for the scarcity of research on Chinese monetary policy. Some studies that analyse Chinese monetary policy include: Xie (2004), Jinwen and Hui (2006), Zhang (2009), Liu and Zhang (2010), Mehrotra and Sánchez-Fun (2010), Fan et al. (2011), Ma et al. (2011); however, they completely abstract from analysing the qualitative instruments. This paper aims to fill this gap by investigating the role of the qualitative instruments for the monetary-policy conduct in China. In the first part of the analysis, the qualitative instruments are obtained by a Kalman-filter estimation of a money-demand function for China. The second stage examines how these qualitative instruments have responded to gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation, and compares these findings with the findings for the main conventional instrument, the PBC base interest rate.",2
20,3,Transition Studies Review,23 October 2013,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11300-013-0293-3,Value Contradiction in Policymaking: The Case of Iranian Foreign Policy,November 2013,Hossein Gheleji,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Public organizations and institutional arrangements pursue the collective interests through the public policymaking process. A source of error in this manner is that decision-making system is chaotic, policymakers are affected by political procedures, and so policy preferences change continuously through time. Then the implementing agencies share overlapping jurisdictions, bureaucratic agencies make decisions in a parallel redundant system, and implementation of policies become impossible. This process leads the public policy system to a position which we can analyze in terms of “multiple rationalities” (Kingdon 1984). Political actors, in this manner, define and achieve relative consensus on the solutions. Iranian political agencies and bureaucratic arrangements, nowadays, are the most famous models of chaotic policymaking and overlapping policy implementation organizations. Therefore understanding and even predicting Iranian behavior in most areas like foreign policy becomes very hard to Western countries. The empirical findings show that many of political institutions like the ministry of foreign affairs, the organization of Islamic Culture and Guidance or even the National Army and Islamic Revolution’s Guardian Corps (IRGC) are not only competitive over their policy tasks, but also uncertain about how they must behave in relation to one another when they share the same policy responsibilities. So a small change in one of the political actors causes a big change in policy outputs. Obviously coherent policymaking arises from coherent ideological principles agreed upon by actors in policymaking systems which in French literature of public policy are called référentiels (Muller 2000; Chevalier 2008). Current policy processes and institutional arrangements in the Islamic Republic suffer from what we call “Ideological Dualism” which makes the Islam/Iran gap in the political system in general and policy performance in particular. This trend is dramatically combined with dogmatic mentality versus pragmatic mentality. This ideological gap leads to the variation and division among political actors on référentiels, the main sociological paradigms and ideological frameworks. Lack of this consensus on principles make gaps in strategies, institutional arrangements and consequently, overlapping or even dualism in policy goals and behaviors. Unlike the most developed countries in which the main principals are accepted by at least most of the policymakers, Iranian policymakers have no consensus on main principals yet. The core politicians, for example, are discussing and disputing the economic ideology after 30 years from the revolution; some of them believe in capitalism, some believe in a kind of socialism, and some of them deny both and believe in Islamic economy. This is true about cultural policy, technology policy, foreign policy, social policy and so on. This means that the policymaking system is based on political men rather than a systematic procedure (Vahid 2005). This complex context makes policy processes and policy structures complicated, uncertain, overlapped or even antithetical. We therefore witness a radical policy change in any policy area when one specific ideological group dominates the others with the exception of some areas which are controlled by the supreme leader. If the dominated group cannot change the policy it will establish a new structure in a way we can name, for instance, “Parallel Armed Force (IRGC) “ after the revolution or “Parallel Intelligence Organization” after 2009 presidential election (Iran Human Rights Center 2009). The main question that we discuss in this research is: why do bureaucratic and political agencies of Iran make policies in a parallel, redundant, and opposed manner through time? To answer this question we have to discuss the Iranian political structure and the link between the government and the political ideology of Islam, and examine the implications of the political ideology of Islam, specifically the Shiite political ideology on the political structures after the Islamic Revolution. The concept of ideological dualism, as just introduced, sheds light on the Iranian policy-making black box and helps to explain and predict the behavior of the public agencies of the Islamic Republic. On the basis of consensus on goals and instruments among the policymakers, four basic models of public policymaking are identified; rational model, incremental model, coalition model and garbage can model. The rational model assumes rationality of decision-makers and emphasizes maximum profits with minimal costs. The procedure of decision-making is: to define goals, ascertain all alternatives to reach the goals, examine the alternatives in terms of their outcomes, the cost-benefit analysis, and make the best choice among the alternatives so that an optimal outcome is achieved. This is the ideal model for decision-making, but it is not practical, because there is a limitation on human information processing capacity and the ability to predict all alternatives output. The concept of Bounded rationality was later raised, which settles a “good enough” or “satisfactory” instead of an optimal one but the core idea is still rationality (Fischer 1980). The incremental model that first was proposed by Lindblom (1959) for problems with complexity and uncertainty, saying that there is no agreement upon policy instruments among policymakers and bureaucrats, emphasizes policymaking by a small change in previous policies. In the Coalition model different interest groups tend not to focus on common policy goals. Rather, they tend to form coalitions to boost up their forces to overcome opposition (Sabatier 1999). The garbage can model is the situation where both goals are ambiguous and instruments are uncertain. This is a model especially applied to organized anarchy situations which can be applied to Iran and some developing countries. Organized anarchy is “characterized by problematic preferences, unclear instruments, and fluid participation” (Cohen et al. 1972). Problematic preferences mean that the organization as a whole does not have a preferences ordering of the kind assumed in the theory of choice. For example in the Iranian social, development or technology policy, goals are not as clearly defined. Unclear instruments mean that the system’s processes are not understood by its members or administrators. Members know the goals to achieve, but they do not know the means to achieve them. Because decision-makers are uncertain about what method to use, instruments and means of implementation are contradictory (March and Olsen 1989). Fluid participation means that the decision-makers and authorities for a specific policy change capriciously. All interest groups and actors have opportunities to influence decision-making. In some cases, how decisions are made depends upon the participants (March and Olsen 1976). For example when a minister is changed, the whole policy may change. A situation with the above characteristics is a “garbage can” where decisions are the outcome of several interdependent and sometimes contradictory “streams” within a policy system (Kingdon 1984). Kingdon argues that there is an element of chance which explains the fluidity and rapid change of the policymaking process. Kingdon’s conception of public policy as a “primeval soup” also implies radical policy change and evolution (John 2003) (Table 1). Policy Coalition frameworks also help to identify more precisely the causal mechanisms driving policy change. The Policy Advocacy Coalition has made substantial headway in characterizing the conditions that lead to policy continuity as well as episodes of significant change in public policies (Jones and Jenkins-Smith 2009). The work of Baumgartner and Jones (1993) is also essential to a study of policy change. They point out that, in this situation at any particular time, an interest group is part of a winning policy monopoly or they are part of an out-of-power minority coalition (McBeth et al. 2007). A constitutional review of the Iranian policymaking system concluded that the supreme leader proclaims the general goals and ideals, and the Expediency Council issues the general policies of the system. The executive branch drafts a 4-year social, economic, and cultural development plan that must be ratified by the parliament. The executive branch divides this plan into yearly programs called the plan of specific sector development, which is provided by Management and Planning Organization. For each year the Executive branch and the Parliament apply budget documents to allocate resources for yearly programs and policies (Parliament 1980). It means that many formal political institutions with a broad variety of ideological orientations and mentality trends put their policy preferences into the policy agenda in any policy subject. If we keep in mind that there are a lot of informal pressure and interest groups which play a role in agenda setting, like IRGC, it will be a very chaotic situation (Fig. 1). Flow of the conflicting policy prefernces into the public policy agenda As mentioned before, a degree of integration and relevance between goals and policies in these processes, clearly, is very important. But, Iranian political agencies and bureaucratic arrangements, nowadays, are the most famous models of the contradictory policymaking structure or Garbage Can policymaking. In this system, one of the main characteristics of policy output is radical change. These radical changes of policy in Iran are rooted in the absence of coherence of policy which itself arises from the absence of a general agreement on goals and principles or common ideological frameworks (which is called référentiels) by actors in the policymaking system. Lack of this référentiels leads to the lack of integration in policy objectives, and consequently causes policy outputs to become overlapping, complicated, antithetical, redundant, or even opposed. This situation will make the implementation process impossible, and consequently the policies will change dramatically (Vahid 2005). The analysis of the effect of this notion, which was introduced by Pierre Muller (2000), leads us to pay attention to the competition of the ideological frameworks in policy analysis. It puts the aspirations of actors at the center of the analysis of public decisions. So the main opposition between policy options is rooted in the instrumental nature of ideologies, values and beliefs as justification of decisions (Chevalier 2008). The Islamic Republic is an ideological regime so policymaking in Iran is highly affected by cultural and ideological notions (see Crooke 2009) and therefore the current policy processes and institutional arrangements in Iran suffer from competition between ideological perceptions and elements which we call “Ideological Dualism”. Britannica Concise Encyclopedia in definition of dualism says: any pair of irreducible, mutually heterogeneous principles used to analyze the nature and origins of knowledge (epistemological dualism) or to explain all of reality or some broad aspect of it (metaphysical dualism); also, any theory that employs dualisms. This dualism makes the policymaking and implementation contradictory. To attain each contradictory policy goal, the Islamic republic has established contradictory institutions too. This is a complicated issue and history is replete with examples of how such policymaking with competing and opposing parallel institutions has not impaired political institutions’ ability to implement its policies. In this regard the core question is: why Iran’s policymaking system faces this complicated situation? The answer is that the root of this complicated policy context derives from the nature of the political ideologies, which underlie the current Iranian political regime. Without understanding this basic ideological ground we cannot understand Iran’s antithetical political behavior. The first contradictory ideological framework is Islamism (which is carried on the shoulders of the clerics) versus Iranism (an old nationalist ideology carried by intellectuals and technocrats). The core point of Islamism is that people are In Service of God and the main idea of Iranism is the interests of Iranian People (Crooke 2009). The Islamic Republic Party (1979–1981), IRGC, the supreme leader, and president Ahmadinejad are the representatives of Islamism orientation and National Front (1949–2005), NehzateAzadi Party, Rafsanjani, National Army, Mosharekat Party, and Mousavi are the representatives of Iranism orientation. The second competitive framework is the pragmatic mentality of policymakers versus dogmatic mentality. On one hand, Some Iranist policymakers and some Islamist policymakers have got pragmatic mentality together and on the other hand some other Islamists or iranists share dogmatic mentality. Dogmatism is a viewpoint or system of ideas based on insufficiently examined premises but pragmatism is referred to a practical approach to problems and affairs (Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary 2009). For example, the important Islamist Dogmatic actors are IRGC and president Ahmadinejad. The main Iranist pragmatic politician is Rafsanjani and the most important Iranist Dogmatic politician is Mousavi. From the mixture of these two ideological frameworks the below diagram is formed (Fig. 2). The diagram of conflicting ideas in policy system These contradictory factors which arise from Shia fiqh (a set of Islamic orders related to steering the Muslim society) and Iranian Nationalism (see Crooke 2009) merged in the Islamic Revolution (1979) and formed the basis for an Iranian policymaking black box (a policy system which is viewed in terms of its input, output and transfer characteristics without any knowledge about its internal workings). As we mentioned, the first problem in Iranian policymaking is that many political institutions participate in policymaking in any different cases. For instance in foreign policy, formal institutions like the Ministry of Foreign Policy, the Ministry of Islamic Culture and Guidance, the Supreme National Security Council, the Islamic Development Organization, Ahl-ul bait global assembly, the parliamentary committee, the Supreme Leader’s advisors, the Islamic Revolution’s Guardian Corps, and many other structures are not only competing over their policy tasks, but also uncertain about how they must behave in relation to each other in agenda setting, decision-making, and implementation of the Islamic Republic’s foreign policy. Even most of them do not know what are the vision, mission, and strategy of their organization, and there is no formally acclaimed policy document. In this policymaking system which is the best example of the “garbage can model” of policymaking, the participants in the decision-making process are very different, and how decisions are made depends upon the domination of the ideological orientation of the participants. The second problem is that the structures and actors confront each other in the name of people or God. For instance in foreign policy some political actors, such as ex-president Khatami, represented the Pragmatic Islamism dimension of the Islamic Republic and the Expediency Council and Parliament committee represented Pragmatic Iranism, while others, like IRGC, pushed the Dogmatic Islamism policy preferences into the policymaking system. Nowadays, president Ahmadinejad is the representative of the Dogmatic Islamism idea in policy system and therefore the solidarity of the system has increased after his election. In this regard, there could have been a chaotic situation inside the policymaking black box if Mousavi and his administration, as representatives of dogmatic Iranism, had come to the office. Dogmatic Islamism (the theological idealistic mentality), In case of foreign policy for instance, dictates policies that support Shi’i groups all over the world. The Ahl-ul Bait Global Assembly is the organization established to implement this policy. This approach is opposed more widely and more intensely by Pragmatic Iranism (which emphasizes Iranian national interests), or even Pragmatic Islamism (which stress the Islamic unity between Shias and Sunnis. This is why some Pragmatic politicians (Rafsanjani) call the Dogmatic Islamist politicians’ behavior (Ahmadinejad) toward the west as “adventurism” in foreign or security policy (Sanati 2007) (Fig. 3). The diagram of the conflicting ideas in foreign policymaking There are three important points in the case of Iran; first, the policymaking system is strictly oligarchic so only governmental actors can participate in the policymaking system. So in this actor-based system the change of an actor will affect the policy output, directly. Second, policymaking is affected most directly by culture and political ideology. Finally, there are many governmental actors, which play an active role in formulating each policy. In such a situation policymaking is a “complex chaotic system”. Because of the Lack of clear référentiels many of political institutions are not only sure and confident about their goals but also competitive over their policy tasks so policies are changed continuously. This chaotic policymaking situation in Iran cuts or aborts the policy continuation. For instance, the technology policy of president Khatami had focused on IT technology development, but right after the election of Ahmadinejad this policy completely shifted toward Nano-technology instead of IT; the IT programs stopped, the related budget was cut down, and the e-government establishing policy was forgotten (Gheleji 2007). We also find out that there are totally different and completely opposing policy options and goals among Iranian politicians if we look at the election time public debate on TV between Ahmadinejad and Mousavi. While Ahmadinejad stressed supporting Lebanon and Palestine according to Islam’s order, the other candidate (who was a prime minister 1 day), opposed it saying that “Ahmadinejad’s contradictory international policies were a danger to Iran’s future” (Erdbrink 2009). Or about policy toward Russia, there are completely contradictory approaches among Islamists and Iranists; as Islamists think that Russia is a friend, supporting us against “the Big Satan”-US, Iranist actors say that the real enemy of Iran is Russia, because of the Caspian Sea issue, 30-year war, occupying Iran during World War I and II. Some may ask about what we can do in such a situation? Here are some recommendations both for Iranian policymakers and foreign politicians. First for the Iranian policymakers, it is better to solve the ideological dualism based on national interests, defining the référentiels clearly, Making and establishing good and sustainable system of policymaking and distinguishing the institution’s authority and borders (Padgett 1980). Second for the foreign countries: there is a need to identify the winners and losers clearly. (Identifying the specific policy advocates or policy networks and their ideological mentality will lead us to predicting the change or continuing a policy stably); to identify the benefits and costs of each group or specific policy advocate framework; to understand the Ideological perceptions and symbols of each policy advocate group.",
