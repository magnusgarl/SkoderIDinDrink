Leon Zhao,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The ability to access credit is a critical lifeline for Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), which represent a large proportion of the total economy around the world. But financing SMEs has been a challenging task for the traditional banking system, as these firms are more informationally opaque, risky, financially constrained, and bank-dependent than large firms (Wehinger 2014). According to the OECD survey of SMEs’ access to finance in 34 countries from 2007 to 2013 (OECD 2015), SMEs tend to be much more vulnerable to economic and financial crises than larger corporations, and their access to credit tends to dry up much more rapidly. Key challenges that banks face when lending to SMEs include inadequate financial information and record-keeping, deficient business management knowledge, and banks’ lack of confidence (Mawocha et al. 2015). Online Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending, which has experienced significant growth in the last decade, has become an important new type of financial service for SMEs. Instead of a bank intermediating between lenders and borrowers, the P2P lending platform directly connects borrowers to lenders. Since the world’s first P2P lending platform, Zopa, was founded in 2005 in the United Kingdom, the P2P lending system has been quickly adopted in many other countries. P2P platforms in the United States provided approximately US$5.5 billion of lending in 2014 (PricewaterhouseCoopers 2015), and the total P2P loan volume in China in 2014 reached US$41.3 billion (Wang et al. 2015b). The lending business, which has historically been dominated by commercial banks, has gone through a so-called financial democracy paradigm shift (TheEconomist 2015). Renaud Laplanche, the CEO of Lending Club, the largest P2P company in the US, believes that while small business owners do not have adequate access to affordable and transparent credit via banks, P2P lending platforms like Lending Club can provide a predictable, flexible, low-cost way to access credit ‘on demand’ if and when they need it (Alois 2015). In Morgan Stanley’s May 2015 report (Srethapramote et al. 2015), SMEs’ P2P lenders represented $4.6 billion of 2014 issuance, or 2.1% of the total market. P2P lenders are estimated to reach $47 billion, or 16%, of total SMEs’ lending in the US. Information technology breakthroughs, i.e., big data-based financial technology (Fintech), have been identified as one important disruptive driving force of this paradigm shift in the lending industry (PricewaterhouseCoopers 2015; TheEconomist 2015; Karabell 2015). The big data era has witnessed to significant changes in methods to collect, present, and evaluate information (Lau et al. 2015). Search costs for credit information have been dramatically reduced, and the collection of credit data has transformed from passive information retrieval into proactive information gathering. In this paper, we take an information economics perspective to investigate how information signaling and search costs affect information asymmetry in the lending business and analyze how big data reduces information asymmetry in P2P lending. Rooted in the P2P lending business, we discuss the economic value of big data and outline a number of business opportunities and several challenging research issues.",48

1.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,02 December 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-015-0016-3,Performance of Islamic and conventional stock indices: empirical evidence from an emerging economy,December 2015,Md Ejaz Rana,Waheed Akhter,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The Shari’ah screenings criteria applied by the Islamic scholars have enabled Shari’ah Complaint Stock Indices to distinguish themselves from conventional stocks indices. In general, there are two Shari’ah screening criteria – positive and negative. Positive screenings allow an Islamic index to include those companies that meet certain Islamic ethical indicators (both quantitative and qualitative) whilst negative screenings delete stocks which are unable to meet such requirements. The common stock guidelines, accepted by Shari’ah scholars, have become a key factor in the growth of Islamic funds all over the world. Majority of the Shari’ah scholars are agreed that buying and selling of stocks &shares adhere to Shari’ah laws because shares & stocks represent real assets. In addition, the dividend payments are also in accordance with Shari’ah indicators since receipt/payment of interest (Riba) is unlawful (Haraam) in Islam. Hence, equities, mutual funds, and government bonds are considered more compatible with Shari’ah screenings criteria of profit and risk sharing than fixed income assets. The researches in Islamic finance have always been interested in investigating the question whether returns earned by the investors of Islamic funds/indices are different from conventional funds investors. In addition, the researchers are also examining whether adhering to Shari’ah law creates any impact on the performance of Islamic funds /indices because such funds suffer from restricted assets selection, limited investment practices, and smaller investment universe, Hassan (2001). Fundamentally, there are essentially two opposing views regarding Shari’ah screening effects on returns earned by Islamic indices. Opponents of Islamic ethical investing argue that implementing Islamic screening may result in limited investment universe due to potential increase in volatility, reduced diversification, and monitoring costs. In particular, due to Islamic screening, stable blue chip and larger firms may be excluded (due to high leverage) from Islamic index and as a result, remaining firms tend to be smaller and prevent investors to have other attractive investment opportunities from further consideration, Guyot (2011). On the other hand, advocates of Islamic investing argue that financial and Islamic ethical screens propose a good economic and social sense to evaluate potential investments. Islamic ethical investors can align their potential investments with their religious & ethical beliefs that will not only give them peace of mind but also a lawful (Halaal) monetary reward. In addition, the empirical findings of Myers (1993), Fama and French (1998 and 2002), Shyam-Sunder and Myers (1999) argue that most profitable firms borrow least, therefore there exist a negative relationship between profitability and leverage. Hence, Islamic index can outperform its conventional counterpart because all firms included in the any Islamic Index have low leverage ratios. Although Islamic funds have shown a massive growth over the past few decades, the empirical literature on the performance analysis of such funds is still at its initial stage. The limited literature provides somewhat mixed results regarding performance of Shari’ah screened funds/Indices compared to their un-screened counterparts. For example, Hakim and Rashidian (2002) analyzed the performance of Dow Jones Islamic Index (DJIM) against its conventional counterparts; Dow Jones world index (DJW) and Dow Jones Sustainability World index (DJS). They applied capital asset pricing model (CAPM) and reported that DJIM index has outperformed DJW but has underperformed DJS index. The same results are reported by Hussein and Omran (2005). This study documents that during entire bull period DJIM index has outperformed its counterpart, but has underperformed during the bear market period. On the other hand, Hoepner et al. (2011) examine performance differences of 62 Islamic equity funds collected from 20 different countries. They report that Islamic funds from 8 western nations are unable to outperform their equity benchmarks, whereas only 3 funds have, somehow, performed relatively well against their market benchmarks. In addition, Dharani and Natarajan (2011) find no significant differences between the performance of Indian Shari’ah compliant stocks and conventional stocks indices during the period of 2007 to 2011. They report that average return earned by Shari’ah compliant stocks is similar to conventional stocks returns. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first attempt towards analyzing the performance of Islamic index with its conventional counterpart in an emerging economy which is struggling to Islamize its monetary and financial system of the country Pakistan is one of those few emerging economies who started Islamization of monetary and financial system of the country in early 80s. As a result of Islamization efforts, Supreme Court of Pakistan, on 14 November 1991, declared bank interest as “Riba” and prohibited all types of interest prevailed in monetary and financial system of Pakistan. In July 2008, an Islamic Index (KMI 30) is launched with a view to provide a platform for ethical investors who seek to align their financial objectives with their religious beliefs and value systems. Beside increasing investor trust and enhancing their participation, KMI-30 index also serves as research tool for measuring performance of Shari’ah compliant stocks and strategic assets allocation procedure. In this regard, it is really need of the hour to assess the performance of Islamic index. This performance analysis will tell us whether Islamization of stocks index rewards its investors or not. In addition, it will also help us to know whether objectives of establishing Islamic index are fulfilled or not. This will also give us insight whether an emerging economy like Pakistan is better at offering ethical investment universe for its local and international investors as well. Therefore, our study is the first attempt of not only analyzing the performance of Islamic stock index of Pakistan but also its response to volatility effects caused by other macroeconomic variables such as interest rate and exchange rate. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is two-fold: first, by using different risk-adjusted performance measures such as Jensen’s Alpha (1968), Sharp ratio (1966), Treynor Ratio (1965), and MM (1977), this study investigates the potential impact of Shari’ah screening on the performance of Karachi Meezan Index (KMI-30), traded at Karachi Stock Exchange (Pakistan), against its conventional counterparts Karachi Stock Exchange index (KSE-100). The study examines whether returns earned by ethical investors who trade Shari’ah compliant stocks (KMI-30) are different from conventional investors. Second, to examine the effects of volatilities of interest rate and exchange rate on KMI-30 index and its counterparts, this study employs Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic in the mean (GARCH-M) model. This framework relaxes constancy assumption of classical linear regression (CLRM) model and allows exchange rate volatility and interest rate volatility to evolve over time. The GARCH-M framework also reveals results about risk-return trade-off in the context of returns earned by Islamic and conventional investors.",16

Whinston,Shaokun Fan,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In 1993, “Making money on the Internet” inspired the global gold rush in electronic commerce (e-commerce) along the newly opened information speedway (Glossbrenner & Glossbrenner 1994). In a little bit more than two decades, we have experienced the tremendous changes in our society brought up by the Internet, mobile communications, electronic commerce, and, nowadays, financial innovations. We have witnessed how Google, eBay, FaceBook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Alibaba, Tencent, Microsoft, CISCO, and many others, are booming in a short period, how social networks reinforced by ubiquitous mobile communications are penetrating and occupying in our daily life, and how explosive big data in the cyber space challenges our information and communication technologies (ICT), and hence stimulates the development of newer technologies, such as Hadoop (http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera/en/about/hadoop-and-big-data.html), Spark (https://spark.apache.org/), NoSQL (http://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained), H2O (http://0xdata.com/), etc. Electronic commerce has quickly evolved from trading of physical goods to digital goods, from primitive electronic payment to advanced financial services, and now credit based businesses (Niranjanamurthy & Kavyashree 2013). Today, baby-boomers is retiring, and Generation X, Y, and Z are giving the way to an even newer generation dwelling deeply in the cyber world. It is the right time to claim “Making money on the Internet by credit”, as the financial innovation, relying heavily on credit management, is leading the new gold rush on the information highway. Internet finance, enabled by ICT, is evolved from electronic commerce. The concept of Internet finance can be traced back to the earlier concept of electronic finance (e-finance) or network finance, which has been defined in MBALib (http://wiki.mbalib.com/wiki/%E4%BA%92%E8%81%94%E7%BD%91%E9%87%91%E8%9E%8D) as “the network technology and finance combined with each other”, but not yet in Wikipedia. By consolidating the information from different sources, Internet finance covers many latest innovative financial services, underpinned by the Internet technologies, mobile communications, and information intermediary based on revolutionary business models (Kauffman & Riggins 2012). Since all these innovations are rooted in the new generation of e-commerce, we can deal Internet finance as the latest evolution of e-commerce with the core in cyber-based credit management system. This paper is intended to investigate current status of Internet finance and identify the emerging research issues in this new arena. We specifically refer more cases in China than other countries because China has been leading the development of Internet finance since 2010s. In Sections 2 and 3, after reviewing the mushrooming Internet finance businesses, we will propose a market structure of Internet finance extended from traditional financial market, raise the issue of online credit management system, and conceive an architecture of big data based credit risk management system. We argue that advanced financial services, such as p2p lending, rely on efficient and reliable credit management. We further claim that the innovative credit management with big data analysis is the key to harnessing Internet finance. Based on this framework, in Section 4 we discuss the emerging research issues in the aspects of Internet finance governance, theoretic research topics, and technological challenges, particularly regarding the big data based credit system in the Internet finance era. Section 5 presents concluding remarks for this paper.",23
1.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,09 June 2015,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-015-0003-8,Will high-frequency trading practices transform the financial markets in the Asia Pacific Region?,December 2015,Robert J. Kauffman,Yuzhou Hu,Dan Ma,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Over hundreds of years around the world, securities were traded through physical venues where buyers and sellers met and negotiated the exchange of ownership of securities and assets. An example in the history of American financial markets is the “Buttonwood Agreement” of May 1792, involving 24 stockbrokers in New York (Terrell 2012). The group established an early basis for the New York Stock Exchange by agreeing to trade with one another and no others, and to set a minimum commission for share trading. They initially met under an American sycamore tree – the so-called “buttonwood tree,” at 68 Wall Street in lower Manhattan. This approach to making trades later moved to purpose-build financial exchange facilities and trading floors, where traders wore brightly-colored jackets, shouted out their bid and ask prices to buy and sell shares, and made themselves stand out from the crowd in the open outcry marketplace. With the recent developments and innovations in information technology (IT), the financial services sector has been transformed over several decades (Steiner & Teixeira 1989; Wriston 1988, 2007). In the 1800s, the use of the telegraph to connect American cities and the Atlantic Cable to connect New York and London created the first instances when it was possible to exploit financial market-related informational advantage for trading in the U.S. regional and U.K. national markets (Kavesh et al. 1978). Starting in the 1970s, the trading process became computerized, and manual trading processes were targeted for elimination. Then, in the 1980s, program trading emerged and trades were sent to market based on computer software and algorithms (Hasbrouck et al. 1993). By the end of 1990s, the emergence of electronic communication networks (ECNs) further changed trading on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quote (NASDAQ) and New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) (Stoll 2006). This made it possible to extend daytime trading into overnight crossing market operations. In 1998, with the passage of the Regulation on Alternative Trading Systems (Regulation ATS) (Securities and Exchange Commission 1998), ECNs became more popular. Some brokerages set up new ECNs, which in turn led to more use of algorithmic trading (Aldridge 2013). 
High-frequency trading (HFT), also called algorithmic trading, is an imprecise term that currently has no legal or regulatory definition. (See Appendix: Table 3 for a listing of all of the technical terms in this article, along with their definitions.) It is used to describe a subset of algorithmic trading activities largely associated with the sell side of the financial industry. Algorithmic trading is the use of computer algorithms to automatically make trading decisions, submit securities trades, and manage securities orders after their submission (Investopedia 2015). A 2010 (Securities and Exchange Commission 2010, p. 45) report on market structure offers a detailed description of HFT practices, which involve: “(1) the use of extraordinarily high-speed and sophisticated computer programs for generating, routing, and executing orders; (2) use of co-location services and individual data feeds offered by exchanges and others to minimize network and other types of latencies; (3) very short time-frames for establishing and liquidating positions; (4) the submission of numerous orders that are canceled shortly after their submission; and (5) ending the trading day in as close to a flat position as possible (… not carrying significant, unhedged positions overnight).” It is typical that high-frequency traders end their trading day by squaring up their positions, so they are neither long nor short. They do this to reflect the fact that they trade on information moment to moment, rather than with longer-term strategies from day to day. Numerous authors have recognized the potential for controversy, problems, and legal issues (McGowan 2010). The securities trading landscape in the presence of HFT practices is characterized by more intense competition for order flows, faster connections between buy and sell-side firms and the exchanges, cooperation between high-frequency traders and exchanges, the emergence of a rich ecosystem of technology providers, and the promulgation of regulations that ensure HFT does not damage market quality. Like other settings where new and advanced technologies are used, HFT technologies enable their adopters to gain legitimate returns on investment (ROI) from their investments, as well as compensation for their market, counterparty and operational risk exposures. The adopters of HFT practices compete to connect their trading capabilities for the financial markets as fast as possible, so they can be faster than the competition.Footnote 1 For the market venues, they compete to attract orders and liquidity providers. Many exchanges now provide beneficial services to high-frequency traders, such as direct connections to exchange data and co-location services. Typical HFT traders include mutual and pension funds, and other sophisticated investors. Innovative HFT practices first appeared in U.S. financial markets, and then expanded to Europe and Asia. The Tabb Forum (2014) reported that HFT activities accounted for 49 % of the trading volume in the American equity markets in 2013. HFT accounted for about 40 % of all equity trades in the European market in 2009, according to a European Parliament report (Swinburne 2010). More recently, HFT practices have been diffusing into the markets in other countries, as the technology capabilities of western countries have extended their influence worldwide. For example, HFT practices have now penetrated all of the major financial markets in the Asia Pacific region although HFT accounted for only about 12 % of total trading by value on the regional stock exchanges in 2011, excluding Japan and Australia, according to research by Schroders reported in Price (2013)2.Footnote 2
 With this background in mind, we ask a number of questions. How have HFT practices been transforming the financial markets in the Asia Pacific region? To what extent have these practices penetrated market exchange of equities, and what issues have arisen around these changes? Have the changes been different for different countries and national markets? What research questions are worthwhile exploring in this context, and what policy issues will need to be addressed? This article offers an overview of HFT practices in different markets around the world, with specific interest in the financial markets in the Asia Pacific region. Though HFT has been gaining global popularity, it still faces a unique set of challenges that raise questions about regulations. The Flash Crash of May 6, 2010 sent a wake-up call to investors and regulators. Footnote 3 HFT practices have been criticized for skimming profits at the expense of ordinary investors, and manipulating the market (Biais & Woolley 2011). In contrast, some experts have argued that these trades play an important role in the market by providing both liquidity and price discovery while lowering transaction costs. As a result, there has been debate around the issue that regulations on high-frequency traders should be cautiously evaluated, so that the market is not frozen and trading is not driven away. Nevertheless, numerous investigations have been initiated to assess the impact of HFT practices on market quality (Brogaard et al. 2014, Hendershott et al. 2011, Jarrow & Protter 2012), and all of the major financial markets have established their own regulations related to HFT. As the debate over HFT has grown, observers have wondered how trading technology will evolve in next decade, whether high-frequency trading will become even more widely dominant, and how it will be regulated. This article is laid out in the following way. Section 2 provides an overview of HFT activities in the American and European financial markets, while Section 3 examines them in the regional financial markets of the Asia Pacific area. Section 4 considers competition, cooperation, and regulation in these markets. Section 5 proposes new research directions, and Section 6 concludes.",11

It can record transactions in a secure, transparent, decentralized, efficient, and low-cost way (Schatsky and Muraskin 2015). Blockchain technology originated with Bitcoin as a bottom-level technology (Nakamoto 2008). It was originally used to record historical transactions of encrypted digital money such as Bitcoin. As the research on digital money went deeper, the underlying blockchain technology was separated from Bitcoin and further developed as a technology related to existing technologies such as cryptography, network topology, and consensus algorithms. (Zhang 2016). There are several types of blockchains – public blockchain, private blockchain and hybrid blockchain. Each type has its advantages and disadvantages, allowing them to meet needs of various applications (He et al. 2016, Buterin 2015). Blockchain technology is a disruptive technology with many advantages. First, the decentralized structure, which lacks a centralized database, enables the blockchain to operate with high efficiency and low cost. It is also resistant to outages of a centralized database. Second, the technology solves the double-payment problem. The public ledger is shared by users on the Internet. It ensures the security, transparency, and integrity of data, which cannot be tampered with or forged. It helps to protect the security and privacy of user data (Zyskind et al. 2015). Third, because blockchain is programmable, it can increase flexibility and reliability in various applications (Pilkington 2016). Currently the main drawback of using block chain technology is the high usage of power and computing resources by the distributed system (Swan 2015). With these features, blockchain technology may be applied in many areas. Swan presents three categories of potential applications (Swan 2015). The first is currency, including currency transfer, remittance, and E-payment systems. The second is smart contracts in financial markets. The third is other social applications beyond currency and financial markets, such as notary, voting, and healthcare applications (Swan 2015). Pilkington also discusses the application of blockchain in digital identification, voting systems, and financial applications (Pilkington 2016). Huckle discusses potential applications of blockchain technology in the shared economy (Huckle et al. 2016). The central banks of many countries, including Britain and China, have issued reports or statements to promote the research on blockchain and its applications in financial industry (Walport 2016, Bloomberg View 2016). Nasdaq launched Linq in 2015 (Nasdaq 2015). Deloitte are using blockchain technology to improve its auditing service (Deloitte 2016). Crowdfunding originated from the concept of crowdsourcing, where a firm gets ideas, feedbacks, and solutions from Internet users to solve the firm’s business problems (Belleflamme et al. 2014). Crowdfunding is the practice of raising fund from a large number of Internet users (Heminway and Hoffman 2010). Schwienbacher defines crowdfunding as “an open call, essentially through the Internet, for the provision of financial resources either in the form of donation or in exchange for some form of reward and/or voting rights to support initiatives for specific purposes” (Schwienbacher and Larralde 2010). Mollick gives a specific definition that refers to the efforts by entrepreneurial individuals and groups to fund their ventures by drawing on relatively small contributions from a large number of individuals using the internet without standard financial intermediaries (Mollick 2014). The participants of crowdfunding include crowdfunding platforms, fundraisers, and investors. The crowdfunding platform is an intermediary for crowdfunding. Fundraisers launch a project on the platform and set a target amount. Funders and investors of crowdfunding projects receive rewards after funding the projects. Thus crowdfunding enables value discovery and matching (Fan 2013). It is difficult for small business or startups to obtain loans from banks, or investments from venture capitals. Crowdfunding helps small firms to raise funds from the Internet. It provides a new channel of financing with low cost, fast speed, and low entry barrier to firms, especially start-ups (Bradford 2012). Equity crowdfunding is a specific type of crowdfunding in which a fundraiser (normally a startup) launches a crowdfunding project with shares of the business as rewards. Investors and project supporters invest in the project in exchange for equity (Cui 2014). According to Ahlers, “entrepreneurs make an open call to sell a specified amount of equity or bond-like shares in a company on the internet, hoping to attract a large group of investors” (Ahlers et al. 2015). Compared with traditional fundraising methods, equity crowdfunding is more efficient with lower costs and barriers to entry, which is useful to start-ups (Zhang 2016). In 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (U.S. Congress 2012) legalized equity crowdfunding. Equity crowdfunding platforms such as Wefunder and AngelList experienced steady development. They supported the fund raising of many start-ups—for instance, ZENEFITS. To date, 132 start-ups have received USD$25 million from 76,000 investors via Wefunder (Wefunder 2016). Due to differences in regulatory laws, economic conditions, and cultural norms, different countries face different equity crowdfunding problems in practice. This study focuses on the relevant issues of equity crowdfunding in China. The Chinese government has proposed “encouraging people to do business creatively and drive innovation”, offered supports to crowdfunding and crowdsourcing, guided and encouraged crowdfunding platforms to develop their business in compliance with regulations, take pilot experiments on public and small amount crowdfunding, and enhance their risk control and standardized management (The State Council 2015). In recent years, crowdfunding platforms have been active in China. Among them, there are several popular and influential platforms in the area of equity crowdfunding, such as Da Jia Tou (dajiatou.com) and Angel Crunch (angelcrunch.com). To date, more than 70 equity crowdfunding websites in China have been collected by the crowdfunding navigation website zczj.com. China’s existing laws only allow the public offering of shares by listed companies. Other forms of public offering of shares or fund-raising are considered illegal. Hence, current equity crowdfunding operations impose certain restrictions on the qualification of investors, number of investors, and amount of investments. Crowdfunding is essentially carried out in the form of private offerings or semi-public offerings (Yang 2014). In terms of regulation, to curb illegal fund-raising, regulate the market, and protect the interests of investors, the Securities Association of China (SAC) issued the “Measures for Private Equity Crowdfunding (tentative) (draft)” (Securities Association of China SAC 2014), to better manage the equity crowdfunding market. In the practice, a lack of protection on the rights and interests of investors is a bottleneck of equity crowdfunding in China. The problems including a lack of legal and regulatory framework for crowdfunding process, unclear rights and obligations of crowdfunding websites, a lack of investor qualification management, information asymmetry and an undeveloped credit rating system for general public and so on (Wang 2016, Liu 2014). There were several cases where some companies illegally transferred equities to small investors through Taobao and Weibo. But it turned out that what they did damaged the interests of investors (Hu 2014). Based on the observations on the equity crowdfunding practice, many Chinese researchers proposed that the Chinese government should strengthen the regulation on crowdfunding websites, introduce investor qualification management, enforce information disclosure, protect the interests of investors, and lift regulatory restrictions on crowdfunding. All these will facilitate the development of crowdfunding market (Lou 2015, Dong et al. 2014, Wang 2016). Certainly, regulatory and technical support are needed to solve the problems mentioned above. We will discuss these issues hereafter.",105

Xu,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Blockchain, an innovation by FinTech, has attracted considerable attention since its origin as a technology to enable bitcoin-based online transactions (Pilkington 2016; Sundararajan 2016). Although bitcoin is a controversial form of digital currency facing skepticism and distrust (Hur et al. 2015) and its legal, social, and economic impacts have been inadequately studied (Mainelli and Smith 2015), blockchain technology is acknowledged for its advantages in recording transactions and events. Many believe that blockchain, similar to the Internet, will revolutionize how people and organizations will manage transactions and assets (Swan 2015). Blockchain technology enforces a distributed consensus and cryptographic transactions, rendering it difficult to compromise the integrity of its records without being noticed by an entire network. Many advocates believe that it can completely prevent such malicious activities as double-spending and hacking (Baxter 2016; Camp 2016). However, others still remain skeptical. This paper answers the question of what can blockchain technology do and not do to fight malicious online activity. Section 2 defines the characteristics and innovative applications of blockchain technology. Section 3 reviews state-of-the-art technologies for detecting online fraud and intrusion. Sections 4 and 5 explore the types of frauds and attacks that blockchain technology might prevent and behaviors to which it remains vulnerable. Section 6 recommends anti-attack measures and the last section calls for new research on how blockchains can fight online malicious attacks.",117

Bank based financial systems channel their funds from depositors to borrowers through financial intermediaries (Levine 2002). In global economy, the importance of financial sector cannot be understated because finance spurs growth, increases livelihood and strengthens the infrastructure. Indeed, empirical research has confirmed that financial deepening is one of the driving forces behind economic growth.Footnote 1
 However, debate on the benefits of financial liberalization and lending booms is always a critical issue among the researchers because of their complex and non-linear relationship. Allen and Gale (2003) argue that financial liberalization triggers the lending growth and increases economy-wide output at the equilibrium owing to the cost of crisis. Similarly, Foos et al. (2010) revealed that growth in abnormal loans in previous years is directly associated with loan losses at both the aggregate and individual bank level, while Gourinchas et al. (2001) found a weak relationship between lending booms and crisis outside Latin America. Therefore, lending growth enhances the financial deepening and competition, which raises the efficiency and reduces the cost of borrowing.Footnote 2
 Like other businesses, financial institutions and banks expand their loan magnitude to generate more earning or profits. In other words, the availability of debt capital for companies and entrepreneurs develops new businesses. Lending money to local companies can also increase the profit of local economies as well as local employment. However, if the trend of loan expansion is aggressive, the chance of loan losses is higher, too. Altunbas et al. (2010) found that households, firms and banks usually underestimate risk to earn higher profits, increasing the probability of future problems. Furthermore, an unstable economy or underpricing by banks can also cause of higher loan losses. Several studies have highlighted the risk associated with excessive bank lending that lead to higher loan losses, which affects financial systems and entire economies. As a facilitator for both borrower and the lender, vibrant banking system in Pakistan makes it possible for manufacturers and industries to enhance their field of operations and potential markets for their products. After undergoing recent reforms and privatization, the dramatic subsequent changes in the Pakistani banking system have attracted significant attention from both researchers and financial managers. The number of borrowers increased markedly because of increased financial activity and sound and stable economic conditions in mid-2000s. Owing to the economic stability to all sectors of economy, banks began to provide individuals and businessmen with convenient and easy access to services, which increased the efficiency and outputs (see, eg, Rajaraman and Vasishtha 2002). Against this background, this study examines whether higher loan growth always lead to higher loan losses in the context of stable economy. We also observe the behavior of banks when they expand their financial statements. Numerous studies describe the consequences of abnormal loan growth; therefore, if growing financial sector in developing countries such as Pakistan uses the experiences of bank-based economy, it will help in future. Furthermore, this is very important during this transition period, when the Pakistan is looking to enhance the banking services and facilities to its entire population. In particular, we examine the relationship between loan growth and risk taking behavior of the banks and discuss the impact of loan growth on financial health. To evaluate different views on the relationship between credit growth and banks’ risk-taking behavior, this study uses micro level panel data on 32 banks over 2006–2014. To understand the effect of loan growth on financial system, we use two-step system GMM (generalize method of moments) estimation technique. This study thus contributes to the banking and finance literature in two main ways. First, it investigates the relation between loan growth and riskiness of banks using balance sheet data of individual bank. Second, along with bank-specific variables, this study also considers macroeconomic-specific variables. However, this study goes one step further by examining the effect of rule of law during the expansion of lending growth. Our findings, therefore, provide important insights to regulators into the riskiness and stability of the Pakistani banking system during a period of excessive lending growth. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Related literature section provides a literature review. We discuss the data and definite the variables in Data sources and defeinition of variables section. Then, Empirical framework section presents the hypotheses and the empirical framework. Empirical results section reports the empirical results and Conclusion section concludes.",15

With the fast-growing information technology, the cyber world has transformed itself into a dominant platform, where people can exchange information, conduct business, and connect with others from all over the world. For example, Amazon had more than 285 million active users by 2015 (Lindner 2015). With the availability of unprecedented amounts of information, the Internet provides convenience to its users. Additionally, it produces challenges for users in processing information. Consequently, intelligent systems are widely applied to assist users in decision-making. With built-in artificial intelligence in different knowledge domains, intelligent systems are capable of gathering information, processing problems, drawing inferences, and generating solutions (Krishnakumar 2003). Given input information and different built-in algorithms, intelligent systems can be applied to support decision making in various domains, such as finance, e-commerce, and healthcare. Regardless of the problem domain, the decision made by the intelligent system depends on users’ inputs. Therefore, decision accuracy is vulnerable to fraudulent users’ input, which is termed as information fraud. Unlike the real world, information in the cyber world is often input through a Web interface. With the advances in Web technology, users can inject fraudulent information easily, in various locations and without face-to-face interaction, making it both difficult and costly to detect fraud. As such, information fraud can hurt the effectiveness of intelligent systems, impair interaction trust in the cyber world, and result in financial losses. Scholars have long examined information fraud. Since the built-in algorithms in intelligent systems are different, users also behave differently to inject fraudulent information. Consequently, various types of information fraud have been identified and summarized. Different supervised or unsupervised learning algorithms of fraud detection have been designed for each fraudulent scenario (Irissappane et al. 2012; Jøsang and Ismail 2002; Lee and Zhu 2012). Prior research has significantly improved the accuracy of information fraud detection; however, few models can maintain perfect detection performance in all fraudulent scenarios. Additionally, even if the fraudulent input is successfully identified, we may still not be able to access the truth and make the right decision. Furthermore, there are various reasons behind information fraud, such as concerns for personal privacy or seeking inappropriate profits (Lam and Ried 2004; Metzger 2004). The current detection algorithms cannot completely eliminate such behaviors. In the era of decentralized computing, a breakthrough in blockchain technology, which underlines Bitcoin (Nakamoto 2008), can be used to preserve users’ privacy and prevent information fraud. Blockchain is a public ledger that verifies every transaction, stores it based on group consensus, and records it indisputably (Soska and Christin 2015; Vandervort 2014). As it can provide transaction records permanently, incorruptibly, and irreversibly, it may help fundamentally prevent some types of information fraud (Khan 2015, Pwc 2015). In this paper, we analyze the effectiveness of blockchain technology in fraud detection. While there are various types of information fraud, in this study, we focus on one popular type: rating fraud. We consider a piece of information fraudulent as long as it is not consistent with real information. In the subsequent section, we provide a brief introduction of rating fraud, followed by an overview of the literature on blockchain technology in An overview of blockchain technology section. In Effectiveness of Blockchain on Rating Fraud section, we discuss the effectiveness of blockchain technology on rating fraud. We conclude the paper in Conclusions and Discussion section with discussions.",125

IPOs are also the mechanism by which governments privatize public sector entities (i.e., transfer their ownership and control to the private sector, where they are managed as commercial activities). Shares sold via IPOs enter trading on public equity markets (Barnes and Walker 2006). On the day that they are issued, shares offered via IPOs generally close at prices exceeding the price at which they were offered to investors. Thus, some studies argue that IPO shares generally are underpriced (Aggarwal, 1993; Loughran and Ritter 2000). However, empirical evidence from developed markets indicates that long-run performance of IPO shares tied to the performance of broader markets (Levis 1993; Aggarwal et al. 1993). Numerous studies examine initial and aftermarket performance of IPO shares in developed countries, but few address emerging markets. Even fewer explicitly compare price behaviors of IPOs involving privately owned firms and those that involve privatizing public sector entities. Vickers and Yarrow (1988), Jenkinson and Mayer (1988), Jacquillat (1987), and Perotti and Guney (1993) suggest that underpricing is greater among IPOs for privatized public entities than it is among IPOs for privately owned firms. Empirical evidence also suggests that share prices for private enterprises underperform during their initial three-to-five years of aftermarket trading, whereas privatized public.entities generally outperform in long-run trading.Footnote 1 However, those results pertain to developed markets and may differ in emerging capital markets. The only Pakistani study is by Rizwan and Khan (2007), who compared the short- and long-run performance of IPOs of publicly owned enterprises and privately owned firms by sampling 35 offerings from 2000–2006. The paucity of scholarship motivates this study. This study measures, analyzes, and compares the short- and long-run performance of IPOs. We define “short-run performance” as the price behavior on the first day that an IPO trades and “long-run performance” as the price behavior spanning five years following an IPO. It examines IPOs for both privately owned firms (private IPOs) and public entities (privatizing IPOs) listed on Pakistan’s Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE). It examines the factors that affect initial underpricing on the first day of trading and aftermarket performance for both groups of IPOs. We further investigate the relationship between ownership structure and initial underpricing of private and privatized IPOs. When “going public,” firms may seek to concentrate ownership to sequester gains among their owners and reduce agency cost, or they might wish to disperse ownership to enhance aftermarket liquidity. The ownership structure is pivotal to corporate finance in emerging markets (LaPorta et al., 1999). We extend the literature by investigating two anomalies: the short-run outperformance and long-run underperformance of private and privatizing IPOs in Pakistan. We also compare the ownership structure and underpricing of both categories of IPOs. No previous research addresses either subject in Pakistan. Our results indicate that private and privatizing IPOs outperform on their first trading day. In the long run, private IPOs underperform and privatizing IPOs outperform although the mean difference between them is insignificant in the short and long runs. The size of the firm, aftermarket risk, and subscription ratio significantly influence underpricing. First-day returns, market volatility, and retained ownership determine the IPOs’ performance over five years. Ownership concentration in both categories is similar. The extent of underpricing, firm size, aftermarket risk, return on assets, and subscription ratio affect the concentration of ownership. This study proceeds as follows. Section 2 reviews IPOs in Pakistan. Section 3 presents an empirical review, theoretical background, and hypothesis development. Section 4 discusses the method, variables, and data sources. Section 5 presents the empirical results. Section 6 concludes the paper and discusses policy implications.",6

According to Nie et al. (2011), a bank can increase its profits by up to 85 % by improving the retention rate by up to 5 %. In addition, customer retention is seen as more important than in the past.

It is generally accepted that the interest rate has a major impact on a country’s saving and investment. The interest rate is defined as the cost of borrowing or gain on lending. Typically, a rise in the interest rate encourages people to save more as the former leads to increased income. However, an increase in the interest rate also raises the cost of capital, resulting in a reduction in investment within the economy. According to Islamic teachings, riba is prohibited. Riba is a practice through which one earns excess returns, where no equivalent counter-value or reward is justified. Riba is an Arabic word, meaning increase or growth; the interest on saving would result in an increase in the final amount payable over and above the original value. The Qur’an, the Holy Book of the Muslims, notes that, “Whereas Allah permitted trading and forbideth usury,” and as Allah has ordered that these practices be shunned, “O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah, and give up what remaineth (due to you) from usury, if you are (in truth) believers.” Hence, in Islam, while earning interest on saving is disapproved of by Allah, the practice of saving is not prohibited. Moreover, Muslims should “…not spend everything so that you became blameworthy and destitute” (Al-Qur’an 17:29). Many empirical studies report that people seek monetary rewards regardless of the type of bank they patronize (Islamic or otherwise) for example study of Metwally (1997) conclude that similar returns were offered to the depositors by Islamic and conventional banks; however, this statement is not always true. Consider the example of the Kuwait Finance House, the first bank to operate in accordance with the Islamic Shariah (Islamic Law) established in 1977. According to Haron and Noraffifiah (2000) the bank has not provided depositors interest on their saving in 1984. However, it has enjoyed widespread patronage, and there have been no reports of mass deposit withdrawals. In another example, the Islamic banks of Sudan have never paid their current account holders any kind of income, but a large proportion of their funding is derived from such accounts. According to the principles of Shariah, wealth should be accumulated by one’s own, not others’, efforts. The Prophet (PBUH) advised Muslims to work hard to earn their keep and discouraged income generated without any effort, such as through earning interest or riba. As people in Islamic countries dislike riba or income from saving because of the religious teachings of Islam, it is a general perception that savings in Islamic countries are not affected by changes in the interest rate. Despite this, some banks of Islamic countries implement the practice of the interest rate; in other words, the policy makers of these countries ignore Muslims’ shunning of riba, and they continue to imitate the practices of developed non-Muslim countries by implementing economic policies that use the interest rate as a determinant of saving. As many Muslim countries are currently facing a financial crisis, the country’s economic policies should be devised in accordance to its population’s characteristics to mitigate the impact of such events. Thus, the aim of this study is to highlight the differences between the effects of the interest rate on saving and investment in Islamic and non-Islamic economies. Because riba or earning income from interest is forbidden according to Islamic teachings, we expect that the interest rate will have different impacts on Islamic and non-Islamic countries. If our expectation is found to be true, we propose that the policymakers of Islamic countries use different criteria while making saving-related policies. This study is conducted using country-level panel data after categorizing the countries as Islamic or non-Islamic. Although many previous studies have covered different aspects of the interest rate with regard to saving and investment, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to determine not only the effects of Muslim religious teachings on saving and investment in Muslim countries but also to conduct a comparison between Muslim and non-Muslim countries in this respect. We use the real interest rate to assess its impact on saving and investment in Islamic and non-Islamic countries. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section provides a review of the literature. Then, we present the methods and its results. The last section concludes.",7

Government of Pakistan and Central bank make different rules and regulations for banks with the aim to increase economic growth in long run. These rules and instructions also include increase in deposits with banks and provide loans on easy terms and condition. Central bank instructs and orders banks to introduce different types of accounts to attract savers to open and keep their savings in bank accounts with the perception that in long run it will contribute to enhance economic growth. Banks uses these deposits to further lend money so it is compulsory for Government to know the fact that which activity of banking sector has cointegration with economic growth so Government can make effective policies in future for the prosperity of country. Banking sector is considered as one of the major industry of Pakistan’s economy and in government policies government always tries to make policies in order to accelerate banking sector’s activities. But Pakistan is a country in which most of the banks are private and only few banks are owned by government. So if private banks will earn profit then this will not be beneficial for government. In this case only bank’s activities are the part of private banks that can be part of interest for government because it is considered to have effect on economic growth so because of this reason I select Pakistan as a country for my study. Lack of data availability was a big limitation for this study so I tried to include the time period in which data was available for all three variables. Bank’s activities (that are deposits and lending) are the key things that will not only affect economy but also will affect the population and government of the country so the purpose of this study is to investigate the direction between these two activities and economic growth and to know the fact that either this relationship is unidirectional or bidirectional. There has been done a lot of work in economic literature about banking sector but there are very few studies that considered specifically deposits or credits side of banking sector and there causal directional relationship with economic growth but In Pakistan no one considered causal relationship specifically between pooling and lending activities of bank and economic growth but combine studies have been done by using bank deposit and bank’s credit as a determinant of GDP or by keeping credits or deposits of banks as proxy of financial development with other additional variables. So this study will provide a guideline to policy makers that whether it is realistic to consider bank deposit and bank’s provided loans to increase the economic growth in Pakistan and also this study will tell to bank managements that either GDP growth has any short run or long run impact on banking sector’s these activities. Secondly according to general consideration bank deposits and lending activities have positive impact on economic growth but this study concludes opposite results so the purpose is to investigate the real scenario that is also the base for narrow selection of bank’s these two activities. The paper is organized as Introduction this section, section 2 presents review of literature, sections 3 presents data, methodology and results and section 4 concludes the paper.",5

The factors behind the shift in the trend are the rapid growth of the credit derivative market, rise in the bankruptcy and developing credit risk literature. The failure of rating agencies (Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s) to predict the fall of giant manufacturing companies like Chrysler, GM, LyondellBasell Industries, Excide Technologies alarmed the need to revisit risk management framework worldwide. The current study proposes a new bankruptcy prediction model for Indian manufacturing companies. Since Beaver (1966), a substantial literature on bankruptcy prediction is developed to assess the financial health of companies. These models were based upon different theoretical approaches and types of information to model bankruptcy. Three notable and most cited accounting based bankruptcy models in the literature of accounting research are Altman (1968), Ohlson (1980) and Zmijewski (1984) (Grice and Dugan, 2001). The suitability and performance of these models in the new era is an empirical question due to change in time periods and financial conditions in which it was originally developed. The study re-estimates and compares these models with the newly proposed model. In the bankruptcy prediction literature academician and accounting, practitioners have differed in the opinion on the power of these models to address the sensitivity of time periods and financial condition (cross-country heterogeneity, market structure, business cycle, etc.). Begley et al. (1996) re-estimates and compares performance of original Altman’s and Ohlson’s models using US 1980’s data. The major finding of the study suggests Altman’s and Ohlson’s model outperforms re-estimated model. Both the re-estimated model have higher classification errors. Out of four contesting models, Ohlson’s original model outperforms other three contesting models. In line with Begley, Boritz et al. (2007) studying bankruptcy in Canada founds predictive accuracy of Altman’s and Ohlson’s original models are higher than re-estimated model. They also compared the accuracy of models developed for Canadian firms, namely, Springate (1978), Altman and Levallee (1980), and Legault and Veronneau (1986). The study concludes the Canadian models are being simpler and requiring less data. All models have stronger performance with the original coefficients than the re-estimated coefficients. On the contrary, there are ample of studies questioning construct validity of the models to original models towards the change in time periods and financial conditions. Grice and Ingram (2001) analysed the sensitivity of Altman’s Z-score model for US companies. The study suggests the coefficients of the models are sensitive to the change in the financial environment and time period. The re-estimated model with the most recent information give better predictive accuracy. Grice and Dugan (2001) conducted study on US companies founds predictive accuracy of re-estimated Altman’s and Ohlson’s model is higher than the original models. Timmermans (2014) analysed the sensitivity of Altman’s, Ohlson’s and Zmijewski’s models on US companies. The major finding of the study suggests the re-estimated model have a higher predictive accuracy than the original models. Avenhuis (2013) conducted study on Dutch companies. The study re-estimates and compares performance of Altman’s, Ohlson’s and Zmijewski’s original models. The major finding of the study suggests re-estimation of model with specific and bigger sample give better predictive accuracy. According to Platt and Platt (1990) the economic environment of two periods may change because of three reasons: First, change in the relationship between bankruptcy (dependent variable) and financial ratios. Second, change in the range of financial ratios (independent variables). And third, change in the relationship among financial ratios. They also suggested these changes attribute to bring change in the corporate strategy, the competitive nature of market, business cycle and technology. In the Indian market Bandyopadhyay (2006), Bhumia and Sarkar, (2011) and Shetty et al. (2012) developed Industry specific models for Indian corporate bond, pharmaceutical, and Information Technology/Information Technology Enabled Services (IT/ITES) industry respectively. Chudson (1945) mentions industry specific models are more appropriate than general models. The similar evidence is also found in the study of Avenhuis (2013). In the light of above discussion the major aim of the paper is threefold: First, to develop a new bankruptcy prediction model for Indian manufacturing companies on Indian sample. Second, to revisits and re-estimate Altman (1968), Ohlson (1980) and Zmijewski (1984) models to examine the sensitivity of these models towards change in financial conditions and time periods. Finally, to choose the best model for prediction of financial distress of Indian manufacturing companies. The current study differs from prior study in three perspectives: Firstly, the study uses larger data set sampled over a longer period (Sample size 208) than in previous studies on Indian market which increases statistical power of the model. Second, the new bankruptcy prediction model is proposed with a unique combination of financial ratios measuring leverage, profitability and turnover of Indian manufacturing companies. Third, in the Indian market, there is no attempt is made to compare the sensitivity of Altman’s, Ohlson’s and Zmijewski’s models together towards change in time period and financial conditions. The major findings of the study reveal that the overall predictive accuracy of all the three models improves on estimation and holdout sample when the coefficients are re-estimated. Amongst the contesting models, the new proposed model outperforms while predicting bankruptcy for Indian manufacturing companies. The study further suggests the coefficients of the models are sensitive to time periods and financial conditions. The relation between financial ratios and bankruptcy and the comparative importance of the financial ratios are also not constant over the time periods. The findings are in line with past studies of Grice and Ingram (2001), Grice and Dugan (2001), Timmermans (2014) and Avenhuis (2013). Hence, researchers should be cautioned while choosing the models for bankruptcy prediction to recalculate the models by looking at the recent data in order to get higher predictive accuracy. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Survey of literature is covered in section 2. Section 3 discusses considered models for the study. Section 4 deals with sample and development of new bankruptcy prediction models for Indian manufacturing companies. Re-estimations of models, results and discussion and evaluation of the model is done in section 5. The study concludes with section 6 which discusses the implications of those findings for users of the models. The formal studies on credit risk started in the 1930’s (Altman, 1968). The early studies were univariate in nature, and single financial ratios were used to assess the financial position of the borrower. These studies set the platform for the further development of credit risk models. Some of the important univariate studies are Fitzpatrick (1932), Smith and Winaker (1935), Merwin (1942), Chudson (1945), Jackendoff (1962) and Beaver (1966). After seven decades of credit risk measurement, there is extensive development in the credit risk literature. The credit risk models can be classified into the following categories (Fejer-Kiraly, 2015): Parametric Models (Accounting and market-based models) and Non-parametric Models (Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Hazard models, Fuzzy Models, Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Hybrid models, or models in which several of the former models are combined) The parametric models could be univariate and multivariate in nature which uses mainly financial ratios and focuses on the symptoms of bankruptcy (Andan & Dar, 2006). Sometimes these models uses non-financial information (Ohlson, 1980; Bandyopadhyay, 2006). Balcaen and Ooghe (2004) and Bellovary et al. (2007) are the most cited paper in literature of bankruptcy prediction. Both the papers focused on the problems of parametric models. These problems are related to assumptions on the dichotomous variable, the sampling method, stationarity assumptions, data instability, selection of independent variables, use of accounting information and the time dimension (Balcaen & Ooghe, 2004). Further, parametric models can be classified into two categories: accounting based and market-based models. Market-based models are again divided into two parts structural and reduced form models. Beaver (1966) with his univariate default prediction study on US firms revolutionize the practice of credit risk assessment. The study compares the mean values of 30 financial ratios of 79 failed and 79 non-failed firms in 38 industries. Further, the study tests the ability of individual financial ratios to classify between bankrupt and non-bankrupt firms. Four financial ratios were found to have highest classification power, namely, net income to total debt (92 %), net income to net worth (91 %), cash flow to total debt (90 %), and cash flow to total assets (90 %). For future research, the study suggested multiple ratios considered simultaneously may have higher predictive ability than single ratios which created a platform for multiple ratio models. Altman (1968) developed a first multivariate discriminant model for default prediction for US companies. The model uses five financial ratios to predict bankruptcy of the firms. The model can predict bankruptcy with 95 % of accuracy for the initial sample one year prior to bankruptcy. Altman et al. (1977) developed a model for US manufacturing and retailers, which had the effective classifying ability from 5 years prior to default. Since Altman (1968), discriminant analysis is used by many researchers by making changes in financial ratios, study sample, and change in business culture. Some of the notable studies are Deakin (1972), Blum (1974), Springate (1978) and Fulmer (1984). The limitations of discriminant analysis created space for the development of logit model. Ohlson (1980) introduced a logit model in the literature of bankruptcy prediction. The assumptions of logit model were different from Z-score models. Ohlson identified nine independent variables (financial and non-financial) based upon their frequent use in the bankruptcy prediction literature. The model was developed with the sample of 2163 companies (105 defaulted and 2058 non-defaulted) for the period 1970-1976. In line with Ohlson, Abdullah et al. (2008), applied the logistic model to foretell corporate failure of Malaysian firms. Further, Zmijewski (1984) applied probit technique using data of 40 bankrupt and 8000 non-bankrupt US firms for the period 1970-1978. After logit and probit models, the number of studies attempted making comparison between logit, probit, and MDA analysis. In case of Thailand, Pongsatat et al. (2004) examines predictive capabilities of Ohlson’s and Altman’s models. The study concludes Altman model outperforms Ohlson model on the basis of predictive accuracy. Likewise, Ugurlu and Aksoy (2006) developed bankruptcy prediction model for Turkish firms using Altman’s (1968) and Ohlson’s (1980) statistical techniques. Further, Gu (2002) develops MDA model for estimating the failure of USA restaurant firms. In the Indian market, Bandyopadhyay (2006) develops a bankruptcy prediction model for the Indian corporate bond sector using MDA and logistic technique. Bhumia and Sarkar, (2011) developed a corporate failure model for the Indian pharmaceutical company based upon MDA technique. Ramkrishnan (2005) used discriminant and logistic model to foretell bankruptcy for Indian companies. The market-based models are classified into structural (Merton 1974; Agarwal and Taffler 2008; Wu, Gaunt and Gray 2010; Hillegeist et al. (2004) and Bharath and Shumway 2008) and reduced (Jarrow and Turnbull 1995; Duffie and Singleton 1999 and Lando 1994) form models. Black and Scholes (1973) option pricing theory which was extended by Metron (1974) is applied to model default in structural based models. In these models firms can default on its debt obligation only at the time of maturity. Later, some models were developed by extension to allow a default to occur before the date of maturity. These models were familiarized by Black and Cox (1976), Lonfstaff and Schwartz (1995), Leland and Toft (1996). On the other hand, reduced form models focus over modeling default explicitly as an intensity or compensator process. Some of the notable market-based studies in the Indian market based upon Board of Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) reference are Varma and Raghunathan (2000), Kulkarni et al. (2005). The non-parametric models are heavily dependent on computer technology and mainly multivariate in nature (Andan & Dar, 2006). Some of the well-known non-parametric models are artificial neural networks (ANN), hazard models, fuzzy models, genetic algorithms (GA) and hybrid models, or models in which several of the former models are combined. The ANN models can learn and adapt, from a data set, and they have the ability to capture non-linear relationships between variables which are also advantages of these models. The main shortcomings of the model are that they fail to explain causal relationships among their variables which restricts their application to practical management problems (Lee & Choi, 2013). Kirkos (2015) in a survey paper on credit risk, which focuses mainly on artificial intelligence models published between 2009 and 2011. The information technology revolution in the 1990’s helped artificial intelligence and managerial systems to grow and develop. This led to the development of a new set of bankruptcy prediction models known as neural networks. The study of Messier and Hansen (1988) is linked to the use of neural networks in bankruptcy prediction. This is followed by number of studies (Bellovary et al. 2007) such as Raghupathi et al. (1991), Coats and Fant (1993), Guan (1993), Tsukuda and Baba (1994), and Altman, Marco, and Varetto (1994). Apart from neural network, there are other non-parametric models, namely, hybrid model. The hybrid models are use of two models either parametric or non-parametric (Lee et al. 1996). Genetic algorithm is also one of the prominent other non-parametric models which work as a stochastic search technique to find out a company goes bankrupt or not (Varetto, 1998). Other widely used non-parametric models are: genetic programming (Etemadi et al., 2009), models based on “rough test” theory (Dimitrias et al. 1999), Bayesian, Fuzzy, Hazard and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). After 2005, the artificial intelligence-based models became more famous and widely used. Premachandra et al. (2009) compares LR and DEA models and concluded DEA models have a better predictive accuracy to predict bankrupt firms (between 84 % and 89 %), but the LR is more accurate in predicting healthy firms (between 69.3 % and 99.47 %). Verikas et al. (2010) conducted a study which reviews hybrid models and ensemble-based soft computing techniques applied in default prediction. Fuzzy logic approach is used by Korol and Korodi (2011). The model is based upon the financial data of 132 companies (107 non-bankrupt and 25 bankrupt). Gupta et al. (2014) conducted study which uses discrete-time hazard model on the data base of 385,733 non-bankrupt and 8,162 bankrupt SMEs. The study develops three hazard models for micro-, small-, and medium-sized firms. The study further suggests the financial reports do not provide sufficient information about the default of the micro-firms. Shetty et al. (2012) develops early warning system for Indian IT/ITES using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Kumar and Rao (2015) develops non-linear new Z-score model based upon Person Type-3 distribution for Indian companies.",14

2.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,01 February 2016,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-016-0021-1,Dynamics of volatility spillover between stock market and foreign exchange market: evidence from Asian Countries,December 2016,Khalil Jebran,Amjad Iqbal,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Over the last three decades, there is rapid growth in international equity investments. The increasing trend in equity investment has lead to increase in high demand and supply of foreign currencies. The high demand of currencies and equity flows has created some interdependence between equity returns and exchange rate returns. The increasing interdependency has also increased the volatility transmission betweens stock and foreign exchange market that has increased the international portfolio risk that is faced by investors, which has further lead to decrease the returns of investors portfolios (Kanas 2000). According to (Ebrahim 2000), it is important to know about how shocks are transmitted across financial markets (stock and currency market) and also to explore the magnitude of their effects. This will further enhance the success of policies implemented by policy makers. The theoretical consensus regarding the linkages between stock prices and exchange rates can be derived from two widely used models named as; flow oriented model (Dornbusch & Fischer, 1980) and stock oriented model (Branson and Henderson 1985; Frankel 1983). The flow oriented model (Dornbusch and Fischer 1980) posits that positive relationship exist between exchange rates and stock prices. This model is based on the idea that exchange rate is determined by a country’s current account balance or trade balance. This model assumes that changes in the foreign exchange rate can effect trade balances and international competitiveness. Therefore, affect the real income and inputs. The phenomena can be explained as; the local currency depreciationFootnote 1 will make domestic firms more competitive by having cheaper exports in international trade. The higher exports will enhance the domestic wealth of firms by appreciating the domestic stock prices of domestic firms. In this aspect, causality will run from exchange rate to stock price. The stock oriented model (Branson and Henderson 1985; Frankel 1983) suggests that the exchange rate is determined by supply and demand of financial assets (equity and bonds). This model is further classified into portfolio balance model and monetary model. The portfolio balance model posits that negative relationship exist between stock prices and exchange rates. This model suggests that causality runs from stock prices to exchange rates. According to this model, investors hold foreign and domestic assets including domestic and foreign currencies. When domestic assets stock prices increases, so investors intends to buy more domestic assets, which compel them to sell their foreign assets in order to have more domestic currency in hand for the purpose of buying more domestic assets. The increase in wealth of investors due to increase in domestic assets prices motivates them to demand for more domestic assets which in turns leads to increase in interest rates. This will lead to currency appreciation.Footnote 2 The monetary approach however postulates weaker or no relationship of exchange rates and stock prices. In this model, exchange rate is considered to be the price of an asset. As prices of assets are based on future expected prices, similarly exchange rates are also determined by future expected exchange rates. So any factor that changes the expected future value of exchange rate will affect today’s value of exchange rate. The factors that cause changes in exchange rates may differ from those factors that brought changes in stock prices. Hence, in such conditions there may be no relationship between stock prices and exchange rates.Footnote 3
 The information spillover between the two financial markets (foreign exchange market and stock market) has been studied by many researchers for different countries. Most of the studies have focused on the transmission of volatility between foreign exchange market and stock market. The developed countries have been extensively studied by most of researchers (see for example; Antonakakis 2012; Apergis and Rezitis 2001; Beer and Hebein 2011; Ebrahim 2000; Francis et al. 2006; Grobys 2015; Kanas 2000; Yang and Doong 2004). There are also number of studies of integration of foreign exchange market and stock market of developing countries (for example; Choi et al. 2010; Kang and Yoon 2013; Mishra et al. 2007; Morales 2008; O’Donnell and Morales 2009; Qayyum and Kamal 2006; Yang and Chang 2008). There are also some studies for emerging countries for instance (see, for examples; Adjasi et al. 2008; Fedorova and Saleem 2009; Li and Majerowska 2008; Oberholzer and Boetticher 2015; Okpara and Odionye 2012; Walid et al. 2011). This study intends to investigate the asymmetric volatility spillover dynamics of stock and foreign exchange market using EGARCH model in Asian countries. One of the rationale behind selection of Asian countries sample is that the literature doesn’t provide enough evidence in the specific area. This study aimed to consider a sample of developed and emerging markets of Asia. The Asian countries included in this study are; China, India, Hong Kong, Japan, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The sample constitutes developed country of Japan and markets of China, India, Hong Kong Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The sample also represents three countries from South Asia i.e. Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan; and three countries from East Asia i.e. Japan, Hong Kong and China. The contribution of the study will be in the following aspects. First, instead of analyzing a single country, this study investigates volatility spillover between stock market and foreign exchange market in sample of different Asian countries. Second, this study will add some valuable knowledge to existing literature in terms of selected Asian countries sample. In reference to Pakistan; we only found a single study of Qayyum and Kamal (2006) that employed weekly data covering the period from 1998 to 2006. The contribution of this study in reference to Pakistan is as follow. First, we have used daily data instead of weekly because stock and foreign exchange market trading occurs on daily basis and the shock that arises on daily basis is absorbed in weekly data. Second, we have used data set covering the period from 1999 to 2014. In reference to Sri Lanka, up to best of our knowledge, this study is the first to address volatility spillover between stock market and foreign exchange market. In this aspect, this study will be a novel contribution in reference to Sri Lanka. In context of China, Hong Kong, India and Japan, we have found many studies but with mixture of results like (Chkili 2012) and (Beer and Hebein 2011) reported contrasting results in case of Hong Kong. Similarly, (Mishra et al. 2007) and (Beer and Hebein, 2011) found different results for India. (Kanas 2000; Yang and Doong 2004) and (Beer and Hebein 2011; Francis et al. 2006) found contrasting results for Japan. Therefore there is still a gap to explore knowledge about the volatility spillover dynamics in the selected countries. The other contribution of this study is considering daily data covering period of 15 years in order to examine volatility spillover in long run. The reason behind selection of daily data is to capture more information that we can do in weekly and monthly data. Furthermore, the results of this study will be important for economic policy makers, investors and multinational firms. The policy makers will benefit from this study by knowing the behavior of two markets in order to implement policies for financial stability perspective. Investors will use the information to manage their international portfolio risk and currency risk strategies. This study is also important for multinational firms which intend to manage their international currency exposures. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The second section presents the literature. The third section presents the methods. The fourth section shows the results and discussion. The fifth section presents the conclusions and policy implication. There are numerous studies that investigated the volatility transmission mechanism between stock and foreign exchange market. The literature can be divided into three aspects; First, those studies that reveals bidirectional volatility spillover between the two markets; Second, those studies which found unidirectional flow of volatility either from stock to foreign exchange market or from foreign exchange market to stock market; Third, those studies which reported no volatility spillover between the two markets. The bidirectional flow of volatility between the two financial markets has been reported by following studies, see (Aloui 2007; Andreou et al. 2013; Chkili 2012; Choi et al. 2010; Francis et al. 2006; Mishra et al. 2007; Qayyum and Kamal 2006; Xiong and Han 2015). Francis et al. (2006) examined US with Germany, Japan, UK and Canada. They observed bidirectional volatility spillover between currency and equity market for German and US countries. The transmission of volatility between the two markets has been found asymmetric in nature. In other study, Aloui (2007) examined US equity and currency market along with 5 major European countries. The analyses were carried out on EGARCH model that confirms bidirectional volatility spillover between equity and currency market. They concluded that persistence of the stock prices volatility was more than exchange rate. Qayyum and Kamal (2006) examined the volatility spillover effects of the two financial markets for Pakistan. They concluded statistically significant bidirectional transmission mechanism of stock returns and exchange rate returns. Mishra et al. (2007) empirically investigated the volatility dynamic effects between the two markets with reference to India. Their analyses show clear evidence of bidirectional flow of shocks between the currency and equity market. Recently, similar results have been reported by (Kumar 2013; Panda and Deo 2014) for India. Choi et al. (2010) empirically investigated the New Zealand currency and equity market for volatility transmission mechanism. They concluded bidirectional mechanism of volatility for the two financial markets. Chkili (2012) investigated 8 emerging markets i.e. Argentina, Brazil, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Mexico, Indonesia and South Korea by using BEKK-MGARCH model. Their analyses reveal bidirectional shock spillover between two financial markets in most cases. Andreou et al. (2013) analyzed 12 emerging markets including six from Asia and six from Latin America. The analyses reveal bidirectional volatility spillover between equity and currency market. Recently, Xiong and Han (2015) reported bidirectional volatility spillover between the two markets for China. The unidirectional transmission of volatility between equity and currency market has been reported by following studies (Adjasi et al. 2008; Antonakakis 2012; Beer and Hebein 2011; Chkili and Nguyen 2014; Ebrahim 2000; Fedorova and Saleem 2009; Kanas 2000; Kang and Yoon 2013; O’Donnell and Morales 2009; Okpara and Odionye 2012; Yang and Doong 2004; Yang and Chang 2008). Ebrahim (2000) empirically examined the flow of volatility of exchange rate on the developed equity markets. The empirical evidence show asymmetric unidirectional price spillover for all the selected models. Kanas (2000) made an attempt to explore the developed equity countries i.e. France, Germany, US, Japan, Canada and UK for transmission of volatility between the two markets. He found significant unidirectional volatility effects flowing from equity returns to exchange rate returns for all economies except Germany. In other study, Yang and Doong (2004) extended the literature for G7 countries for currency and equity market spillover effects. Their results show evidence of unidirectional transmission of shocks from equity to exchange rate market for United States, France, Italy and Japan. O’Donnell and Morales (2009) investigated Hungary, Slovakia, Czech republic and Poland. In case of Czech Republic and Slovakia, they reported unidirectional flow of volatility from currency rates to equity prices. Adjasi et al. (2008) empirically investigated Ghanaian stock and currency market and found significant spillover from currency returns to equity returns. Beer and Hebein (2011) made an attempt on studying the G8 countries with South Korea, Hong Kong, India and Philippines. The unidirectional shock flow has been observed from currency market to equity market for Japan, India, US, Korea and Canada only. Yang and Chang (2008) carried out a study on Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, Singapore and USA and reported unidirectional asymmetric shock spillover from equity to currency market. Fedorova and Saleem (2009) examined the shock spillover of currency with equity market in European countries. Their empirical evidences showed currency spillover to equity market for all countries except Czech Republic. Okpara and Odionye (2012) empirically found unidirectional transmission of shocks from exchange rate to equity market for Nigeria. Antonakakis (2012) examined cross border currency shock spillover before and after Euro and other currency including Japanese yen, Swiss France and British Pound. They found evidence of cross border shock spillover for all currencies. Kang and Yoon (2013) reported unidirectional flow from exchange rate market to equity market of volatility with reference to Korea. Chkili and Nguyen (2014) recently examined the BRICS countries i.e. Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. They used regime switching model and found volatility spillover from stock prices to exchange rate with no feedback from exchange rate. In contrast to empirical evidences discussed in above literature, there are also studies that reported no evidence of flow of volatility between stock market and foreign exchange market, see (Apergis and Rezitis 2001; Kearney and Daly 1998; Morales 2008). Apergis and Rezitis (2001) extended the literature for New York and London and found no evidence of volatility transmission between currency and stock market. Morales (2008) empirically studied Six Latin American countries; Venezuela, Argentina, Mexico, Brazil, Colombia and Spain with a European country and found no clear evidence of flow of volatility between the two financial markets. Kearney and Daly (1998) tested the stated relationship for Australia and found no evidence of volatility flow between currency market and stock market.",39

The profitability of contrarian investment strategies, revisited",December 2017,Aron A. Gottesman,Gady Jacoby,Huijing Li,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"An extensive body of academic literature investigates the performance of contrarian investment strategies. Contrarian investment strategies refer to trading strategies in which stocks are classified as underpriced (value) or overpriced (glamour) based on relative past returns or accounting data. By investing in value stocks or divesting glamour stocks, advocates argue, investors can outperform the market. Generally, significant empirical evidence indicates that contrarian strategies outperform the market both in U.S. markets (De Bondt and Thaler, 1985, 1987; La Porta, 1996; La Porta et al. 1997; Lakonishok et al. 1994; Lettau and Wachter, 2007; Chen et al. 2008) and non-U.S. markets (Chan et al. 1991; Lai et al. 2003; Chin et al. 2002). Debate persists, however, as to whether the success of these contrarian strategies is due to expectational errors on the part of market participants (De Bondt and Thaler, 1985; Lakonishok et al. 1994; La Porta et al. 1997; Piotroski and So, 2012), which in turn lead to underpricing and overpricing, or whether investing in value stocks is fundamentally riskier than investing in glamour stocks (see Fama and French, 1992; Chan, 1988; Chen and Zhang, 1998; Ball and Kothari, 1989; Petkova and Zhang, 2005; Cohen et al. 2009; Campbell et al. 2010). Petkovaa and Zhang (2005) find that the return differential between value and glamour portfolios can be partially attributed to time-varying risk. However, fundamental betas are lower in value portfolios than in growth portfolios (Lakonishok et al., 1994; Cohen et al., 2009). By contrast, Piotroski and So (2012) document that expectation errors play an important role in explaining the value premium in contrarian investment strategies, and provide evidence consistent with mispricing explanation. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the success of contrarian investment strategies can be attributed to differences in the relative illiquidity of stocks categorized as value versus those categorized as glamour. The motivation for considering illiquidity is the extensive evidence that returns are positively related to the degree to which stocks are illiquid. In a seminal paper, Amihud and Mendelson (1986) develop a model and empirical tests to demonstrate that asset returns are positively related to their proxy for illiquidity, that is, the relative bid-ask spread. Other evidence supports and explores these findings (e.g., see Amihud and Mendelson, 1989; Eleswarapu, 1997; Jacoby et al. 2000; Gottesman and Jacoby, 2006). In this paper, we follow Lakonishok et al. (1994) and examine the illiquidity characteristics of value and growth portfolios. We investigate whether differences in the relative illiquidity of value portfolios versus glamour portfolios contribute to the success of contrarian investment strategies. Our evidence suggests that value portfolios are associated with dramatically greater levels of illiquidity than glamour portfolios. We further demonstrate that strategies based on illiquidity (in the year prior to portfolio formation), result in return characteristic of resembling contrarian strategies. Our results suggest that higher returns associated with contrarian investment strategies serve as a compensation for illiquidity associated with value portfolios. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the methodology. Section III describes the results. Section IV concludes.",3

,
Footnote 2 Some studies mainly focus on the large negative abnormal return on Monday (e.g., Kelly, 1930; French, 1980), and some on both the Monday-negative and Friday-positive abnormal returns (e.g., Chen and Singal, 2003). Other studies suggest, however, that the day-of-the-week effect is not limited to Friday and Monday (e.g., French, 1980; Keim and Stambaugh, 1984; Birru, 2017). Keim and Stambugh (1984) and Birru (2017), for example, indicate a tendency for returns to improve during the week. Different studies propose a number of explanations for the day-of-the-week effect, including measurement errors (Gibbons and Hess, 1981), settlement procedures (Gibbons and Hess, 1981; Lakonishok and Levi, 1982), and the timing of new information (Defusco et al., 1993; Damodaran, 1989; Dyl and Maberly, 1988). A more recent explanation by Chen and Singal (2003) relates the Monday-negative and Friday-positive abnormal returns to the activity of short sellers around the weekend. Another possible explanation for the day-of-the-week effect is the behavioral hypothesis, which relates the day-of-the-week pattern of returns to the pattern of improving mood throughout the week. The behavioral hypothesis emerges from a line of research in psychology, which suggests that lower mood is associated with more prudent behavior and reduced risk taking (e.g., Cole et al., 1998; Bader, 2005; Kahnman, 2011). Lower mood and the resulting increased prudence at the beginning of the week can therefore potentially explain the increased tendency of individual investors to sell stocks on Monday, as documented by Abraham and Ikenberry (1994), Brockman and Michayluk (1998), Brooks and Kim (1997), and Lakonishok and Maberly (1990). The relation between mood and prudence can also explain the results of Pettengill (1993), who found that investors tend to take higher financial risks before the weekend and lower financial risks after the weekend. Jacobs and Levy (1988) and Rystrom and Benson (1989) are the first to propose the behavioral hypothesis as a possible explanation for the day-of-the-week effect; neither, however, carry out statistical tests of the hypothesis. Gondhalekar and Mehdian (2003) find some supporting evidence for the behavioral hypothesis by showing that the negative returns on Mondays are intensified during periods of investor pessimism. More recently, Hirshleifer et al. (2017) find supporting evidence for the behavioral explanation of the day-of-the-week effect by using mood-mimicking returns to study the cross-section of returns. Our interpretation of the behavioral hypothesis is that as the week progresses, the remaining time to the weekend break is shortened, creating anticipation for the break and better mood. If this hypothesis is true, then the day-of-the-week effect is a full-week effect, not limited to just Mondays and Fridays. To test this hypothesis, we build a template of mood scores and then test the ability of this template to explain the day-of-the-week effect. The template approach has parallels in the literature on pattern recognition in stock prices. Fu et al. (2007) suggest that a time series of stock prices can be investigated using rule- or template-based pattern-recognition methods. A number of studies have examined rule-based patterns common among technical analysts, including Lo et al. (2000), Brock et al. (1992), and Bessembinder and Chan (1998). To illustrate a rule-based pattern in the context of the day-of-the-week effect, consider the following rule: This rule says that returns improve throughout the week—that is, Friday’s return is larger than Thursday’s, Thursday’s larger than Wednesday’s, and so forth. A rule-based pattern-recognition analysis of the day-of-the-week effect could begin, for example, by counting the number of instances where the rule is matched and compare it to the expected number of instances based on randomness.Footnote 3
 Template-based pattern-recognition methods are another way to identify patterns in stock prices. There are many possible sources for finding templates suitable for stock price pattern recognition. These include, but are not limited to, templates common among technical analysts, templates generated from other stock prices or stock market indices, templates generated from the earlier observations of the time series, and templates such as momentum that are more consistent with traditional research in finance. A simple hypothetical example of a template in the context of the day-of-the-week effect is The analysis can then proceed in various ways to examine the appropriateness of the template, for example, by applying various distance measures, such as mean squared error (MSE), that measure the distance between the template and the true data. The template we use here is not a template of stock returns but a template of mood scores that comes from the exterior domain of human psyche—hence the expression “exterior template” in the title of this paper. The mood scores template is generated from two samples of mood scores 50 years apart: mood scores reported by Farber (1953) and the results of a more recent survey of preferences for days of the week that we conducted in 2007. Our mood scores show the same tendency as Farber’s (1953)—namely, that mood gradually improves during the week. Moreover, our survey results are highly correlated with those of Farber (linear correlation coefficient of 0.98), suggesting that attitudes toward days of the week did not change much over a period of more than 50 years. To test the behavioral explanation of the day-of-the-week effect, we replicate the weekly mood-score template and regress the time series of daily returns directly on the repeatedly occurring mood-score template. This approach has an advantage over the mood-mimicking returns approach used by Hirshleifer et al. (2017) since it is impossible to know with certainty whether mood-mimicking returns actually mimic mood properly. Our results indicate that the mood template is a potentially valid explanation of the day-of-the-week effect. Regressions of daily returns from 1953 to 2006 suggest that a simple average of the mood scores in Farber (1953) and our survey can explain 35% to 90% of the variation in average daily abnormal returns. Given evidence that individual investors tend to disproportionately invest in small stocks (Lee, Shleifer, and Thaler, 1991; Grinblatt and Moskowitz, 2004; Nagel, 2005), we expected the mood variable to be more powerful for small stocks. Our findings confirm this hypothesis and show that the ability of mood to explain abnormal returns is considerably higher in small capitalization deciles. Several studies suggest that the magnitude of the day-of-the-week effect has declined over time. Therefore, we repeated the full-period analysis for three 18-year subperiods and found that the magnitude of the day-of-the-week effect has indeed declined over time. However, we found that the ability of mood to explain the day-of-the-week effect has remained relatively stable. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we generate various mood scores based on Farber (1953) survey and a more recent survey we conducted in 2007. Section 3 analyzes the relation between mood and daily returns. Section 4 repeats the analysis of section 3 for three subperiods. Section 5 concludes the paper.",2

The first documented evidence of the day-of-the-week effect (henceforth the effect) is provided by Kelly (1930), who reports that returns on Mondays are lower than returns on other days of the week. Several other practitioners have confirmed the existence of a day-of-the-week effect, including Fields (1931), Hirsch (1968), and Cross (1973). Interest in the effect within academic circles begins with French (1980), who documents negative returns on Mondays and positive returns on other days of the week. Subsequent research verified the existence of this effectFootnote 1 and identified that its magnitude is larger in small market capitalization stocksFootnote 2. This paper makes two contributions to the literature on the day-of-the-week effect. The first contribution is to describe the development of the effect over time and across size deciles. Analysis of the effect in three subperiods suggests that the magnitude of the effect has declined over time. The decline in the magnitude of the effect is not uniform, but rather it is inversely related to size. As part of this decline, in the last subperiod, the largest market capitalization decile and the value-weighted (VW) portfolio display no signs of a day-of-the-week effect. The second contribution of the paper is the documentation of a pattern of improving returns during the week. These results are consistent with the behavioral hypothesis of the day-of-the-week effect, which relates the pattern of improving returns to the pattern of improving mood during the week. Farber (1953) and Golder and Macy (2011), among others, document a pattern of improving mood during the week. Cole et al. (1998) and Bader (2005) document a relationship between mood and increased prudence. Increased prudence during periods of low mood may explain the findings of Pettengill (1993), who shows that investors have a higher tendency to take financial risks before the weekend and lower tendency to take risks after the weekend. Higher levels of prudence may also explain the increased tendency of individual investors to sell stocks on Monday (e.g., Abraham and Ikenberry 1994; Brockman and Michayluk 1998; Brooks and Kim 1997; Lakonishok and Maberly 1990). Rystrom and Benson (1989), Jacobs and Levy (1988), and Markese (1989) are the first to propose the behavioral hypothesis as a possible explanation for the day-of-the-week effect. Some empirical support for the behavioral explanation is provided by Gondhalekar and Mehdian (2003), who find that the negative returns on Mondays are intensified during periods of investor pessimism. More recently, Hirshleifer et al. (2017) study the effect of mood on the cross section of returns by using mood-mimicking returns and find that mood is a valid explanation of the day-of-the-week effect. Further support for the behavioral explanation of the day-of-the-week effect is recently provided by Birru (2017).",5

These authors considered bank specific characteristics, industry specific factors and macroeconomic variables as the main determinants of bank profitability. Since then, a huge number of studies have been carried out on this issue (Pasiouras and Kosmidou (2007) and García-Herrero et al. (2009), Berger and Bouwman (2013), Berger and Bouwman (2013), Soedarmono, et al. (2013), Marozva (2015)). However, since the information and communication technological (ICT) revolution of the mid-nineties, non-traditional activities have become an additional contributor to bank revenues and have also become an important factor that determines bank performance and risk taking. Literature on the impact of non-traditional activities on bank performance has provided a conflicting recommendation. In fact, while an important number of studies reported the positive impact of non-interest income (NII henceforth) on returns and risks (Ismail et al. (2015), Trivedi (2015), Lee et al. (2014), Meslier et al. (2014) and Saunders et al. (2014)), some other papers have found that traditional activities are considered as a key factor for more profitability and less risk (Pringle’s (1974), Graddy and Kyle (1979), Molyneux et al. (1998), Ramadan et al. (2011), Carbó-Valverde et al. (2011) and Ekpu and Paloni (2015)). These conclusions show that the effects of non-interest income differ from one country to another one. For example, in the U.S, the average bank’s fees and noninterest income represent 27% of net operating income while trading income counts for about 3.5% (Stiroh, 2004a, b). In the same context, the ratio of NII moved from 25% to over 40% of their aggregate income over the period 1984 to 2001 (DeYoung and Roland, 2001a, b). In Europe, over the period 1996–2002, the average NII represented 23.16% of net operating income and 9.7% from trading income (Lepetit et al. 2008). In Italy, net interest income as a percentage of total assets fell from 3% in 1993 to 1.8% in 2003 while non-interest income grew from 1% to 1.4% (Chiorazzo et al. 2008)). In Australia, the average net interest margin during the period 1987–2004 was around 2.236% whereas the NII was 1.835% (Williams and Prather 2010). In India, the contribution of interest income (IIC) in total income dominates the NII since the average IIC as a percentage of total income was 86.40% during the period 2005–2011, while NII represents only 13.60 (Trivedi 2015). Given these inconsistencies, this research paper aims to analyze the weight and effects of non-interest income on overall bank performance within the Tunisian context. Tunisia is an interesting case study since it has witnessed extensive financial reforms in the beginning of 1990s such as implementation of the structural adjustment programs, trade liberalization and the ratification of many accords and trade agreements (Hamdi 2013). All these reforms aim to modernize the banking activities and to improve the financial service products. In this paper, we analyze the main factors that determine the level of non-interest income for Tunisian banks then, we study the impact of non-interest income on the banking profitability and finally, we explore the association between non-interest income and the level of risk taking. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study yet that has analyzed the impact of diversification on bank performance and risk within the Tunisian context. Therefore, this paper tries to fill the gap of literature by providing a comprehensive study. In the empirical study, we used annual data related to 20 Tunisian banks during the period 2005–2015 and we conduct an econometric model based on the General Moments of Methods in system (SGMM). Empirical results indicate that the main determinants of non-interest income are relatives’ performance such as RROA and RROE, some bank specifics (bank size and loan specialization), technological innovation (ATM) and credit cards. We also find that diversification increases bank performance for both ROA and ROE measures. For the effect on the level of risk, non-interest income appears to be negatively and significantly correlated with the standard deviation SHROA and SHROE. The structure of this paper is presented as follows. In section 2, we present the literature review. Section 3 provides an overview of the Tunisian banking. In section 4, we present a comparison of the importance of non-interest income and interest income. The section 5 provides data and methodology. Section 6 discusses the findings and section 7 concludes. In this literature review we start by presenting the determinants of noninterest income then, we review the association between noninterest income and bank performance and finally, we analyze how noninterest income can make banks more risky. During the last two decades, banking sector has witnessed a structural change thanks to the financial deregulation and the rapid surge in information and communications technology in the financial markets. As a response to these competitive pressures that leads to low interest margin and weak profitability, many banks embraced the new business model based on the new banking activities. Empirically, many studies have been done using bloc of countries or single country to analyze the added value of non-interest income on bank profitability and performance. For example in Barbados, Craigwell and Maxwell (2006) studied the determinants of non-interest income and its impact on commercial bank financial performance. The authors have used a sample of commercial banks in Barbados between 1985 and 2001. Their results support that bank characteristics and the ATM technology as the most influential factors shaping the trend of non-interest income in the banking industry in Barbados. Findings also indicate that non-interest income is positively related to both bank profitability and earnings volatility. Hakimi et al. (2012) analyzed the determinants of the noninterest income for the Tunisian context by the use of data of 10 Tunisian retail banks. The sample is observed during the period 1998–2009. Results of panel data regression reveal that the advance of information and communication technologies (ICT) proxied by the number of automatic teller machine and the number of credit cards affect positively the level of NII. Findings also indicate that banking characteristics such as the bank size, the credit quality and the banking strategy are considered as the main influential factors shaping the tendency of non-interest income in Tunisia. Using a dataset of 662 relatively large commercial banks in 29 OECD countries during the period 1992 to 2006, Hahm (2008) analyzed the determinants and consequences of the NII. Empirical results show that banks with relatively large asset sizes, low net interest margins, high impaired loan ratios, and high cost-income ratios tend to exhibit higher non-interest income shares. Besides bank specifics the author tested the effect of macroeconomic factors on the level of NII. Findings indicate that banks showing slow economic growth, a stable inflation environment, and well developed stock markets tend to show higher non-interest income shares. De Young and Hunter (2003) and De Young et al. (2004) also report that bank size is positively associated with the level of non-interest income. According to these authors, relatively large banks make use of economies of scale in order to dominate the production of consumer loans. Recently, bank profitability was studied in association to bank specifics variables such as credit risk, liquidity risk, bank size and bank capital and industry specifics factors such as bank competition and concentration indexes. Tan (2016) tested the impact of risk and competition on bank profitability. To this end, he used a sample of Chinese banking industry observed during the period 2003–2011. Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) system estimator was used as empirical approach. Findings indicate that there is no significant association between competition, risk and bank profitability. However, results show that Chinese bank profitability is affected by taxation, overhead cost, labour productivity and inflation. In another recent study, Tan et al. (2017) used a sample of 100 Chinese commercial banks over the period 2003–2013 to investigate the determinants of bank profitability in China. The authors focused especially on the impact of efficiency, risk and competition on bank profitability. Empirical results reveal that under a lower competitive environment and weak bank risks, Chinese commercial banks records higher profitability. In the same context, Tan and Anchor (2017) investigated the impact of competition on the main baking risks such as credit risk, liquidity risk, capital risk and insolvency risk. They used a sample of Chinese banking industry during the period 2003–2013 and he performed the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) system estimator to examine the impact of competition on risk. Empirical findings showed that greater competition increases credit risk, liquidity risk, capital risk but decreases insolvency risk. Literature on the effect of banking diversification has provided conflicting results on the real impact on non-interest revenues on banking profitability. Empirically, many studies found that diversification improved the level of performance and increased overall bank income. For example, Meslier et al. (2014) used a sample of 39 universal and commercial banks in the Philippines from1999 to 2005 to investigate the added value of banking diversification. Results indicate that noninterest income increases bank profits and also risk-adjusted profits. In the same line of idea, Lee et al. (2014) investigated the effect of non interest income on bank profitability and risk using bank data of 22 countries in Asia and 967 individual banks over the period 1995–2009. By performing the dynamic panel Generalized Method of Moment method (GMM), results indicate that non-interest activities of Asian banks reduce risk, but do not increase profitability. More recently, Sun et al. (2017) have used a dataset of 16 listed Chinese commercial banks, over the period of 2007 to 2013 to test the effect of noninterest income on the bank performance. By performing panel threshold model, empirical findings indicate that that there is a nonlinear relationship between noninterest income and bank performance. Findings also indicate that there is a negative association between the noninterest income ratio and performance of commercial banks. The authors reported that it should raise the ratio of noninterest income to a certain level to make banks more profitable. Ismail et al. (2015) used a sample of Pakistani Banks for the period of 2006–2013 to explore the relationship between income diversification and banking performance. Findings showed a positive impact of income diversification on the level of bank in Pakistan. Similarly, Trivedi (2015) used a sample of 81 banks in India over the period 2005–2012. Major findings indicate that the rising share of fee-based income and non-interest income in total income and diversification has a positive impact on profitability. For the U.S context, Saunders et al. (2014) used 368,006 quarterly observations on 10,341 U.S banks during the period 2002–2013, and found that a higher ratio of non interest income is associated with a higher profitability across the banking sector and under different market regimes. This result reported that stronger diversification might be the best alternative. In the same line of analysis, Craigwell and Maxwell (2006) employed quarterly data related to seven commercial banks in Barbados during the period from 1985 to 2001. Their findings confirmed that an increase in non-interest income is linked to greater bank profitability but also to higher earnings volatility. Many studies have found that non-interest income derived from diversification of bank activities increases the bank risk. For example, Delpachitra and Lester (2013) used a sample of nine Australian-owned banks out of the twelve listed banks for the period 2000–2009 to study the effects of diversification of bank performance. Empirical results suggest that non interest income and revenue diversifications reduced profitability and did not improve the overall default risk of banks. They have concluded that non-interest income activities would not benefit banks. In another study, Williams and Prather (2010) focused on the effect of noninterest income on the bank risk-return. To this end, they have used 49 banks in Australia, which account for over 65% of Australian resident banking assets. As major findings, fee-based income seems to be riskier than margin income but offers diversification benefits to bank shareholders. The European context was explored by Chiorazzo et al. (2008). Based on annual data related to Italian banks over the period 1993–2003, they analyzed the link between noninterest revenues and profitability. Findings indicate that income diversification increases risk-adjusted returns. Those results are in line with current studies on E.U banks, but do not support findings on the U.S. experience. In particular, they find that this relation is consistent with large banks. However, Small banks can profit from increasing noninterest income when they have very little non-interest income share to start with. Khalid Mndeme (2015) investigated the impact of noninterest income on bank performance in an African county which is Tanzania. To reach this goal, he used a sample of 25 banks for the period from 2002 to 2012. Empirical results of the fixed effect model revealed that interest income has a positive impact on performance. However, findings indicate that noninterest income activities may adversely affect bank performance. The evolution of the banking environment as the improvement of technology, competition, and diversification might be the best alternative to raise the bank profit of Tanzanian banks. Stiroh (2004a,b) found that noninterest income is associated with more volatile returns and lower risk-adjusted profits. In another study, Stiroh (2006a, b) investigated the determinants of bank risk for a sample of U.S banks observed during the period 1997–2004. Results indicate that components of noninterest income are particularly volatile activities. Similarly, DeYoung and Roland (2001a, b) showed that fee-based activities are associated with increased revenue volatility, higher leverage, and increased earnings volatility. Using a sample of commercial banking companies in 42 countries during the period of 1995–2002, Gorener and Choi analyzed the effect of noninterest income on the risk-performance. The authors have found that non-interest income is associated with riskier stock returns in commercial banking companies. They explained this association by the increased market and the systematic risk. Since its independence in 1956, Tunisia has adopted two major development strategies. Until 1985 the country opted for an inward looking development strategy based on the establishment of import-substituting industries to meet the needs of the local population for manufactured goods and to reduce the trade deficit. This model of economic development has been blocked by its own mechanisms, since most of the companies created have not been able to expand and achieve economies of scale. Homemade products are non-competitive. This aggravated the budget deficit and led the country to resort to external debt, which accounted for almost 60% of GDP in 1986. Faced with this economic crisis, the IMF and the World Bank proposed to Tunisia the implementation of a structural adjustment program in 1986. Since then, the country has undertaken structural reforms which have changed the Tunisian economy which became diversified and open to the outside. On average, over the period 1990–2015, the growth rate of GDP and the inflation rate are respectively 4.02% and 4.22%, despite the difficult and unstable international situation. The budget deficit did not exceed 3% on average. In particular, the budget deficit has improved from 5% of GDP in 2014 to 4.8% in 2015.Footnote 1 These performances of the Tunisian economy are realized thanks to the positive effects of the reforms that give considerable importance to the banking sector, which is constantly reformed to support economic growth. The Tunisian banking sector has undergone significant structural reforms over the past three decades. In December 1987, the Central bank of Tunisia (CBT, henceforth) has changed the rules for granting, monitoring and refinancing loans (circular n°87–47 of 12/23/1987) to give the financial institutions more importance in the Tunisian economy. In 1988, the first Tunisian investment company (CSI) was born to promote the investment activities in the countries and to improve the Tunisian infrastructure. In 1992, the CBT launched several reforms aimed to improve the supervision of the banking sector and to remove a variety of restrictions on participation in the sector and the nature of products and services that could be provided. In 1994, the banking act n°94–25 of 02/07/1994 gave new options for development banks and deposit banks concerning their lending activities. This reform focuses on the liberalization of deposit interest rate, which aims to increase the competition between the two institutions. The privatization of the public banks in 1997 leads to the increase of the level of competition between banks, and financial services were improved considerably. In 2001, a new banking act was born suggesting the generalization of the so-called universal bank instead of the specialized banks. This new reform allows banks to widen their expertise and to exercise new financial activities. In 2005, the organization of the Tunisian banking sector has known three major events: first the creation of a new bank called “Banks of Financing of Small and medium-sized firms”, second the privatization of the “Banque de Sud” which gives birth to “Attijari Bank” and third, the change of the statute of some development banks (STUSID, BTL, TQB and BTK) to universal banks. In January 2008 and within the framework of the program of restructuration of the banking system, there was the privatization of the “Tuniso-Koweitienne Bank” by the transfer of 60% of its capital to the profit of financial company «OCEOR», a subsidiary of the French group “Caisse d’Epargne”. Headed by the Central Bank of Tunisia, the Tunisian banking sector is composed of credit institutions and offshore banks. Credit institutions include banks and financial institutions.Footnote 2
 In 2015, Tunisia banking sector is made up of 23 banks: 11 of them are listed banksFootnote 3 and they are the main players of the Tunisian stock exchange and the other are unlisted banksFootnote 4 in which 3 of them are Islamic banks, which have been enriching the Tunisian banking landscape in recent years, by offering financial products that respect the principles of Islam. As for financial institutions, they are made up of leasing institutions, factoring companies and business banks. In 2015, we had eight leasing establishments: Tunisia Leasing, International Leasing Company, Arab Tunisian Lease, Attijari Leasing, Modern Leasing, Arab International Lease, Best Lease and Hannibal Lease. Concerning factoring companies, there are two, which are Tunisia Factoring and Uni-Factor. Similarly, we had two business banks which are International Maghreb Merchant Bank and Business Bank of Tunisia. In addition to credit institutions, Tunisian banking sector includes also offshore banks. We had seven banks: Citibank, Tunisian Foreign Bank, Tunis International Bank, Loan and Investment Company, North Africa International Bank, Alubaf International Bank and Arab Banking Corporation. In all development strategies adopted by Tunisia, Tunisian banks played a crucial role in financing the national economy. Even after the 2011 revolution, which caused a significant tightening of their liquidity, banks continued to fulfill their funding mission. The loans granted by these banks represented 81.65% of their total assets and 71.24% of GDP in 2015. The loans granted to businesses and professionals account for 71.78% of total outstanding loans to the economy, compared with 28.22% for loans to individuals. Concerning the time horizon, outstanding medium- and long-term loans represent 57.26% of total outstanding loans to the economy, compared with 42.74% for short-term loans.Footnote 5
 The Tunisian banking sector, which has long been involved in economic activity and has not in many cases been interested in its own requirements, suffers from several weaknesses, mainly its low profitability, the deterioration of the quality of its assets, poor governance, etc. In 2015, the returns on assets (ROA) and the returns on equity (ROE) of Tunisian banks were respectively 1.06% and 11.07%. Recently, the quality of assets of the Tunisian banking sector has been enormously deteriorated. Bank nonperforming loans to total gross loans are steadily increasing from 11.3% in 2011 to 14.5% in 2015.Footnote 6 This deterioration is mainly due to the lack of effective supervisory instruments and rigorous prudential regulation. The majority of all Tunisian banks are small, even compared to banks in African countries. Total assets of all banks is TND 74589.359 million.Footnote 7 Total equity is TND 6484.61 million Tunisian dinarsFootnote 8 showing their low capitalization, as their capital adequacy ratio is 8.69%. Furthermore, the structure of net banking incomeFootnote 9 shows the significant weight of the interest margin (which represented 54.7% of net banking income in 2015) compared to the commission margin (which represented 22.5%). Tunisian banks continue to rely on traditional balance sheet intermediation activities, despite reforms to encourage banks to develop market activities and provide more personalized services to customers. The Tunisian banking sector is also characterized by the deterioration of its exploitation coefficient.Footnote 10 In 2015, operating expenses accounted for 49.1%Footnote 11 of net banking income. This high level of expenses is explained by the increase of staff costs, which rose from TND 811.4 million in 2011 to TND 1155.1 million in 2015.Footnote 12
 All these weaknesses, non-exclusive of others, should not hide the strengths of the Tunisian banking sector. In fact, Tunisian banks continue to maintain long-term relationships with their customers, who remain loyal to their banks, despite the emergence of new banking service providers. Customer deposits did not fall even during and after the popular revolution of January 2011. They were valued in 2015 at 59556.580 Million Tunisian dinarsFootnote 13 against 60,905.717 Million Tunisian dinarsFootnote 14 for the credits granted; representing a coverage rate of 97.78%. Tunisian Banks did not know the problem of the race of depositors to branch offices to withdraw their deposits. The risk of bank runs did not raise an issue for Tunisian banking sector, which has not suffered from global liquidity crisis. Tunisian banks invest heavily in new information and communication technologies. They can now follow their customers around the world without limiting themselves to national borders and without fear of time zones. The three main productivity ratios of Tunisian banks evolved positively even after the revolution. Customer loans compared to the number of employees increased from 2191.8 Thousand Tunisian dinars in 2011 to 2617.5 Thousand Tunisian dinars in 2015. Customer deposits divided to the number of employees rose from 2050.1 Thousand Tunisian dinars in 2011 to 2544.1 Thousand Tunisian dinars in 2015. Net banking income relative to the number of employees moved from 110.2 Thousand Tunisian dinars in 2011 to 151.1 Thousand Tunisian dinars in 2015.Footnote 15
 To ensure their sustainability in an open and highly competitive environment, Tunisian banks are required to invest more in new technologies, to rely on highly qualified staff and to revise the primacy given to credit and deposit activities. They must develop market activities and provide diversified and personalized services to customers everywhere. The Table 1 below indicates some main indicators of the Tunisian banking sector during the recent period 2010–2015. These indicators are relative to the ten (10) dynamic banks in Tunisia with regard to total assets, total deposit, total credit and also in term in financing the Tunisian economy. The examination of the two Figs. 1 and 2 below reveals that the contribution of interest income (IC) is higher than that of non-interest income (NII). On average, the IC represents almost 4.5% in total assets and 70% in total gross revenue. However, the contribution of NII is very weak as it only represents almost 0.9% in total assets and 13% in total gross revenue. Those values indicate that Tunisian banks are concentrated on traditional activities: based on lending and deposit. On the contrary, the weak contribution of NII confirms that Tunisian banks are not oriented to diversified activities. Portion of IIC and NII in Total Assets in % Portion of IIC and NII in Total Gross Revenues in % Table 2 shows also downward trends of NII and IIC during the period 2005–2012. For example, the ratio of NII as a share of total assets shifted from 1.039% in 2005 to 0.635% in 2012. Also, the ratio of NII as compared to total gross revenue recorded the same trend as it crossed from 14.506% in 2005 to 11.494% in 2012. Similarly, the evolution of the IIC as a share of total assets curve showed the same downward trend as it was 4.803% in 2005 and became 3.754% in 2012. In contrary, the report of IIC to gross revenue registered an upward trend. Hence, this ration moved from 65.8% in 2005 to reach 73.4% in 2012. During the period of study 2005–2012, the average value of IIC and NII recorded some fluctuations. In fact, the average maximum values of NII are 1.077% and 14.506% with regard respectively to total assets and gross revenue. However, the average minimum value of NII divided by total assets, registered in 2012, is 0.635%. The weak value of NII to total gross revenue, recorded also in 2012, represents only 11.494%. With regard to the contribution of IIC in total assets and gross revenue, statistics below indicate that the contribution of IIC to total gross revenue is very important. We have recorded 74.1% as a maximum value and 65.8% as a minimum value. Those levels confirm the importance of the IIC in the total revenue of Tunisian banks since it represents almost 70% of total revenue. Similarly, and taking into account the importance of the total assets value, we find that IIC represents 5.077% as a maximum value and 3.754% as a minimum value. From all these statistics and data, we can conclude that Tunisian banks are more oriented to traditional activities such as business lending rather than diversified activities. Compared to other countries where the interest rate is very low, the Tunisian central bank and Tunisian banks suggest a high level of interest rate to their customers. For example, the monetary market rate was 4.87% in 2010 and 3.98% in 2012. Also, the central bank’s policy rate was 4.5% in 2010 and 4.75% in 2012.",24

Eyo,Eucharia A. Ajah,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Microcredit is an important interventionist strategy in this decade of global economic liberalization, as it is designed to address and ameliorate financial markets by providing credit without collateral to those in rural area (Aterido, Beck and Lacovone, 2011). Nigeria’s 1986 economic liberalization as in many other countries exacerbated the financial problems in the rural sector. Loan funds from formal markets dwindled and borrowing costs escalated while the financial outlays for business enterprises multiplied several-fold due to the ravage of inflation such that only a limited number of entrepreneurs could meet their financial obligations, (Eyo, 2008). Microfinance has become a major tools used to extend credit to many low income entrepreneurs in developing countries. The provision of microcredit services improves the latent capacity of the poor for entrepreneurship thus enabling their increased self-reliance, increasing their capacity to create more employment opportunities and ultimately enhancing household income and creating wealth (Allen, Demirguc-Kunt, Klapper and Martinez-Peria, 2012). However, several authors (Ghatak, 1999; Soren, 2002; Campbell, 2006; Eyo, Otu and Sampson, 2008; Mkpado, Idu and Arene, 2010; Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper, 2012) indicate that financial institutions in recent years have preferred to disburse credit to micro entrepreneurs in groups to solve the menace of low repayments rates and high transaction costs. This is particularly true of the Nigerian financial market and micro entrepreneurs in the agricultural sector. Group lending involves the administration of credit among groups whose individuals differ in characters and reactions but who possess a common interest, in that they benefit from the group (Hulme and Mosely, 1996). The pattern of membership composition is judged as important for groups’ increased performance in terms of repayment as well as savings mobilization and the building of social cohesion through attendance at regular meetings, among other activities, (Aryeety and Udry, 1997). A greater probability exists that members will conform to group objectives in homogenous group where individual members have similar interest and share similar problems than in heterogeneous groups.",12

M. Abdullah,Salina Siddiqua,Nazmul Hossain,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"In an era of globalization and of flexible exchange rate regimes in most economies, an analysis of foreign exchange rate volatility has become increasingly important among academics and policymakers in recent decades. Volatile exchange rates are likely to affect countries’ international trade flow, capital flow, and overall economic welfare (Hakkio, 1984; De Grauwe, 1988; Asseery & Peel, 1991). It is also crucially important to understand exchange rate behavior to design proper monetary policy (Longmore & Robinson, 2004). As a result, researchers, stakeholders, and policymakers are very interested in analyzing and learning about the nature of exchange rate volatility, which can help to design policies to mitigate the adverse effects of exchange rate volatility on important economic indicators. Accordingly, beginning with Engle’s (1982) autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model, several models have already been developed to model volatility. Different models have aimed to capture different features of volatility. For example, while some models are only used to model “volatility clustering,”Footnote 1 others are used to capture the “leverage effect.”Footnote 2 However, it is widely recognized among researchers that because of increased kurtosis, along with an increase in data frequency, the rate of return in financial or macroeconomic variables as exchange rates might have a levy distribution, or a fat tail (Mandelbrot, 1963). Thus, volatility models should not be considered under the general normality assumption for errors, because if the errors are not thus, then volatility forecasting based on such models will be misleading. The current study makes an effort to appropriately model and forecast the volatility of the exchange rate return of the taka against the US dollar, taking into account the issue of error distribution assumption. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Literature review presents a review of previous literature that has attempted to model and forecast exchange rate volatility using various ARCH and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models. Methods describes the data and the theoretical methodology. Estimation results and findings analyzes and compares the results of different ARCH and GARCH models. Forecasting exchange rate return volatility is discussed in Volatility Forecasting, and Conclusion concludes the paper.",10

3.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,05 September 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-017-0066-9,The volatility of returns from commodity futures: evidence from India,December 2017,Isita Mukherjee,Bhaskar Goswami,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Volatility plays a vital role in derivative pricing, hedging, risk management, and optimal portfolio selection. The concept of volatility relates to the uncertainty or risk about an asset’s value. A higher volatility means that an asset can assume a large range of values, while a lower volatility implies that an asset’s value does not fluctuate dramatically, even though it changes over time. Accurate modeling and forecasting of volatility in asset returns are major issues in financial economics. Derivative markets, particularly commodity futures markets, have become more sophisticated now a day. The futures price depends on the availability of information. A small change in price may have large effects on the trading results across futures markets. Researchers around the world showed increasing interest in the volatility of commodity futures. In the present analysis, an attempt is made to examine the trend and pattern of the volatility of daily returns of few select commodity futures in the Indian context. As a first step, we examine the characteristics of the commodity futures. In particular, we analyze whether the price variability of a future increases or decreases when the contract approaches maturity. The Samuelson hypothesis for the selected commodity futures is tested. Samuelson (1965) argued that the volatility of the change in futures price increases as the contract approaches maturity. This phenomenon is also called the “Maturity Effect.” The purpose of testing the Samuelson hypothesis is to assess the degree of maturity of Indian commodity futures. From the view point of the Samuelson hypothesis, the prediction of price volatility is very useful for all participants in the futures market, such as hedgers, speculators, and traders. We also address the trend in daily return’s volatility across the contract cycles to decipher the volatility characteristics of the select commodity futures. To this end, we introduce the concept of rolling standard deviation. We, then, proceed to examine the volatility aspects of the commodity futures. The steps involved in this exercise are the graphical plotting of the daily returns series, followed by its descriptive statistics. The daily returns are tested for stationarity. Then, we explored the GARCH (1, 1) model for the return volatility of the select futures.Footnote 1
 The present paper derives its motivation from the following considerations. First, commodity futures as a financial asset is gaining prominence in the Indian capital market. The uninterrupted transactions in futures contracts from 2004, with a volume of trade surging from Rs 1.29 lakh crore in 2003–2004 to a peak of Rs 181 lakh crore in 2011–2012,Footnote 2 confirms the phenomenal importance of commodity futures. Second, empirically testing the Samuelson hypothesis as an indicator of developed and mature futures market seems necessary for the Indian commodity futures market. One of the key contributions of this paper is to use the GARCH (1,1) process for testing the Samuelson hypothesis on select commodity futures. Testing the Samuelson hypothesis through the β term of the GARCH (1,1) yields meaningful results, as the GARCH (1,1) assumes that the returns are uncorrelated, with zero mean. Moreover, in the GARCH (1,1) process, the present volatility does not depend on past returns, and thereby makes it a suitable methodology to test the Samuelson hypothesis. In this respect, the present analysis aims at filling a gap in the existing literature. Finally, in India, while the volatility issues related to dominant financial assets, such as company shares, have been well researched and documented, only a few studies on commodity futures have been carried out. More specifically, the trend and pattern of the volatility in the daily returns from commodities have been largely ignored in the existing literature. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The second section presents the literature. The third section deals with the methodology used in this paper and describes the relevant data sources. The result and discussion of the analysis are carried out in the fourth section. Finally, the fifth section provides our concluding remarks. Many researchers, such as W. R. Anderson (1985), examined the Samuelson hypothesis using selected agricultural futures contracts and found support for wheat, oat, soybeans, and soybeans meal futures. Bessembinder et al. (1996) provided a new framework for the maturity effect, the ‘BCSS hypothesis’ (based on Bessembinder, Coughenour, Seguin and Smoller). This hypothesis is an extension of the Samuelson hypothesis. The authors found that the Samuelson hypothesis is more likely to hold for those commodities whose price changes can be reversed in future. Black and Tonks (2000) investigated the pattern of the volatility of commodity futures prices over time and revealed the conditions which support the Samuelson hypothesis. Allen and Cruickshank (2000) analyzed the Samuelson hypothesis for selected commodity futures of three different futures markets in three different countries. They performed a regression analysis complemented by ARCH models, and the result suggests that the Samuelson hypothesis holds in the case of maximum selected contracts. Floros and Vougas (2006) investigated the Samuelson hypothesis in the context of the Greek stock index futures market and examined the maturity effect through linear regressions and GARCH models. The result of the study suggests that volatility depends on time to maturity and gives a stronger support to the Samuelson hypothesis compared to linear regressions. Duong and Kalev (2008) examined the Samuelson hypothesis for 336 selected commodities from five futures exchanges observed between 1996 and 2003. Using the Jonckheere-Terpstra Test, OLS regressions with realized volatility, and various GARCH models, the authors find mixed evidence concerning the support for the Samuelson hypothesis. Even though many studies investigated the Samuelson hypothesis, very few contributions analyzed it in the context of the Indian commodity futures market. Notable exceptions are Verma and Kumar (2010), who examined the application of the Samuelson hypothesis and BCSS hypothesis in the Indian commodity futures market. Gupta and Rajib (2012) also examined this issue for eight commodities, and they concluded that the Samuelson hypothesis does not hold for the majority of the considered commodity contracts. Numerous studies investigate the volatility of futures prices worldwide. Locke and Sarkar (1996) examined the changes in market liquidity following changes in price volatility. The results of the study suggest that market makers are most hurt by volatility in the case of inactive contracts. Richter and Sorensen (2002) analyzed a volatility model for soybean futures and options using panel data. The study suggests the existence of a seasonal pattern in convenience yields and volatility, in line with the storage theory. Chang et al. (2012) examined a long memory volatility model for 16 agricultural commodity futures. The empirical results are obtained using unit root tests, GARCH, EGARCH, APARCH, FIGARCH, FIEGARCH, and FIAPARCH model. Manera et al. (2013) examined the effect of different types of speculation on the volatility of commodity futures prices. The authors selected four energy and seven non-energy commodity futures observed over the period 1986–2010. Using GARCH models, the study suggests that speculation affects the volatility of returns, and long-term speculation has a negative impact, whereas short term speculation has a positive effect. Christoffersen et al. (2014) analyzed the stylized facts of volatility in the post-financialization period using data of 750 million futures observed between 2004 and 2013. Two strands in the existing literature focused on volatility in the Indian commodity futures market. First, the literature is largely dominated by spot price volatility and its spillover effect on future price volatility, that is, the price discovery mechanism of the futures market. Brajesh and Kumar (2009
) examined the relationship between future trading activity and spot price volatility for different commodity groups, such as agricultural, metal, precious metal, and energy commodities in the perspective of the Indian commodity derivatives market. P. Srinivasan (2012) examined the price discovery process and volatility spillovers in Indian spot-futures commodity markets and the result points to dominant volatility spillovers from spot to futures market. Sehgal et al. (2012) examined the futures trading activity on spot price volatility of seven agricultural commodities and found that unexpected futures trading has strong correlation on spot volatility. Chauhan et al. (2013) analyzed the market efficiency of the Indian commodity market. They found that for guar seed, the volatility in futures prices influences the volatility in spot prices and the opposite result holds for chana. The work by Chakrabarti and Rajvanshi (2013) also explored the determinants of return volatility of select commodity futures in the Indian context. Sendhil et al. (2013) examined the efficiency of commodity futures through price discovery, transmission, and the extent of volatility in four agricultural commodities and found persistence volatility in spot market. Kumar et al. (2014) examined the price discovery and volatility spillovers in the Indian spot-futures commodity market. Gupta and Varma (2015) reviewed the impact of futures trading on spot markets of rubber in India and observed bidirectional flow of volatility between spot and futures market. Vivek Rajvanshi (2015) presented a comparative study on the performance of range and return-based volatility estimators for crude oil commodity futures. Malhotra and Sharma (2016) investigated the information transmission process between the spot and futures market and found that bidirectional volatility spillovers exists between the spot and futures market. Second, a few studies specifically focus on the volatility of commodity futures. Kumar and Singh (2008) examined the volatility clustering and asymmetric nature of Indian commodity and stock market using S&P CNX Nifty for the stock market, and gold and soybean for the commodity futures market. Kumar and Pandey (2010) examined the relationship between volatility and trading activity for different categories of Indian commodity derivatives. They find a positive and significant correlation between volatility and trading volume for all commodities, no significant relationship between volatility and open interest, and an asymmetric relationship between trading volume and open interest. Kumar and Pandey (2011) examined the cross market linkages of Indian commodity futures with futures markets outside India. However, all these studies focus on the price volatility of commodity futures. In contrast with the above-mentioned studies on the Indian commodity futures market, the present study attempts to examine the return volatility of select commodity futures as financial assets.Footnote 3

As such, it is an important export for Pakistan, generating substantial revenues for the government through export duties, and the government has adopted different policies to promote adequate production. Punjab and Sindh are the major rice production provinces, accounting for 56% and 39% of total production, respectively (GOP, 2013). Rice is also the most important food crop of Pakistan, even more so than wheat because despite wheat being also widely produced here, wheat yields are lower when compared to other countries such as China, France, and the United States (Ozpinar et al., 2006; Rehman et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c, 2016d). Tillage and weed infestation are the two major causes of low yield, decreasing the wheat yields by 50–80%. Tillage is still the primary method used for weed control and preparing seedbeds in most areas worldwide. However, tillage practices alone are not adequate for weed management (Mohanty et al., 2006). More recently, several techniques for rice cultivation have been introduced, including alternate wetting and drying, direct seeding, a mechanized system for rice amplification, and an aerobic rice system. These systems have been verified and scaled up in the provinces of Punjab and Sindh by the Pakistan Research Council (PARC), in cooperation with national and international research organizations (IRRI, 2010; Sharif, 2011). For a discussion on these technologies and systems, see Bouman et al. (2007) and Rehman et al. (2016a, 2016b, 2016c, 2016d). We studied the performance of an aerobic rice system (ARS), where alternatively to transplanting seedlings, seeds are sown directly in the field. This system reduces cost per unit area, and is well suited for areas with labor shortages (Pandey et al., 2002; Pandey and Velasco, 2005). Furthermore, the availability of a wide range of weedicides decreases the labor required for weeding in this system (Farooq et al., 2011). Additionally, the system has methods of achieving irrigation requirements when groundwater drops below a critical level. The overall performance of aerobic and direct seeded rice means they are potentially more profitable and environmentally maintainable as production systems. As such, the aerobic rice system may be an attractive alternative technological change in environments where water is scarce (Bouman et al., 2007). Rice is an important crop for many countries. Its cultivation extends from the humid tropics to northeastern China and southeastern Australia and from sea level to an altitude of over 2500 m in the more moderate regions of Nepal and Bhutan. Although most rice is cultivated in Asia, there are several suitable areas for its cultivation in Oceania and Europe. Due to the wide geographical distribution, rice is cultivated in many different climates and on a wide range of soils, with tremendous differences in soil properties. Early studies focused on flooded rice production in Asia due to these characteristically rice soils (IRRI, 1978; IRRI, 1985; Kawaguchi and Kyuma, 1977; Moormann and Breemen, 1978). However, most studies have focused on the specifics of waterlogged soil treatments (Banta and Mandoza, 1984; Kirk, 2004; Kögel-Knabner et al., 2010; Ladha et al., 1992; Ponnamperuma, 1972; Wassmann et al., 2000). As a result, recent studies examining the spatial representation and rice soil distribution are limited. Consequently, comparable quantitative data on paddy soil quality and rice production systems are unavailable. In this context, important issues regarding to soil quality that require qualitative studies can usually be answered by local experts. A better understanding of the spatial representation of soil quality and barriers to rice production could serve several purposes. To evaluate the target and focus on agricultural research, spatial information on environmental constraints to crop production can be used (Hijmans et al., 2003), and can additionally be assisted by communication technologies (Singh and Singh, 2010). Understanding the spatial distribution and properties of soil, climate, hydrology, and abiotic traits, with a focus on the importance of the target crop, can assist with specific challenges in rice production, such as finding more tolerant varieties of rice (Huang et al., 2010), as well as dealing with submergence tolerance (Xu et al., 2006), phosphorus deficiency tolerance (Gamuyao et al., 2012), and water stress tolerance (Verulkar et al., 2010). Similarly, this type of information can be used to improve the study and dissemination of management options and issues related to a particular soil. The sustainability of conventional rice systems is susceptible to water supply issues and deteriorating energy resources. For this purpose, resource conservation technologies (RCTs) are being developed and disseminated to promote global rice production (CGIAR, 2010). Rice production technology has shown significant potential of improving resource utilization by planting rice in a manner similar to other crops, that is, in non-banks and non-flooded areas, such as unsaturated soils under wheat and maize, or the drought sowing of upland rice. Additionally, aerobic rice varieties are developed by crossing traditional lowland and upland varieties to combine yield potential traits of lowland varieties and adaptation to aerobic soils (Atlin et al., 2006) of upland varieties. ARS has been established in temperate climates and there is being work done to improve these systems in tropical and subtropical regions to increase the incomes of local farmers, as well as regional and national food security (Maclean et al., 2002; Prasad and Donald, 2011). Another technology of rice cultivation is paddy rice, which is typically grown by transplanting 25- to 35-day-old seedlings in well-prepared puddled soils. This controls purification and weed growth and infestation, but requires tremendous amounts of fresh water for proper growth. Growing paddy rice in Pakistan is a formidable challenge for food security, where limited water reservoirs and increasing population are important barriers (Briscoe and Qamar, 2009). According to one estimate, during the fiscal year 2011–2012 (July 1 to June 30), the availability of water from canal irrigation was around 10% less than the long-term average water use of 128 billion m3 (GOP, 2012). The groundwater table is falling at the rate of nearly 0.3 m per year (Hussain, 2002) due to increasing groundwater exploitation and utilization of more than 7 m (Kahlown et al., 2007; Rehman et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c, 2016d). Increases in fuel prices have also resulted in high charges for pumping groundwater, thus causing a decline in net economic profits. Labor shortages are another factor impacting rice cultivation, and hampering production and causing delays in transplanting seedlings, when manual evacuation and transplantation are required. The existing limited labor force mainly consists of unskilled contracted women and teenagers, which results in a lack of quality assurance in addition to uneven plantations and economic densities below the agronomically optimal ones (Baloch et al., 2005; Chaudhary et al., 2001; Farooq et al., 2011). According to a report published by FAO (2000), around 40% of food is produced through irrigated agriculture, a practice that consumes around 69% of all freshwater resources. Furthermore, world population growth is predicted to increase demand for cereals, including rice and wheat, by 1.27% annually between 2000 and 2025 (Rosegrant and Cai, 2000). To achieve this projected food demand, an incremental increase of 17% in freshwater resources for irrigated agriculture would be needed (Seregeldin, 1999). To fulfill the requirements of an increasing population, pressure has been placed on the agricultural sector in both agricultural and semi-agricultural countries to produce higher yields where population growth is high and availability of freshwater bodies is low, further intensifying water consumption to produce more for an increasing population. This trend drives the bulk production of cereals, especially rice and wheat, to use inadequate amounts of irrigation. Pakistan is expected to suffer a scarcity of irrigation water in the near future. Here, farmers generally utilize an open flooded system to irrigate fields in bundled units, resulting in poor water uniformity, long irrigation events, and over-irrigation (Kahlown and Kemper, 2004; Rehman et al., 2016a, 2016b, 2016c, 2016d). The tendency to rely on standing water during the growing season as to exploit rice yields has led to poor water use efficiency. Numerous studies on Pakistan revealed that 13–18 cm of water is applied per irrigation, which is considerably higher than the consumptive use of around 8 cm between irrigation events (Kahlown et al., 2001). Additionally, farm irrigation efficiency ranges between 23 and 70% (Clyma and Ashraf, 1975; Kahlown et al., 1998; Kijne and Kuper, 1995). Furthermore, the use of a pressurized irrigation method has allowed planting of rice and wheat in different countries. Sprinkler irrigation, such as portable rain, guns can be used to add water depth, and sprinklers have been used under prevailing climatic conditions on the Indian subcontinent to improve farm irrigation efficiency by up to 80%. The areas under rice crop production per 1000 ha and yields in kg/ha for Pakistan are shown in Figs. 1 and 2. Area under Rice Crop Production 1970–2015 Yield of Rice Crop in kg/ha 1970–2015",16

3.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,02 June 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-017-0061-1,At what levels of financial development does information sharing matter?,December 2017,Simplice A. Asongu,Jacinta C. Nwachukwu,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"The purpose of this study is to assess how an increase in information-sharing offices affects financial access when existing levels of financial development are taken into account. Recent literature reveals that less than 20% of African households have access to financial services (see IFAD 2011; Asongu et al. 2017). This widespread narrative indicates that a great part of the population on the continent depends on the informal sector for financial services. Some factors limiting access to finance include low population densities in many areas, poor facilities in transport, and limited communication infrastructure. In regions where financial services from the formal sector are available, low-income households and small businesses are for the most part unable to meet certain basic lending requirements, like strict documentation and collateral provision. Even in situations where such conditions are met, cost barriers (like substantial transaction fees) and high minimum deposits of savings could still overwhelmingly restrict financial access. The above concerns have led to issues of surplus liquidity or excess cash in African formal financial institutions (see Saxegaard 2006; Fouda 2009; Asongu 2014a, p. 70). The authors have suggested measures to curb both the voluntary and involuntary holding of excess liquidity by banks. First, voluntary holding of excess cash can be reduced by: (i) helping banks to track their positions at the central bank to prevent them from keeping reserves above statutory limits; (ii) consolidating institutions that are favorable to interbank lending; and (iii) improving infrastructure to prevent remote bank branches from holding excess reserves essentially due to transportation problems. Second, involuntary keeping of surplus cash can be kept at minimum by: (i) reducing the incapacity of banks to lend in scenarios where interest rates are regulated; (ii) creating conducive conditions for commercial banks to invest surplus liquidity in bond markets; (iii) increasing investment avenues for regional banks via promotion of regional stock exchange markets; and (iv) reducing lending contraction of banks through instruments that encourage competition and mitigate information asymmetry. This line of inquiry is closest to the final point (iii) of the first strand, regarding the improvement of infrastructure. Over the past decade, information-sharing bureaus have been introduced across the African continent in order to enhance financial access by limiting information asymmetry. Unfortunately, recent empirical literature has been based on the assumption that information-sharing agencies may not be increasing financial access as theoretically anticipated (see Triki and Gajigo 2014). For instance, Asongu et al. (2016) concluded that the effects of information-sharing bureaus have mostly been negative on financial development dynamics in terms of depth, allocation efficiency, and activity. Moreover, as we shall demonstrate in the literature review that follows, there has been very limited scholarly focus on the role of information-sharing agencies on financial access in the African continent. This study addresses the highlighted gaps by investigating the levels of financial development for which an increase in information-sharing bureaus can most enhance financial access. The interest in considering initial levels of financial development arises because the findings of Asongu et al. (2016) were based on the average values of financial development. It is important to include countries with low, intermediate, and high levels of financial development in the modeling exercise, because blanket policies based on the mean values of financial access may not succeed unless they are contingent on initial levels of financial development and tailored differently across countries with different levels of financial access (see Henderson et al. 2013). In the light of the above insights, the quantile regression empirical strategy is adopted, because existing studies on information sharing have examined the relationship between information-sharing bureaus and financial development using parameter estimates based on the conditional means of financial development variables (Triki and Gajigo 2014; Asongu et al. 2016). The emphasized research gaps are addressed by answering the following question: can we identify the existing levels of financial development in Africa for which increases in information-sharing bureaus show a strong positive effect on financial access? Addressing this research inquiry is important, because the findings should inform policy makers on ways to lift financial access barriers to enable households and small corporations to maximize their savings and earnings for more productivity, more employment, and higher economic growth. Hence, the contribution of this study is to complement existing literature by investigating how increases in information-sharing offices influence financial access when existing levels of development are considered in the modeling exercise. One of the main results stemming from the econometric analysis is that an increase in public credit registries improves financial efficiency in countries in the middle range of the financial development distribution. This result is intuitive, because for poorly developed financial systems, increasing information-sharing bureaus may in some respects decrease the pace of development, whereas for more developed financial systems, the impact of information sharing may already have been taken into account. It is important to note that some initial conditions (e.g. good infrastructure, saving accounts for the majority of the population and high penetration of information and communication technology) that are essential for information-sharing bureaus to improve financial access may not be apparent in countries with poorly developed financial systems. The rest of the study is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the stylized facts, theoretical underpinnings, and empirical literature. The data and methodology are covered in Section 3. The empirical results are presented and discussed in Section 4. Section 5 concludes with future research directions.",9
3.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,18 May 2017,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-017-0060-2,Financial innovation and its governance: Cases of two major innovations in the financial sector,December 2017,Keren Naa Abeka Arthur,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Financial innovation can be defined as the creation and popularisation of new financial products, processes, markets, and institutions (Llewellyn, 1992; White, 1997; Tufano, 2003; Mishra, 2008; Sánchez, 2010; Delimatsis, 2011; Gubler, 2011; Lerner and Tufano, 2011). This definition suggests that financial innovation is a process that can be managed and governed to achieve desired results (Tidd et al., 2005; Tidd and Bessant, 2009). Despite this, there is limited research on the process and governance of financial innovation. The few existing studies are mainly focused on aspects of the ‘backend’ of the innovation process, such as diffusion, the characteristics of adopters, and the impact of innovation on firm profitability (Frame and White, 2004). As such, there is a need to fill this gap since a better understanding of financial innovation and governance processes can help steer financial innovation toward positive ends (Asante et al., 2014). The financial services industry comprises a broad range of businesses with distinctions that are not clearly distinguished (Asmundson, 2011). That said, they can be broadly categorised into four main groups: monetary financial institutions, other financial institutions, insurance companies or intermediaries, and activities auxiliary to financial intermediation (Burgess, 2011). Monetary financial institutions include banks (i.e. central, investment, and commercial) and building societies. Other financial institutions can include the following: non-bank credit grantors (e.g. credit unions and cooperatives), consumer credit institutions (e.g. payday lenders, pawnbrokers), payment service institutions, electronic money institutions, mortgage and home finance lenders, finance leasing companies, bank holding companies, investment funds, securities dealers, unit trusts and factoring companies, hedge funds, venture capital, private equity, and pension funds (Burgess, 2011). The activities of monetary and other financial institutions include taking deposits from individuals or institutions and feeding them into funds (e.g. pension funds, unit trusts) or firms in the form of equity institutions (e.g. venture capital, private equity, hedge funds, investment banks) (European Central Bank, 2015). These financial service sub-sectors are associated with innovations in products, processes (Batiz-Lazo and Woldesenbet, 2006), and services (Barras, 1986), which can occur either through a normal product life cycle or through what Barras (1986) calls a reverse product cycle. Within this model of innovation, process improvements and innovations provide the basis for future product innovations rather than the reverse (Barras, 1986). This process can be incremental or radical (Bessant and Tidd, 2007). For some monetary and other financial intermediaries—including those whose activities are ‘based around complex, large-scale production and distribution systems’, such as investment banks (Nightingale et al., 2003: 478), where the amount of financial risk correlates positively with increases in the scale and scope of financial trades—innovation can include technologies that help to create control systems (Nightingale and Poll, 2000) for minimising financial risk. The activities of insurers and insurance intermediaries involve pooling and diversifying risks (Harrington and Niehaus, 1999). Meanwhile, activities auxiliary to financial intermediation include facilitating trade between borrowers and lenders (e.g. financial markets and asset management companies) (Burgess, 2011) and supporting individual decisions regarding investments and financial planning (e.g. financial advisers) (Banerjee, 2013). Again, innovations in products, processes, technology, and services are characteristics of these types of financial service institutions (Barras, 1986; Batiz-Lazo and Woldesenbet, 2006). A review of the literature (Llewellyn, 1992; White, 1997; Tufano, 2003; Mishra, 2008; Sánchez, 2010; Delimatsis, 2011; Gubler, 2011; Lerner and Tufano, 2011) suggests that the features of contemporary financial innovation include the following: 1) poor characterisation, with no overall descriptive model for how it happens and is governed; 2) a process that is mainly incremental and recombinant but also complex with rapid diffusivity; 3) a process that occurs with a short lead time; 4) an informal process with little evidence of a systematic framework for management and governance (Armstrong et al., 2012); and 5) the involvement of multiple stakeholders, including individuals, non-financial firms, governments, financial firms, markets and exchanges, and technology firms, all of whom may be involved in the innovation process but with little understanding of how they interact. In terms of governance, Cox (2008) describes a four-stage cyclical system of issue identification, self-regulation, failure, and legislation. He explains that the process of governing financial activity normally begins when an industry perceives a problem. To address that problem, actors in the industry implement voluntary standards that all are willing to accept. This approach usually works fine until something goes wrong in the financial system, which then triggers legislation since the legislature typically views this as the only solution. Stout (2011), meanwhile, uses the case of credit default swaps to argue that the financial innovation governance process begins with a common-law approach, followed by a modern approach involving codification and de-codification. At the common-law level, laymen and lawmakers use common sense to anticipate the benefits and possible risks of financial innovations, and decisions about which innovations to promote are made on that basis. While this approach does not prohibit financial innovations considered risky, it discourages their emergence by making them unenforceable by law, which leads to the emergence of self-regulatory mechanisms. Over time, common-law courts recognise the legality of such private enforcement activities and introduce legislation to prohibit them. However, this faces resistance from stakeholders, thus leading to a reversal of the old common-law rule. This process of codification and de-codification usually involves introducing transaction costs and establishing a discretionary authority with power over financial instruments and firms as a means to discourage risky innovations (Pradier, 2011). The processes described above show that two main types of mechanisms are used in the financial innovation governance process—namely, statutory regulation (e.g. using legal sanctions) and self-regulation (e.g. using corporate governance structures and private exchanges) (Stefanadis, 2003; Awrey, 2011). Nevertheless, these mechanisms appear to focus more on financial sector governance than on governing financial innovation. Germain (2010): 27 defines financial sector governance as ‘publicly sanctioned decision-making directed towards establishing the framework of rules by which and through which financial institutions undertake and organise financial transactions within and across borders’. This definition emphasises law and order in financial activity; however, it does not touch upon how financial sector innovations and the associated stakeholders are monitored from ideation to commercialisation (Asante et al., 2014). According to Asante et al. (2014), the latter is likely to include mechanisms such as ‘stage gating’, where challenging and approving ideas is key, as well as test-before-market principles and the use of new-product-development committees that debate the risks and impacts of innovation. However, the literature suggests that use of those mechanisms is limited in financial innovation, with its introduction, approval, elaboration, and diffusion appearing to occur under governance constraints. Comparing financial innovation with its governance, the literature also suggests a reactive rather than forward-looking approach (Pol, 2009; Germain, 2010; Pacces, 2010). Here, governance occurs after development and commercialisation, and lags behind financial innovation itself, sometimes by decades or even centuries (Asante et al., 2014). This partly implies an ideal state or condition in which stakeholders in the financial innovation ecosystem could assess risks, implement mechanisms to mitigate them, and respond quickly to emerging knowledge on new risks and wider impacts. The literature suggests the ability to foresee all risks associated with innovation has significant limits. However, many scholars still believe financial innovators can manage such uncertainty with the right mechanisms and tools. To this end, science and technology researchers have suggested a framework of anticipation, reflection, deliberation, and responsiveness to steer innovation toward the desired ends (Owen et al., 2013). This could also be useful in the financial sector (Armstrong et al., 2012; Muniesa and Lenglet, 2013; Asante et al., 2014). Below, I summarise findings from an analysis of secondary sources regarding how two major financial innovations—automated teller machines (ATMs) and collateralised debt obligations (CDOs)—were developed and governed, as well as the extent to which activities such as anticipation, reflection, deliberation, and responsiveness were adopted. The ATM is considered both a specific and general innovation used not only by financial institutions to dispense cash from an individual’s account but also as a facility for cash transfers between financial institutions. Similarly, the CDO is a general innovation used by all financial institutions across the industry. These two cases were selected because they are considered significant innovations in the financial services sector. They are representative of product innovations in the monetary financial intermediary segment of the financial services landscape. This subsector can be considered more risky, and potentially more disruptive, because of its involvement with, for example, structured finance products that help transfer risks using complex mechanisms on a global scale. Thus, understanding innovation and governance processes within that financial service sub-sector can help to discover ways to promote responsible financial innovation. The ATM is a computerised self-service device that dispenses cash and performs other banking services with the insertion of a card and the entering of a personal identification number (PIN) (Curran and King, 2008). It can be traced to the early twentieth century, where increasing interest and rapid development in automation created a trend toward unmanned retail and other services (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). Though this innovation emerged from a growing pressure to end Saturday business hours in Europe, as well as branch expansion restrictions in the US, it successfully embedded itself in the economics of everyday life in a way that made it one of the biggest technological innovations in financial history (Goode and Moutinho, 1995; Curran and King, 2008; Volcker, 2009; Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). Nevertheless, this entrenchment in society took a period of about 18 years to move from idea generation to commercialisation (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). Though normally credited to Don Wetzel (Mandell, 1990; Hayashi et al., 2003), the idea of a fully functioning ATM offering multiple services (e.g. dispensing cash, making deposits, printing balances) cannot be traced to one individual (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). Rather, it was the product of collaboration among bankers, engineers, and end users in an unstructured, iterative, and evolutionary manner (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). While collaboration took place within organisations in different parts of the world, society saw the introduction of several standalone devices with various designs, verification systems, and capabilities (most limited to dispensing cash) (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). Nevertheless, limited capability and security remained major obstacles, leading to continuous improvements in both functionality and hardware. Consequently, there were new innovations in the specific aspects of ATMs, such as PINs and PANs (personal access numbers) associated with verification/security, web-enabled systems with online capabilities, and modular systems with memory storage customisation capabilities. These allowed for the coordination of payment systems across financial institutions—something that can be considered an innovation in itself (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). Aided by advancements in other sectors (e.g. computing, electronics, and communication), the ATM as we know it emerged as a result of a long, distributed chain of innovations in different aspects of the product, involving different people in different countries (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). Although there is limited information on the history of ATM governance, it appears that the ATM was developed under a system of self-regulation rather than legislation. In a few cases, patents were granted to individuals or groups for the innovation or part of it (e.g. US Patent 3,761,682 given to Don Wetzel for the Docuteller and GB Patent 1,197,183 given to Anthony Davies and James Goodfellow for the Chubb MD2), but these occurred only at the end of the innovation process and were not a requirement for commercialisation (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). Systems for self-regulation were decentralised to top-level leadership as well as the team leaders of various innovation committees (e.g. the Technical Committee of Joint Purchasing Company Sparframjander, who designed the Bankomat, and a committee comprising staff from Midland Bank and Speytec Engineering). These were set up within companies around the world that used the mechanisms of periodic assessment (through meetings), testing (for the resilience of plastic cards with magnetic stripes), and prototypes, mainly to understand security and capability issues (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). Further, the competitive nature of the industry allowed consumers to play an indirect ‘de facto’ governance role by eliminating non-performing products (through non-purchase), thereby encouraging innovators to continuously improve (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). In the late twentieth century, innovation governance shifted from a decentralised structure to a more centralised one with the introduction of the ATM Industry Association (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). This organisation began as a dedicated media site for selling ads and promoting ATM supplies but grew to become a global self-regulatory body providing best-practice manuals, regulatory monitoring, campaigning services, and benchmarking services (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). Similarly, government regulation (in the form of legislation) has also improved, though it mainly focuses on fees/surcharges and consumer protection (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). The widespread use of committees involving individuals from various backgrounds (e.g. bankers, engineering manufacturers, transaction processors, software providers) created platforms to facilitate deliberation (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). Nevertheless, anticipation was lacking as these discussions were reactive, narrowly focused on security and capability issues identified only after deployment (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). The development of the PIN/PAN system provides a good example of this. This innovation came about sometime after the initial deployment of the first Swedish bank machines in 1967. Someone had discovered that the algorithm used to associate card numbers with PIN codes was not resilient and exploited this by withdrawing money from various ATMs around Sweden during Easter vacation in 1968 (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). Unfortunately, the bank did not catch this until about 50 days after Easter, creating problems that nearly led to the closure of the company (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). These events produced discussions among stakeholders (banks, manufacturers, and engineering firms), who studied the work of other companies (e.g. Smith Industries’s method for accurate, low-cost, high-security customer access to machines) to create an improved verification/security system (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). This suggests that although anticipation was lacking, innovators were reflexive and responsive in dealing with identified problems. In another example supporting responsiveness, we find deployment of features of the ATM delayed by about two years after various security issues had been identified through testing (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013). Further, it has been shown that slow adoption processes in the case of the ATM (Harper and Batiz-Lazo, 2013) allowed for mistakes to be corrected at a lesser cost to society. Defined as ‘an asset-backed security backed by a diversified pool of one or more classes of debt’ (Lucas et al., 2008: 395), CDOs were introduced in 1987 in the US (Stefani, 2010). They gained prominence in the twenty-first century, creating a new source of demand for lower-rated ‘tranches’ of securities (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011). Based on the logic that pooling many bonds together reduces investors’ exposure to the failure of any one bond, and that ‘tranching’ will enable investors to pick their preferred levels of risk and return (Lucas et al., 2008), this innovation involved a complex process of purchasing (of assets to invest in), pooling (to obtain diversification benefits), tranching (to identify their place in the cash-flow waterfall), and selling (to investors) (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011). Historically, CDOs were composed of asset pools mainly including bank loans, corporate bonds, and emergency bonds. In response to the 1998 liquidity crisis, the composition of asset pools was expanded to include different kinds of securities backed by assets from various sectors (e.g. mortgages, mobile home loans, aircraft leases, and mutual fund fees). In 2002, when these ‘multi-sector’ CDOs performed poorly, the composition of CDO asset pools was reformed, focusing mainly on non-prime, mortgage-backed securities. Innovators argued that CDO managers understood this industry well, and it seemed to have good performance in terms of returns. This was further narrowed to residential mortgage-backed securities and non-agency mortgages (among others), which offered relatively stable collateral but introduced a lot of complexity into the system (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011). There were five key players in the CDO innovation and governance process: securities firms, CDO managers, rating agencies, financial guarantors, and investors (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011). Securities firms, CDO managers, and financial guarantors participated in the development process by originating and underwriting CDOs, selecting collateral and managing portfolios, and providing protection against default, respectively. Meanwhile, rating agencies and audit companies performed oversight governance by providing basic guidelines on collateral content and CDO structure and signing prospectuses, respectively, to ensure that investors (who buy CDOs) are protected (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011). Nevertheless, rating agencies’ effectiveness in this governance role is considered poor (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011) because of conflicts of interest arising between these agencies and innovators (Mullard, 2012), as well as flaws in the rating models/methodologies used to assess risk and define rating guidelines (Griffin and Tang, 2011). In addition to self-regulation through rating agencies, there was some statutory regulation in the form of guidelines for calculating net capital reserves (to hold against securities portfolios) and the approval of documents (e.g. prospectuses) by various government institutions (e.g. the SEC). However, these occurred just before commercialisation with very little on-site examination (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011). A review of the financial crisis enquiry commission report on the CDO machine (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011) suggests that while some anticipation and reflection occurred in the CDO development process, the principles of deliberation and responsiveness were limited. Innovators of CDOs in the late 1990s did anticipate a high default risk (arising from selling low-investment-grade products) as a possible consequence of their innovation. However, the possibility of this leading to the collapse of an entire financial system (i.e. systemic risk) was overlooked. They argued that ‘if one security went bad, the second had only a very small chance of going bad at the same time’ (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011: 128). Anticipation processes were not acted upon, and reflection processes were not broadly constituted. The wider consequences of complex innovations cannot be sufficiently identified and evaluated by narrow reflection alone and require broad deliberation (within and beyond the financial sector). However, deliberation was limited to the five key stakeholders mentioned above, each of which took varying degrees of risk and for a time profited handsomely. Yet, discussions were skewed and did not effectively consider the complex, wider impacts of the innovation—especially on the public. Furthermore, the level of complexity involved in CDO construction made reflection and deliberation increasingly difficult, and in many cases management and boards of directors might have participated only passively in their development and commercialisation (Crouhy et al., 2008; Pol, 2009; Castellano et al., 2011). Unsurprisingly, institutional responsiveness was poor. This was compounded by the fast rate of CDO commercialisation (e.g. nearly $700 billion in CDOs were issued between 2003 and 2007) (Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, 2011).",12

It first appear in a paper written by Nakamoto (2008), this paper described Bitcoin as a pure peer-to-peer electronic cash, which achieves decentralization, anonymous and transparent. The genesis block was mined with a total number of 50 BTC in 2009. In May 2010, a Florida programmer use 10,000 BTC to purchase a pizza worth US$25, this is first Bitcoin transaction in real world. From 2011 to 2013, in only 3 years, Bitcoin price rise one hundred thousand times and goes above $1000 in Nov. 2013. The turn down start since one of the biggest Bitcoin company Mt. Gox’s bankruptcy, market start lose faith in Bitcoin and Bitcoin price suffer a big drop from then. But it seems that it will always return to its trend when the impact is over. In the year of 2016, Bitcoin’s price have changed significantly from $360 to $766.62 and still have chance to go higher at the end of this year (Fig. 1). No need to say how Bitcoin price changed since 2011 when it first came to people’s attention. This observation can lead to many questions worth to study on. Such as what influence Bitcoin price? What is the relationship between Bitcoin and other economy indicator? Is there any connection between Bitcoin price and stock market index? All these questions are remain unsolved. Bitcoin price in exchange of CNY and US dollar Until today, only a few country explicitly allowed Bitcoin’s use and trade, most country have difficulties to classify Bitcoin, and some country, such as China have banned the use of Bitcoin. Although most countries in the world holds different policy against Bitcoin, it certainly did not slow down Bitcoin’s development. We can see this from the Fig. 1, Bitcoin price has the same tendency in exchange of CNY and UD dollar. However, as Bitcoin booming in the market, there is still lack of a definition in the academic world to clarify whether Bitcoin is a currency or simply an investment. Most scholar support that Bitcion is only a commodity at this point, a few have the faith that it will become a real currency eventually. Šurda (2014) holds the opinion that the trust between economy participants make sure the Bitcoin system run smoothly, however, Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, it’s value only depends on market strength and the belief from users. From that point of view, Bitcoin is a commodity rather than a currency. Yermack (2013) holds the same opinion, which is Bitcoin appears to behave more like a speculative investment than a currency. In his paper he point out that, on the one hand, Bitcion’s exchange rate has no relativity to the main currencies in the world, makes it’s hard for Bitcoin holders to make risk management and to hedge to other currency. On the other hand, Bitcoin make it’s hard to count in banking system with deposit insurance. Bergstra and Weijland (2014) consider Bitcoin as a Money-like Informational Commodity (MLIC). Chinese scholar Jia (2013) analyses that Bitcoin can provide a majority function as a currency, but not yet a real currency. Wu and Pandey (2014) analysis the value of Bitcoin in enhancing the efficiency of an investor’s portfolio, they suggest that Bitcoin may be less useful as a currency; it can enhance the efficiency of an investor’s portfolio. “What we want from a monetary system isn’t to make people holding money rich; we want it to facilitate transactions and make the economy as a whole rich.” Paul R. Krugman (2011) said. He refer Bitcoin as “Golden block chain”, but he also concerned that, fixed supply will push Bitcoin price to a higher place, causing hoarding, deflation and economic depression. Therefore, analyses how Bitcoin price influenced by economic factors can be very helpful to understanding Bitcoin better. In this paper, we decide to analysis what factors influence Bitcoin price. People always compare Bitcoin to Gold as they both have limited number and can used as a purchase method. We choose some factors which may influence gold price and add gold price in our model so that we could analysis whether gold price have influence on Bitcoin’s price. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Related work section briefly explains the key aspects of Bitcoin necessary in the course of this paper and additionally sums up related work. Methods section describes our methodology and data when analyzing Bitcoin’s prices. In Empirical analysis section is empirical analysis using VEC model. In Analysis on the influence factors of Bitcoin’s price section we present and discuss our results and gives some hints for future research.",55

Therefore, it is widely argued that the behavior of a stock market mostly depends on the economic performance and political environment of the country. The smooth performance of the stock market is relatively important for developed and emerging economies. Oil is an important source of energy that is important for maintaining smooth economic performance of industries that depend on oil or oil products. Oil is required for the economic performance of emerging economies, including Pakistan. Pakistan’s domestic production of oil is relatively lower than its consumption, and therefore, the country relies heavily on oil imports. The economy produces at most 15% of its total consumption. Figure 1 represents the domestic production and total consumption of the economy. A visual examination of Fig. 1 clearly shows that the economy produces a relatively small proportion of total consumption. Oil Production and Consumption (Thousand Barrels) Recent oil price fluctuations have led us to revisit and re-examine the effect of the oil price and its shocks on Pakistan’s stock market behavior. As discussed earlier in the introduction, Pakistan, as an emerging economy, relies heavily on oil imports. Therefore, any oil price fluctuation negatively (positively) affects stock market performance. Because a higher (lower) oil price represents higher (lower) input costs, oil price changes are likely to directly affect the earnings of an organization. Furthermore, any increase (decrease) in the oil price would result in an increase (decrease) in inflation. Therefore, this study attempts to revisit the effects of oil price fluctuation on the stock market of Pakistan before and after the 2007 Asian financial crisis period. There are many reasons for examining the effect of oil price changes on the stock market of Pakistan. First, the literature indicates both positive and negative effects of oil price fluctuations on stock markets and this study attempts to reveal for policy makers whether the effects are positive or negative. Second, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the association of the stock market and oil price in Pakistan by considering periods before and after the 2007 financial crisis period. The use of these two sub-periods provides valuable insights into the effect of the oil price on the stock market of Pakistan. Third, this study applies several econometric techniques to study the association between the oil price and the equity market, there by providing more robust results than would otherwise have been achieved. Finally, this study adds valuable knowledge about an emerging economy that is also an oil importer. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related studies. Section 3 presents the many econometric techniques used in this study. Section 4 discusses the results. Finally, Section 5 concludes.",21

About 42.3% of employment and near about 19.5% of the GDP were generated by this sector (GOP 2017a; Rehman et al. 2015). Agricultural credit is an essential element of agricultural growth in the developing countries. It is a temporary substitute for personal saving by accelerating technological change by stimulating smallholder productivity, asset formation, food security and the subsequent rural agricultural income to stimulate agricultural production (Kimuyu and Omiti 2000). The World Bank has also promoted agricultural credit through its private finance department and other banks such as the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Small-scale peasant farmers must be provided formal funding if they are able to generate a marketable surplus that can contribute to the development process (WB 2008). Different studies have been done regarding agricultural credit in the Pakistan and its impact on agricultural growth as well as for the economic growth. The access of agricultural credit has a vital role for smallholder farmers in the Pakistan, furthermore, Rehman et al. (2017a) study on fertilizers consumption, water availability and credit distribution results revealed that the credit distribution had a positive influence to agricultural production in the Pakistan. Similarly, Saqib et al. (2016) study results show that the small-scale farmers have limited access to the agricultural credit as compared to the medium and large-scale farmers. The limited access to agricultural credit has been identified as a major constraint on the agricultural development of smallholder farmers in many developing countries (Chandio et al., 2016a; Dercon and Christiaensen 2011; Guirkinger and Boucher 2008; Karlan et al. 2014; Keramati et al. 2016; Rehman et al., 2017b). Smallholder farmers, that consider the important sectorial drivers, have low access to the credit, one of the key constraints. A research study in the key areas conducted in Kenya shows that low credit access is one of the main constraints highlighted to improve access, increase productivity and overcome rural poverty (RoK 2006). The chances for small farmers to increase their output and eventually improve their income that depend largely on their access to credit and their ability to make effective use of credit (Chandio et al. 2017c; Mahmood et al. 2009; Siddiqi and Baluch 2009). In recognition of this, the government of developing countries provide subsidized credit to the small farmers (Ellis 1992). Hussein and Ohlmer (2008) study revealed that where individuals are subject to credit constraints, individuals cannot take advantage of their own credit and thirst for the relevant market conditions at the moment. Market imperfections, institutions, and individuals or family-related factors may limit access to credit markets. Inefficiencies or imperfections in credit markets in developing countries are often caused by government interest ceilings, monopoly power, large transaction costs and moral hazard (Bell et al. 1997; Li et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2016). Access and utilization of the agricultural credit are therefore considered as an important means of increasing agricultural production and improving rural livelihoods (Gatti and Love 2008; Shimamura and Lastarria-Cornhiel 2010). At the macro level, limited credit has been identified as a major constraint preventing people from getting out of poverty (Kumar et al. 2013). Several studies have found that the bulk of agricultural credit is used for the non-agricultural purposes, including the purchase of consumer goods and celebration of festivals (Muhumuza 1997; Siddiqi and Baluch 2009). The production and development loans provided by the financial institution are important for the growth and development of agriculture sector (Chandio et al. 2017d). Production loans are used to purchase seeds, chemical fertilizers, insecticides, water charges, labor, animal feeds, and medicines. Similarly, development loans are used to purchase agricultural equipment such as tractors, threshers, trolleys, cutting machine adhesives, spray machinery and pipe-handling equipment. In this regard, the agricultural output of small-scale farmers is very low, their land size is small and also their capital investment is small. Consequently the role of agricultural credit is crucial for the agricultural development (Chandio et al. 2016b; Chandio et al., 2017e; Fayaz et al. 2006). Simon (2013) research suggested that, among other things, the age and sex of family heads of households and the size of their families are the main determinants of rural credit usage in the Zimbabwe. Similarly, Amjad and Hasnu (2007) analyzed the use of rural credit by small farmers in Pakistan and found that household labor and the literacy of heads of household are affecting the use of credit by farmers one of the factors. Credit swaps have been explored by some research institutes. For instance, credit is spent on consumption and festivals, education and healthcare, and repayments of loans (Akram and Hussain 2008; Hussain and Thapa 2016). Nosiru (2010) and Enimu et al. (2017) research showed that in Nigeria microfinance was provided to support farmers’ investment in purchasing more agricultural inputs to enhance their agricultural productivity. The findings revealed that the microcredit has negative effect on agricultural productivity. This was due to the utilization of microcredit in other necessities. In various parts of the world, an ample of empirical literature regarding smallholders access to formal credit and its effect on agricultural productivity and as well as the livelihood of smallholders has discussed. To study agricultural credit fungibility issues and utilization of credit in agriculture sector limited empirical literature is available in Pakistan, particularly in Sindh. Small, medium and large-scale farmers were acquired agricultural credit from both formal financial institutions and informal financial channels in the study area. The main objective of this study was to examine agricultural credit investment in the agricultural sector and credit fungibility which is known as the utilization of agricultural credit in the non-agricultural sector.",16

Woahid Murad,Mohammad Amzad Hossain,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The inspection of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) has been one of the most controversial topics in the last few decades in international economics (Rogoff 1996 and Taylor and Taylor 2004). PPP theory is used to balance the comparative value of currencies by estimating the adjustment and required for the exchange rate to correspond to countries’ purchasing power. The literature examining this hypothesis is extensive. Froot and Rogoff (1995), Taylor and Sarno (1998), O’Connell (1998), Anker (1999), and Breitung and Candelon (2005) have presented the theoretical background and empirical evidence of the PPP-real exchange rates relationship. Froot and Rogoff (1995) found that the real exchange rate is stationary over sufficiently long horizons. According to Froot and Rogoff (1995), the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis can be considered as an alternative model. Taylor and Sarno (1998), found that the real exchange rates among the G5 are CPI-adjusted, which means that the exchange rates are apparently mean reverting over the floating rate period. O’Connell (1998) and Anker (1999) emphasized controlling the cross-sectional dependence in case of investigating the random walk effect of the panel data of real exchange rates. Breitung and Candelon (2005) considered structural breaks and found that the PPP hypothesis holds in the Asian countries, which experienced a flexible exchange rate; on the contrary, the South and Latin American currencies, which are in the pegged regime for a long time, do not hold the PPP hypothesis. The panel unit root test has been used extensively in recent times to observe the unit root of real exchange rates. For instance, Fleissig and Strauss (2000), Engel (2000), Wu and Wu (2001), and Sarno and Taylor (2002) found that real exchange rates follow a stationary process. Murad (2016) used first-generation and second-generation panel unit root tests and found that the exchange rate of the Bangladeshi taka is mean-reverting. Banerjee (1999), Baltagi and Kao (2000), and Pedroni (2000, 2001) advocated the panel cointegration framework to draw econometrically rigorous conclusions. Very few papers have explored PPP in the context of data on Asian exchange rates thus far. Kim et al. 2009 expressed concerns over the PPP assumption in Southeast Asian countries. Investigations of the nonlinear PPP relationship using Southeast Asian data were conducted by Aggarwal et al. (2000), Zurbruegg and Allsopp (2004), and Wu et al. (2004). Their findings show that the unit root null rejection speed is larger in the case of a structural break investigation. Aggarwal et al. (2000) found that the relationship between exchange rate and price levels of two nations were stronger when the Japanese yen was considered as a numeraire compared to other reference currencies. Zurbruegg and Allsopp (2004) found that the exchange rates of Hong Kong, Singapore, Philippines, South Korea, Japan, and Malaysia, converged to the long-run PPP. They advocated that the PPP hypothesis may be investigated further in the contexts of Indonesia and Thailand. Wu et al. (2004) used monthly data and found that real exchange rates among Pacific Basin countries are mean reverting. Unlike the results obtained from the monthly data, the authors obtained mixed results while considering quarterly data. They rejected the unit-root hypothesis that real exchange rates are nonstationary only in Thailand, the Philippines, and South Korea out of eight countries, namely, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea, based on the Zivot-Andrews statistic. Applying the unit root test developed by Kapetanios et al. (2003) for a nonlinear Exponential Smooth Transition Auto-Regression (ESTAR) stationary alternative to 11 Asian real exchange rates, Liew et al. (2004) found the PPP relationship. When the US dollar was the numeraire currency, they found that two-thirds of the real exchange rates of Southeast Asian currencies were consistent with nonlinear stationary processes. On the contrary, when Japanese yen was considered as a numeraire currency, 60% of the real exchange rates are mean reverting. According to their findings, price levels in Asian countries adjust more quickly to the US price level than the Japanese price level. Choudhry (2005) found that the Generalized Purchasing Power Parity (G-PPP) held in the ASEAN 4 countries (Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines). On the other hand, Ogawa and Kawasaki (2006) found the facts of the G-PPP relationship in the case of the ASEAN 5 countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand), as well as China and Korea. Ahn et al. (2006) also identified the continuation of the G-PPP in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, as well as the four Northeast Asian Economies of Taiwan, Korea, Hong Kong, and Japan. Chang et al. (2012) applied a simple and powerful nonlinear unit root test and found that PPP only holds for Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand out of eight ASEAN countries, namely, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam and the adjustment toward PPP was nonlinear and asymmetric. Ma et al. (2017) developed some empirical tests for the PPP hypothesis in East Asian countries by incorporating the quintile unit root and quintile cointegrating regression method. They found that the PPP hypothesis holds in China, Japan, and South Korea. Chen and Hu (2018) considered a sample of 178 countries covering the period from 2000 to 2013 and found that the consumer price index (CPI) and PPP are positively correlated. They also found that the PPP has an exchange rate pass-through effect on the price level. Ha (2018) examined the validity of the PPP hypothesis by analyzing panel data of nine countries in Southeast Asia, namely Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and the Philippines between January 1995 and February 2017, in terms of the US Dollar and Japanese Yen. The absolute PPP was rejected by the panel unit root test for Southeast Asian countries. However, when Ha (2018) incorporated the panel unit root test considering structural breaks in the data, he found that the PPP theory seemed to hold over the period from July 1997 to August 2008, that is, after the Asian financial crisis ended in 1997 and before the global financial crisis began in 2008. Most prior studies on the PPP theory concentrated on ASEAN economies employed time series econometric techniques. The drawback of such techniques is that they have limited power against the alternative hypothesis, with a highly persistent deviation from equilibrium. Thus, there is the possibility that it may mislead policy initiatives. Although some papers have incorporated first-generation panel data approaches, such techniques do not work well in the presence of cross-sectional dependence. Many prior studies, for instances, Baharumshah and Ariff (1997), Wu and Chen (1999), have failed to reject the null hypothesis of no-cointegration even in cases where cointegration was strongly suggested by theory. The reason is that most residual-based cointegration tests, both in pure time-series and in panels, require the long-run parameters for the variables in their levels to be equal to the short-run parameters for the variables in their differences. This failure can cause a significant loss of power for residual-based cointegration tests. On the contrary, Westerlund (2007) developed four new panel cointegration tests based on structural, rather than residual, dynamics. Therefore, these tests do not impose any common-factor restriction. We did not find any study on PPP theory in the context of the ASEAN member countries that relied on such second-generation panel cointegration tests. Therefore, this paper attempts to investigate the validity of the PPP theory in the context of ASEAN economies using second-generation panel data approaches. Since the PPP theory does not work well in a short span of time, we consider all the member countries of the ASEAN in this paper (Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) and use annual data from 1973 to 2015. The data were obtained from the World Development Indicators (WDI) published by the World Bank and the International Financial Statistics (IFS) CD-ROM published by the International Monetary Fund. In the next section, we develop and present a model of the PPP theory. The third section presents the sources of data and the methodologies used in this study. The empirical results are presented in the subsequent section and finally, the fifth section offers concluding remarks.",5

It is rather more practical and reliable in view of the large number of investors who participate in the stock market and take decisions over different time periods. Basically, stock market participants are a diverse group comprising intraday traders, hedging strategists, portfolio managers, financial and non-financial institutions and so on. It is notable that these market participants operate on different time scales depending upon their requirements and thus the true dynamic structure of the relationship between variables might vary over different time scales. The purpose of this paper is to address one of such issues related to Capital Asset Pricing Model which makes its inferences on efficient markets and believes that economic agents are entities that act according to the rational expectation strategy. The model builds on Markowitz (1952, 1959) mean variance portfolio theory and conveys the notion that securities are priced such that the expected returns will compensate investors for the expected risks. The CAPM presumes investors to be utility maximising agents and allows predicting the return of an asset for its given level of systematic risk measured through beta coefficient. However, very often evidence showed the inability of the CAPM to identify the true beta that would allow investors to price risky securities in order to determine the desirability of an investment. One of the reasons of the incapability of the CAPM is because the model is based on the assumptions which appear to be unrealistic in real market world. For instance, one of such assumptions is about investor homogeneity. The main characteristic of this paradigm is the representative agent, i.e., the investors are homogeneous about their preferences, their expectations and their investment strategies. However, the differences in planning horizons, frequency of trading or institutional constraints are neglected. While Fama (1965) and Levhari and Levy (1977) profoundly criticized the homogenous assumption of the model, the work of M. Levy and Levy (1996) showed that homogeneous expectation assumption could lead to a highly inefficient market with periodic and predictable booms and crashes. Long-back, the veteran economist Keynes (1930) also argued that agents do not have sufficient knowledge of the structure of the economy to form correct mathematical expectations that would be held by all agents. Of late Muller et al. (1997) emphasized that the formation of markets is based on multiple layers of investment horizons or time scales ranging from seconds to years and hence market participants cannot be a single homogeneous group of investors. Thus, under the homogenous expectations assumption, the CAPM model fails to recognize diverse kinds of traders seeking investment betas for different time horizons. For instance, there are traders who take a very long view for the investment and consequently concentrate on what is termed as ‘market fundamentals’. These traders ignore ephemeral phenomena. In contrast, other traders trade on a much shorter time-scale and as such are interested in temporary deviations of the market. And yet other traders may operate in the market for which even a day is long time. Each of these classes of traders analyses their own trading with their own perception of yardstick, consistent with their trading horizons. Miller (1977) proposes a direct relationship between a stocks risk and its divergence of opinion. He argues that “in practice, uncertainty, divergence of opinion about a security’s return, and risk go together”. Consequently, he proposes that “the riskiest stocks are also those about which there is the greatest divergence of opinion”. An early empirical study by Bart and Masse (1981) supports Miller’s proposition. Therefore, if CAPM homogeneity assumption must be true, then all investors are supposed to experience the same degree of systematic risk measured by its ‘beta’ for their investments. But this is not the case as CAPM was criticized mainly based on time varying beta. However, such conclusions were direct reflections of time domain analysis where the evolution of individual variables were examined and assessed over time. This was apparent because traditionally it was impossible to look simultaneously at the same dynamic system through time and frequency domains. In other words, the time and frequency domains were not interchangeable, i.e., information was bound to be lost in changing return series from one domain to another. To deal with such issues, the adaptations of econometric techniques in financial analysis were not able to visualize financial markets as complicated dynamic systems to address the heterogeneous behavior of investors who operate at different time and frequency resolutions. For example, researchers while addressing the interval effect of beta use conventional time decomposition scales like daily, weekly, monthly or annually. However, under such circumstances, when the return interval is changed from daily to weekly and so on, the number of sample points would decrease which obviously amounts in the loss of information. This was one of the fundamental reasons as why physicists have been lured into financial markets to bring new theories to study the chaos of the markets and to model the price of complex derivatives without losing information in terms of data. The example of losing sample points in the conventional data decomposition is illustrated diagrammatically later in this paper. Wavelets possess many desirable properties, some of which are useful in economics and finance. It can enable the finance or economics researcher to separate out a return series into its constituent multi-resolution components to discover the complex market behavior. Additionally, wavelets can deal with both stationary and non-stationary data. Thus, the main purpose of the paper is to repeat the conventional beta time varying analysis in simultaneous time frequency oscillations by using the insights from wavelets to improve the specification and estimation of asset pricing models that incorporate this risk dynamics. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Review Literature section provides an insight of the related empirical literature. Multiscale Model Specification section discusses about the methodological aspect in terms of wavelets. Data Description and Empirical Results section demonstrates the data and findings of the study. We conclude in the final section.",4

But in reality, most of the time individuals follow the other’s decisions without any reason (Easley and Kleinberg 2012). So, when individuals imitate others in most of their decisions by bypassing their own judgment or decision, then how can all individuals claim to be rational. Herding is one of the important behavior of human being which explain the deviation of human being from the rational decision making by following others. Malkiel and Fama (1970) claim that financial markets are efficient and security prices fully reflect all available information at any time; and investors are rational in these efficient markets. But reality is somewhat different and investor’s decisions are governed by their emotions and individual behaves irrationally (Shiller 2003) because their decisions are effected by their emotions. Kahneman and Tversky (1979) argue that human psychology is important to understand the financial markets. Individuals behave irrationally due to herd behavior in financial markets. There are several effects of herd behavior on financial markets. Olsen (1996) argue that it’s difficult to forecast in presence of herding behavior, as stock prices do not reflect their fundamental values in presence of herding behavior. This deviation of prices from fundamental values reflects the inefficiency of the markets. This study examines the herding behavior with respect to three aspects, which are discussed below one by one. First, this study examines the herding during different market conditions, e.g. rising (up) and falling (down) market, High and low trading volume as well as high and low market volatility. This study uses the two regression models of (Christie and Huang 1995) and (Chang et al. 2000) for herding estimations. Extreme herding results in mispricing and this phenomena ultimately leads to financial crisis (Hwang and Salmon 2004). So, pre-crisis herding leads towards crisis. Second, this study examines the herding behavior during Month of Ramadan. Emotions and mood of individual play a crucial role in investor’s behavior (Loewenstein et al. 2001) and mood of individual is also shaped by religious occasions. Wright and Bower (1992) argue that investors can become more optimistic and also willing to take riskier investment decisions in positive mood state. In literature, social mood is gauged by the weather (Saunders 1993), belief related to Friday 13th (Dowling and Lucey 2005) and biorhythms (Kamstra et al. 2003). Some studies has examined the effect of religion on the mood and behavior of individuals; Frieder and Subrahmanyam (2004) studied the effect of Jewish High Holidays on US dollar volume and stock returns. Positive stock returns are observed during these holidays. Pantzalis and Ucar (2014) find that behavior of investors in US is significantly affected during Easter week holidays. While many studies have investigated the stock returns in Muslim Countries; and identified the “positive mood effects of Ramadan” on investor’s behavior (Al-Hajieh et al. 2011; Al-Khazali 2014). These studies find that stock returns are higher during Ramadan as compare to non-Ramadan days. Motivated by this evidence, this study examines the presence of herding behavior during Ramadan days in stock market of Pakistan. Third, this study examines the herding behavior during crisis period. Christie and Huang (1995) suggest that herding intensity rises during the times of market stress. Uncertainty regarding value of asset can increase during financial crisis and ultimately investors show herd behavior. Chiang and Zheng (2010) find that herding increases during financial crisis. Fourth, this study also detects herding during crisis period. So, herding behavior can be different in crisis and non-crisis time period. Motivated by the evidence, this study examines the herding behavior during global financial crisis of 2008. Overall, this study examines herding in the Pakistani Stock Exchange under different market conditions, focusing on the Ramadan effect and Crisis period. Our findings also provide insight into foreign and local investors while taking investment decision in different market conditions. Findings will also provide important insights to the regulators of the equity market of Pakistan for stability of market during a period of crisis. Furthermore, this study will also add literature to the area of “Religion and Finance”. The stock market of Pakistan has provided very high returns to investors as compared to Indian and Chinese equity markets in 2016 (Mourdoukoutas 2016). In 2016, the market was declared as the best performing stock market in Asia, according to a basket of 26 peers tracked by Bloomberg (Kim and Mangi 2016). MSCI Incorporation reclassify Pakistan as part of its benchmark emerging-market index from May 2016 (Nauman 2016). The standard deviation of stock market returns is also high, so volatility of market is high as compare many other Asian Markets (Hamid et al. 2017). So, it’s important for the foreign and local investors to become familiar with the behavior of investors especially herd behavior during Ramadan and crisis time period in stock market of Pakistan. To fulfill the objective of the study, the rest of the research paper is divided into sections. In Section (Literature review), this study provides the comprehensive review of literature. In Section (Research methodology), this study presents the research methodology of the study and this section has further divided into two subsections. Data description is presented in subsection (Data description) and model of study is presented in Subsection Model. In Section (Empirical Results), this study provides the empirical results of the study and this section further divided into two subsections. Summary statistics is presented in Subsection (Summary Statistics) and regression analysis is demonstrated into Subsection (Regression Results). In chapter 5, this study provides the conclusions of the study. In section 6, this study presents the references of the study.",40

One of the primary objectives of a firm’s financial policy is to maintain its financial flexibility. An effective financial policy does not only ensure funds for the present but also for the future investments. The value of financial flexibility further increases when financial markets suffer from frictions and financing restrictions compel firms to pass up some profitable investment opportunities due to unavailability of capital (Graham & Harvey (2001)). The previous empirical research on firms’ capital structure decisions also provided evidence that financially constrained firms are expected to get less funds in periods when financing costs are higher (Faulkender & Petersen (2006), Hubbard (1998), Fazzari et al. (1988), and Carpenter & Petersen (2002)). According to the pecking order theory, asymmetric information costs play an important role in determining the capital structure choice of firms. Therefore, financially unconstrained firms are likely to depend less on internal funds than their financially constrained peers (Myers & Majluf (1984)). Further, owing to information asymmetries, firms prefer debt to equity financing when go for external funds and issue equity only as a last resort. Since information asymmetry increases the external financing cost and since financially constrained firms suffer more from information asymmetries, their external financing should more strongly negatively relate to cash flows. Thus, for a given level of investment, profitable financially constrained firms require less external capital to finance their investments, and therefore, they are less likely to tap the external capital markets. However, one should note that this argument assumes that a firm determines its level of investment before determining the optimal amount of debt and equity to issue (Myers (1984)). Several recent studies such as Almeida & Campello (2010) and Gracia & Mira (2014) have documented strong evidence on the role of financial frictions in determining the relationship between internally generated funds (cash flows) and the funds obtained from the external capital markets. These studies have explained that information asymmetries have an important role to play in deciding the capital structure of corporate firms. Doing empirical analysis for developed countries, they have provided strong evidence on the negative association between cash flows and external financing. Yet, they show that this negative relationship is relatively stronger for financially constrained firms. The more negative and statistically significant relationship between internal funds and external financing for financially constrained firms implies that financially constrained firms’ investing decisions are determined endogenously and strongly depend on internally generated funds. On the other hand, the investment decisions of financially unconstrained firms might be mainly determined exogenously, showing no significant dependence on cash flows. Although information asymmetry is expected to play a significant role in formulating the linkages between internal funds and external financing, it is not the whole story. As stated by Almeida & Campello (2010), financially constrained firms are more reliant on internally generated funds while making investment decisions. On the flip side, financially unconstrained firms are generally free to make decisions regarding investment. Said differently, investment is exogenous for unconstrained firms. Thus, Almeida and Campello stated that in case of financially constrained firms, the endogeneity of investment is the fundamental cause for the negative sensitivity of external funds to cash flows. However, it should be noted that the standard pecking order theory of capital structure does not take into account any possibility that firm investment may become endogenous when firms face credit constraints. There is also an intense debate on the role of credit multiplier in establishing the external financing – cash flows relationship. The credit multiplier is considered as an additional instrument, which makes the relationship between cash flows and external funds less negative. Financially constrained firms suffer more from adverse selection costs than the financially unconstrained firms do. Therefore, creditors require more loan guarantees, mainly in terms of pledging tangible assets, in order to save their contracts while lending to financially constrained firms. Thus, financially constrained firms are likely to invest excess of their internal funds in tangible assets such as plant, property, and equipment. Possession of more tangible assets makes easy for financially constrained firms to acquire external funds. Several previous studies including Campello & Hackbarth (2012), Almeida & Campello (2007), Bernanke et al. (1996), and Kiyotaki & Moore (1997) have suggested that the tangibility of assets increases the capability of financially constrained firms to seek new funds. Almeida & Campello (2007) provided evidence that firms increase their tangible assets when they are in periods of positive income shocks which in turn increase firms’ capacity for new credit and as a result more tangible assets and so on. Almeida & Campello (2010) and Gracia & Mira (2014) demonstrated that financially constrained firms are more sensitive to increase the holdings of tangible assets. Therefore, the credit multiplier effect is expected to be more prominent in case of financially constrained firms than for unconstrained firms. Previous empirical research on the link between cash flows and external financing is scant. The most of the previous existing studies such as Almeida & Campello (2010), Gracia & Mira (2014), and Schoubben & Van Hulle (2011) have explored the issue for developed countries only. However, when we review the literature for developing countries, we observe that researchers have not paid considerable attention on the external financing-cash flows relationship. Rather, most of the previous studies in emerging and developing countries have focused on exploring the capital structure determinants. With reference to Pakistan, the literature is also silent on the issue how firms’ make external financing decisions when they face financial constrains. Yet, in developing countries, like Pakistan, firms probably face higher financial constrains, as financial markets in these countries are more likely to experience the financial frictions. The prevalence of financial market frictions due to under developed financial system and capital market and unfavorable banking sector policies for corporate firms significantly increase adjustment costs, which, in turn, considerably affect the external financing choices of firms. Furthermore, such market conditions are expected to have a significant impact on the relationship between cash flow and firms’ external financing decisions. Therefore, to get a complete understanding of how financial constrains affect the substitution between internal and external funds, it would be worthwhile to get empirical evidence on this issue from emerging and developing countries. Another gap in the literature is that there is little empirical evidence on the role of credit multiplier in external financing decision for developing countries. However, there are numerous studies in developed countries regarding the role of credit multiplier effect on the external financing-cash flow relationship (Almeida & Campello (2007), Bernanke et al. (1996), and Kiyotaki & Moore (1997)). These studies concluded that in case of financially constrained firms, credit multiplier plays an important role in getting new external funds. In developing countries, there are more financial frictions and uncertainty and therefore, creditors require more securities/collateral for their loans. In this context, empirical evidence on the impact of credit multiplier for emerging and developing countries would really help firm managers to understand the role of tangible assets in mitigating the impact of financial constraints. Pakistan provides a good setting for testing these both issues. In Pakistan, financial markets suffer highly from financial frictions, as economic, financial, and political uncertainty is showing a hiking trend due to energy crisis, political unrest, and ongoing long lasting fight against terrorism. Given all these, firms operating in Pakistan not only face higher credit constraints, suffer more from information asymmetries, and pay more costs for external funds but also have to provide more collaterals to seek funds from external capital markets. In this context, the role of financial frictions and the credit multiplier in establishing the linkages between cash flows and external financing would be worth exploring. This paper using a large panel of Pakistani non-financial firms over the period 2000–2013 examines the role of financial constraints in establishing the relationship between cash flows and external financing. The paper also investigates the credit multiplier effect for financially constrained and unconstrained firms. We use three different measures namely Kaplan and Zingales index (hereafter KZ index), the debt to asset ratio, and the interest coverage ratio to classify the firm-year observations into financially constrained and unconstrained. Our results indicate that the external financing decisions of firms are negatively, significantly related to internal funds availability. The finding of the substitutionary relation between internal funds availability and external financing has been viewed as evidence supporting the pecking order theory of capital structure. However, the results reveal that this negative external financing – cash flow sensitivity is less for financially constrained firms. This finding has been inferred as evidence suggesting the interdependence of external financing and investment decisions of financially constrained firms. We also find that for financially unconstrained firms, the negative sensitively of external financing increases with tangibility. On the other end of the continuum, for financially constrained firms, the negative sensitivity of external financing to cash flow either decreases or at least turns positive as the tangibility of assets increases. The greater complementarity between external financing and cash flow for those financially constrained firms that have higher tangible assets implies that these firms benefit more from investing in tangible assets because such assets not only help relax financial constraints but also having a potential to be a direct source of funds, particularly in periods of negative cash flow shocks. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section “Literature Review” presents the literature review. Section “Data and Methodology” describes the data and the empirical methodology applied to carry out the empirical analysis. Section “Empirical Results” presents our main empirical results. Finally, Section “Conclusions” concludes.",9

An alternative perspective on the current hype,December 2018,Daniel Gersten Reiss,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Current discourse about money mainly focuses on its supply in a digital format. The wide access to technological products and the introduction of bitcoin triggered recent hype, which suggests that a disruptive transformation in financial markets and systems is imminent. However, corresponding discussions surrounding electronic money (e-money), virtual currencies, digital financial services, and mobile wallets topics commonly overlap with the discussion of the digitalization of money. Policymakers and regulators have invested considerable effort in dealing with these mixed perspectives on the digitalization of money and catching up with market trends. In addition to hosting discussions at the national level, international bodies have undertaken several initiatives to explore these topics (CPMI 2015; CPMI 2017; IOSCO 2017; Pearlman 2017). Building on the existing literature, we analyze current perceptions of the digitalization of paper money and posit that, despite the recent hype, this digitalization is a long-term, ongoing process.",8

Currently, microfinance institutions (MFIs) are diffusing all over the world but at the same time it is rapidly changing with new innovative opportunities (Moro Visconti, 2011; Hartarska, 2005). From the last decade, microfinance institutions began to appear as more commercial and this commercialization is growing at a speedy rate (Silva and Chavez, 2015). The commercial banks in advanced and developing economies play an evolving role in funding MFIs. In Pakistan few private commercial banks have transformed into MFIs. However, in other countries like Nepal, Thailand and Malaysia there are several projects for transforming commercial banks into MFIs (Dokulilova, 2009; Janda et al., 2014; Krauss, 2011). The technological advancement of microfinance has also extended the conventional services of MFIs. The microfinance institutions conventionally focus on microcredit, specifically small loans to the poor (O’Donohoe, 2009). At present there is a significant shift of microcredit institutes into MFIs offering innovative customized services (Chowdry, 2011; Moro Visconti, 2011). This broader term reveals the fact that microfinance is not only focused to provide loans but it is also dedicated to update its services in terms of latest technology (Silva and Chavez, 2015). Furthermore, latest banking expertise like ATMs, online banking services, internet and charge cards have started to join the microfinance sector, assisting the investors and enhancing banking services (Havemann, 2009). The funding condition of MFIs has also started to transform quickly. Conventionally, MFIs were mainly supported by public and private donors or aid institutes (Aemiro and Mekonnen, 2012). Currently, international commercial banks and donors have become more interested in financing MFIs that are offering innovative services to their customers. The first example of MFI with commercial capitalization was the establishment of an investment fund known as Profound and it raised 23 million dollars to finance MFIs operating in Latin America (CGAP, 2007). In the present era, technical and social innovation exerts a deep impact on microfinance institutions and it also contributes in reshaping their business model (Moro Visconti, 2011). For mitigating risk factors in microfinance institutions, innovation works as an opportunity in view of its persistent impact on the investment risk factors (Aemiro and Mekonnen, 2012). MFIs are considered as an effective and innovative measure of poverty alleviation as it provides various financial services to poor borrowers who require a small amount of money to finance their micro-businesses (Kneiding, 2009). Therefore, microfinance can be recognized as a tool of economic innovation with a goal to combat poverty. At present thousands of microfinance institutions (MFIs) are operating with ranging from self-help groups to established commercial banks providing various financial services to millions of microbusinesses (Dokulilova, 2009). These MFIs are supported by not only the donor agencies, but also by many philanthropists, investors, network organizations, lenders, management consulting firms, and many other specialized businesses and all these organizations collectively form the flourishing global microfinance industry (Gonzalez, 2011; Wagner, 2013). Microfinance has developed as an essential tool for poverty alleviation from the past two decades and its idea was first launched in 1970 when Dr. Yunus of Grameen Bank (Nobel laureate) started interest free micro loans to poor people (Karanshawy, 2007). At present, a huge number of institutes are providing microfinance services in South Asia including a huge number of Non- Governmental Organization, Microfinance Banks, Rural Support Programs, Non- Banking Financial Institutions and others (Pakistan Microfinance Network, 2014). A research by Chowdry (2011) explained that MFIs are the best proven channel of credit delivery to the small and medium households of economy but due to the global financial crunch not only the financial sector but also the MFIs of South Asia went through a very harsh period. The economy of South Asia showed an impressive growth during the first half of 2000s (Khawaja & Ghani, 2012). But in 2008 the world economy confronted its most dangerous catastrophe since the Great Depression of the 1930s (O’Donohoe, 2009). The crunch began in 2007, when in the United States sky-high home prices finally turned resolutely downward, spread rapidly, initially it effected entire financial sector of U.S. and then it reached financial markets overseas (Olson and Zoubi, 2016). However, the South Asian economy faced greater inflationary pressure in the crunch period with an increase in food prices, severe power shortage and a slowdown in the services and manufacturing sector. Ultimately, the microfinance sector also faced a shock in its balance sheet as on the liability side, all types of donors were badly influenced due to a sudden drop in liquidity and on the assets side, due to the worsening of macroeconomic conditions the loan delinquency and write offs also began to increase (Badiola, 2009). The crunch and recession also affected the poverty reduction goals of developing countries in South Asia as the crunch lead to rising unemployment and collapsing of financial institutions made it more difficult to tackle as compare to the past recession of 1980s (Littlefield, 2009). This paper examines the moderating role of country’s political practices on the impact of global financial crunch on the performance of financially innovative South Asian MFIs by using fixed effect panel data regression method. Previous research studies have not attempted so far to analyze such issue; rather they were more focused to investigate efficiency of MFIs by comparing their internal costs, interest rates, and profitability (Rosenberg, Gonzalez and Sushma, 2009) or determining the effect of macroeconomic factors on microfinance performance (Ahlin, Lin and Maio, 2011).",17
4.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,21 June 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-018-0096-y,Does financial depth impact economic growth in North Cyprus?,December 2018,Turgut Türsoy,Faisal Faisal,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"North CyprusFootnote 1 is a small island economy. Over a period of 39 years, the banking sector in North Cyprus accumulated vast amount money in bank deposits. In the 1970’s the total deposits in the banks of North Cyprus amounted to approximately USD 100 million. Because North Cyprus does not have any international economic and political relations with other countries except Turkey, the total deposits which is representing the total deposits amount into the banking sector (public and private banks) have increased 54-fold, reaching approximately USD 5 billion by the end of 2015. This amount is larger than the North Cyprus gross national product, which amounted to USD 3.7 billion in the same year. This deposits are belonging to it’s of citizens and residence of the country. The crucial question to be asked is whether these deposits, as an indicator of financial debt, had a substantial effect on economic performance. North Cyprus has a bank-based financial system, so banks are the primary institutions for funding individuals, investment projects, firms, and governmental agencies. Bank deposits, which constitute a significant share of the banks’ liabilities, are the leading source of funds available for financing. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the amount of total deposits, as the main source of funds for economic activities, would have a substantial effect on economic growth. Of course, the financial development in any country implies the improvement of financial services that should be supported by policies designed to increase their effectiveness and efficiency. Efficient financial intermediation allows capital to be allocated to the most profitable projects in the economy. Improved quality and depth in the financial sector leads to growth in the available funds, and channels the savings to the most highly productive opportunities. Therefore, demonstrating the relationship between depth and the economy can motivate the creation of policies that improve financial development and promote economic prospects. Financial development is usually measured by many factors, including the depth and size of the financial system, among others. The World Bank classified the ratio of deposits to GDP as one indicator of financial depth. Beck et al. (2010) used the calculation of deposits as a share of GDP as an indicator of financial intermediary development. Arestis and Demetriades (1997) discussed evidence that the relationship between finance and growth utilises bank-based measures of financial development, such as the ratio of bank deposits to nominal GDP. However, the State Planning Organization, a governmental agency of North Cyprus, provides only the data for deposits, so the ability to measure financial depth is limited. Because the financial system of North Cyprus exhibits the characteristics of a bank-based financial structure, this study used the bank-based measurement of financial development, in the light of a substantial number of existing studies, to examine the relationship between finance and economic growth in North Cyprus. In the existing literature as discussed above, various studies have explored the relationship between financial development and economic growth. This study also tries to investigate the financial-growth nexus and also using inflation rate as another regressor to contributes the existing literature in several ways. Firstly, in a manner that differs from the existing studies of North Cyprus, we used the banks’ total deposits as the financial depth indicator to establish the relationship between finance and economic growth. Since the financial system of North Cyprus can be classified as bank-based, the accumulation of savings is an important indicator of the condition of the financial system. Secondly, we included the inflation rate in our empirical investigation, which is a new approach to assessing the relationship between finance and economic growth in North Cyprus. At the same time, this study examined the inflation-growth nexus. None of the previous studies of North Cyprus have included the inflation rate in their modelling and analysis of the finance-growth nexus. Lastly, another significant contribution of this work is that we used the quadratic match-sum method to convert the annual data to quarterly data to investigate the long-run and short-run relationships between depth, inflation, and growth. Prior studies used yearly data to investigate the long-run and short-run interactions, and used Granger causality to expound the finance and growth interaction. For this study, we used quarterly dataFootnote 2 from Q1 1978 to Q4 2015 to investigate the relationship under the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test combined with cointegration. However, the ARDL model suffers from problems identifying the cointegration order in a series because it is a single cointegration equation. Therefore, to improve the robustness of the results, our research also applied a combined cointegration test that produced more reliable results based on other conventional cointegration tests. After utilizing quadratic match sum method, the number of observations rose to 152. Additionally, this study applied Granger causality under VECM framework to investigate the direction of causation not only in the short and long-run but also joint causality. The limitation of this study was that there was no data available for other proxies of financial development. Hence, we used only total deposits as the financial depth indicator to establish a nexus between finance and growth. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section “Literature Review” presents the literature review. Sections “Model Specification and Data Collection4” explains the model specifications and data collection methods, while Section “Methodology” describes the empirical methodology. Section “Empirical Results” provides the empirical results and a discussion. Finally, Section “Conclusion and Policy Implications” concludes the study and offers an overview of policy implications.",10

Abraham,William M. Fonta,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Farmers have always found ways to adapt to the impact of changing weather and climate conditions. Global climate and environmental changes, however, increase the scale at which farmers need to build and implement resilient strategies (see IISD 1995; von Braun 2002; Hess 2003; Ayers and Huq 2009; Aiello 2009; Akter and Fatema 2011; World Bank 2012; Kim 2013; Collier 2013; IFAD 2014). The literature on climate change and risk management strategies identifies several approaches to help farmers adapt to the impact of climate change; one example is access to credit (Botzen and van den Bergh 2008; Akter and Fatema 2011; WFP and IFAD 2011). While evidence of the effectiveness of access to credit as a poverty reduction strategy is mixed in the literature (see Diagne and Zeller 2001 and Zeller and Sharma 2002), others (e.g. Sorensen 2000; Pettengell 2010; World Bank 2012; Collier 2013) suggest that access to finance could have some effect as a climate change adaptation strategy. Climate change has been argued to have a worsening effect on the conditions of the poor (Nelson and Agbey 2005; Eriksen et al. 2007; CCAA 2010; Baumüller et al. 2011). Among the various adaptation strategies considered to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on the poor, whether financial innovation aimed at increasing the access of households to financial services would enhance their adaptive capacity is not clearly established. A quote is taken from Agrawala and Carraro (2010), who provide insight into the relevance of assessing the role of financial inclusion in fostering adaptation to climate change: 
“Much of the current policy debate on adaptation to climate change has focused on estimation of adaptation costs, ways to raise and to scale-up funding for adaptation, and the design of the international institutional architecture for adaptation financing. There is however little or no emphasis so far on actual delivery mechanisms to channel these resources at the sub-national level, particularly to target the poor who are also often the most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. It is in this context that microfinance merits a closer look.” (Agrawala and Carraro
2010
:3).
 In their assessment of farmers’ perceptions of climate change in northern Nigeria, Farauta et al. (2011) identified various problems associated with climate change that include loss of crops and revenue, loss of forest resources, poor crop yield and quality, increase in weed infestation, increase in pest attack, and delay in planting time. Human activities such as bush burning, indiscriminate cutting of trees, and overgrazing of farmland by livestock, among others, were identified as factors that aggravate the exposure of farmers in northern Nigeria to the adverse effects of climate change. Building on this study, this paper examines the role access to credit could play in helping rural farm households in northern Nigeria mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on their primary occupation and the source of food supply to Africa’s most populous country. Nigeria’s population is approximately 182.2 million (2015 estimate), and the country has a population growth rate of 2.8%. Available statistics further show that approximately 80.4% of the financially excluded population are rural dwellers, of which more than 70% practice land-use agriculture. However, this sector, which accounts for 44% of the GDP, only receives 2% of the total loans disbursed by commercial banks (CBN 2012). Therefore, the rationale for this paper is that since rural farm households in sub-Saharan Africa are vulnerable to climate change and are financially excluded, examining how financial inclusion can enhance their resilience to the increasing impact of climate change, especially in the Sudan savannah regions, would be important. Poverty is also highest in many developing countries that are also vulnerable to climate change as most failed to achieve the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) target of halving poverty by 2015. Thus, traditional methods of adaptation measures would be overstretched and access to technological innovation constrained due to limited or no access to financing. Another justification for this paper is the goal of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and other stakeholders to implement a national financial inclusion strategy that will decrease the number of Nigerians that are excluded from financial services from 46.3% to 20.0% by 2020 and to increase the number that are included from 30% in 2010 to 70% by 2020, as committed to in the Maya Declaration. The CBN (2012) noted that this goal will be achieved through a broad range of coordinated interventions that include the implementation of Credit Enhancement Schemes/Programs to empower micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises; these schemes/programs include the following: the Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises Development Fund, of which 60% is targeted at supporting the on-lending activities of microfinance banks and institutions to women enterprises and clients; implementation of the Nigerian Incentive-based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL); Entrepreneurship Development Centers (EDCs); Restructuring and Refinancing Facilities for SMEs; and the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme. This paper, therefore, examines farmers’ perceptions of their exposure to climate change in rural northern Nigeria. It also determines whether there is a significant relationship between the exposure of farmers to climate change and their need for financial access as an adaptation strategy. The paper contributes to the literature by testing the relationship between farmers’ perceptions of their exposure to climate change and their need for credit to finance adaptation. A measure of the level of association is also provided in order to inform policy makers on the urgency of the situation.",28

Since 1993, when the Bank of International Settlements (BIS) announced its intention to introduce a capital requirement for market risk, and especially after 1996, when regulators began to allow and promote the use of internal models to measure risk exposures, quantile measures such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) have become very common. The VaR framework, originally introduced by RiskMetrics for market risk, has been extended to valuate the credit risk embedded in loans and privately traded bonds as in CreditMetrics (see Gupton et al. 1997). The Basel Committee Internal Models Approach prescribes that a bank must have a model in place to capture specific risks in its regulatory capital, and capital charges are specified in terms of VaR-based calculations. The VaR measure is defined as the minimum loss that will occur with a certain probability. For example, a confidence level of 99% requires capital levels to be set so that the estimated probability of insolvency is lower than 1% per year. In the European Solvency II measures, the economic capital an insurance company must hold to guarantee a one-year ruin probability of at most 0.5% is named the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) and is calculated using VaR techniques. Moreover, some aggregation formulas have been proposed to combine several forms of risk (see EIOPA-14-322 2014). Since using VaR to set capital requirements does not provide information about the potential size of losses exceeding the VaR measure, measures such as the Conditional Tail Expectation (CTE), Tail-Value-at-Risk (TVaR), and Expected Shortfall (ES)Footnote 1 have recently been proposed as well. ES at the 99% confidence level is the average loss given that the loss falls within the worst 1% part of the distribution. The advantage of this measure over VaR is discussed in Artzner et al. (1999), and it has been adopted in some regulatory directives (e.g., the Swiss Solvency Test). While regulators and scholars have made great efforts to differentiate and properly quantify different risk exposures, the incorporation of a more elusive form of risk (i.e. ambiguity and its effect on the calculation of capital requirements) remains an unexplored issue. The measurement of a specific risk presupposes that the probabilities are known or can be estimated with confidence. Meanwhile, ambiguity refers to incalculable uncertainty and pertains to realistic situations where there is subjective uncertainty about the probability measure governing the outcomes. A precise definition of ambiguity is offered in Epstein and Schneider (2010). Agents may differ in their prior beliefs and attitudes toward ambiguity. This may lead to distortions and deviations from ‘true’ estimates and eventually result in different decisions even though the same risk-management techniques are adopted. The inconvenience of excessive reliance on a single probabilistic model was highlighted in the Turner Review (2009), as it became especially salient after the global financial crisis. The crisis of 2007–2009 brought attention to how subjective perceptions of uncertainty and behavior affect the real economies and markets. In turbulent economic times, ambiguity aversion provides better explanations than risk aversion (e.g., Guidolin and Liu 2016). Meanwhile, various studies have linked ambiguity and financial crises (f.e. Boyarchenko 2010) or have shown that incorrect beliefs arising from probability weighting or misestimation have a sizable effect on investors’ utility gains Hens and Rieger (2014). To avoid the disincentivizing effects of an obscure environment some non-model-based methods have been proposed to measure risk capital (see Ghamani 2015, for an application to CCP risk capital, for example). In this study, we investigated the effect of ambiguity aversion on the most common risk measures by focusing on the case of Gaussian distributions. We chose Gaussian distribution because this assumption is behind many industry models for risk calculation and is implicit in many standard formulas and methods prescribed by international regulation. The incorporation of ambiguity was achieved by building on the method developed by Kast and Lapied (2010a, 2010b), which is theoretically founded and, at the same time, parsimonious enough to be easily calibrated to real-world data (see So 2017). However, as Agliardi et al. (2016) showed, the model relevant parameter can be mapped to a measure of average ambiguity aversion as proposed in Rieger et al. (2015), which provides a convincing proxy for ambiguity aversion bias. Roughly speaking, under the adopted mathematical model the presence of ambiguity deforms the probability distribution throughout a parameter measuring the degree of ambiguity aversion or ambiguity seeking. Since deformation affects both the mean and the variance, the results are not easy to obtain and demand a careful analysis. We show that a moderate degree of ambiguity aversion always demands higher capital requirements, but in certain extreme situations, the presence of this form of uncertainty may decrease the calculated capital requirement. The mathematical setting is presented in Section “5. Conclusion”. Section 3 discusses the effect of ambiguity aversion on the most common risk measures, while Section 4 investigates the issue of risk aggregation. Throughout this study, the relative changes in portfolio value were assumed to follow Brownian motion, that is, a normal distribution was adopted to apply a parametric method for the relevant risk measures. To capture the ambiguous environment, we adopted a Choquet–Brownian model as in Kast and Lapied (2010a, 2010b). The uncertain setting was modeled through capacity theory, which replaces the classical probabilistic framework. By capacity on a set of uncertain states, S, we mean a set function ν such that ν(S) = 1, ν(∅) = 0 and A ⊆ B ⇒ ν(A) ≤ ν(B). A capacity ν is convex if. It is concave if the reverse inequality holds. Convexity and concavity are interpreted in terms of ambiguity aversion or ambiguity seeking, respectively, by the decision maker. We refer to Schmeidler (1989) for the link between the convexity of capacities and a representation of ambiguity aversion. In this context, expectations are defined as Choquet integrals: \( E(X)=\underset{S}{\int } Xdv \). As a first step, Choquet random walks are defined. A binomial lattice is considered and for each state. s
t
 at time t, 0 ≤ t ≤ T, the possible successors at time t + 1 are denoted as s
t + 1
u (‘up’ movement) and s
t + 1
d (‘down’ movement). The capacity of “up” and a “down” movements is defined as follows: where c, 0 < c < 1, c is a constant that represents the decision-maker’s ambiguity regarding the likelihood of the states to come. Note that we adopted symmetric Choquet random walks: the case of asymmetric Choquet binomial trees was investigated in Agliardi (2017). The relevant parameter c plays a crucial role in the model and can be extracted from market data, as shown, for example, in So (2017) where the formulas of Driouchi et al. (2015) were used. The absence of an ambiguity bias is represented by the anchor case c = 1/2, because, in this status, we are reduced to the classical symmetric random walks, while c < ½ (c > ½) describes the situation of an ambiguity-averse (seeking) decision maker. Kast and Lapied (2010b) showed that the symmetric discrete process defined above converges to a distorted generalized Brownian motion. More precisely, we quote the following result: When the time interval converges toward 0, the symmetric random walk defined above converges toward a general Wiener process with mean m = 2c–1 and variance s2 = 4c(1–c). To explore the effect of ambiguity on risk measures in portfolio values, we need to compare biased estimates with those obtained under an undistorted stochastic process of the form. where Wt is a standard Wiener process with respect to an original probability measure toward which the decision-maker is perfectly confident. Therefore, we start with an arithmetic Brownian motion to model the relevant economic variable, where the source of uncertainty is governed by a Wiener process. Now, we introduce model risk in the form of ambiguity, that is, we suppose that the decision maker is not perfectly confident about the extent to which the ABM properly represents the wealth dynamics. As discussed above, we start with symmetric Choquet random walks with conditional capacity c. To obtain a continuous time framework, we consider the limit process as the time interval between two consecutive movements tends to 0. As specified in the abovementioned Proposition 5.2 (Kast and Lapied 2010b), the limit process is a distorted Brownian motion whose parameters depend on the ambiguity level, c. Thus, ambiguity is introduced in the continuous time model (1) and takes the form of a distortion of the original ABM. In the biased process, the original drift is replaced with μ + mσ and the volatility with sσ. Note that for fully ambiguity-averse decision-makers one has − 1 < m < 0 and 0 < s < 1, so μ + mσ< μ and 0 < sσ < σ, because the ambiguity parameter, c, is restricted to 0 < c < 1/2 in the case of ambiguity aversion, which implies that m < 0 and s < 1. Here, drift and volatility are both reduced in comparison to the case of the absence of ambiguity biases. Thus the direction of the resulting effect of ambiguity aversion is not easy to guess, as it depends on the relative values of the relevant parameters. In Fig. 1 below, the distortion of a standard normal distribution function is obtained by varying the base parameter c while keeping c ≤ 1/2. Figure 1 is obtained by taking μ =0, σ=1 in the unbiased distribution (blue curve) and then modifying drift and volatility according to various ambiguity levels. Empirical evidence confirms that ambiguity aversion is prevalent among decision-makers. For example, Trautman and Van De Kuilen (2013) report that ‘there is a clear evidence that on average ambiguity aversion is the typical qualitative finding’. Therefore, the subsequent analysis mainly focuses on the case c ≤ 1/2. Gaussian distribution under several ambiguity levels, c Assume a portfolio has a risk exposure affording a risk management division to use Gaussian distributions. To fix ideas, in the base case we assume the profit and loss distribution has a zero mean value and a standard deviation of 10% during the prescribed time horizon. As the proof in Proposition 1 shows, our results are independent of the value of μ, that is, they are robust to changes in the drift of the undistorted price process. In Table 1 Value-at-Risk calculation is performed on an initial portfolio value of 1000 units of currency by introducing ambiguity in the form of a parameter c, as explained in Section “5. Conclusion”. The confidence levels are fixed at 99, 99.5 and 99.9% as these are relevant values in prudential regulation. For example, the Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) is calibrated to the one-year VaR at the 99.5% confidence level, meaning that within the next year, the insurer’s capital will only be insufficient to absorb unexpected losses in 0.5% of cases, or 1 out of 200 cases. As a general rule, the capital requirement increases in the presence of a moderate degree of ambiguity, that is, when parameter c moves away from the base case, c = 0.5; thus, ambiguity acts as an additional form of unfavorable uncertainty. Interestingly, when the ambiguity level becomes very high, the result is reversed and the calculated prudential capital may become even lower than in the unambiguous case. A possible explanation lies in the nature of ambiguity, which, on the one hand, shifts the loss distribution toward the unfavorable side but, on the other hand, hampers the role of “probabilistic” risk. In terms of risk measurement, the component related to expected risk is inflated in the presence of ambiguity, while the portion attributed to unexpected risk is slightly reduced: when the latter effect prevails in some extreme situations, the estimated amount of losses may even result in lower values. In recent decades, risk professionals have started employing some coherent alternatives to VaR. Among them, Expected Shortfall is a natural choice whenever the concern is with the expected loss sustained in the portion of the unfortunate possibilities cut out by a fixed confidence level. Changing from VaR to ES to determine economic capital requirement is among the recommendations of the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision (BCBS 2013). In Table 2, we present computations similar to those in Table 1 using the ES at various confidence levels. The effect of ambiguity is similar for this risk measure - that is, an inverted U-shaped ES curve emerges as a function of the degree of ambiguity aversion parametrized by c. A crucial question in all risk assessment methodologies concerns how to aggregate the overall risk of a portfolio by combining the calculated risks of its individual components. For example, in the Solvency II paradigm, the market risk module comprises six submodules dealing with interest rate, equity, property, spread, currency risk, and the risk arising from market concentrations. The capital requirement for each submodule is determined based on prespecified scenarios, calibrated such that the resulting SCR should correspond to the VaR at the 99.5% confidence level over a one-year period. Finally, the overall capital requirement for market risk is obtained by combining individual SCRs through a predefined correlation matrix (see EIOPA-14-322 2014, pp. 138–139). This section investigates the effect of ambiguity on the overall capital requirement of a portfolio by restricting the analysis to VaR. To simplify the analysis, we assume that all components are affected by the same degree of ambiguity, meaning that the modeller is the same for the several submodules. Consider a portfolio with a value of 1000 that consists of two assets whose return distributions are normal with a mean value of zero and standard deviations of 20% and 10%. In Tables 3, 4 and 5, the calculation of the VaR on the total portfolio is performed for several values of the ambiguity level, c, and by assuming a correlation ρ = 0 in Table 3, ρ = 0.5 in Table 4, and ρ =  − 0.5 in Table 5. The increase in the VaR when a moderate level of ambiguity is introduced is confirmed, followed by a decline when c becomes very low. Note that in the case of negative correlation, a stronger ambiguity aversion (c = 0.02) is needed to get a lower VaR level than in the unbiased value (c = 0.5). Proposition 1 shows that the inversion in the direction of VaR is a general phenomenon. For simplicity’s sake, we present the proof for the case of independent assets, although the result holds true in a more general situation, as specified in Remark 1. Let V
α
(c) denote the VaR of the whole portfolio at confidence level α and with a fixed level of ambiguity c. In what follows, N(.) denotes the cumulative distribution function for a standard Gaussian distribution. Let (θ1, …, θ
n
), θ
i
 ≥ 0, be a portfolio of n assets, whose returns X
i
, i = 1,…, n, follow Choquet-Brownian motions with ambiguity parameter c, 0 < c < 0.5, and are independent. Then for every α> 0.5 there exists a critical value c* of the ambiguity parameter such that V
α
(c) ≤ V
α
(c∗) for any c _ (0,0.5). Moreover, for any α >N(\( \sqrt{n} \)), there exists \( \overline{c} \) (0,0.5) such that V
α
(c)<V
α
(0.5) for c<\( \overline{c} \). Let σ
i
 denote the standard deviation of X
i
, i = 1,…, n, and let \( \Xi ={\left(\sum \limits_{i=1}^n{\theta}_i^2{\sigma}_i^2\right)}^{1/2} \). Then, V
α
(c) is maximized when (1-2c) \( \sum \limits_{i=1}^n{\theta}_i{\sigma}_i \) + \( 2\sqrt{c\left(1-c\right)}\kern0.5em {Q}_{\alpha}\Xi \) is maximized, being Q
α
 the α-quantile for the standard normal distribution. That is, c* is obtained as the solution to. As the function on the right-hand side ranges from 0 to \( \mathbb{K} \), a solution c* is always found. V
α
(c) < V
α
(0.5) is equivalent to \( \left(1-2c\right)\sum \limits_{i=1}^n{\theta}_i{\sigma}_i+2\sqrt{c\left(1-c\right)}\kern0.5em {Q}_{\alpha}\Xi <{Q}_{\alpha}\Xi \). Let \( \phi (c)=\frac{1+2\sqrt{c\left(1-c\right)}}{1-2c}\ge 1 \) for 0≤c < 0.5. The above inequality can be written as \( {Q}_{\alpha }>\phi (c)\sum \limits_{i=1}^n{\theta}_i{\sigma}_i/\Xi \). As \( \sum \limits_{i=1}^n{\theta}_i{\sigma}_i/\Xi \le \sqrt{n} \) by taking \( \phi \left(\overline{c}\right)\le {Q}_{\alpha }/\sqrt{n} \) one has V
α
(c) < V
α
(0.5) for any c, \( 0\le c\le \overline{c} \). This result is preserved in the general case of dependent assets. Let Θt = (θ1, …, θ
n
), R = (ρ
ij
) the correlation matrix and let Ξ be replaced with \( {\Xi}_R={\left(\sum \limits_{i=1}^n{\theta}_i^2{\sigma}_i^2+\sum \limits_{i\ne j}{\rho}_{ij}{\theta}_i{\theta}_j{\sigma}_i{\sigma}_j\right)}^{1/2} \) throughout the proof of Proposition 1. Note that Thus V
α
(c) is maximized when c = c*, where c* is the solution to \( {Q}_{\alpha }{\Xi}_R/\sum \limits_{i=1}^n{\theta}_i{\sigma}_i=\frac{\sqrt{c^{\ast}\left(1-{c}^{\ast}\right)}}{0.5-{c}^{\ast }} \). Moreover, V
α
(c) < V
α
(0.5) is equivalent to \( {Q}_{\alpha }{\Xi}_R>\phi (c)\sum \limits_{i=1}^n{\theta}_i{\sigma}_i \), where ϕ(c) is as in the proof of Proposition 1. If \( \sum \limits_{i,j}{\rho}_{ij}\ge 0 \), by taking \( \phi \left(\overline{c}\right)\le {Q}_{\alpha}\sqrt{\sum \limits_{i,j}{\rho}_{ij}}/n \) one has V
α
(c) < V
α
(0.5) for any c, \( 0\le c\le \overline{c} \). For example, if the assets exhibit a common correlation,Footnote 2 ρ, then the result holds for ρ ≥ 1/(1-n). Indeed, \( {\Xi}_R={\left(\sum \limits_{i=1}^n{\theta}_i^2{\sigma}_i^2+\rho \sum \limits_{i\ne j}{\theta}_i{\theta}_j{\sigma}_i{\sigma}_j\right)}^{1/2} \) and \( {\Xi}_R^2\ge \frac{\left(n-1\right)\rho +1}{n}{\left(\sum \limits_{i=1}^n{\theta}_i{\sigma}_i\right)}^2 \). Taking \( \phi \left(\overline{c}\right)\le {Q}_{\alpha}\sqrt{\frac{\left(n-1\right)\rho +1}{n}} \) one has V
α
(c) < V
α
(0.5) for any c, \( 0\le c\le \overline{c} \). A similar argument can be applied to Expected Shortfall, because, in the case of normal distributions, it is multiplicative in the standard deviation and linear in the mean. More precisely, the ES for a profit and loss distribution with standard deviation σ and mean μ, at confidence level α, is of the form: σES
α
[N(0, 1)] − μ. Therefore, the proof of Proposition 1 can be adapted to this risk measure with only a small modification. Thus far, the aggregation formula has been based on the assumption that the dependence between the distributions can be fully captured by linear correlations. In the mathematical literature, a number of examples can be found where the dependence between the marginal distributions is more complicated (see Embrechts et al. 2002). Overlooking the “true” dependence structure could lead to incorrect aggregated results, i.e. producing either an underestimation or an overestimation of the capital requirements at the aggregated level. To address this issue, (occurring, for example, in the case where there are tail dependencies), we can combine the marginal distributions throughout non-Gaussian copulas. As a first step, we must write the aggregate distribution (i.e. the distribution of the weighted sum of several random variables, each following a Choquet-Brownian motion). Then we compute a lower percentile of the aggregate distribution to estimate the VaR. Copula theory provides an easier method for handling (otherwise) complex multivariate structures. The main idea behind this approach is that the marginals and the dependence function - the copula - can be modeled separately. The dependence relationship is determined by the copula, while scaling and shape depend on the marginals. In mathematical terms, an n-dimensional copula is an n-dimensional distribution function restricted to [0, 1]n with uniform-(0; 1) marginals. For a given copula Φ and marginals F1,… Fn one has that is a distribution function with these marginals. Conversely, for a given joint distribution function F with marginals F1,… Fn there is always a copula Φ satisfying this relationship. Given a set of continuous marginal distributions, a unique copula function can be backed out: These results are known as Sklar’s theorem (1959), and they provide motivation for modeling dependence structures throughout copula functions. If f
i
(x
i
), i = 1,…,n, denotes the marginal density function and f(x1, …, x
n
) is the joint density function, then differentiation yields. where When regarded as a function of (u1, …, u
n
) with u
i
 = F
i
(x
i
), φ is referred to as the copula density. For example, the bivariate normal copula density is of the form. where ξ
i
 = N−1(u
i
), i = 1,2. This is the copula that is implied by a bivariate Gaussian copula. A more flexible copula is the Student’s t copula, which is implied by multivariate t-Student distribution and requires an additional parameter, V, called the degrees of freedom. In contrast to the Gaussian copula, the Student’s t copula exhibits both upper and lower tail dependence. Another example, belonging to the Archimedean family, is the Clayton copula density function, which in the bivariate case takes the form of When a > 0, the Clayton copula exhibits lower tail dependence. We referred to Nelsen (1999) for a thorough treatment of copula theory. In what follows, we adopt Gaussian distributions for the marginals. This is because we need to compare the results with those above, and an explicit formula for the distorted process under ambiguity is available in this case. We denote by X
i
 the random variable modeling the profits and losses on the ith asset in a portfolio and assume that losses are represented in the left tail of the distribution. Hence, the VaR at confidence level α is the negative of the (1-α)-quantile, and typical values for α are 0.95, 0.99 or 0.995. The changes in the portfolio value are. \( \sum \limits_{i=1}^n{\theta}_i{X}_i \) where θ
i
 > 0 and \( \sum \limits_{i=0}^n{\theta}_1=1 \). In the sequel, we confine the analysis to the bivariate case, where the value of portfolio losses is given by Y = θ1X1 + θ2X2, with \( {X}_i\sim N\left({\mu}_i,{\sigma}_i^2\right) \), i = 1,2. The probability that Y is less than q is computed as \( P(q)={\int}_{-\infty}^q{\int}_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\phi \left(N\left(\frac{x_1-{\mu}_1}{\sigma_1}\right),N\left(\frac{y-{\theta}_1{x}_1-{\theta}_2{\mu}_2}{\theta_2{\sigma}_2}\right)\right)\exp \left[-\frac{{\left({x}_1-{\mu}_1\right)}^2}{2{\sigma}_1^2}\right]\exp \left[-\frac{{\left(y-{\theta}_1{x}_1-{\theta}_2{\mu}_2\right)}^2}{2{\theta}_2^2{\sigma}_2^2}\right]\frac{dx_1 dy}{2{\pi \sigma}_1{\sigma}_2} \). Here, ϕ(u1, u2) denotes the copula density function. Changing to variables \( \frac{x_1-{\mu}_1}{\sigma_1}={\widehat{x}}_1 \) and denoting θ1μ1 + θ2μ2=:μ and \( \sum \limits_{i=1}^2{\theta}_i^2{\sigma}_i^2 \)=: Ξ2, the expression above is rewritten as \( {\int}_{-\infty}^q{\int}_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\phi \left(N\left({\widehat{x}}_1\right),N\left(\frac{y-{\theta}_1{\sigma}_1{\widehat{x}}_1-\mu }{\theta_2{\sigma}_2}\right)\right)\exp \left[-\frac{{\widehat{x}}_1^2}{2}\right]\exp \left[-\frac{{\left(y-\mu -{\theta}_1{\sigma}_1{\widehat{x}}_1\right)}^2}{2{\theta}_2^2{\sigma}_2^2}\right]\frac{d{\widehat{x}}_1 dy}{2{\pi \theta}_2{\sigma}_2} \). A further change of variables \( \frac{y=\mu }{\Xi}=: v,\frac{{\widehat{x}}_1\Xi}{\theta_2{\sigma}_2}-\frac{\left(y=\mu \right)}{\Xi}\frac{\theta_1{\sigma}_1}{\theta_2{\sigma}_2}=: z \) transforms the integral into Note that an alternative expression for P(q) is. Assume the stochastic variables X
i
 are deformed under ambiguity according to the Choquet framework of section “5. Conclusion”, and let c ∈ (0, 0.5) denote the ambiguity parameter, as usual. Then, with obvious notation, \( {\mu}^{(c)}={\mu}^{(0.5)}+\left(2c-1\right)\sum \limits_{i=1}^2{\theta}_i{\sigma}_i \) and \( {\Xi}^{(c)}=2\sqrt{c\left(1-c\right)}{\Xi}^{(0.5)} \). Note that the last two expressions for P(q) show that the integral value is affected by the ambiguity parameter only throughout the integration set, while the integrand remains unchanged across different levels of c. This remark yields the following result. In the above-described setting, the relationship V
α
(c) < V
α
(0.5) between the VaR at confidence level α under ambiguity level c, 0 < c < 0.5, and in absence of ambiguity is equivalent to. where q1 − α is the solution to P(q) = 1-α and P(q) is given by (4.1). The VaR for the portfolio above at confidence level α is −q1 − α, where q1 − α is the solution of the eq. P(q1 − α) = α. Therefore. which yields the relationship above in view of \( {\Xi}^{(c)}=2\sqrt{c\left(1-c\right)}{\Xi}^{(0.5)} \). In the case of a Gaussian copula, this relationship boils down to the one we obtained in Remark 1. Indeed, the VaR has a well-known explicit expression. If we replace φ in (4.2) with the Gaussian density copula with correlation parameter ρ and change to variables \( {\theta}_1{\sigma}_1{\widehat{x}}_1+{\theta}_2{\sigma}_2{\widehat{x}}_2={\Xi}_{\rho }y \) and \( {\widehat{x}}_1{\Xi}_{\rho }=z\sqrt{1-{\rho}^2}{\theta}_2{\sigma}_2+y\left({\rho \theta}_2{\sigma}_2+{\theta}_1{\sigma}_1\right) \) with \( {\Xi}_{\rho }={\left(\sum \limits_{i=1}^n{\theta}_i^2{\sigma}_i^2+2\rho \sum \limits_{i\ne j}{\theta}_i{\theta}_j{\sigma}_i{\sigma}_j\right)}^{1/2} \), then (4.2) is written as \( N\left(\frac{q-\mu }{\Xi_{\rho }}\right) \), i.e. q1 − α = μ + Ξ
ρ
N−1(1 − α). However, in general, q1 − α cannot be represented through analytical expressions and is often computed by Montecarlo methods. Some studies have provided bounds for the numerical values of VaR obtained through copula methods (Embrechts et al. 2003). In any case, Proposition 2 shows that the results we found in the Gaussian environment are preserved in a more general setting, at least at a qualitative level. As an illustration, we perform simulations for three different copula functions and compute VaR at the 99% confidence level. We consider a portfolio of two assets with equal weight and with normal marginals, with a volatility of 10% for the holding period under consideration. The correlation is fixed at 0.7, and the following copulas are adopted: a Gaussian one, a Student’s t with ν = 5 degrees of freedom and a Clayton copula with the parameter a = 2. Figure 2 plots the distribution of the portfolio returns for the different forms of aggregation. Table 6 reports the computation of VaR at the 99% confidence level. Despite the slightly different values obtained from the three copulas, the phenomenon presented in Proposition 2 is evident across the alternative choices for the copula function.

S. Ranjani,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The basic requirement of firms is to fund investment projects by tapping the most economical source of financing. Firms can use internal finance, debt capital, or issue new equity to fund their projects. The popular pecking order theory suggests that the prioritization of funding sources by each firm is based on the cost it incurs, and accordingly, the first choice is internal finance, which is the most economical among the sources available. The next viable option is debt capital, followed by new equity issuance. The assumption of perfect capital markets reports that firms are able to raise enough external capital to finance profitable investment opportunities and cover any short-term cash flow shortages that may arise. However, capital markets in the real world are not perfect due to the presence of taxes, information asymmetry, agency problems, etc. This scenario gives rise to an important concept in corporate finance known as “financial constraints.” The broad and established definition for this concept states that there exists a discrepancy between internal and external sources of finance, which precludes the company from making an investment it would have chosen to make, had internal funds been available (Kaplan & Zingales, 1995). In other words, we can treat the inability of the firm to accept positive net present value projects due to inaccessibility of external finance as an example of financial constraints. Under imperfect capital markets, firms face financial constraints and investment decisions in such markets are dependent on firm-level factors. The significance of these factors depends on the degree of information asymmetry faced by the firms. Cash flow sensitivity to investment is used as the proxy for capturing the extent of financial constraints by numerous studies, including the seminal contribution by Fazzari et al. (1988). However, its use as the most relevant proxy was challenged by Kaplan and Zingales (1995) and other studies that followed on theoretical, as well as interpretative grounds. To provide a solution for the proxy debate, Almeida (2007) suggested tangibility of assets as an alternative or facilitating measure to capture financial constraints; it gauges the effect of tangibility on cash flow sensitivity of investment through the tangibility credit multiplier approach. The present study is motivated by the desire to explore the variation in rates at which the external finance is available to the Indian firms, according to the characteristics of the firms seeking it. For example, the business group affiliation, tangibility of assets, and market capitalization influence the rates. Further, financial constraints as a topic of research interest is limited largely to the United States and European countries. Understanding the role of financial constraints in the Indian context becomes important due to the sharp differences in the interest rates at which external finance is available to the firms, as mentioned earlier. The objective of the study is to explore the investment determinants of firms by splitting firms according to firm-level criteria, such as business group affiliation, market capitalization, and tangible net worth. Further, it investigates the degree of cash flow sensitivity and the effects of tangibility on easing financial constraints. The motivation for conducting the present study is to understand the level of information asymmetry prevailing in the Indian capital market and the disparity among Indian firms in accessing external funds. The current study will contribute to the literature by reporting the extent of dependence on internal funds for the listed Indian manufacturing firms. It will also complement the dispersed literature on the use of a proxy for financial constraints, besides capturing the effects of pledging assets on alleviating the problem of financial constraints. The study will also provide evidence for the effects of financial constraints on investment decisions in developing economies, on which there are very few studies available.",21

In recent times, member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) have paid considerable attention to promoting financial inclusion in their respective nations. The levels of financial inclusion and development vary widely among the SAARC countries. Until recently, for vast numbers of people, formal financial products and services have been out of reach. Financial exclusion is caused by demand factors as well as supply factors. Accordingly, to speed up the drive toward greater financial inclusion, initiatives must be taken from both the demand and supply sides. Focusing on supply-side factors alone will not solve the problem of financial exclusion. However, efforts to promote financial inclusion have been adopted primarily from the supply side, including nationalization of banks, an extension of bank branches to rural areas, provision of credit to previously excluded sectors, and adjustment of loan interest rates for low-income households. The development of mobile financial service providers such as bKash Limited (a subsidiary of BRAC Bank) and Dutch Bangla Bank mobile services in Bangladesh, and the expansion of branchless banking and mobile banking in Pakistan, are among the more recent initiatives taken by individual SAARC countries to increase the speed of financial inclusion. Utilization of mobile phones and the Internet to provide financial services has become a new way to offer unbanked people more opportunities to participate in the formal financial system. Mobile money services have increased the access of rural people to financial products and services at a reasonable cost (Thulani et al. 2014). E-banking with a well-developed banking infrastructure provides many secure and convenient services, including 24/7 banking, bill paying, online deposits, money transfers between individuals and between banks, on-time message delivery, around-the-clock call centers, and purchase of airline or train tickets. E-banking is effective in reducing transaction costs. The ability to conduct financial transactions anytime, anywhere using a personal computer or mobile device saves both time and money by eliminating the need to visit a physical bank branch. Banks have worked to build consumer confidence that e-banking is as convenient and reliable as banking in person. Alam et al. (2013) found that mobile banking is more convenient, affordable, and secure. E-financial services increase the banking habits of customers as well. Liao and Cheung (2002) also found that a well-developed, user-friendly banking infrastructure provides customers with such advantages as greater accuracy, reliability, security, convenience, and speed of transactions. The use of mobile banking and Internet banking is quite popular in African countries. Examples include Celpay Zambia Limited’s mobile payments solutions, as well as WIZZIT mobile banking solutions and MTN mobile telecommunications in South Africa. In Kenya, through M-PESA’s mobile financial services, people are entering into a new kind of social structure in which mobile banking plays an important role. M-PESA has proven successful in connecting a large number of previously unbanked and under-banked people in Kenya with the financial system. Kusimba et al. (2013) concluded that the availability of mobile money solutions created a new form of value in Kenyan lives by providing the means for easy transfer of money to friends, relatives, and family members. This facility provides new avenues for social relationships and supports networks with loved ones. For small-scale businessmen and traders, mobile and Internet banking are helpful for conducting daily business transactions. Similarly, a few of the SAARC countries have made efforts to extend the drive toward financial inclusion. The introduction of the eZ Cash mobile financial service by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in 2012 is one significant initiative that widened the boundaries of financial inclusion. This mobile money service has the dual objectives of financial inclusion and economic growth. eZ Cash has covered many unbanked citizens, and it has opened new market opportunities for both banking and non-banking institutions. In Pakistan, the launching of Easypaisa mobile financial services in 2009 was a major initiative for faster financial inclusion. The primary emphasis of this service is to extend mobile banking accounts, create consciousness about mobile banking, and spread information regarding the benefits of mobile banking. In India, the development of Airtel Money and EKO India Financial Services has covered a large number of previously non-banked customers, spreading the boundaries of financial inclusion. Currently, many developing countries are working to include financially excluded people in the mainstream formal financial system through the use of mobile banking and Internet banking. In each SAARC country, the number of mobile users is greater than the number of people in the banking population. There is enormous room for banks to extend their banking services through mobile banking to the unbanked population. The extension of mobile and Internet banking to unbanked/under-banked regions and citizens is a means through which all SAARC countries could fulfill the dream of financial inclusion successfully. To fulfill this dream of financial inclusion, in 1969 the Government of India (GOI) nationalized fourteen banks. The objective was to increase the savings and access to credit of low-income people and to extend banking services to less developed financial regions (Hirashima et al. 2011). In 1980, six more banks were nationalized to expand the range of financial inclusion in India. For the expansion of bank branches in the rural unbanked regions, the Central Bank of India declared a branch licensing policy in 1977. The Central Bank governors argued that through the bank licensing policy, the expansion of bank branches to rural areas or the unbanked regions from 1977 to 1990 had a significant effect on poverty reduction (Burgess and Pande 2005). In India today, financial inclusion for every individual is seen as a necessary precondition for inclusive development (Sangmi 2013). Unfortunately, because of leakage and corruption high in the government distribution system, many resources are unable to reach the poorest of the poor. As a remedy, for some of the services, the GOI has implemented a direct cash transfer system for transferring money directly to the beneficiaries’ bank accounts. It has been argued that payment of government subsidies through bank accounts and the post office will have less leakage. In this regard, mobile phones and the Internet play a vital role in helping the government fulfill this program successfully. Moreover, mobile payments can eradicate corruption from the system by achieving greater distribution. In addition to financial inclusion, many government departments are providing mobile services to citizens for the purpose of good governance. Using mobile phones, the people can gather all kinds of government information or file complaints in case of any government irregularities. This access will help to better the welfare of the citizens. In addition, the advancement of information and communication technology spurs economic growth by making the market more efficient, which ultimately generates more income for the poor and reduces poverty in the economy. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we examine the status of mobile and Internet services in SAARC countries from 2004 to 2014. Section 3 provides an overview of related research. In Section 4, we provide a statement of the contributions of this study, and in Section 5 we detail our methodology. Section 6 gives our results and provides a discussion. Section 7 provides our conclusion and policy implications.",46

4.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,24 February 2018,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-018-0087-z,Examination of the profitability of technical analysis based on moving average strategies in BRICS,December 2018,Matheus José Silva de Souza,Danilo Guimarães Franco Ramos,Herbert Kimura,Unknown,Male,Male,Male,"The basic principle of technical analysis (TA) is that patterns related to past prices of instruments traded in the asset markets can be used to predict the direction of future prices. The objective is to enhance the return of an investment portfolio by understanding the interaction of price indicators for the portfolio’s holdings over an identified time period. According to Stanković et al. (2015), TA is a way of detecting trends in asset prices based on the premise that the price series moves according to investors’ perceived standards. Their study demonstrated that the duration of these standards is sufficient for the investor to make above-average profits, even if the investments incur transaction costs. The goal of our research was to investigate the profitability of trading strategies based on TA in the stock markets of BRICS countries. To this end, we developed an automated trading system based on the moving averages of past prices. We demonstrated that this trading system, using technical analysis techniques, could surpass the profitability of a buy and hold strategy for a portion of the traded assets, calculated by country. The work presented in this paper updated the findings of previous research, and found that technical analysis can help fundamental analysis identify the most dynamic companies in the stock market. TA uses a systematic, graphical approach to identify patterns of historical trading prices and market movements, and then formulate predictions that may generate abnormally strong returns. According to Murphy (1999, pp. 1–2), graphs are the primary instruments of TA. The graphs reflect indicators, such as moving averages and oscillators, that allow analysts to detect trends, identify points of inflection in the price movement, and track capital inflows and outflows. The tools used by TA can provide an index of resistance and support as well. Indicators include the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and the Average Directional Index (ADX), among others. These indicators seek to estimate patterns of future behavior and predict buy and sell opportunities solely from the previously verified pricing of assets. More specifically, Vandewalle et al. (1999, pp. 170–172) defined moving averages as transformations of a price series that allow us to identify trends from data smoothing. According to Gerritsen (2016), the success of technical analysis trading rules would conflict with the weak form of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) (Fama 1970), which holds that current asset prices reflect all relevant past data. In its weak form, EMH states that it is not possible to obtain above-average returns from the study of past prices (Malkiel and Fama 1970, p. 383), implying that a price series has a unit root. Therefore, belief in the validity of TA means rejecting EMH. Expressed in economic terms, Jensen (1978, p. 97) considered a market to be efficient if the economic profit is null, i.e., if the market meets the optimal condition that marginal benefit equals the marginal cost of acting based on the publicly available information. Technical analysis is not compatible with the idea that stock prices can change at random (the random walk hypothesis), as pointed out by Lo and MacKinlay (1987, pp. 87–88). A series of prices presents a unit root, or follows a random walk, if the observations at an instant t can be expressed as the price in t − 1 added to a random shock. In other words, random factors persist in determining the observations of the variable, since the shock is little dissipated over time. More formally, let pt. be the price of an asset at the instant t, and let εt be a term denoting a random shock. If the data generation process is in the following form: , then the series of prices is said to be a unit root if α is not statistically different from 1, which means that the random shock is completely absorbed in the process. In comparison to TA, fundamental analysis (FA) is focused on the economic and financial aspects of stocks and the markets. According to Lui and Mole (1998), FA turns to the microeconomic aspects of companies and to the macroeconomic fundamentals of sectors and countries — known as market fundamentals (Allen and Taylor 1990) — to justify past movements and to predict fluctuations. Through the review of previous research, we also made clear that FA and TA are not mutually exclusive tools for analyzing market data, but rather explore different drivers of price behavior. TA could be an auxiliary tool to FA. In fact, some studies explored a hybrid approach using both TA and FA, e.g., Lui and Mole (1998), Lam (2004), and António Silva and Neves (2015). In this paper, however, we focused primarily on TA. For our research, we assumed that prices are determined by the equilibrium between the supply and demand of the asset to which they refer. Therefore, prices captures any considerations that may be brought by fundamental analysis (Nison 1991, pp. 8–11). The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, we give a brief summary of related research regarding both the development of TA and the results of experiments with data from emerging countries. Section 3 provides the conceptual foundation of TA, while section 4 explains our method and the algorithm applied to generate buy and sell signals. Section 5 discusses the main results obtained, demonstrates the importance of using TA and FA as complementary tools for obtaining profits in the open market, and draws attention to the importance of these results for the literature. Section 6 provides our conclusion. Scholars have tested the efficiency of the tools of technical analysis frequently, for example, in the studies of Allen and Taylor (1990), Jegadeesh (2000), and Kuang et al. (2014). The main reasons for this continued research, as discussed in Zhu and Zhou (2009), were that previous studies of the profitability of technical analysis obtained inconclusive results and lacked a scientific basis. Consequently, more consistent hypotheses to justify TA were needed. For example, Allen and Taylor (1990), Frankel and Froot (1986), Shiller (1989), and others pointed out the irrationality of TA. According to Allen and Taylor (1990), the subjectivity of this approach prevents it from acquiring a scientific character. Frankel and Froot (1986) and Shiller (1989) held that the use of technical indicators leads to overvaluation of asset prices, thereby heating up the demand for some assets without good reason. There have been few experimental tests of the profitability of the TA indicators across the typical market structures of emerging countries. In particular, further work is needed regarding the BRICS member nations, a special subgroup composed of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Recently, studies were carried out on isolated emerging markets that are not similar to each other, including contributions by Chang et al. (2004), Kuang et al. (2014), Mitra (2011), and Mobarek et al. (2008). However, none of these studies proposed a comparison of the results for groups of similar countries, so they failed to answer whether TA is profitable for emerging markets as a whole. Interest in these countries has been stimulated by the typical characteristics of their macroeconomic environments, such as instability, uncertainty, and inflation resulting from their adopted economic growth strategies. According to Chang et al. (2004), emerging countries became attractive markets to investors looking for portfolio diversification and financial returns above the average attainable from the consolidated markets of developed countries. Emerging markets differ from markets in developing countries insofar as they are closer to the markets of developed countries, making them more dynamic and attractive to foreign investors. On this topic, Mukherjee and Roy (2016) emphasized the relationship between instrument price fluctuations and macroeconomic particularities. The good predictability of TA and the high returns in emerging markets are not unanimously accepted in the literature. Chang et al. (2004) and Harvey (1995) emphasized that there is a strong autocorrelation in the price series of emerging markets, which means that the random walk hypothesis is rejected. Therefore, there is a good predictive capacity in these markets. However, Costa et al. (2015) and Ratner and Leal (1999), who considered transaction costs, identified that the predictive capacity of TA does not lead to abnormally strong returns. In this context, Urrutia (1995) identified positive results of TA for Latin American countries. Noakes and Rajaratnam (2014) signaled mixed results for South Africa because the profitability of TA for low capitalization assets sustains itself, which is the opposite of more commonly traded assets. Sharma and Kennedy (1977) showed negative results for India. Almujamed et al. (2013); Errunza and Losq (1985) suggested there is a lower degree of efficiency in emerging markets, compared to the consolidated markets of developed countries. Sobreiro et al. (2016, p. 99) found that a strategy based on the crossover of moving averages generated greater profits than a static strategy for Russia, Brazil, and Argentina, but not for the markets of Jamaica and China. Table 1 summarizes the results of the main studies of the profitability of TA in both emerging and developed countries. Surveys were considered to provide mixed evidence if their results demonstrated that the good performance of technical analysis was not sustained after considering transaction costs. Based on this context, the objective of this paper was to investigate the profitability of moving average trading strategies in the stock markets of BRICS countries. We sought to analyze the performance of TA in environments that are different from those of developed countries and other emerging nations in terms of their stock markets, the behavior of investors, and national economic policies (Mozumder et al. 2015; Naresha et al. 2017). For this research, we used an automated trading system (ATS) that simulated the transactions based on patterns verified by the data and related to the signals of the moving averages over the prices of the assets. We prepared a comprehensive portfolio for each country, containing all the assets traded in the markets of each BRICS member. For South Africa, China, and India, we included the asset prices from 2000 to 2016. For Brazil and Russia, we used price data from 2007 to 2016. Initial capital transactions were carried out as the model issued buy and sell signals from the interaction of the series of moving averages over prices. In this work, we sought to complement the approach of Costa et al. (2015) and Sobreiro et al. (2016) in some respects. First, we studied the performance of technical analysis for the instruments traded in Brazil as verified in Costa et al. (2015), and also for the BRICS members, to check the profitability of indicators for a more general class of countries. In contrast to Sobreiro et al. (2016), we included transaction costs, aiming to establish more realistic assumptions. Our study aimed to update results from Chong et al. (2010) by using more recent data and adding South Africa to the analysis, the latest member to be included in the BRICS countries. In this context, we investigated all BRICS countries, instead of only the BRIC nations, using data through 2016. It is important to highlight that both Sobreiro et al. (2016) and Chong et al. (2010) did not analyze the results of trading strategies that took into account transaction costs. Therefore, our automated trading system, by operating with and without brokerage fees, allowed us to assess the impact of transaction costs on the overall profitability of the strategies. Nison (1991, pp. 8–11) added the psychological and emotional components of the rational agents to the study of asset prices in the financial market. This approach was capable of capturing the animal spirits spoken about by Keynes (1936), a concept that is not incorporated in fundamental analysis. Nison (1991) suggested that the study of technical analysis is important because it provides an understanding of why the market moves. The author emphasized that great negotiators make their decisions based on technical indicators. Both the previous price and the influence exercised by leaders over the decisions of other investors are factors that determine the price movement itself. Ellis and Parbery (2005) highlighted the use of moving averages for the generation of buy and sell signals as a mechanism to identify price trends. While the short-term moving average is more sensitive to price changes, longer term moving averages capture medium- and long-term trends. Investors in the stock exchanges utilize technical analysis extensively, and moving averages are the most commonly used indicators because they are simple to understand and relatively easy to use. Regarding the calculation of the moving averages, let h be the length of the moving average, i.e., the number of observations from which the average of the values will be extracted, and let N ≥ h be the position of a given observation from which the previous h values will be included in the calculation of the N-th moving average. If SMAN is the N-th simple moving average, and EMAN is the Nth exponential moving average, they can be calculated as follows: and For a deeper explanation of the simple moving average, please see Vandewalle et al. (1999). According to Appel (2005), the exponential moving average is better than the simple moving average for identifying trends in a price series. Park and Irwin (2007, p. 67) summarized the evidence for the profitability of technical analysis in futures contracts, foreign currency markets, and in the capital markets. According to the authors, from 1988 to 2004, 26 studies obtained positive results for the use of technical indicators in the capital markets, and 12 found negative results. However, Park and Irwin (2007, pp. 29–30) concluded that the positive results of technical analysis were more consistent and significant for the futures and foreign currency markets, compared to results for the stock markets. Also, the authors concluded that TA’s positive results for asset markets were subject to data manipulation problems and the creation of ex-post strategies. In previous research, findings about the profitability of technical analysis were quite inconsistent when applied to the stock markets of emerging countries. In general, the simple moving average (SMA) or exponential moving average (EMA) strategies assured a positive return, but the return was not sustained when transaction costs were considered, such as fees paid to the broker (Brock et al. 1992). Similar results were presented by Mitra (2011), and Ratner and Leal (1999) when they compared the returns obtained from the generation of buy or sell signals with the returns of a static strategy such as buy and hold. The former study focused on financial assets traded in India, and found that when the short-term moving average crossed above the long-term moving average, the prices generated positive net results. However, when transaction costs were considered, this profitability did not sustain itself. Ratner and Leal’s study (Ratner and Leal 1999), which was broader and considered countries in Latin America and Asia, reached the same conclusion. The exceptions were the Taiwanese, Mexican, and Thai markets, whose profitability was maintained even after transaction costs were included. For data regarding the United States of America (USA), Alexander (1961), Brock et al. (1992), and Fama and Blume (1966) found that if the transaction costs were not zero, the profitability gained by applying technical analysis was not significant. In comparison, Kuang et al. (2014) achieved an average annual return of approximately 30% for emerging countries’ stock markets. However, they considered that this profitability was not accurate, since it was the result of problems arising from prior manipulation of the data to discover ex-ante patterns. In a study using data from Bangladesh, Mobarek et al. (2008) proposed that the accelerated growth of the capitalization level in that country was an investment opportunity. The research emphasized that Bangladesh was an emerging country that had undergone extreme structural economic changes in which the focus on agriculture was abandoned in favor of a strategy involving industrialization and the formation of new companies. The null hypothesis that the market is weakly efficient was rejected after verification. These results showed the weakness of moving average techniques in predicting price behavior. They also suggested that if transaction costs are negligible, technical analysis becomes a viable alternative, indicating that under certain conditions the markets are not efficient. Treynor and Ferguson (1985) emphasized the importance of historical prices in forecasting price behavior as a complement to the role played by the information available to suppliers and claimants who are, above all, responsible for creating profit opportunities. Shynkevich (2012) concluded that the profitability of technical analysis for portfolios holding small cap assets with less liquidity was greater than for portfolios holding large cap companies from the technology area. For this reason, it is especially relevant to analyze the returns of classic technical indicators for emerging markets where more small caps are expected, possibly because of policies used to stimulate industrial activity. Recent empirical evidence for South Africa verified by Noakes and Rajaratnam (2014) suggested that the level of capitalization of traded assets in that country was inversely related to market inefficiency. Moreover, the authors suggested that the degree of market efficiency falls during periods of crisis, as during the financial crisis of 2008. The research of Costa et al. (2015) analyzed the power of technical analysis indicators for the Brazilian asset market. The authors concluded that technical analysis has weak predictive power whether or not brokerage fees are considered. However, the use of crossing moving averages, simple or exponential, and Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) provided a high probability of guaranteeing a return greater than the amount invested. In general, research indicated that it is natural for markets to become efficient, because they do not obtain significant returns from past price behavior. Thus, evidence for technical analysis in emerging markets suggested less efficiency in these countries, which might set up an attractive investment option for the foreign investor. Sobreiro et al. (2016) obtained positive and above-average returns generated by the static buy and hold strategy for the short-term SMA crossing over the long-term SMA. However, although some combinations of short- and long-term SMAs were profitable for some countries, they did not provide sustained profitability for other emerging countries. Consequently, a more general conclusion could not be reached from the study. In general, buy and hold is a more profitable and risk-free alternative to an automated strategy for most emerging markets. It is worth mentioning that the approach of Sobreiro et al. (2016) does not explore the impact of transaction cost on a portfolio’s return, which has a significant cooling effect on the performance of the trades, and is subject to currency rate volatility. With regard to this last aspect, it is worth noting that the authors’ use of 10,000.00 local currency units as the initial value of the portfolio left the investments open to the effects of exchange rate fluctuations and inflation that often impact the currencies of emerging countries. Concerning the influence of technical analysis on fundamental analysis, Almujamed et al. (2013, pp. 57–58) studied data for Kuwait. They concluded that investors check a firm’s profitability before looking at the stock chart movements and stock price trends of the company. Furthermore, they asserted that fundamental analysis that uses a more recent series of prices, usually within five years, is employed more commonly by investors in developed markets, while emerging markets are considered inefficient. According to Bettman et al. (2009, pp. 21–22), TA and FA are complementary, since models that combine the assumptions and elements of both analyses achieve higher profitability than models based on a single approach only. For their analysis of TA and FA, the authors ran linear regression models with explanatory variables from TA, e.g., trend and momentum indicators based on past prices. They also ran models using variables from FA, e.g., book value and earnings per share, and models using variables from both. Bettman’s findings indicated that a model with independent variables from both approaches provided better performance based on statistics such as the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and likelihood ratio tests. The work of Wang et al. (2014, pp. 33) supported a similar conclusion, showing that the joint application of FA and TA reduced the risk of the investment. Chong et al. (2010, pp. 237–238) set out to compare the performance of the traditional technical analysis indicators for the BRIC1. They concluded that the average profit in Russia surpassed the returns obtained in the other countries, and the evidence indicated that the Brazilian open market was the most efficient. The authors attributed these findings to the fact that the age of the market was directly related to efficiency. Therefore, they supported the view that markets become efficient over time. However, the costs associated with open market buy and sell transactions were not considered. Lo et al. (2000, pp. 1753–1764) demonstrated that technical analysis benefits from the automation provided by computerized trading systems, with emphasis on the identification of visual patterns in the asset price series. Tharavanij et al. (2015, pp. 39–40) analyzed the performance of a wide variety of technical indicators for similar Asian emerging markets, such as Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. The analysis was conducted on a risk-adjusted basis, and accounted for brokerage fees. The authors found several levels of efficiency in the markets, but overall, TA strategies could not beat the buy and hold benchmark, and prices could not foster excess returns above the market average. These results indicated that similar characteristics did not lead to a single winning strategy.",26

5.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,11 November 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-019-0158-9,Effect of family control on corporate dividend policy of firms in Pakistan,December 2019,Imran Yousaf,Shoaib Ali,Arshad Hassan,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"“Corporate governance is a philosophy and mechanism that entails processes and structure which facilitate the creation of shareholder value through management of the corporate affairs in such a way that ensures the protection of the individual and collective interest of all the stakeholders” (Hasan & Butt, 2009, p.50). Corporate governance only modestly provides a mechanism through which outside investors can protect themselves against expropriation by insiders. It is mostly associated with the presence of agency problems, which can arise when there is a separation of control and ownership in a firm. The agency issues may exist between managers and owners or between controlling owners and minority shareholders. Notably, owner–manager problems are fewer in family firms, but more prominent between a controlling shareholder and minority shareholders (Jensen & Meckling, 1976). The latter case can be attributed to scenarios wherein controlling shareholders expropriate the wealth of minority shareholders. Extant research on finance also contends that family firms often expropriate the wealth of minority shareholders (De Cesari, 2012). Such firms should then pay more dividends compared with nonfamily firms to overcome agency problems and reduce agency costs. Bozec and Laurin (2008) argue that dividends can be a controlling mechanism in governance to reduce agency costs. The Pakistan business landscape is dominated by family-owned firms. Around 59% of nonfinancial listed firms can be classified as family-owned firms (Shahab and Attiya, 2012). These family firms are indispensable to the economic growth of Pakistan. Owners of family firms control firms through direct ownership, a pyramid structure, or a cross-holding ownership structure. These firms conventionally offer more benefit to family members (majority shareholders). Some studies find that family firms pay less dividends than nonfamily firms do (Attig et al., 2016; Lukas, 2017; Duygun et al., 2018). Contrariwise, evidence also suggests that family firms pay higher dividends to overcome agency conflicts (Lukas, 2010). So far, there is no conclusive substantiation that resolves these contradictory findings. Our objective herein is to examine the effect of family control on the dividend policy of firms in Pakistan. Further, previous studies focus on determining the determinants of the dividend policy of firm (Baker and Powell, 2000; Ben et al., 2006; Denis and Osobov, 2008; Ahmed and Javid, 2009; Mehta, 2012; Yousaf and Ismail, 2016; Baker et al. 2019) without segregating the family and non-family firms. Thus, this paper contributes to the strand of literature on the determinants of corporate dividend policy in two ways: first, by accounting for family control; second, by examining the moderating role of family control on ‘the impact of firm-specific factors on the dividend policy’. Some investors give preference to dividend yield over capital gain while designing their portfolios. This study will be helpful for dividend demanding investors in the selection of stocks for portfolios, because this study also explores whether family firms pay more dividends or non-family firms. It will also be helpful for policymakers of the family businesses’ dominant country while designing or restructuring the corporate governance code for family dominant firms to protect the rights of minority shareholders. Our study is novel for three factors: First, scholars have rarely, if not ever, studied the stated objective in the context of Pakistan. Second, this study contributes to the corpus of literature on dividend policy in firms by focusing on an emerging economy, thus making it relevant to a large group of fast-developing countries in Asia and Africa. Third, it is particularly important to study firm policy dynamics in countries where most firms are family-run. To examine the impact of family control on the dividend policy of firms in Pakistan, we collect sample data of 103 nonfinancial firms ranging from 2009 to 2016 and subject them to panel data analysis using the generalized method of moments (GMM). The remaining paper is structured as follows: After providing an overview of the extant literature in section 2, we explain the data, variables, and empirical methodology in section 3. In section 4, we present and discuss our findings, and then conclude in section 5.",23

5.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,06 November 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-019-0154-0,"Savings, investment, and growth in Nepal: an empirical analysis",December 2019,Aadersh Joshi,Sumit Pradhan,Jagadish Prasad Bist,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The importance of savings in developing countries depends on the long-debated economic theory that the rate of economic growth is the function of the rate of investment and the latter is constrained by the rate of domestic savings (Arndt 1991). Solow’s (1956) growth model argued that economic growth depends on and follows higher saving rates. In fact, Solow (1988) subsequently stated that a developing economy that succeeds in permanently increasing its savings (investment) rate will have a comparatively higher output level than otherwise and must therefore grow faster for a period. He further indicated that stimulating investment will favor faster medium-run growth through its effect on the transfer of technology from laboratory to factory. The key is that savings contribute to economic growth by freeing up resources that can be employed to then raise the productive capacity of the economy by increasing the amount of capital-equipment, machinery, buildings, among others (Mason 1988). The importance of savings for economic growth can also be witnessed in the economic progress made by, for instance, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, and Thailand (Patra et al. 2017). However, low-income countries such as Nepal, which lack a frontier technology, mostly fail in utilizing the available savings in productive sectors. In such economies, the absence of foreign direct investment (FDI) and, hence, the unavailability of recent technologies and skills hampers the efficient utilization of available resources. As such, increasing the efficiency of investment or the effective use of scarce capital is of great importance (Arndt 1991). In this vein, Aghion et al. (2016) argued that savings do not always matter for growth. They further asserted that poor countries require cooperation amongst foreign investors familiar with the frontier technology and the local sectors familiar with the domestic conditions to mobilize the available savings into productive sectors. In this case, domestic savings matter for technology adaptation and therefore growth. However, low-income countries such as Nepal save at a lower rate and experience slow economic growth. The statistics show that the average gross domestic savings over 1975–2016 were around 11% of the GDP (World Bank 2018). This indicates that Nepal’s consumption rate is very high. Additionally, it is worrying that consumed goods are solely imported, fueling a persistent trade deficit. The World Bank Indicators show that, during 2014–2018, Nepal’s trade deficit was above 30% of the GDP. The lack of private and FDI (only 0.13% of the GDP over 1975–2016), rudimentary tradable sector of the economy, and total dependence on India for fuel are further widening the trade deficit. To this end, it is also important to note that the remittance inflow is the only source backing the current account deficit, international trade, and forex reserve of the country. Therefore, the country is not able to utilize the remittance pool in its productive sectors. Accordingly, Nepal has to consider a paradigm shift from its current remittance-led and consumption-based growth to one that is investment- and productivity-driven. Moreover, a decade-long Civil War, from 1996 to 2006, the political turmoil in the subsequent years until 2018, corruption, weak regulatory and legal policies, poor information systems, and poor technological innovations have been major barriers to the development of Nepal’s financial sector (Bist and Bista 2018). Thus, the poor and urban-based financial sector is another hurdle in channeling savings into the productive sectors in the country. Nevertheless, the new constitution and federalist system, the recent political stabilityFootnote 1 in the country, and government’s quest for the development of the nation are likely to induce significant changes in investment policies for both domestic and foreign investors. In fact, the current government has the target of graduating the country from World Bank’s low-income category to the middle-income category by 2030. To make this happen, Nepal recently organized the “Investment Summit 2019” to attract foreign investors and succeeded in signing more than 15 memorandums of understanding between foreign and domestic investors. Therefore, it has become more important than ever to analyze the relationship between savings, investment, and growth in Nepal as to assist policymakers in the policy formulation. Although a few studies having tried to investigate this relationship in Nepal (see Budha 2012; Adhikary 2015), there still exists a significant gap in the analysis of savings, investment, and economic growth. The major issue with these studies is that, although they have used time series data, there has been no attempt to address the issue of structural breaks given that Nepal’s political and economic history has registered some structural changes over time. As such, ignoring these facts may severely distort the findings of any related study. In fact, Perron (1989) argued that ignoring potential structural breaks can invalidate the statistical results not only of unit root tests but also of cointegration tests. Therefore, it is not clear whether the estimates of extant studies represent a valid inference instead of a spurious one. To this end, this study seeks to contribute to this debate by using Nepal as a case study. First, there is limited knowledge on the savings, investment, and growth nexus using recent data on Nepal. To the best of our knowledge, no study has analyzed the savings, investment, and growth relationship using recent time series data analysis techniques such as the autoregressive-distributed lag (ARDL) approach or cointegration in the presence of structural breaks. Second, no study on Nepal has made the use of unit root or cointegration tests to account for structural breaks in analyzing the proposed relationship. This study is the first to use Zivot and Andrews’s (1992) unit root test along with Gregory and Hansen’s (1996) cointegration to account for structural breaks. Similarly, to check the robustness of the cointegration results, this study examines the presence of a long-run relationship using three cointegration techniques, namely the Johansen, Gregory–Hansen, and ARDL approaches to cointegration. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly reviews extant related studies. Section 3 presents the data, model specification, and empirical results. The conclusions and implications of the study’s findings are drawn in the final section.",8

Evidence from Turkey,December 2019,Farrukh Shahzad,Zeeshan Fareed,Muhammad Ikram,Male,Male,Male,Male,"As the International Monetary Fund, Ernst & Young1, and other agencies point out, the Turkish banking system has a relatively low proportion of non-performing loans (NPLs), despite the recent economic downturn and foreign exchange risk. Nevertheless, this ratio varies from bank to bank, and some banks are more sensitive than others are. Although NPLs are not high by regional standards (or compared to some Eurozone member states) and are well configured, analysts, and sector participants are increasingly aware of the risk of rising balance sheet ratios. After several years of rapid credit growth, several factors may lead to an increase in NPLs, including a slowdown in economic growth, a pullback in the economy, and a fall in investor sentiment. NPLs gained research attention in recent years due to the increasing interest in understanding the variables that are vulnerable to a financial crisis. NPLs are one such indicator that is linked closely to weakness in the financial and banking system. We can confirm this by the close relationship between the surge in NPLs and solvency. Though Louzis et al. (2012) and Reinhart and Rogoff (2011) point out that the increase in NPLs marks the outbreak of the banking crisis, NPLs are also significant after the global crisis. Certainly, the global financial crisis led to a surge in NPLs, which also pose a risk to the profitability and liquidity of the banking system, as well as financial stability. In the early 1980s, Turkey’s financial sector relaxed the process of neoliberalism. These provisions increase the efficiency of the Turkish banking system (Zaim 1995). Through these reforms, Islamic finance emerged, called Special Financial Houses2. Despite these reforms, Selcuk (2010) and Afsar (2011) argue that there was a prompt increase in NPLs after the global crisis. In addition, the global crisis challenged both the Turkish banking sector and the changes in NPLs after the crisis and ownership as key drivers of this change. According to Blejer (2006) and Shahzad et al. (2019), financial efficiency is an important issue because it improves financial stability. In rapidly changing global financial markets, bank managers, regulators, and investors pay more attention to converting their expensive inputs into more effective financial products and services. Banking is the mainstay of the Turkish financial system. In particular, total banking assets account for about 87% of the Turkish financial system (CBRT, 2016). This is the main motivation for analyzing NPLs, which provided important feedback in financial stability. At the same time, the global crisis forced the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) to supplement financial stability. Therefore, this analysis can also inform monetary policy related to macro-prudential issues (BASCI and Kara 2011). We specifically examine the relationship between loan growth and bank risk-taking behavior and discuss the impact of loan growth on financial health. To assess the different perspectives on the relationship between credit growth and bank risk-taking behavior, this study uses micro-level data from 59 Turkish banks3 between 2011 and 2017. To understand the effect of loan growth on the financial system, we use the two-step GMM (Generalized Method of Moments) estimation technique. Thus, this study contributes to the literature in two ways. First, it analyses 5 types of banks: commercial, corporate, real state, investment, and Islamic banks. Second, we also include additional variables such as political stability and the rule of law to check their impact on NPLs and solvency.",7

In this regard, an effective and efficient financial system could be considered as an indispensable tool that is necessary for a nation’s economic development process. Financial liberalization, in contrast to repression, is regarded as a means to foster competition in the financial sector, which is vital in deepening the access to cheap credit for firms and households alike. Stable financial systems can be used as an alternative method of measuring the rate of development that countries are able to garner. It is not surprising that most advanced economies have had relatively sound and efficient financial systems. This could be accounted for by the common interconnections between economic prosperity and healthy financial institutions. This is attributed to the ever-increasing debates between the demand-following versus supply-leading hypotheses. The relationship between economic growth and financial development has generated significant interest in the economic literature. Numerous researchers have discussed the causal impact of financial development on economic growth. Studies over the past 30 years on the finance-growth nexus not only show the consistent relationship between them, but also the strong predictive power of the aggregate measures of finance and growth. They also argue that better financial systems stimulate faster growth in productivity by channelling society’s resources into promising productivity-enhancing endeavors (Colombage, 2008). Kou et al. (2019) emphasize the importance of numerical analysis of financial market with measuring financial systemic risk. Some studies have explicitly confirmed the demand-following hypothesis by employing distinct econometric methods (see for instance, Claessens et al., 2001; Islam and Mozumdar, 2007; Micco et al., 2007; Yartey 2008). Furthermore, the supply-leading hypothesis was documented in the works of Patrick, 1966; Goldsmith, 1969; Jung, 1986; King and Levine, 1993; Levine and Zervos, 1998; Levine et al., 2000; Christopoulous and Tsionas 2004; Güryay et al., 2007. Drake et al. (2006) gave an insight into the need to take into account problematic outliers, accounting for shocks from external factors on banking systems empirically, while considering banking systems that experience a downturn in efficiency due to unpredictable market conditions. Fink et al. (2009) examined the impact of financial sectors at different stages of development in nine European Union accession countries during their early years of transition (1996–2000). The conventional production function was applied in determining the impact of the credit, bond and stock segments. The study found that the transfer mechanisms differed over the development cycle (from bond markets to educational attainment to labour participation) and that financial market segments with links to the public sector (but not stock markets) contributed to stability and growth in transition economies. The long-run and short-run relationship between economic growth, bank deposits and the inflation rate in North Cyprus was analyzed by Tursoy and Faisal (2018) using ARDL bound test. The results showed a strong long-run relationship between the variables. Also, the study found unidirectional causal relationship between economic growth and the inflation rate in North Cyprus. Moreover, Caporale et al. (2015) investigated the relationship between financial development and economic growth in a transition economy by estimating a dynamic panel model over the period 1994–2007. The study found that the contribution of the financial sector to economic growth is limited owing to a lack of financial depth in the transition economy. In spite of the vast body of literature dealing with the finance-growth nexus, few studies have been conducted on the role of financial sector output in a semi-closed economy with limited interconnection with the global financial system. North Cyprus is arguably an autarchy that is recognised only by Turkey. Since its unilateral declaration of independence in 1983, the country has had minimal participating power in global politics owing to the embargo placed on it by the United Nations. The country relies heavily on Turkey for its economic and political development (Okumus et al., 2005). In this text, Cyprus means pre-1974 Cyprus, while North Cyprus will be used interchangeably with the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus (TRNC). The next section presents a snapshot of the North Cyprus economy, Section 3 describes the research method, Section 4 analyses the results and the final Section concludes the study.",5

Price movements are observed daily in our day to day life. The behavior of stock prices appears to be rather odd. However, the price movements are not totally random in nature. Stock values are numerical values having uncertainty. Building a model for a problem involving uncertainty is no easy task. There are numerous forecasting tools and techniques available for predicting the stock market prices. Statistical models do not employ all available data for manipulation. The problem arises in handling unequally spaced, available historical high frequency data. Hence to address and resolve all the above challenges arising out of uncertainty and to achieve a better prediction accuracy, robust algorithms based on Markov chain and Fuzzy logic have been developed. Incidents of jumps are determined from the observations of the stock market data. This being an integrated model, it is more robust than the classical one and is well suited for analysis of high frequency data of observations. A Markov chain is a stochastic process characterized by memoryless property. According to Markov chain concept, the probability distribution of the future state depends only on the present state and not on the sequence of happenings that precedes it. Markov chains are used in the area of finance to model a variety of different phenomena including stock indices and market crashes. In 1974, Markov chains were used for modeling finance market behavior. Later, in 1989, they were used for modeling switches between periods of high volatility and low volatility of asset returns. A recent development is a Markov switching multi fractal model using Markov chains. In addition to these, Fuzzy logic analysis can be a very efficient tool in predicting stock market trend. Fuzzy models have the capability to analyze the datasets of linguistic values. Fuzzy set is a versatile tool for both linguistic and numerical modeling. For a randomly changing dynamic system, prediction of state of a Markov chain at a given point in the future is noted for uncertainty. In order to overcome this difficulty, the current model merges fuzzy logic tool with Markov concept for prediction and analysis. The main purpose of this study is to integrate two major models, viz., the Markov chain model and the fuzzy model in an efficient way to obtain a solution for ambiguous situations like external factors affecting the stock market. A fuzzy approach has been developed, for analysis and study of the moving trends of the stock market leading to a generalized mathematical model called NTFCMs interrelated model and an integrated NTFCMs Markov chain model with internal threshold indicating the lower bound, upper bound and the exact threshold value, to enable palpable benefits to investors. The model predicts the MAPE and RMSE tolerance limit for various stock indices. Comparisons are made with the other existing models measuring the effectiveness of the model for a multi-timeframe approach. The advantage of the model lies in the study of the positive, negative and mixed jumps for prediction analysis and for considering the most ambiguous situations in getting optimum solutions. Ambiguous situations are made possible for consideration since the historical price data are numerical values preprocessed and used for addressing the error tolerance effect and predicting the trend in the developed model. The interest here is to develop a low complexity, accurate prediction model which is better suited for real life situations. This study focuses on construction of an optimum solution using the interval partition in the Universe of discourse. Knowledge of the error tolerance limit, helps in taking reliable decisions predicting the trend of stock price index over varying timeframe. The estimates can be quite different depending on the frequency of the dataset. This paper contains five sections. The First section provides the introduction. The Second section presents a review of literature. In the third and fourth sections, Markov chain and Fuzzy interrelated jump analysis prediction model, an integrated NTFCMs Markov chain model are defined respectively. Section 5 deals with applications of integrated NTFCMs Markov chain model to stock market moving trend analysis. Section 6 provides conclusions.",10

In addition, the Fed’s balance sheet size expanded more than four times its value of 2007. The U.S. monetary policy normalization strives to return the monetary policy to a state in which the Fed’s nominal interest rate is above zero and the size of the balance sheet is reduced. It is also intended to return the monetary policy process to the pre-recession era in terms of ending the zero-interest rate policy. This would simultaneously lead to an increase in short-term market interest rates and transform the composition of the Fed’s asset holdings to the pre-Great Recession era. Both researchers and policymakers acknowledge that the withdrawal of monetary stimulus and eventual increase in interest rates by the Fed would have tremendous repercussions on emerging market economies. The impact of these repercussions could take the form of portfolio reversal, financial system vulnerability, or macroeconomic instability, and eventually lead to greater financial turmoil in the global financial markets. Over the years, Nigeria’s financial market has evolved in terms of both sophistication and interconnectedness with the global financial system. The level of development has improved considerably, and it is expected to respond to major external monetary policy shocks such as the Fed’s monetary policy normalization after nearly a decade of quantitative easing (QE). Furthermore, it is observed that normalization of monetary policy in the U.S. has the potential of reversing investors’ sentiment in developing and emerging economies (BIS, 2018; Goes et al., 2017; and Moore et al., 2013). In the medium-term, the U.S. monetary policy normalization is expected to continue to fuel investor expectations with the threat of possible reversal of capital flows. As observed by CBN (2015), “the expected policy normalization in the U.S. could accentuate capital flow reversals from emerging and developing economies and further tighten global monetary conditions, thus exerting greater pressure on exchange rates in those countries.” The analytical spotlight on the effect of the Fed’s monetary policy normalization on emerging and developing economies has focused on China, South Africa, and Brazil; Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru; Mexico and other emerging economies (Goes et al., 2017; and Moore et al., 2013). To the best of our knowledge, there is no study assessing the spillover effects of the Fed’s monetary policy normalization on Nigeria’s sovereign bond yield. Given the relative size of Nigeria’s economy in the Sub-Saharan African (SSA) region and its interconnectedness to the global financial market, a study that clarifies understanding of the spillover effects of Fed’s monetary policy normalization on Nigeria is imperative. This study, therefore, aims to address this important research gap, by examining the effects of the U.S. 10-Year bond yield on Nigeria 10-Year sovereign bond yield. To achieve this objective, the remainder of the study is structured as follows: Section 2 presents the stylized facts; Section 3 reviews related literature; Section 4 describes the methodology; Section 5 presents the discussion and results, while Section 6 concludes the study.",3
5.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,11 July 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-019-0142-4,Do migrant remittances matter for financial development in Kenya?,December 2019,Roseline Nyakerario Misati,Anne Kamau,Hared Nassir,Female,Female,Unknown,Female,"For decades, economic policymakers have experimented with many development mantras, with various objectives ranging from increasing economic growth and reducing inequality to alleviating poverty, and especially for the “bottom billion.”Footnote 1 However, economic approaches in developing countries have historically revealed no compelling evidence of any particular suitable model that has worked perfectly in the developing world, and in Africa in particular (Ascher et al. 2016; Olu and Afeikhena 2014). For instance, various models on financial development—such as micro-credit and digital payment systems meant to increase access to finance for the poor—are still being promoted in African countries, but Africa’s level of poverty is increasing while declining in other regions worldwide (Asongu and Sara 2018; Santos and Kvangraven 2017; Bateman 2017; World Bank, 2015; Hulme and Maitrot 2014).Footnote 2 Moreover, a recent analysis of financial development indicators in Africa revealed that fewer than one-quarter of adults have an account with a formal financial institution, many adults use informal methods to save and borrow, and a majority of small and medium-sized enterprises are unbanked, with access to financing as their greatest challenge (Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper 2012). Among other reasons, the study also found that the low penetration of bank accounts in Africa is partially attributed to the low income levels that hinder savings, limited physical access points, and the high costs of maintaining bank accounts. While acknowledging the low income across African communities as a possible constraint to financial inclusion through traditional banking systems, financial inclusion for the “bottom billion” is clearly possible through technology.Footnote 3 For instance, Ndung’u (2017, 2018) noted that digitalization has driven the accelerated provision of financial services through retail payments, virtual savings, and credit supply. This has been demonstrated in Kenya, where the country’s M-Pesa services have contributed to the growth of bank account-holders, from 26.7% in 2006 to over 75% in 2016.Footnote 4 Although the debate regarding the finance-growth nexus is far from concluded, evidence exists based on endogenous growth theories to suggest that a well-developed, inclusive financial system will support higher levels of growth and lower levels of poverty (Terfa 2018; Terfa and Fonta 2018; Mauzu and Alagidede 2018; Zulfiqar et al. 2016; Andrianaivo and Kpodar 2012). Therefore, focus has intensified following a steady increase in remittance flows to Africa, toward leveraging remittances to enhance financial inclusion and promote financial development. Additionally, research activity has intensified in this area, although these studies present mixed findings. Some studies have confirmed that families receiving migrant remittances can access better health facilities, obtain a better education, and have better financial access and lower poverty levels than those that do not receive such remittances (Uzochukwu and Chukwunonso 2014; Dilip 2013; Reanne et al. 2009). Moreover, remittance flows through formal channels provide opportunities for encouraging savings, increasing deposits, and deepening financial inclusion (Al-Tarawneh 2016; Meyer and Shera 2016; Shera and Meyer 2013). However, other studies have demonstrated that remittances lead to the relaxation of borrowing constraints, which subsequently decreases the marginal utility of wealth and increases the consumption of all normal goods, including leisure. In this case, migrant remittances cause reduction of labor supply among the non-migrants who substitute income for leisure. This may adversely impact investments and the accumulation of capital (Berrak et al. 2018; Guha 2013).Footnote 5 This debate on the remittance-finance link has not escaped policy circles in Kenya; approximately three million Kenyans constituting around 7.0% of the total population live abroad (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2014). Remittances have steadily increased in Kenya, at an average annual rate of 15.8% in the past decade and increasing from US$934 million in 2011 to an estimated US$2.7 billion in 2018, or 3.0% of Gross Domestic Product -GDP (World Bank 2019). Kenya is one of the top five highest remittance-recipient countries in Africa, after Egypt, Nigeria, Morocco and Ghana, as per the World Bank estimates in 2018. Remittances to Kenya have consistently increased, with higher levels recorded than foreign direct investments and portfolio equity flows. However, these statistics only reflect remittance flows through formal channels and are believed to be grossly underestimated, as migrants send money through informal channels and in-kind transfers, and these are often unrecorded. As summarized by Filippo et al. (2014), money transferred through financial institutions paves the way for recipients to demand and access other financial products and services. Moreover, providing remittance transfer services allows banks and financial institutions to gather recipients’ information, which is important for mitigating adverse selection problems. The same paper also noted that remittance channels can be used to sell financial service packages geared toward low-income individuals. This debate takes on special importance in the case of Kenya, where cross-border remittance transactions have been extensively revolutionized using mobile phone technology. Kenya is one country used as a worldwide example of what adopting technology can accomplish, as with its well-known M-Pesa products.Footnote 6 An international remittance transfer service is one such product with substantial potential to reach millions of people, including low-income and unbanked populations in rural areas. However, in spite of these remittances’ potential impacts on financial development, few country-specific studies have empirically examined the remittance-financial development linkages in the African region. Moreover, no consensus exists regarding the impact or direction of the causality between remittances and financial development (Coulibaly 2015; Nyamongo et al. 2012; Gupta et al. 2009). Previous studies on migration and remittances have concentrated on remittances and growth and have ignored the channels through which migration and remittances affect economic growth (Fayissa and Nsiah 2010). The few studies that have considered these channels have primarily focused on investment and consumption channels, ignoring those that could promote financial development (Makori et al. 2015; Aboulezz 2015; Mwangi and Mwenda 2015; Ocharo 2014; Kiio et al. 2014). This study attempts to fill this gap by analyzing the relationship between remittances and financial development as it contributes to existing knowledge in at least four respects. First, no study to the best of our knowledge has examined the remittance-financial development nexus using Kenyan data. Second, this paper uses multiple indicators of financial development, including such indicators of financial inclusion as the numbers of bank accounts and mobile transactions that have not been used in previous studies based on Kenyan data. Third, the paper’s data set also incorporates the bound co-integration technique or the autoregressive distributive lag model (ARDL), which previous studies have not utilized. Fourth, this study also examines whether any reverse causality exists between remittances flows and financial development, as existing literature indicates the possibility of such a relationship. This study’s results are critical for policymakers keen to leverage technology to facilitate enhanced remittances and improved financial inclusion. The study is also beneficial to private sector actors—primarily banks, but also governments—that can benefit by developing customized products for the diaspora.",20

As such, its fluctuations have the potential to impact economic developments worldwide. The ability to forecast the price of crude oil is therefore a useful tool in the management of most industrial sectors (Shin et al. 2013). Nevertheless, crude oil price forecasting has been a challenging task, owing to its complex behavior resulting from the confluent influence of several factors on the crude oil market. In specific, the nonlinear features exhibited in the dynamics of oil price volatilities present a quandary for predictive techniques, making the issue of (long-term) crude price forecasting open to finance research. A wealth of literature exists on the topic of forecasting crude oil prices. These articles are myriad, both in terms of the types of models and the number of methods being used concurrently. Some studies use an approach with a single method (non-hybrid) and some are defined by several methods (hybrid). In this regard, the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) was amongst the first methods used because of its ability to capture time-varying variance or volatility (Agnolucci 2009; Arouri et al. 2012; Cheong 2009; Fan et al. 2008a; Hou and Suardi 2012; Kang et al. 2009; Mohammadi and Su 2010; Narayan and Narayan 2007; Sadorsky 2006; Wei et al. 2010). We attempted to perform the GARCH model as a hybrid method by combining with other models, such as the stochastic volatility (SV) model, the implied volatility (IV) model and the support vector machine (SVM) model. The neural network (NNET) method has been another approach for crude price forecasting (Azadeh et al. 2012; Ghaffari and Zare 2009; Movagharnejad et al. 2011; Shin et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2012; Yu et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2008). However, it reportedly bears the disadvantage of over-fitting, local minima and weak generalization capability (Zhang et al. 2015). For this sake, its hybrid usage has been recommended for the purposes of crude price forecasting. Some authors opted to use the SVM model for price prediction, taking advantage of its suitability for modeling small-sized data samples with nonlinear behavior (Guo et al. 2012). Others have reported on the merits of the wavelet technique for crude price forecasting (Yousefi et al. 2005) with one major shortcoming being its sensitivity to the sample size. However, the recent literature advocates for the use of hybrid methods to improve on the accuracy of price forecasting. The use of the best of each technique in a hybrid framework has been enhanced by combining the soft-computing or econometric method or both (Fan et al. 2008b; Xiong et al. 2013). The reader is referred to the excellent review by Zhang et al. (2015) for a more complete assessment of past research on oil price forecasting. The motivation behind the present work was to exploit the potential of Bayesian network (BN) theory, in the context of crude price prediction, by constructing a network over decomposed price components. As such, the present article contributes to the existing literature in this field by proposing a novel hybrid method within a Bayesian network framework. In addition, this article reports results on other devised hybrid methods, using Random Forest (RF), Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), NNET and SVM. The rest of the article is organized as follows. The next section will detail the methods being used. A description of the results is provided in the third section, which will be followed by some concluding remarks.",12

5.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,05 June 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-019-0140-6,Portfolio optimization by improved NSGA-II and SPEA 2 based on different risk measures,December 2019,Massimiliano Kaucic,Mojtaba Moradi,Mohmmad Mirzazadeh,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The portfolio selection problem can be defined as the optimal allocation of wealth among a finite number of assets that follows careful processing of all available information about both investors and markets (Meucci 2009). Markowitz’s mean-variance model is by far the most popular procedure in asset allocation (Guerard 2009). Even if it is considered the cornerstone in this field, the mean-variance portfolio optimization model presents two serious drawbacks from a theoretical point of view. First, when asset returns are skewed and fat-tailed, they tend to include only a limited proportion of stochastically dominant assets in the efficient solutions, and prematurely preclude asset with negatively skewed returns. Second, risk is measured by variance, which treats both the above and below target returns equally, while investors are more concerned about the probability of investment returns falling below the target return. Consequently, risks are under-estimated and portfolios that are downside efficient are ruled out. A solution proposed in the literature to make Markowitz’s approach more effective is to replace the variance with a downside risk measure in order to model the loss aversion of investors properly. In this context, semi-variance has been studied extensively (Nawrocki 1999; Sing and Ong 2000). Two main reasons justify these efforts. First, semi-variance is an approximation of the skewness for the return distribution, since it measures below-target returns. The higher is the value of semi-variance, the greater are both the degree of negative skewness and the risk of the investment. Second, semi-variance efficient portfolios closely approximate the stochastic-dominance efficient set. However, the computation of portfolio semi-variance is a difficult task owing to the endogenous nature of the portfolio co-semi-variance matrix, which depends on the weights assigned to each asset, that is, changes in the weights affect the periods in which the portfolio underperforms the target level, which, in turn, affects the evaluation of the co-semi-variance matrix itself. Some attempts have been proposed to solve this problem directly (Hogan and Warren 1972; Konno et al. 2002; Markowitz 1959; Markowitz et al. 1993). Other studies have focused on the definition of an exogenous co-semi-variance matrix that satisfactorily approaches the endogenous one (Ballestero and Pla-Santamaria 2005; Cumova and Nawrocki 2011; Estrada 2008; Nawrocki 1991). Nowadays, because of the regulatory importance of quantifying large losses in banking and insurance, another class of downside risk measures, called quantile-based measures, occupies a leading position in the risk management sector. One of the most popular examples is value-at-risk (VaR), defined as the maximum loss occurring over a given period at a given confidence level. Although VaR is apparently easy to use and intuitive, it presents several disadvantages. Primarily, it ignores losses exceeding VaR and is not sub-additive, that is, diversification of the portfolio may increase VaR (Artzner et al. 1999). From a computational perspective, VaR is difficult to use when investors want to optimize their portfolios, since it is represented by a non-linear, non-convex, and non-differentiable function with multiple local optima (Gaivoronski and Pflug 2005). Moreover, rational agents wishing to act on their decisions according to expected utility theory may be misled by the information related to the portfolio VaR (Yamai et al. 2002). To deal with these shortcomings, (Rockafellar et al. 2000) introduced the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), which is defined as the conditional expectation of losses above the VaR (Sarykalin et al. 2008). CVaR is a coherent risk measure in the sense of (Artzner et al. 1999) and, because it is a convex function, optimization problems with CVaR as the minimization objective and/or constraints can be efficiently handled (Krokhmal et al. 2002; Larsen et al. 2002; Rockafellar and Uryasev 2002). Increasing complexity of practical applications has led researchers to develop heuristic procedures for solving their portfolio optimization problems. These techniques require less domain information to be considered than the standard gradient-based mathematical programming methods do. Moreover, they guarantee satisfactory approximations to solutions in a fair computational time even when they deal with non-convexity, discontinuity, and integer decision variables. The approaches that have been proposed in the soft-computing literature can be categorized into the following two groups. On one hand, single objective methods optimize a weighted sum of the portfolio objectives. On the other hand, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) attempt to tackle the allocation problem directly in its multi-objective form by simultaneously optimizing risk and reward. In the first case, the complete set of risk-return profiles is obtained by varying a parameter that represents the risk aversion of the investor (Chang et al. 2000; Crama and Schyns 2003; Cura 2009; Woodside-Oriakhi et al. 2011). In the second case, the complete efficient frontier is represented in a single run (Anagnostopoulos and Mamanis 2011a; Meghwani and Thakur 2017; Mishra et al. 2014). Both categories pay great attention to encoding types and constraint–handling techniques (Liagkouras and Metaxiotis 2015; Meghwani and Thakur 2017; Metaxiotis and Liagkouras 2012; Ponsich et al. 2013). Some real-life situations, which are not considered in Markowitz’s model, have been analyzed recently by (Eftekharian et al. 2017) and (Meghwani and Thakur 2018). (Eftekharian et al. 2017) include as constraints some restrictions on the number of assets in the portfolio, limitations on investing in assets from a given industry, and cardinality, class, and quantity constraints. Furthermore, they developed an improved version of the NSGA II algorithm, called 2-Phase NSGA II, to solve the resulting optimization problem. Meghwani and Thakur (2018) focus on the problem of handling equality constraints, like self-financing constraints, and constraints arising from the inclusion of transaction cost models using MOEAs. Researchers have also focused on so-called swarm intelligence methods to overcome the computational difficulties of realistic portfolio designs. Unlike evolutionary algorithms that utilize the principle of natural selection, these approaches are inspired by the behavior and self-organizing interaction among agents, such as foraging of ant and bee colonies, bird flocking, and fish schooling (see Ertenlice and Kalayci (2018) for a detailed review of the subject). Over the past few decades, machine-learning algorithms have been widely used to explore financial data and make data-driven predictions (Chao et al. 2019; Kou 2019). For instance, (Huang and Kou 2014) present a kernel entropy manifold learning algorithm to measure the relationships between two financial data points in order to describe the characteristics of a financial system by deriving the dynamic properties of the original data space. Similarly, (Huang et al. 2017) propose an information metric-based manifold learning algorithm to extract the intrinsic manifold of a dynamic financial system and to detect impending crises. (Ergu et al. 2014) focus on the use of the analytical network process in risk assessment and decision analysis of an emergent event. They propose a new consistency index to assess the key factors of risks and analyze the impacts and preferences of decision alternatives. Zhang et al. (2019) develop three soft minimum cost models based on different weighted average operators for resolving consensus decision–making problems. The usefulness of the proposed models is validated in a real–world loan consensus problem, using data from a Chinese P2P platform. Kalayci et al. (2019) review state–of-the-art methods dedicated to mean-variance portfolio optimization. Evolutionary computations are made by iterations and, in each iteration, the weights of the portfolios are known a priori because they are generated by the algorithm. Thus, it is possible to directly determine in which periods the portfolio underperforms the target level. In this manner, the difficulty of computing the ex-post portfolio semi-variance can be fruitfully resolved by the use of an evolutionary algorithm. One of the first studies to attempt this is (Dueck and Winker 1992), who reformulate the bi-objective optimization problem into a single-objective and solve it through a local search technique, called threshold accepting. In a similar way, (Arnone et al. 1993) propose a solution to a parametric programming problem with the objective of optimizing a convex combination of mean and semi-variance. The algorithm is based on Whitley’s GENITOR system (Whitley 1988) and uses a steady-state breeding strategy and elitist selection. Chang et al. (2009) apply a genetic algorithm to portfolio optimization problems in different risk measures, namely variance, semi-variance, absolute deviation, and variance with skewness. Recently, (Liagkouras and Metaxiotis 2013) address the mean-semi-variance portfolio optimization problem from a multi-objective perspective by developing an ad-hoc evolutionary algorithm. Evidence of the robustness of the algorithm is accomplished in out-of-sample testing during both bull and bear market conditions on the FTSE 100. Macedo et al. (2017) compare the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II, Deb et al. (2002)) and the strength Pareto evolutionary Algorithm 2 (SPEA 2, Zitzler et al. (2001)) within the mean-semi-variance portfolio optimization framework. Numerical experiments indicate that NSGA-II outperforms SPEA 2 in-sample. Senhaji et al. (2016) propose to resolve the problem by combining the continuous Hopfield neural network with NSGA-II. The effectiveness of this strategy is proved using a portfolio of 20 assets. Regarding the quantile-based minimization problems involving many financial instruments, a large number of price scenarios is necessary to estimate risk correctly. As the dimension of the problems increases, this operation can be time consuming (Lim et al. 2010) and the use of heuristics may be advisable or even necessary to detect a solution. An example is provided by the multi-purpose data-driven optimization heuristic proposed in Gilli M and Hysi (2006), which deals with different risk functions, such as VaR, CVaR, maximum loss, and Omega, as well as with practical constraints on the portfolio composition. An evolutionary computation approach is developed by (Hochreiter 2007) to solve the general scenario-based risk-return portfolio optimization problem when standard deviation, VaR, or CVaR are used to represent the risk of the investment. A variant of the NSGA-II algorithm based on differential operators is developed by (Krink and Paterlini 2011) for portfolio optimization involving real-world constraints and quantile-based risk measures. Meanwhile, a comparison of the capabilities of different MOEAs to adapt in any addition of new constraints and/or replacement of the risk function is given in (Anagnostopoulos and Mamanis 2011b), and (Baixauli-Soler et al. 2012) focus on SPEA 2 performance. Recently, hybrid stock trading systems based on evolutionary metaheuristics and mean-CVaR models are proposed in Chen and Wang (2015) and (Qin et al. 2014). The contribution of this study is twofold. On one hand, based on the promising results of (Subbu et al. 2005) and (Baixauli-Soler et al. 2010), we include in the same portfolio optimization framework the loss-averse attitude of investors as well as the capital requirements imposed by the regulator, and we investigate the relationship between semi-variance and CVaR in quantifying the downside risk. On the other hand, we extend the research of (Liu et al. 2010) and investigate the effectiveness of using the uniform selection scheme, the extended intermediate crossover operator (Gen and Cheng 2000; Mühlenbein and Schlierkamp-Voosen 1993), and the Gaussian mutation (Hinterding 1995; Schwefel 1987) in the NSGA-II and SPEA 2 algorithms in order to generate the approximated Pareto fronts for the considered downside risk-based portfolio optimization problems. In addition, the performance of the proposed algorithms is compared to that of other variants of the NSGA-II and SPEA 2 algorithms that have already been shown to be highly competitive in portfolio optimization problems. The results on five publicly available datasets show that our procedures completely dominate the fronts produced by the counterparts from the literature. Furthermore, our variants of the NSGA-II and SPEA 2 algorithms can generate the entire Pareto front for large-scale problems for which the other Pareto-based approaches are unable to work properly. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In “The portfolio selection problem under downside risk measures” section, we introduce three preference relations based on the reward-downside risk principle and discuss the related portfolio selection problems. “Pareto-based evolutionary algorithms” section presents a description of the MOEAs used for solving the resulting optimization problems. “Experimental analysis” section outlines the numerical experiments and “Concluding remarks and future research” section presents concluding remarks and ideas for further research.",28

5.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,11 June 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-019-0141-5,Macroeconomic effects of Mobile money: evidence from Uganda,December 2019,Joseph Mawejje,Paul Lakuma,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There has been growing enthusiasm for, and investigations of, the potential benefits of new financial innovations for poverty reduction and inclusive economic growth (e.g., Chibba 2009). Equally interesting are the implications of such financial innovations for the conduct of monetary policy (Ndirangu and Nyamongo 2015; Mehrotra and Yetman 2015). Mobile money is one such innovation that has revolutionized the financial-sector landscape with regard to the way people save, make payments, and make transfers. There is growing interest in how mobile money might affect macroeconomic outcomes in developing countries (e.g., Nampewo et al. 2016; Aron et al. 2015). The rapid expansion of mobile money has attracted much debate regarding its implications for the growth of the financial sector and the effectiveness of monetary policy. For example, mobile money can facilitate effective monetary policy to the extent that it improves financial inclusion. This is because households with access to formal financial markets can have complete access to instruments that facilitate borrowing and savings. Consequently, changes in policy interest rates have direct effects on intertemporal consumption and investment decisions. Lwanga and Adong (2016) found that having a registered mobile money account increased the likelihood of having some household savings in Uganda. This implies that in the presence of imperfections in financial markets, the increased adoption and use of mobile money could lead to increased formal savings. There are concerns, however, that the proliferation of mobile transactions will change the landscape of traditional banking, carrying implications for financial-sector development, the conduct of monetary policy, and financial-sector regulation. Kamukama and Tumwine (2012) argued that the proliferation of mobile payments in Uganda could disadvantage commercial banks by weakening their liquidity. Concerns have also been raised about the implications of mobile money for the conduct of monetary policy in Uganda. The adoption and use of mobile money imply a gradual substitution of real cash balances for bank deposits. This creates a larger money multiplier since all mobile money balances must be backed up by cash deposits in the escrow account of a partner commercial bank. Moreover, mobile money will obviously increase the velocity of money in circulation because it reduces the time and transaction costs of making retail payments. Indeed, innovations in the financial sector, including mobile money, have been shown to have statistically significant positive long-term effects on money velocity in Uganda (Nampewo and Opolot 2016). At a 2015 conference convened by the International Growth Center in Kampala under the theme “Mobile Money and the Economy,” the governor of the Bank of Uganda expressed his concerns thus: If more radical mobile banking business models are eventually developed in which mobile money becomes a substitute for demand deposits in banks, the ability of central banks to control interest rates could be undermined. This is because central banks control short-term interest rates by varying the liquidity available for commercial banks to meet their reserve requirements. But if mobile money eventually leads to a diminution of the role commercial banks play in the financial system, the interest rate transmission mechanism, which relies on movements in short-term interbank rates being transmitted along the yield curve to all other interest rates in the economy, will be weakened, which in turn will weaken the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. (Tumusiime-Mutebile 2015) Despite these concerns, there is insufficient research on the links between mobile money and its effects on the economy and the conduct of monetary policy. Nampewo et al. (2016) examined the role of mobile money in the supply of private-sector credit in Uganda. Similarly, Aron et al. (2015) examined the relevance of mobile money in inflationary processes. The present study provides novel evidence of the macroeconomic effects of mobile money in Uganda within a broader framework. In particular, this study examined the effects of mobile money on money stock, consumer price index, interest rates, private-sector credit, and gross economic activity. An important aspect of this study is that it establishes the implications of mobile money shocks for the conduct of monetary policy. The results showed that mobile money has moderate positive effects on monetary aggregates, the consumer price index, and private-sector credit. Mobile money transactions are correlated with the composite index of economic activity. Mobile money deposits respond to changes in monetary policy instruments, signaling possible ameliorating effects for the conduct of monetary policy. The rest of this study is structured as follows: Section 2 provides the background for mobile money development in Uganda. Section 3 presents a brief survey of the literature. Section 4 introduces the analytical framework. The data and methods used in the analysis are discussed in section 5. The results are presented and discussed in section 6. Finally, section 7 concludes the study and makes policy recommendations.",15

It is referred as one of the strong and dynamic techniques due to its ability to detect multifractal behavior in non-stationary time series. Especially, local Hurst exponents help point out the discontinuities in the financial time series. Hence, any asymmetric or inconsistent behavior in the time series, such as the failure of any economic system, can be captured. These irregularities are the main reason for the fat tail observations. Local Hurst exponents demonstrate that these irregular behaviors may be organized to be used in various models/methods. Mandelbrot and Ness has laid the foundations of multifractal analysis by introducing fractional Brownian motions, fractional noises and its applications (Mandelbrot & Van Ness, 1968). Later, multifractal de-trended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) has been proposed as an alternative method in analyzing financial time series by (Kantelhardt et al., 2002). Heretofore, there have been many researchers using this method in their analysis. Zhang et al. have investigated asymmetric multiscale multifractal analysis of wind speed signals (Zhang et al., 2017). Multifractal and wavelet analysis of epileptic seizures have been studied by (Dick & Mochovikova, 2011). An in-depth analysis of stocks of the company GE was performed by Thomson and Wilson by contrasting the results with those obtained using multifractal de-trended fluctuation analysis and using conventional time series models (Thompson & Wilson, 2014). Benbachir and Alaoui employed the MF-DFA method in order to explore the multifractal properties of the Moroccan Dirham compared with the US Dollars (Benbachir & Alaoui, 2011). Zhu and Zhang studies the multifractal property of Chinese stock market in the CSI 800 index based on MF-DFA approach (Zhu & Zhang, 2017) and concluded that the shape and width of multifractal spectrum are dependent on the weighing order and Hurst exponents can account for the market crash. (Sensoy, 2013) studies the time-varying efficiency of 15 Middle East and North African (MENA) stock markets by generalized Hurst exponent analysis of daily data with a rolling window technique and concludes that all MENA stock markets exhibits different long range dependence. In other study, Sensoy and Tabak proposes an alternative index to model time-varying inefficiency in stock markets using generalized Hurst exponents calculations (Sensoy & Tabak, 2015). (Tiwari et al., 2017) in 2016 challenges efficient hypothesis using the generalized Hurst exponent and MF-DFA methods. In our study, we will show that obtaining coherent time series lead to more accurate forecasting results because not only the long-run effects but also the short and long term dynamics can be taken into considerations simultaneously. The wavelet analysis is also one of the methods in scrutinizing the time series. Unlike Fourier transform, as Burrus et al. indicated, wavelet analysis does not need stationarity (Burrus et al., 1998) and is able to look deep into the frequency information of the series at different scales without losing time information (Reboredo & Rivera-Castro, 2014) which helps eliminate the weaknesses in Fourier transform (Gülerce & Ünal, 2016). Gencay’s study (Gencay, 2002) has become a pioneer work for many researchers using wavelet tools to analyze financial time series in many studies such as (Aguiar-Conraria & Soares, 2012; Aguiar-Conraria & Soares, 2013), (Barunik et al. 2013), and (McCarthy & Orlov, 2012). Multi-scale analysis is accepted as one of the main applications of wavelet methods in finance and economics (Haven, 2012). There have been many investigations looking into the relation of precious metals using these types of tools. Kucher and McCoskey indicated that the long-run relationships between precious metal prices are strongly influenced by economic conditions using a vector error correction model (Kucher & McCoskey, 2017). A flexible modification of the dynamic conditional correlation model that accounts for asymmetry and long memory in variance is applied on precious metals by (Klein, 2017). He et al. uses wavelet analysis and autoregressive moving average model with higher accuracy to forecast prices of precious metals (He et al., 2017). Das et al. suggest intense and positive co-movement in Asian gold spot markets after the Asian financial crises of 1997 at all frequencies (Das et al., 2017). To the best of our knowledge, multifractal de-trended fluctuation analysis along with multiple wavelet coherence analysis of precious metals has not been studied to this extent heretofore. In this paper, we will use a software package for wavelet coherence analysis provided by (Torrence & Compo, 1998) and (Grinsted et al., 2004) and a Matlab tool for multifractal de-trended fluctuation analysis developed by (Ihlen, 2012). The former will be used to analyze inter relations, co-movement dependencies, frequent and consistent signals in multiple financial time series of precious metals (gold, silver and platinum). The latter will be used to confirm their multifractal behavior, calculate local Hurst exponents and obtain the inter-calculated fractal function time series at specific scale determined. Multiple wavelet coherence will be used to determine the specific time period and scale that possesses common long range dependence out of the time series. With the help of Matlab tool, the multifractal behavior of these time series will be validated and a new series out of local Hurst exponent calculations will be obtained. These new series will be modeled using multivariate methods and forecasted accordingly. The first multivariate model has been introduced by Quenouille in 1957 (Akaike, 1974) and later improved by Akaike (Dunsmuir & Hannan, 1976), Dunsmuir and Hannan (Hannan, 1981) and Hannan (Oral & Unal, 2017a) in order. Multivariate models are a dynamic system of equations that examine the impacts of fluctuations (shocks) or correlations (interactions) between financial variables (Oral & Unal, 2017a). Multivariate modeling is because of the fact that more information out of multiple highly correlated data can be used and low mean-squared errors compared to univariate models may be obtained (Oral & Unal, 2017b). Moreover, multifractal nature of our data urges us to employ vector autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average method. Gold is treated as hedging instrument against inflation and exchange rates (Hammoudeh et al., 2010) and, in many papers, reported as an indicator of inflation (Ranson & Wainright, 2005). Likewise, Mahdavi and Zhou points that commodity prices respond to new information faster than any consumer price (Mahdavi & Zhou, 1997). Therefore, results obtained from a successful forecasting of gold with smaller error bands may help and support both finance researchers as well as many different players in financial world such as monetary policymakers, hedge fund managers, portfolio managers, centrals banks and investors while making investment decisions. As far as we know there is no general method about forecasting of data possessing multifractal nature and we believe our paper will serve well during these type of decision-making processes. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 covers the data and methodology used in this paper. The main equation of continuous wavelet transform and multiple wavelet coherence, basics of multifractal de-trended fluctuations analysis and vector autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average model will be included as a summary review. In section 3, multiple wavelet coherence will be utilized to detect the highly correlated time periods and frequencies. After the multifractal characteristics of the series are verified, a new series of fractional function will be obtained out of local Hurst exponent calculations at the specified scale. Section 4 will compare and discuss the forecasting results of both multivariate and univariate models. Section 5 will be ended with the discussion of the results. In Appendix 1 will display two forecasting results of each metal couple along with the plot of the data set extracted from the local Hurst exponents’ calculations at the specified period.",12

Tindall,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"China’s annual GDP growth has averaged more than 9% since 2000. Meanwhile, the Chinese stock market has experienced substantial fluctuations during this period. The Shanghai Composite Index reached a historical high of over 6000 in October 2007, only to fall to approximately half that level at present. This disparity between rapidly growing GDP and lackluster stock market performance poses a dilemma for investors. How can one benefit from the burgeoning Chinese economy by investing in the Chinese stock market? As Rapach and Zhou (2013) have indicated, forecasting stock returns is extremely challenging in general; this task is even more difficult when it involves the turbulent Chinese stock market. Kang et al. (2002) studied contrarian and momentum strategies for the Chinese stock market in earlier years, while Li et al. (2017) examined the performance of trends following strategies in Chinese commodity futures markets. The recent introduction of advanced statistical approaches to portfolio management, such as machine learning, has been highly successful (e.g. Li and Hoi 2015; Shen and Wang 2017; Wu et al. 2018; Gu et al. 2019). This paper presents a statistical learning approach to select top-performing Chinese stocks that can potentially generate superior returns and significantly outperform the market. Some researchers have attempted to identify the underlying drivers for Chinese stock returns. Wang and Xu (2004) discovered that the value factor does not explain the cross-sectional differences in the Chinese stock market due to the market’s speculative nature and low-quality accounting information. On the other hand, the size factor does carry certain explanatory power. Kling and Gao (2008) explored the positive feedback process between Chinese stock share prices and institutional investors’ sentiment. Further, Yuan et al. (2008) found that the equity ownership of mutual funds positively effects performance. These types of information can all contribute to the stock selection process. However, these methods benefit institutional rather than individual investors, as the latter cannot easily access this information. Given the Chinese stock market’s poor performance, an increasing number of institutions and investors are searching for stocks with high excess returns compared to the Shanghai Composite Index. Empirical finance often ranks stocks according to a risk factor over a look-back window, and long and short stock positions are subsequently taken according to this ranking. Literature has also proposed numerous factors (Fama and French 1992; Ang et al. 2006; Frazzini and Pedersen 2014), with Harvey et al. (2016) identifying more than 200 such factors. Factor-ranking procedures are simple and effective, but have some inherent problems. For example, a particular factor’s risk premium may be unstable over time. Fama and French (1992) found that their value factor exhibits a positive risk premium over the long-term in the U.S. market; however, we discovered that the value premium—estimated as the annual return difference between the Russell 1000 Value Index and Russell 1000 Growth Index—has been negative in all five-year rolling windows from 2009 to 2015. The simple factor-ranking approach can be extended to include multiple risk factors in the portfolio-formation process, but this creates another problem. If we follow a traditional approach, we would select stocks ranked in the top group for all risk factors. However, a high-dimensional problem occurs with many factors, in that the stocks would be scattered sparsely in an N-dimensional space, with N being the number of factors that we would incorporate. It may be impossible to find enough stocks in the top rankings of all factors to form a diversified portfolio. One could use an ad hoc method by applying a composite score to combine the factors into a ranking. Mohanram (2005) combined traditional fundamental factors to create an index-GSCORE. While a long-short strategy based on the GSCORE earns significant excess returns, this method lacks theoretical guidance about how to assign weights among factors, and subjective factors always influence the method’s precision in forming a composite score. These problems make the method unstable in practice. As previously mentioned, both simple and multiple factor-ranking approaches cannot effectively construct a portfolio with the highest future return, and thus, we must consider other ways to improve performance. Cross-sectional regression plays an important role in finance to explain variations in stock prices (Sharpe 1964; Fama and French 1992; Carhart 1997). For example, Fama and French (1992) indicate that the cross-section regression provides a good description of returns on portfolios formed based on size, BE/ME, and term-structure risk factors. This leads to the gradual development of a method for determining factors’ weight through regressions. While some subsequent works (Hou et al. 2015; Fama and French 2015) attempted to discover more factors to explain stock returns using cross-sectional regression models, the regressions’ accuracy is undermined by the effects of multicollinearity and overfitting using a large number of factors. In this paper, we propose an advanced statistical model, the elastic net (Zou and Hastie 2005), to resolve this issue when regressing stock returns over a large number of factors. Our method differs from most existing methods by building cross-sectional forecast models for stock returns, and selects stocks based on these models’ predicted returns. Our approach is rooted in the Fama-French-Carhart model (Carhart 1997), hereafter “the FFC four-factor model,” but greatly expands its scope to include more statistical factors. Given the low quality of accounting information in the Chinese stock market, we focus on forecasting future returns using only the statistical factors derived from historical stock prices. We handle this as a supervised statistical learning problem in which portfolios are formed according to the forecast returns’ rankings. We find that the highest ranked portfolios generate robust and superior performance. Our forecast methods deviate from traditional econometric approaches and are more in line with the approach taken by Varian (2014), who argues that data analysis in statistics and econometrics can be divided into four categories: 1) prediction, 2) summarization, 3) estimation, and 4) hypothesis testing. The statistical learning methods that we employ fall into the first category as our goal is to identify the stocks with the highest future returns. This paper contributes to existing literature in the following ways. First, the proposed statistical learning approaches effectively rank, and hence select, the top performing stocks relying on the predictability of the forecast model. This is different from traditional cross-sectional regression models (Fama and French 1992; Carhart 1997). Second, building a statistical learning model provides a data-adaptive guidance on how to combine information from different factors (which we treat as features) in the proposed forecast model. Third, the use of the elastic net estimator (Zou and Hastie 2005) improves the estimation precision (accuracy) of the forecast model when multicollinearity is present and also avoids the overfitting that occurs when a large number of features are considered. Another advantage of the proposed method is its interpretability and feature selection capability. Lastly, the proposed stock selection framework is flexible and can be modified by investors to include user-specific features. The remainder of our paper is organized as follows: Section 2 discusses our motivation and explains the proposed methodology. Subsequently, Section 3 presents the data and features used in this study. Section 4 presents the empirical results, while the final section concludes.",9
5.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,24 April 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-019-0134-4,On the monetary measures of global liquidity,December 2019,Israr Ahmad Shah Hashmi,Arshad Ali Bhatti,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In the aftermath of the global financial crisis (hereafter GFC), global liquidity has remained central to the debate on an international financial system. There prevails a perception that global liquidity is a powerful driver of cross-border capital flows, global inflation, asset prices, and financial stability (Cohen et al. 2017). The monetary aggregates view recognizes its role as one of the chief determinants of aggregate demand, goods price inflation and cross-border macroeconomic spillovers (Chen et al. 2012; Rüffer and Stracca 2006; Baks and Kramer 1999). Another stance, supported by empirical findings, is of the view that an abnormal increase in private credit coupled with a rise in asset prices may lead to financial distress (Borio and Drehmann 2009). Aggregate credit flows are also closely associated with financial vulnerability. This international component is of much significance in the assessment of global liquidity. Though international credit is very small relative to domestic credit, it is highly correlated with booms and busts in global financial conditions (Cohen et al., 2017; CGFS 2011). Despite the tremendous importance of global liquidity lime lighted by many empirical studies, it still lacks agreed definition and measure (Domanski et al. 2011; Landau 2011). Generally, global liquidity is considered as an “ease of financing in global financial centres”, though it is a challenging task. Therefore, global liquidity remains an elusive concept (Cohen et al. 2017; Domanski et al. 2011). The concept of global liquidity can best be explained by shedding light on its foundations. Liquidity, in general, refers to the degree of ease and speed with which an asset can be converted into another asset (purchasing power). Keeping in view this notion of ‘liquidity’ and in the context of current financial system, two concepts of global liquidity are most important: market liquidity and funding liquidity (CGFS 2011). Market liquidity refers to the situation where immediate or short notice sale of an asset has least impact on its price. A lesser impact on asset price is associated with more market liquidity. Similarly, funding liquidity involves raising cash by borrowing with least impact on borrowing cost. Less of an impact on borrowing cost indicates greater funding liquidity (Cohen et al. 2017). A wide range of measures of different aspects of global liquidity are suggested in the literature.Footnote 1 The selection of measures depends primarily on the aspect of global liquidity being focused on. Constructing the measure of global liquidity, one must be mindful of the fact that global liquidity is mainly determined by the interactions of financial institutions and private investors. Financial institutions fetch market liquidity to the securities market through their trading activities (buying securities) and funding liquidity to the borrowers through their lending activities. But the question arises: Which measure, or aspect of global liquidity is relatively better to explain financial and macroeconomic conditions? To answer this question, some researchers are of the view that various concepts of liquidity are closely related (Baks and Kramer 1999; Cohen et al. 2017). For instance, monetary liquidity can be an important source of funding in the securities market. Increased market liquidity lowers the funding cost (interest rate) and hence supports market making activities. The net supply of securities might tend to increase in periods of ample market liquidity because monetary markets are generally receptive to new issues. On the other hand, money demand, willingness of financial institutions and investors to take risk, willingness of corporations to take on debt, and global liquidity may increase simultaneously during periods of improved economic prospects. Clearly, relationships among different types of liquidity assign a key role to central banks and hence to monetary liquidity (Baks and Kramer 1999). Monetary and credit measures are therefore the best options to proxy the quantity and volume of global liquidity. Moreover, other aspects of global liquidity are also primarily determined by money and credit supply in global financial centres. The ability of financial and non-financial institutions to advance credit is further determined by the availability of monetary services in the market. Thus, credit can also be proxied by monetary assets (Chung et al., 2014). Inspired by this stance, our study also constructs monetary measures of global liquidity. This investigation constructs and examines the dynamics and correlation of the secular components of global real economic activity along with its lags of five different monetary measures of global liquidity: simple sum, GDP-weighted growth rates, currency equivalent (hereafter CE), Divisia index, and Principal Component Analysis (hereafter PCA) based measures. We firstly construct and investigate the dynamics of aggregates at a regional level and then at a global level. For this, sampled countries are grouped into five regional blocks, as categorized by the World Bank. The regional blocks are: (i) East Asia and the Pacific (ii) Europe and Central Asia (iii) Latin America and the Caribbean (iv) Middle East and North Africa, and (v) North America. On our end, we use monthly data for sampled high income countries, spanning the period December 2001 to December 2017. The study is organized as follows: section 2 reviews the measures of global liquidity suggested and utilized by theorists and empirical researchers, section 3 describes the data and its sources, section 4 elaborates the aggregation procedures involved in different measures, section 5 examines and discusses the dynamics of aggregates and the connection between secular components, whereas section 6 contains the conclusion and policy recommendations.",2

However, access to requisite financing has been noted to be a critical challenge in many developing countries (Anang, Sipiläinen, Bäckman and Kola, 2015). Therefore, bridging the financing gap of these farmers must become a priority. Where this is absent, farmers often rely on informal instruments, which although are accessible and flexible they are also inefficient and costly in the short term and do not always offer the support needed to help transform subsistence farming into a profitable business (Okonjo-Iweala and Madan, 2016). Unfortunately, due to the challenges associated with delivering rural and agricultural finance, most commercial financial institutions are not interested in financing farmers and other rural clients because they represent a less familiar, riskier, and less profitable market than their more traditional urban clientele (World Council of Credit Union (WOCCU, 2009). There is thus the need to urgently explore innovative approaches to rural and agricultural finance (IFPRI, 2010). In this context, value chain financing (VCF) presents an innovative approach to rural and agricultural financing, as it enables the understanding of both financing within a value chain and financing tailored to fit a value chain (Miller and Jones, 2010). Specifically, agricultural VCF is the financing of agriculture and agribusiness within a chain, aligning and structuring finance with the chain or as a result of its existence (AfDB, 2013). Fundamentally, this framework hinges on market orientation, without which the resulting financial services would fail, and its approach requires that financial institutions consider the financial potential of the entire value chain, not only the creditworthiness of individuals. This focus shift allows financial institutions to more accurately measure and mitigate risk. However, this type of finance is not always available, and actors in agricultural and rural value chains frequently complain about the lack of access to financial services (WOCCU, 2009). In Nigeria, the various financing windows provided by the federal government through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) are presently not fully utilized by farmers due to a lack of awareness. Further, many of the previously implemented financing initiatives were rather from an “intervention perspective” than a participatory perspective, often ignoring the need for farmers’ participation in drawing out financing initiatives. Therefore, while these financing measures have attempted to overcome existing barriers and expand access to formal finance in rural communities, their success has been rather elusive. As a result, many rural households in Nigeria still lack access to reliable and affordable finance for agriculture and other livelihood activities (IFPRI, 2010). In this context, the VCF approach ensures that actors within a value chain are actively involved in the process and creation of financial products that fit the chain, as well as agree with the financing institutions on the workable and acceptable modalities for such financing. The plantain (Musa Spp) is considered a “high value crop” with enormous potential, Nigeria being ranked among the 20 most important plantain-producing countries worldwide (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2011). However, the production concentrated in the southern part of the country is inconsistent and low, being mostly produced by small-scale farmers (Federal Office of Statistics, 1999; Akinyemi, Aiyelaagbe and Akyeampong, 2010). Therefore, an increased plantain production through VCF is desirable, as the crop has the ability to contribute to food security, employment, diversification of income sources in rural and urban areas, and gross national product Nkenda and Akyeampong (2003). While there exist ex-ante studies in agriculture using the economic surplus model, many of these studies however focused on innovations as it concerns inputs such as crop varieties, fertilizers and herbicides. Ex-ante studies on innovative agricultural financing initiatives are very rare. Also, many studies have analyzed ex-post the impact of financing initiatives, studies on the ex-ante impact of financing innovations (i.e., prior to their implementation) are scarce. This literature gap has partly contributed to the lack of success of some previous financing initiatives in Nigeria such as the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme Fund (ACGSF) initiated since 1978; Small and Medium Enterprises Equity Investment Scheme (SMEEIS); Refinancing and Rediscounting Facility (RRF), established in 2002 and; The Large Scale Agricultural Credit Scheme (LASACS), established in 2009. The more recently initiated financing programmes includes the Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) initiated by the Central Bank of Nigeria in 2016 as well as the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk-Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL). Many of these financing initiatives were implemented with little or no appreciable impact on agricultural production as no initial studies were carried out to determine their potential impact before implementation. This study however focuses on assessing the potential benefits derivable from VCF in meeting the financial needs of plantain producers towards increasing production.",2

Supply and demand of shares drive the stock market. In any country stock market is one of the most emerging sectors. Nowadays, many people are indirectly or directly related to this sector. Therefore, it becomes essential to know about market trends. Thus, with the development of the stock market, people are interested in forecasting stock price. But, due to dynamic nature and liable to quick changes in stock price, prediction of the stock price becomes a challenging task. Stock markets are mostly a non-parametric, non-linear, noisy and deterministic chaotic system (Ahangar et al. 2010). As the technology is increasing, stock traders are moving towards to use Intelligent Trading Systems rather than fundamental analysis for predicting prices of stocks, which helps them to take immediate investment decisions. One of the main aims of a trader is to predict the stock price such that he can sell it before its value decline, or buy the stock before the price rises. The efficient market hypothesis states that it is not possible to predict stock prices and that stock behaves in the random walk. It seems to be very difficult to replace the professionalism of an experienced trader for predicting the stock price. But because of the availability of a remarkable amount of data and technological advancements we can now formulate an appropriate algorithm for prediction whose results can increase the profits for traders or investment firms. Thus, the accuracy of an algorithm is directly proportional to gains made by using the algorithm.",113
5.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,20 March 2019,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-019-0121-9,A dynamic credit risk assessment model with data mining techniques: evidence from Iranian banks,December 2019,Saba Moradi,Farimah Mokhatab Rafiei,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"A commercial bank, hereafter referred to as a bank, is a type of financial institution that provides services such as accepting deposits, making business loans, and offering basic investment products. Inevitably, banks must take risks in giving loans and credit cards to customers because these are economic drivers. This is delicate because a bank’s survival is tied to taking appropriate risks; a non-risk-taking bank is as vulnerable as an overly-risk-taking one (Narindra Mandalaa & Fransiscus, 2012). Therefore, when banks are faced with a risk, appropriate risk management depends on identifying, understanding, measuring, and finally providing appropriate strategies towards it (Bekhet & Eletter, 2014). According to the Basel 2 accord, credit risk is one of the risks that banks face in allocating resources. It is defined as the probability of non-payment or delayed payment by customers or their inability to repay a loan (Cisko & Klieštik, 2013). Customers with a high probability of loan repayment are classified in the good customer group and customers with a high probability of default are classified in the bad customer group (Akkoc, 2012). Credit risk assessment is vital for banks; they must ensure that borrowers are able to pay their installments before allocating a loan to them (Narindra Mandalaa & Fransiscus, 2012). According to Basel 2, each bank needs to organize and develop its own internal credit scoring system with which they can analyze a borrower’s risk. This has led to an upsurge in the demand for scoring systems that can accurately model risks at high resolution; some institutions are remunerated very well to develop such models for banks upon request. These credit-scoring techniques can then be used as decision support tools or as automated decision algorithms for a wide range of customers (Heiat, 2012). Most current credit risk models have been developed based on trial and error and lack a theoretical framework (Wang et al., 2014). Moreover, most of these models are static and are unable to function efficiently in economic crises. Traditionally, banks have used static modeling frameworks to assess customer credit risks; however, the lack of responsiveness to the evolving economic environment renders these models inefficient, especially in the face of concept drifts, where a portion of previously good costumers fall into default (i.e., become bad customers). While, the traditional static models have proven to work reasonably well during periods of stasis, they fail to do so in the face of economic and political fluctuations. This is especially evident in Iran, after the governing regime (the Islamic Republic) came under several international political and economic sanctions. Consequently, the number of non-performing loans (NPLs) increased and many Iranian customers became unable to repay their obligations. As new factors were introduced during this period, the model criteria needed to be updated, as well. Opting for appropriate factors that work well in all circumstances is difficult (if not impossible); therefore, a dynamic model that can accommodate new factors is desirable. In this paper, we introduce a new model that can accommodate changing uncertain factors as well as the more stable certain factors used in static models.",39

Awad,Mohammed S. Al Karaki,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The modern economy is a credit economy. The economy requires credit for different purposes; one main purpose is to promote economic activities (Nwaru and Okorontah 2014). Credit fuels economic activities by allowing businesses to invest beyond their cash on hand, households to purchase homes without saving the entire cost in advance, and governments to smooth out their spending by mitigating the cyclical pattern of tax revenues and in investing in infrastructure projects. The influence of credit on economic growth has been widely debated in economic literature over the last decades. Therefore, he goes to a moneylender to borrow the cash under his friend’s guarantee. The moneylender, Shylock, demands a pound of flesh as security if the money is not paid back. Accordingly, paying more attention to uncertainty and risk is necessary to be taken into account (Awad and Al-Ewesat 2017). Furthermore, the more you grow, the more you become powerful. The earliest Italian banks adapted this thought; the Medici Bank, which had multiple relevant partnerships moved from financial success to hereditary status and power. The Medici Bank achieved this by adapting the risk diversification and by engaging in currency trading as well as lending. As a result, they reduced their vulnerability to defaults (Ferguson 2008). Banking activity is confirmed to be a significant factor in driving local economic growth, in line with the empirical literature on the relationship between finance and economic growth (Caporalea et al. 2016). In line with this, bank lending in the euro area has continued to expand. In 2017, loans to households grew by 2.8% and loans to non-financial corporations by 2.9% (European Economic Forecast Winter 2018). However, the link between bank lending and economic growth has important policy implications for development strategies. Especially, in the field of increasing the rate of economic growth in spite of the limited role of the banking sector to control the money supply and its effects on the economy. Therefore, the statement of problem measures “The impact of bank lending on the economic growth in Palestine during the period from 1996 to 2015”. The primary goal of the study is to examine the impact of bank lending on economic growth in Palestine. The specific objectives are to (1) Investigate whether it is possible to use bank lending as the means of long-term economic growth, and if so, under which conditions; (2) Understand the relationship between bank lending and economic growth with other economic indicators; and (3) Apply Granger causality test to examine the causal relationships between the examined variables.",7

Furthermore, the financialization of the commodity markets has provided valuable tools for managing portfolio risks (Erb and Harvey 2006; Silvennoinen and Thorp 2013). As a commodity, crude oil has a well-recognized impact on equity markets worldwide. Early studies of the impact of oil prices on aggregate stock returns are limited to specific countries, with mixed findings. Some studies find a positive relationship (Narayan and Narayan 2010; Zhu et al. 2011; Zhu et al. 2014; Silvapulle et al. 2017), others find a negative relationship (Gjerde and Saettem 1999; Sadorsky 1999; Papapetrou 2001; Basher and Sadorsky 2006; Driesprong et al. 2008; Park and Ratti 2008; Chen 2009; Filis 2010; Basher et al. 2012), and still others find no relationship (Huang et al. 1996; Cong et al. 2008; Apergis and Miller 2009; Miller and Ratti 2009; Reboredo and Rivero-Castro 2014; Hatemi et al. 2017). These conflicting results may arise owing to several underlying pitfalls in the studies, such as not considering the level of oil dependence among stock markets, not explicitly considering heterogeneity in the context in which the aggregate index is exposed to gains or losses from changes in the oil price, the nature of the oil price shock considered, and the time-varying element used (Smyth and Narayan 2018). Whereas earlier studies assume linear and symmetrical adjustment processes for the underlying variables (Zhu et al. 2011), the current view favors assuming an asymmetrical effect of oil prices on stock returns (Basher and Sadorsky 2006; Kilian 2008; Kilian and Park 2009; Arouri 2011; Aggarwal et al. 2012; Asteriou and Bashmakova 2013; Narayan and Gupta 2015; Phan et al. 2015; Kang et al. 2016; Li et al. 2017). This view is further supported by the nonlinear characteristics of the oil price-stock return relationship. However, some empirical studies do not support this view, as they either find no asymmetric effects (Bachmeier 2008; Cong et al. 2008; Nandha and Faff 2008; Mollick and Assefa 2013; Reboredo and Rivero-Castro 2014; Asalman and Herrera 2015; Reboredo and Ugolini 2016) or only find evidence for such effects in oil-importing countries in the period after the global financial crisis (Ramos and Veiga 2013). Failure to account for the mixed heterogeneous effects of positive and negative oil price shocks on individual stock returns and merely considering aggregate stock returns may result in these conflicting findings (Tsai 2015). Furthermore, Kilian (2008) seminal work demonstrates that the nature of the oil price structural shock, be it an oil supply shock, aggregate demand shock, or oil-specific demand shock, could be an important factor in the oil–stock interplay, and failure to consider it may result in erroneous findings (Kilian and Park 2009). The period during which each type of stock gains dominance can be obtained by decomposing oil price data (Fueki et al. 2016). Performing this analysis shows that oil supply shocks were mainly influential from the second half of 2013 through the first half of 2015. Currently, oil supply shocks are no longer as important to macroeconomic developments, and aggregate demand shocks are seen as more influential (Kang et al. 2016). Further, empirical evidence shows that the effect of the oil price on equity returns varies considerably across sectors depending on the nature of the structural shock (Broadstock and Filis 2014). The effect of an oil supply shock is found to be positive (Basher et al. 2012; Abhyankar et al. 2013) or negative (Gupta and Modise 2013; Cunado and de Gracia 2014). For oil-specific demand shocks, however, the empirical evidence almost unanimously suggests a negative effect on equity returns in oil-importing countries (Filis et al. 2011; Basher et al. 2012; Abhyankar et al. 2013; Gupta and Modise 2013; Güntner 2014; Koh 2017) and a positive effect for Norway, an oil-exporting nation. Another puzzling feature of the oil–stock relationship is that it exhibits different behaviors in periods of low and high economic volatility; in other words, it varies over time. Quite a few studies focus on this feature, primarily using Markov-switching vector autoregression (VAR) models, regime switching models, wavelet decomposition, or frequency domain methods (Aloui and Jimmazi 2009; Chen 2009; Mohanty et al. 2010; Reboredo 2010; Jammazi and Aloui 2010; Daskalaki and Skiadopolous 2011; Filis et al. 2011; Chang and Yu 2013; Ciner 2013; Broadstock and Filis 2014; Reboredo and Rivero-Castro, 2014; Zhang and Li 2014; Kang et al. 2015; Martin-Barragan et al. 2015; Xu 2015; Zhang 2017; Zhu et al. 2017). Concurrently, studies have examined the role of oil price volatility on stock returns using both generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH)-type models and structural VAR models (Äijö 2008; Arouri and Nguyen 2010; Choi and Hammoudeh 2010; Elyasiani et al. 2011; Chen 2014; Lin et al. 2014; Narayan and Sharma 2014; Kang et al. 2015; Salisu and Oloko 2015; Awartani et al. 2016; Maghyereh et al. 2016; Bouri et al. 2017a, 2017b). The findings show that the volatility spillovers across markets can be strong and are significantly influenced by structural breaks, indicating a heterogeneous volatility transmission phenomenon with potential economic significance for hedging purposes. Thus, the recommended approach involves using the implied rather than the historical volatility in analyzing the cross-market association, as the former is a more accurate predictor of investor sentiment. Many studies have focused on the effect of the oil price–stock returns relationship at the sector level (Cong et al. 2008; Arouri 2011; Elyasiani et al. 2011; Narayan and Sharma 2011; Lee et al. 2012; Li et al. 2012; Moya-Martinez et al. 2014; Caporale et al. 2015; Xu 2015; Zhu et al. 2016; Li et al. 2017; Peng et al. 2017), and many specifically focus on the oil and gas sector (Sadorsky 2001; Boyer and Filion 2007; Cong et al. 2008; Nandha and Faff 2008; Gupta 2016; Li et al. 2017). A key conclusion of these studies is that oil price increases positively affect the stock returns of firms in the oil and gas sector (Smyth and Narayan 2018), with a prolonged nonlinear relationship that strengthens over time (Managi and Okimoto 2013). However, the bulk of these studies focus on developed economies and rarely extend their analyses to emerging or transition markets. At the country level, studies have been conducted for oil-importing (Masih et al. 2011; Cunado and de Gracia 2014; Bouri 2015; Silvapulle et al. 2017) and oil-exporting countries (Bjornland 2009; Arouri and Rault 2012; Mohanty et al. 2011; Ramos and Veiga 2013; Gil-Alana and Yaya 2014; Demirer et al. 2015), as is intuitive. Although their findings vary, these studies generally find that oil prices positively affect equity returns in oil-exporting countries (Smyth and Narayan 2018). Only a limited number of previous studies examine the oil price–stock relationship in Iran, and few focus on the effect on the price index of the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) (Najafabadi et al. 2012) or its volatility (Davoudi et al. 2018). Based on the above literature review, this study makes a two-fold contribution to the existing literature. It provides the first analysis of the oil price impact on equity returns in Iran’s oil sector, and it uses a firsthand application of the quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method and Bayesian network (BN) theory in this setting. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides a description and preliminary analysis of the data. Section 3 outlines the research methodology used in the empirical investigation. A discussion of the results is presented in Section 4, followed by the concluding remarks.",6

Hedge funds have been pessimistic to regulation and disclosure as they fear that regulation can constraint their money making abilities and that full disclosure would lead to others copying their trades. Investors were happy with the elusive and non-transparent structure of hedge funds when they delivered double digit returns and low market correlation, however, the 2008–2009 economic crisis and recovery has shown that hedge funds are not entirely immune to market events (Sourd 2009). Hedge funds engage in techniques such as shorting to protect against adverse market returns and to maintain a lower correlation to the overall market. However, studies have shown that although they exhibit low correlation and superior returns during market uptrends, they tend to be severely affected during market downturns (Agarwal and Naik 2004). Investors are beginning to question the value they receive in exchange for paying the high fees charged by hedge funds, which have typically charged a management fee of 1–2% of assets and an incentive-based performance fee of 15–20% (Fung and Hsieh 1999). Growing investor concerns are beginning to encourage investors to look for alternatives that offer complete transparency along with daily liquidity, helping to avoid lock-up periods often associated with hedge funds (Suarez 2011). Agarwal and Naik (2000) found that performance persistence decreases as the return measurement period increases, and that persistence in losers is higher than among winners, making hedge fund selection important. Malkiel and Saha (2005) also showed a lack of persistence in the performance of hedge funds. There is also evidence that the allure of hedge funds might be overstated. Hedge fund indexes showing stellar performance include funds that are closed to new investments, with the performance of investable funds having been found to be significantly inferior to the performance of the non-investable indexes (Feldman et al. 2009). Choosing a hedge fund that is available to new investors in another challenge that needs extensive and expensive due diligence. This is somewhat addressed by investing in fund-of-funds hedge funds, which handle the due diligence and diversification process effectively, but this comes at the cost of an additional layer of fees. Research found that the average fund-of-funds hedge fund does not offer statistically significant alpha (Fung et al. 2008), with any alpha delivered often consumed by fees (Fung and Hsieh 2007). A lack of consistency among hedge fund index providers also casts doubts over their usefulness; the heterogeneity across providers makes performance measurement of hedge fund categories difficult to analyze, and research has found convertible arbitrage to be the only truly homogenous category of hedge funds across hedge fund index providers (Kugler et al. 2010). The effects of missing returns in hedge fund databases are often debated. However, Edelman et al. (2012) showed that this is not a serious concern as missing returns of liquidated funds are offset by successful funds that choose to stop reporting. After Sharpe (1992) used an asset class factor model to decompose the performance of mutual funds, the focus shifted to hedge funds and substantial research has established that a significant component of hedge fund returns are made up of systemic exposures that can be expressed in terms of liquid tradable instruments. Fung and Hsieh (2004) used a seven-factor model showing that up to 80% of the variance of returns of some broad hedge fund indexes can be explained by using a combination of equity and options based factors. Fung and Hsieh (2001) used look-back straddles to replicate the returns of trend followers. Jaeger and Wagner (2005) used a multi-linear asset factor model that showed good results for strategies such as long/short and short bias, but performed poorly for complex strategies such as managed futures and equity market neutral. Li et al. (2013) used factor models to highlight potential applications in hedging market exposure for estimating daily VaR and the daily performance of hedge funds. Within the last few years, researchers have also been replicating hedge fund returns (Hasanhodzic and Lo 2007; Kat and Palaro 2005), with hedge fund replication products, or clones, being a viable alternative to hedge funds for investors who are unable to meet the accreditation requirements needed to invest in hedge funds, as well as those investors challenged by the high minimum investments that hedge funds typically require. Institutional and sophisticated investors could consider hedge fund clones as they provide a significant cost advantage over hedge funds, offer daily liquidity, and are scalable to the capacity of investments that institutional investors can make. The clones also have an advantage in terms of transparency and ease of monitoring. The difficulty associated with selecting a hedge fund make clones an accessible choice that an investor can use to gain immediate exposure to the desired hedge fund strategy. Hedge fund replication can be broadly classified into three categories: distribution replication, rules-based replication, and factor modeling. Distribution replication focuses the replication on the statistical properties of the hedge fund returns rather than tracking the monthly returns of the funds (Kat and Palaro 2005). This strategy is complex and can be difficult to implement, sometimes becoming more complicated than the underlying hedge fund trading strategies. Rules-based replication uses a set of defined trading rules to capture the core processes of specific hedge fund styles; a sub-category of this type of replication often used is mechanical replication. Mechanical replication seeks to mimic the holding of hedge funds, however, limitations in disclosures by hedge funds make this an ineffective strategy that suffers from lag even when copying the holdings revealed in the 13F filing of top managers. Factor modeling offers a simple and easy to implement model that can be used to effectively replicate or clone various sub-styles of hedge funds. Hasanhodzic and Lo (2007) showed that by using a simple factor model made up of easily tradable factors, replication of funds could be achieved to a great extent. Although using a common set of factors can result in a low cost approach for replicating hedge fund returns, there should be some benefit for improving clone risk-reward performance from using strategy specific factors. Therefore, this work extends the traditional hedge fund replication analysis to cover individual hedge fund strategies that now focus on the importance of selecting the factor exposures that are economically relevant to each fund strategy. After discussing the modeling building methodology and approach used for this research, the selection of strategy specific factors are discussed in detail. A results comparison of the strategy specific clone risk and reward performance against both actual hedge fund performance and hedge fund clones constructed using a more general set of common factors are then presented; testing shows that using strategy specific factors to replicate common hedge fund strategies can offer superior risk-reward performance compared to previous general model clones. Finally, concluding remarks are provided.",

For example, according to the Investment Company Institute, the total mutual fund asset globally as at the end of 2016 was in excess of $40.4 trillion. To date the largest mutual fund markets are located in United States ($18.9 trillion), Luxembourg ($3.9 trillion), Ireland ($2.2 trillion), Germany ($1.9 trillion), France ($1.9 trillion), Australia ($1.6 trillion), United Kingdom ($1.5 trillion), Japan ($1.5 trillion), China ($1.3 trillion) and Brazil ($1.1 trillion) (Chattopadhyay et al. 2018). In the United States, mutual funds play an important role in U.S. household finances. At the end of 2016, 22% of household financial assets were held in mutual funds. Their role in retirement savings was even more significant, since mutual funds accounted for roughly half of the assets in individual retirement accounts, 401(k) s and other similar retirement plans (Song et al. 2017). In total, mutual funds are large investors in stocks and bonds. Luxembourg and Ireland are the primary jurisdictions for the registration of UCITS funds. These funds may be sold throughout the European Union and in other countries that have adopted mutual recognition regimes (El Ghoul and Karoui 2017). Quarshie (2017) reveals that the mutual fund industry in Ghana dates back to pre-colonial times with the traditional “Susu” system still practiced among rural dwellers in Ghana. In this traditional capital market setup, a group of locals (market women, hawkers, farmers, drivers, artisans, and mostly low and informal income earners etc., contributes periodic amounts of money into a savings fund. This fund is managed by a designated individual or group of individuals who in turn return the accumulated total contributions to the member at the end of a pre-determined period. The challenge of dishonest stewards increased the reconstitution of these informal groups into formalized groups such as cooperative unions. These cooperative unions adopted the same modus operandi as the traditional “Susu” saving clubs but their operations were more formalized and offered opportunities for members to take loans in from the contribution. Further cooperative unions were also trained to invest the resources of their members through the now defunct Cooperative Bank. In the early 1990s the Government of Ghana promulgated the Security Industry Law (PNDCL-333) which has subsequently been amended in Security Industry Law (2016) to allow legal framework and government led institution to overseas and ensure transparency in the market due to its susceptibility to abuse. Since then the mutual fund industry as an alternative capital market has witnessed tremendous growth. By the end of 2010, the mutual fund industry in Ghana had become a highly regarded performing investment market in Africa in particular and developing markets as a whole. Among the notable mutual fund in Ghana with international appeals include the Data Bank EPACK (first mutual fund in Ghana). Despite its success there are uncertainties as to whether mutual funds in Ghana obtain optimal performance relative to their counterparts in United States, Luxembourg, Ireland, France, Australia, United Kingdom, Japan, China and Brazil (Xu et al. 2018).). In less developed economies like Ghana, industry players prefer using raw returns in their annual financial reports which do not necessarily reflect superior performance as any unskilled investor can increase raw returns by undertaking highly risky investment. In other to evaluate mutual fund’s performance, there are a lot of measures that can be used to do the evaluation. Among which are the Jensen Alpha Index, Sharpe and Treynor as well as Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) Ibikunle and Steffen (2017). These measures are widely used especially in terms of evaluating the risk-adjusted returns of the fund where volatility and variability can be measured. In spite of this, evaluation for mutual funds are done basically on periodic basis either in weeks, months or quarterly making it very important only for comparing past performances. In other to meet the fast changing trends dimensions and trends in market conditions, performance evaluation aerobics must update repetitively and anytime at request of the user (Eldering and Igoe 2010). The performance measures tool are adopted more often for evaluation but they normally do not provide predictive variables and as such makes it difficult to be used in forecasting superior mutual funds. To be able to deal with such situation, interested researchers have adopted and employed various approaches to get predictive variables in order to make forecasting of superior mutual funds. One of the evaluation methods which have been the focus of a valuable development is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) since forecasting and calculating abilities of ANN are superior to native algorithms in several angles (Omer et al., 2015). Originally, Backpropagation Neural Networks (BPNN) is an ANN model widely used in finance with a supervised neural network which can analyse continuous data (Pan et al. 2017). Enhanced resilient back propagation neural networks (ERBPNN) are emerging models better in bankruptcy classification than other statistical instruments because it gives an accurate response (Siddiqui et al. 2018). Rezaee et al. 2018) used ERBPNN to predict the bankruptcy risk of major US carriers. ERBPNN was also used by Han et al. (2018) to improve bond rating in the stock market. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward neural network with one or more layers between input and output layer. Feed-forward means that data flows in one direction from input to output layer. This type of network is trained with the back-propagation learning algorithm. MLPs are widely used for pattern classification, recognition, prediction and approximation. This was applied in a work done by Afroz et al. (2017) to predict mutual fund performance where they obtain good forecasting results in blended funds, but not for growth funds. Krauss et al. (2017) suggested a hybrid intelligent system that predicts the failure of firms based on past financial performance data by combining a rough set approach with MLP. There is a positivity of enhanced resilient backpropagation neural networks to integrate fundamental and technical analysis for financial performance prediction et al., 2018). Aside the fact that ERBPNN is commonly applied in financial literatures, it has its own limitations thus, the cost of training is mostly high, local factors often mislead the results, and its online learning is highly impossible. Other forms of Artificial Neural Network models are designed for classification problems that helps eliminate the challenges of Backpropagation Neural Network, Example is the Self Organization Map (SOM) Pun and Shahi (2018) and Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) (Kaffash and Marra 2017; Majhi et al. 2018) families. These types of neural model unlike the ERBPNN, can be trained quickly and be put in an unknown pattern without accurate information. However, most of these neural models are unsupervised models features which limit their application in financial fields. Ding et al. (2018), developed a new approach called FANNC to neural networks. It is suitable in its algorithm particularly when it comes to giving fast and instant response to the continually changing financial market conditions. The method used by Mustafa et al. (2017) is based on adaptive resonance theory (ART) and field theory (FT). ART can perform online learning and work under a non-stationary world. To enable one-pass learning and perform real-time supervised learning at high speed, Coulomb potential model for electrostatic forces provided the basis for field theory approach to artificial neural network. The feedback connections function is to transfer an active signal to each successive layer within the four-layer structured neural network called FANNC to implement competition and resonance. This can be seen in illustration below (Fig. 1). FANNC Architecture The use of FANNC integrates the concept of the attracting basin, which is represented in theory as the electric field produced by the trained instance. Every second-layer unit defines an attracting basin by a certain responsive centers and the responsive characteristics widths of the Gaussian weights connected with them. The second-layer units are normally used to internally classify inputs, whereas the third-layer units are used internally for output classification. This study is necessary in light of doubtful analytical techniques on financial sector performance in Ghana with the closure and liquidation of several leading Ghanaian institutions within the last year and the need to reclaim customer confidence in the financial sector. We contribute to the current literature by testing an ensemble of more sophisticated, novel, enhanced resilient analytical neural networks tools to evaluate the performance of mutual funds listed on the Ghana Stock Exchange to obtain robustness of inference. The inputs and outputs instances are discussed in section 2, results and training processes are then provided in section 3, section 4 discussion is based on comparing and analyzing results and finally section 5 is the conclusion of the study.",10

During the discounting process, the interest rates directly affect the value of the stock. Huang et al. (Huang et al., 2016) specify that a low level of interest rates makes the discounting cash flow high, thus justifying the increase in current stock prices. Based on the stock valuation models, stock prices are predicted by the discounted value of expected cash flow. Therefore, according to the theory, the primary factor determining the value of stocks is directly related to the discounting rate, namely interest rates. Laopodis (Laopodis, 2013) explains that expected dividends determine stock prices and interest rates with any surprises in monetary policy likely to influence stock prices, either directly via the interest rate channel or indirectly through changes in the determinants of dividends. According to Bernanke and Reinhart (Bernanke & Reinhart, 2004), current interest rates can influence asset prices. Moreover, Assefa et al. (Assefa et al., 2017) find that interest rates have significant effects on stock returns in developed economies. Theoretically, financial markets are classified as capital and money markets, respectively. Today, it is important in both markets for participants to follow market movements before making investment decisions. All types of prices provide essential information for investors to revise their portfolios. There are many kinds of prices, including stock prices and interest rates. According to the explanation above, empirical evidence supports the view that there is a significant relationship between stock prices and interest rates. Figure 1 shows the interest rates and stock price levels for the period 2001 M1 – 2017 M4. The graphical investigation presents evidence indicating that when interest rates dropped from 120% to under 20%, the stock market indexes increased substantially. After the 2001 crisis in Turkey, the monetary authority pursued an inflation targeting program to decrease the inflation rate. Following the monetary changes, interest rates fell substantially and remained under 20%. Additionally, the stock market responded with a substantial increase during the same period. Movements of the interest rate and stock price Assefa et al. (Assefa et al., 2017) explain that monetary policy, through interest rates, tends to affect the returns – and hence prices – of financial assets, thereby influencing economic decisions and growth. Sellin (Sellin, 2001) also surveys the literature on monetary policy and stock prices. For Turkey, Alrub et al. (Alrub et al., 2016) provide support by illustrating the outcomes of monetary policy changes in the stock market for the period of January 2002 to December 2013. There are two main reasons for revisiting the relationship between the equity market and interest rates. First, a significant volume of literature developed by Chen, Roll and Ross (Chen et al., 1986), Campbell and Ammer (Campbell & Ammer, 1993), Thorbecke (Thorbecke, 1997), Laopodis (Laopodis, 2013), Huang et al. (Huang et al., 2016), and Assefa et al. (Assefa et al., 2017) focuses on the effects of macro-variables on stock prices. Second, in general, Turkey is classified as a bank-based financial system, but also has a stock exchange that is integrated into the global financial market. Market participants usually prefer deposit accounts to safeguard their wealth. They also have the option to invest in the stock market, but foreigners usually place their wealth in the Borsa Istanbul as a portfolio investment. Foreigners make approximately three quarters of the investments in the stock market, while domestic residents prefer bank accounts. Therefore, this study uses the indicator of deposit interest rates as the proxy for interest rate components. Moreover, it is favorable to use the equity price index for the component of the stock market. The interaction between both components is investigated based on the dynamics between them. Consequently, the objective of this study is to examine the relationship between both prices by applying the ARDL Bounds Test, cointegration equations, and equity capital market (ECM) for Turkey in order to substantiate evidence for this relationship. Specifically, a bivariate form of cointegration is applied to analyze the relationship between the two variables. The primary purpose of this study is to identify the short-run and long-run relationships, as well as the elasticities of the relationship in Turkey. Therefore, this study investigates if in the case of Turkey, both the stock prices and interest rates have a long-run relationship by using the ARDL Bounds Test. Furthermore, the elasticities of the concerned relationship produced by the cointegration equations (FMOLS, DOLS, and CCR) provide the signs of each coefficient in the possible relationship. The vast majority of studies in the literature provide the signs for coefficients in this relationship. Also, the cointegration results from the ARDL Bounds Test and the long-run elasticities are corroborated with the Johansen cointegration methods. The rest of the article is organized as follows: Section 2 explains the literature review. Section 3 describes the data, model specification, and econometric methodology. Section 4 provides the empirical results and discussion, and. Section 5 explains the conclusion.",18

Asongu,Nicholas M. Odhiambo,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Over the decade since the 2008 financial crisis, the literature on banking and finance has seen renewed interest in a number of areas, including the nexus between loan growth, regulation, diversification, and competition, and the development indicators for risk, capital management, and efficiency of banks (Kashif et al. 2016; Bokpin 2016; Fanta 2016; Zheng et al. 2017; Ozili 2017; Khraisha and Arthur 2018). Interest has also grown regarding banking industry performance in terms of allocation efficiency, risk management and profitability (Moudud-Ul-Huq 2017; Hamdi et al. 2018), the application of manifold learning approaches (Huang and Kou 2014; Yan et al. 2017), and the implications of Basel III for banking sector development (Ramlall and Mamode 2017). Financial intermediation represents the fundamental mission of banks to mobilize deposits into credit for economic operators. This paper was motivated by two main considerations in scholarly and policy circles: (1) the ongoing debate about the relationship between bank size and the efficiency of financial intermediation, and (2) gaps in the existing literature regarding this subject. Questions about the role of bank size in improving efficiency in the banking sector are reflected in the work of various researchers, including Asongu et al. (2016); Boateng et al. (2018), and Asongu and Odhiambo (2018). Existing research maintains that some big banks might abuse their market power instead of leveraging economies of scale to increase their efficiency in financial intermediation. The mechanisms for enhancing financial intermediation include, inter alia, increasing the quantity of loans, decreasing the price of loans (i.e., interest rates and fees), and reducing information asymmetry between borrowers and lenders (Kusi et al. 2017; Kusi and Opoku Mensah 2018; Tchamyou 2018a, b). There is a growing body of evidence that for big banks in Africa, interest rate spreads are higher as compared to small banks (Beck and Hesse 2006; Ahokpossi 2013).Footnote 1 Interest rate spreads have been used widely in the literature to indicate the level of banking sector efficiency (Dabla-Norris and Floerkemeier 2007; Chortareas et al. 2012; Asongu 2017). Big banks are expected to have lower margins because they have more opportunities to leverage their size to achieve economies of scale. This capacity for leverage should allow the larger banks to benefit from lower funding costs compared to the smaller banks. Therefore, it would be reasonable to surmise that one of the main benefits of bigger size would be gains in efficiency that transfer to the banks’ customers through higher deposit rates, lower lending rates, and lower overall interest spreads. However, research indicates that this expectation is not being met. Big banks worldwide continue to be more inefficient than their smaller counterparts, which is a paradox (Mitchell and Onvural 1996; Karray and Chichti 2013; Asongu et al. 2018a; Asongu and Biekpe 2018).Footnote 2 Therefore, concerns are emerging about the role of bank size in improving efficiency in the banking sector (Karray and Chichti 2013). Two arguments have been put forward that attempt to explain this paradox. The first view holds that as big banks become bigger, more efficient, and unchallenged, they tend to abuse their power to exploit customers by creating monopolistic practices (Mitchell and Onvural 1996). The second argument is that increased bank size beyond certain thresholds introduces diseconomies of scale that in turn lead to inefficiency. According to this view, larger banks find themselves with higher and higher average costs as they grow beyond a crucial threshold, and these costs lead to wider interest margins and inefficiency (Berger et al. 1987; Noulas et al. 1990; Mester 1992; Clark 1996; Karray and Chichti 2013).Footnote 3 In other words, contrary to expectations, increased size beyond the identified threshold would widen interest margins to the detriment of customers. In the light of the above, the problem to be addressed can be stated as follows: “Is the relationship between bank size and efficiency influenced by exploitation of market power or economies of scale?” To the best of our knowledge, the existing literature regarding African financial development has not focused on this underlying question for banks.Footnote 4 This paper contributes to the literature by providing a deep examination of the connection between bank size and efficiency in Africa, with the concurrent goal of determining whether that association is influenced by abuse of market power or economies of scale. For this research, we used a panel of 162 African banks with data for 2001–2011, and we analyzed the empirical evidence using instrumental variables and fixed effects regressions. Our research provided two key results. First, we found that bank size increases the interest rate margins enjoyed by a bank, following an inverted U-shaped curve. Second, market power and economies of scale do not increase or decrease the interest rate margins significantly. The main policy implication is that interest rate margins cannot be elucidated by market power or economies of scale. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.  Literature review and clarification of concepts section provides a review of the related literature and clarification of the concepts used in this work. Bank size, market power, and efficiency section presents our data and methodology, and the empirical results are given in Economies and efficiency in the banking industry section. Cost efficiency section provides our conclusion, including the implications of our findings and suggestions for future research.",15

Firms need cash for various reasons, such as day-to-day operations, to finance growth through profitable operations, to retire mature debts, for paying taxes, and for pre-cautionary motives (Kafayat et al. 2014; Opler et al. 1999; Uyar and Kuzey 2014). However, maintaining excessive cash reserves has both advantages and disadvantages. For example, on the one hand, firms need excessive cash reserves to prevent financial distress and precautionary motives. On the other hand, excess cash may incur opportunity costs by way of forgoing profitable projects (Uyar and Kuzey 2014). Therefore, there is still no consensus on how much cash amount firms need on their balance sheet. Most studies have explored factors that determine corporate cash holdings for developed countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and Italy (see: Al-Najjar and Belghitar 2011; Bates et al. 2009; Bigelli and Sánchez-Vidal 2012; Chen 2008; Opler et al. 1999; Ozkan and Ozkan 2004), while a few have examined emerging equity markets (see: Al-Amarneh 2015; Kariuki et al. 2015; Shabbir et al. 2016; Uyar and Kuzey 2014). The literature on cash holdings comprises a few studies on factors that determine cash holdings in the context of a crisis (Al-Amarneh 2015; Momeni et al. 2016; Mugumisi and Mawanza 2014; Song and Lee 2012). Considering the above, we investigate factors that determine corporate cash holdings in Pakistan’s emerging economy. More specifically, we investigate corporate cash holdings in normal and crisis periods. The US subprime 2007 financial crisis has been providing researchers with opportunities to study firm behavior in crisis periods.Footnote 1 Like other emerging economies, Pakistan’s economy was affected by the financial crisis (Jebran et al. 2017a, 2017b); corporate sectors faced problems in generating cash flow and capital. Considering the importance of funds that firms require in different situations, we designed our study to examine factors that are important in determining the corporate cash holdings in different contexts, namely, normal and crisis periods. There are numerous studiesFootnote 2 in the extant literature that investigate the determinants of corporate cash holdings in Pakistan. However, none, to the best of our knowledge, have explored factors that determine corporate cash holdings during crises in the context of Pakistan. Through our work, we contribute to extant literature in at least two ways. First, we investigate factors that affect corporate cash holdings during the pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis periods, thus offering valuable insights. Second, we especially focus on corporate cash holdings in the emerging market of Pakistan. The results will provide new insights about the cash holdings behavior of firms in emerging markets during normal and turbulent period. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.

6.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,23 December 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-020-00199-w,"Hedge effectiveness of put replication, gold, and oil on ASEAN-5 equities",December 2020,Robiyanto Robiyanto,Bayu Adi Nugroho,Andrian Dolfriandra Huruta,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"There has been an ongoing discussion about the usefulness of oil and gold for hedging the equities market. The topic has been vastly researched in developed nations such as United Kingdom, United States, and China (Baur and Tran 2012; Ciner et al. 2013; Creti et al. 2013; Hood and Malik 2013; Lucey and O’Connor 2013; Ming et al. 2020; Shahzad et al. 2019) and continues to gain popularity after the financial crisis (Baur and McDermott 2012; Maghyereh et al. 2017). Recently, the effectiveness of oil and gold as safe haven assets has been researched in Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS), which are oil-exporting countries and emerging nations in Asia (Abdullah et al. 2016; Maghyereh et al. 2017; Mensi 2019; Pandey 2018; Robiyanto 2018b; Robiyanto et al. 2019a, 2019b; Robiyanto et al. 2017; Shakil et al. 2018; Trabelsi 2017). However, the effectiveness of portfolio insurance strategy proxied by put replication has not been vastly researched. This study uses equities and commodities for portfolio construction due to the following reasons. First, Nugroho et al. (2018) showed that investing in equity is quite profitable. For instance, Indonesian Stock Market returns were the highest in Asia Pacific and fifth highest in the world in 2016. However, the previous study also showed that the level of capital market integration increased, implying that investors making investment diversification across ASEAN capital markets could only earn limited diversification advantages (Jarungkitkul and Sukcharoensin 2016; Karim and Ning 2013; Muharam et al. 2020; Thomas et al. 2017). They must therefore find other assets that can diversify their equity portfolios, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and the Philippines (ASEAN-5). Second, commodities like gold and oil have a weak correlation with equity and can be used to hedge and diversify the equity portfolio (Iglesias-Casal et al. 2020). The main focus of this research is to analyze the usefulness of oil, gold, and bonds on hedging ASEAN-5 equities from the period January 2007 to December 2018. This period covers the financial crisis (Wen et al. 2019), the rise and subsequent fall of gold prices in 2010, and the recent oil crisis which began in mid-2014. The study specifically aims to measure the hedge effectiveness of oil on equities in ASEAN-5 countries as most Southeast Asian nations have been known as major oil consumers. Except for Malaysia, the other ASEAN-5 nations are net oil importers (Abdullah et al. 2016), and changes in crude oil prices can negatively impact these economies (Boonyasana 2018; Robiyanto 2018a). By investigating the dynamic correlations and volatilities between crude oil and equities markets, investors in ASEAN-5 stock markets can gain information about diversifying advantages. Another objective of this research is to measure the hedge effectiveness of gold on equities. Gold investment is becoming attractive for investors due to their awareness of market risk in equity. This creates an opportunity for financial institutions to offer gold investment products, just as some Islamic and conventional banks in Malaysia have done. While previous research have shown that gold is good for hedging and risk reduction in severe market turbulence, investigation on this topic is relatively scarce in emerging Asian nations (Ghazali et al. 2015; Robiyanto 2018b). The final objective of this research is to measure the hedge effectiveness of the put replication strategy. Portfolio insurance methods gained popularity in the financial industry at the end of the 1970s. Rubinstein and Leland (1995) created option-based portfolio insurance (OBPI) by replicating options with a position in stock and cash. Perold and Sharpe (1988) introduced the constant proportion portfolio insurance (CPPI), which has gained popularity since it benefits investors by reducing downside risk while gaining upward possibility. The rest of the study is structured as follows: Section 2 reviews the related literature and presents the hypotheses; Section 3 reveals the research method; Section 4 discusses the empirical findings; and Section 5 concludes the paper.",7

6.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,26 November 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-020-00202-4,Governing the gold rush into emerging markets: a case study of Indonesia’s regulatory responses to the expansion of Chinese-backed online P2P lending,December 2020,Angela Tritto,Yujia He,Victoria Amanda Junaedi,Female,Unknown,Female,Female,"Peer-to-peer lending (also known as P2P lending, or platform lending) is a relatively new form of online lending that matches potential borrowers with investors using digital and communications technologies. Since the world’s first online P2P lending platform, Zopa, started in the United Kingdom in 2005, platforms have sprung up around the world. The global P2P lending market was valued at US$26 billion in 2015 and is projected to reach US$460 billion by 2022, growing at an annual rate of 51.5% (Research and Markets 2017). This growth is propelled by not just developed economies, such as the United States and Europe, but to an increasing extent by emerging markets. While formal borrowing is the most common source of credit in high-income economies (almost 90% of borrowers employed financial institutions or credit cards in 2017), borrowing from family and friends is most common in developing economies (World Bank 2017a). Besides, emerging markets face significant financing gaps for MSMEs (Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises). The gap of the East Asia and Pacific region accounts to USD 2.4 billion, representing 54% of the global MSME figure (World Bank 2017b). The increasing convergence of banking and mobile services in emerging markets is not only allowing banks to get around the constraints of traditional brick-and-mortar outlets, but also enabling technology leapfrogging to reach these under-banked groups (Amankwah-Amoah 2019). Asia and, particularly, Southeast Asia represent some of the most promising markets for online lending because of four main reasons: the large and young population, the high Internet penetration and smartphone usage, the growing spending market, and the largely unbanked population. Indonesia is the perfect example. According to the Indonesian Financial Services Authority (or OJK, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan), by December 2018, the loans disbursed from registered lenders had totaled over 22.66 trillion IDR (1.58 billion USDFootnote 1) (OJK 2018a). However, P2P lending also poses a rising challenge for emerging-market regulators. The case of Indonesia provides a useful example to examine the effect of foreign investments from other countries such as China on the domestic regulatory environment. Unless they have already done so, policymakers in Southeast Asia’s emerging economies and beyond will need to follow with regulations and institutional responses, as they will find themselves dealing with similar issues to China and Indonesia. Particularly, the Chinese and Indonesian cases highlight the pitfalls of a reactive regulation approach. Through proactive regulatory approaches, other emerging markets can drive the online lending industries towards areas of needs, as in the case of Malaysia allowing P2P lending only for MSMEs, or promote better investments, as in the case of Chinese companies eyeing acquisitions in the credit-starved but already developed Indian market (Jao 2019). This paper examines Indonesia’s innovative and prompt regulatory and institutional responses to the expansion of online P2P lending backed by foreign investments predominantly from China using both primary interviews and secondary firm-level data. It starts by analyzing the P2P lending expansion in China, the resultant risks, and recent regulation efforts. It then analyzes the development of the P2P lending sector in Indonesia, the entry of Chinese capital, and the Indonesian government’s response resulting in policy and institutional changes in P2P lending governance. The paper argues that the Indonesian approach to regulation is to mitigate risks from market expansion powered by foreign capital (primarily from China) without stifling innovation’s potential to boost financial inclusion. To do so, the state has imposed regulatory and institutional changes to promote synergy with market players and industry self-regulation. The study concludes with policy recommendations and directions for future research.",10

In recent years, due to extraordinary shifts in the monetary policies of developed market (DM) and country-specific macroeconomic developments, EM currencies and interest rates have fluctuated sharply. Although the composition of EM bond funds is heterogeneous because the countries involved have different economic and market structures, these countries’ asset prices are correlated to each other. Unhedged bond portfolios that are affected by both currencies and interest rates have suffered, and having an effective risk management strategy has become more critical. The literature on risk analysis of EM fixed income has been limited and scattered. Early research mostly focused on the risk–reward profile and showed the diversification benefits of EM bonds, along with other asset classes (Burik and Ennis 1990, Erb et al. 1999, etc.). Similarly, research on systemic risk, risk transmission, or financial network touched on EM bonds as part of the whole investment universe (see Kou et al. 2019). Some others considered immunization strategies in this area (see Ortobelli and Sebastiano 2018, etc.). In the extensive literature, value at risk (VaR) and related volatility modeling are the prominent risk management concepts that have been applied frequently. Nevertheless, applications of this approach to EM bond portfolios are insufficient. Therefore, referring to studies on other asset classes, especially those dealing with the developed market bonds, is the only plausible way. Guo et al. (2007) applied quantile VaR to U.S. corporate bond indices and incorporated treasury interest rates as information variables. Although using these information variables was beneficial, the estimated confidence intervals for VaRs were wide, thus downgrading the applicability of the model. Tu and Chen (2018) evaluated U.S. bond indices with a factor-based approach. VaR estimations of the study present that market shocks (not macroeconomic developments) primarily cause the variations. Vlaar (2000) compared the out of sample performances of volatility models with different distributions and stated that generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models deliver the best results under a normal distribution assumption. Yet, the analysis considered only the univariate volatilities in Dutch bond portfolios. In the literature, there are also other advanced techniques to consider such as the novel Markov-switching (MS) models. Although EM bonds have not been part of the scope, the MS model framework has been applied to fixed income markets, as well as other asset classes, in recent years (Escobar et al. 2017, Elliott and Nishide 2014, Dimpfl and Peter 2016, Guidolin et al. 2014, Hevia et al. 2015, Kim et al. 2019, etc.). Business cycles in long-term data series and bull and bear markets are the usual concepts for the MS models. As such, the necessity of separating the impacts of the global financial crisis has been one of the motivations behind the recent popularity of MS models. Meanwhile, in fractal (self-similar) structures, MS models have some drawbacks in terms of capturing the long memory because assumed regime changes reduce the persistence impact. Furthermore, in the literature, most studies have focused on univariate or bivariate time series with two-state models. In the case of multivariate data series, with time variant probabilities and possible multi-state model selection, the process becomes cumbersome, and with too many explanatory variables, the inference could become complicated. In the data series of bonds, especially in the volatilities, fractal features can be observed. Apart from the pricing dynamics of the bonds, as the coupon payments or the accrued interests slowly change over time, they become integrated in the returns. Under these conditions, regarding volatility, we evaluate based on a relatively new concept, that is, fractional modeling. The preliminary analysis justifies this type of approach. It considers the fractal (self-similar) features of datasets and quantifies the persistence of shocks in financial markets. The volatility model, fractionally integrated GARCH (FIGARCH), was proposed by Baillie (1996) after the introduction of the mean model alternative auto-regressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA; see Granger and Joyeux 1980 and Hosking 1981). The FIGARCH model focuses on the hyperbolic decay of the impacts of previous innovations in the volatility. It extends the application of the integrated GARCH model (IGARCH), thereby providing an opportunity to determine the true level of the hyperbolic decay at the impact of the previous shocks. Unlike regime-switching models, the number of explanatory variables increases slightly, which makes it easy to incorporate and interpret. Subsequently, various models have been proposed in this “fractional” framework. In this field, fractionally integrated exponential GARCH (FIEGARCH), hyperbolic GARCH (HYGARCH) and fractionally integrated asymmetric power ARCH (FIAPARCH) are some examples that cover additional features of volatility such as leverage or asymmetry. Tsung and Shieh (2007) conducted a VaR analysis for Treasury bond futures with fractional volatility models and showed the superior performance of FIGARCH under normal, Student-t, and skewed Student-t distributions. Martinez et al. (2016) used fluctuation analysis (i.e., detrended fluctuation analysis; DFA) to investigate the long memory in European stock and bond markets. The major finding of the study is the fractal structure of corporate bonds, which implies that modeling the data has to consider long memory properties. In similar studies, Zunino et al. (2015) and Ferreira (2018) presented evidence of long-range dependence in the returns of various sovereign and corporate bond markets as a factor of market inefficiency. Cotter (2004) applied several GARCH type models to U.K. financial markets. He stated that the highest level of long range-dependence is observed in bond futures. On EM bonds, as one of a few examples, Jung and Kim (2012) analyzed high-frequency data of Korean Treasury bond futures and concluded that the return volatility of this asset class has persistence. As another example, Mendoza (2005) successfully revealed long memory features in Latin American sovereign bonds. Although its application is rare in fixed income assets, the efficiency of fractional volatility modeling has been demonstrated for other asset classes several times. (See Ding et al. 1993, Lardic and Mignon 1999, Serletis and Andreadis 2004, Jin and Frechette 2004, Baillie and Morana 2007, Tabak and Cajueiro 2007, Kasman 2009, Ksaier and Cristiani-D’ornano 2010, Manap and Kassim 2011, Chang et al. 2012, Wang 2013, Sensoy and Sobaci 2014, etc.) For the second point, we deploy the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model of Engle (2002) to examine the co-movements. Dynamic copulas or wavelet transformations are the other advanced techniques that have been applied in recent literature. Copulas focus on the interdependence of individual distributions and the linkage between individual and multivariate distributions; they have various forms including parametric and/or regime switching. Nevertheless, as copulas deal with distributions, solo applications can be used for tail dependence, risk budgeting, and related tools such as option pricing. Moreover, since model alternatives are relatively limited for multivariate cases (Archimedean and elliptical) and having too many parameter estimations is burdensome, most of the literature have focused on bivariate cases. Furthermore, optimal parametric copula model selection (related goodness-of-fit tests), which affects tail dependence, is another discussion point (see also Weiß 2013). Recent applications in the fixed income market have usually been through developed markets or credit risks (see Kim et al. 2020, Yang et al. 2020, Chao and Zou 2018, Otani and Imai 2018, Bekiros et al. 2018, Benlagha 2014, Chen et al. 2014 etc.) The other technique, wavelet transformation, also drew attention, in recent years. Especially in stock markets and commodities, the wavelet method has been frequently applied to investigate interdependence and coherence. However, there has been limited application on EM bonds (Najeeb et al. 2017). As in the case of copulas, wavelet transformation needs additional model for forecasting. Application, extracting, and model selection needs intensive computation for a meaningful analysis. Moreover, in multivariate cases, as the number of data series increases, the process becomes highly complicated. Gulerce and Unal (2016) reached, at most, five different time series for coherence of the analysis. Meanwhile, our selection of the DCC model is not only useful for risk budgeting but also easy to implement for forecasting and portfolio optimization. Furthermore, unlike the aforementioned approaches, under this method, estimation results are easy to comprehend. Most of the existing DCC applications to bonds are specific to regional submarkets and tackle the concept of market integration. Applying the DCC-GARCH model, Tsukuda et al. (2017) revealed that integration within the Asian bond market is shallow. Champagne et al. (2017) showed strong market interdependence between the U.S. and Canadian corporate bond markets. Kenourgios et al. (2013) investigated the contagion effects of the global financial crisis (GFC) by applying an asymmetric generalized DCC (AG-DCC) model to Brazilian long-term bond indices, along with other asset classes, and found contagion links of the bonds with U.S. stocks, real estate, and commodities. In a similar framework, Kenourgios and Padhi (2012) covered the bond markets of a wide range of EM countries and found the co-integration levels and diversification benefits of EM bonds during well-known crises, including the late 1990s. By applying DCC-GARCH models, Sclip et al. (2016) and Bhuiyan et al. (2018) revealed the diversification benefits of sukuks (Islamic bonds) within given samples (see also Goeij 2004, Kenourgios et al. 2011, Celik 2012, Christiansen 2010, Benlagha 2014, Bessler et al. 2016, and Fang et al. 2018). Regarding other asset classes of EM, Dimitriou et al. (2013) applied a DCC-FIAPARCH model to Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa stock markets and showed an increasing contagion effect during the GFC. Other studies revealed the superior performance of multivariate applications regarding volatility persistence properties (e.g., Engle and Colacito 2006; Harris and Nguyen 2013; Selmi and Hachicha 2015). To summarize, there has been a literature gap in covering EM bonds from the portfolio management standpoint. Furthermore, despite findings of the long memory feature of bond markets (and many other markets such as stocks and commodities) it has not been taken into account in this framework. This study contributes by filling this gap. Specifically, it covers EM local bonds (as well as the currencies) of a wide range of countries and derives satisfactory model outcomes. Because this study targets funds or portfolio investments, it deals with institutional investors. For the retail side, there are other concepts to deal with (see Wen et al. 2019). As another assumption, this study leaves out matters related to cost, as further analysis may be required regarding cost efficiency. Particularly for the credit-risk side, cost sensitive analysis may affect the strategies (see Wang et al. 2020). This study mainly presents risk management tools that are versatile and comprehensive for EM local bond portfolios. For this purpose, modern time series approaches that consider fractal data structures and correlation dynamics are sought. The study primarily focuses on three aspects: return–volatility dynamics, correlation features, and VaR performances. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section explains the compilation method of the bonds and the construction of the proxy time series that are suitable for evaluating the portfolios. Section 3 briefly covers specific long memory models and the DCC approach to be employed in the empirical analyses. In Section 4, together with a basic analysis of the data, the results of four different multivariate models are presented. In this section, using the selected model, out-of-sample VaR performances are examined for static and dynamic portfolio samples, including portfolio optimization. In Section 5, inferences of the analyses are compiled and the main findings of this study are presented.",6

R. Murthy,Natalya Ketenci,,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"Economists and policymakers have been studying the dynamic role of capital mobility in economic growth recently, especially in emerging countries in general and in Latin American and Caribbean countries in particular, which are experiencing large inflows of capital from abroad. One source is the recent unconventional monetary expansion in the United States through large-scale quantitative easing (QE), undertaken through extensive purchases of assets by its Federal Reserve. Lower U.S. interest rates and other phenomena, such as an appetite for increased global risk, improvements in these developing countries’ macroeconomic fundamentals, and the rapid progress in information technology, have all contributed to the increase in capital flow to these economies. Ford and Horioka (2016), in explaining the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle (Feldstein and Horioka 1980; Feldstein 1983), state that net transfers of capital among countries depend not only on the integration of financial markets but also on the integration of the goods and services markets. Ko and Funashima (2019) find evidence that large markets have higher correlations between savings and investments compared with mid- and small-sized countries. Eaton et al. (2016) present empirical evidence that financial friction in the goods and services markets reduces the degree of capital mobility. In fact, they contend that removing the frictions in the goods and services markets reduces considerably the dependence of domestic investment on domestic saving, leading to a greater degree of capital mobility in the observed Feldstein-Horioka puzzle, which is estimated by the following equation:
 where I/Y is the investment ratio to gross domestic product (GDP) in country i and period t. S/Y is the saving ratio as a percentage of GDP and βit is the saving retention coefficient, which indicates the capital mobility level in country i. εit indicates the error term of the regression model. In countries where capital mobility is high, the savings–retention coefficient is expected to be low reflecting a low level of correlation between domestic investments and savings. However, Feldstein and Horioka (1980) illustrate empirically that the correlation between investment and saving ratios is high in developed countries, where it is expected to be low, which has created the Feldstein-Horioka puzzle. Eaton et al. (2016) argue, given that there is no “home-country bias” and an absence of financial friction in the goods markets and financial markets, in recipient countries, there are many benefits from an inflow of capital where there is a low level of domestic savings as well as crowding-out effects of a budget deficit. These factors have been instrumental in enabling a developing economy to pursue the most profitable investment opportunities and acquire foreign funds to finance domestic investment projects. This then limits the tax burden on relatively immobile domestic factors of production, smooths domestic consumption, and, ultimately, improves resource allocation and the economic welfare in the recipient countries (Obstfeld and Rogoff 2010; Boschi 2012; Ghosh et al. 2012; Ahmed and Zlate 2013; Koepke 2019; Zheng et al. 2019; Al-Jassar and Moosa 2020). At the same time, an economy that is witnessing a steady capital inflow, despite some benefits, may experience many undesirable economic consequences and distortions, the most important being the inability to implement independent monetary policy actions. A review of capital inflow data reveals that many Latin American countries, unlike in the 1970s and 1980s, have experienced larger capital inflows recently. External shocks, like low-interest rates or economic slowdowns in developed countries, “push” investors to emerging markets, like Latin America, and are considered key factors in attracting foreign investments (Calvo et al. 1993; Fernandez-Arias 1996; Aizenman and Binici 2016; Kang and Kyunghun 2019; Koepke 2019; Eller et al. 2020). However, Baek (2006) argues that together with low international interest rates, which are push factors, the most important factor attracting foreign investment to Latin America is strong domestic economic growth, which is considered a pull factor for foreign investments. Fomina (2021), with the help of systematic and structural-logical techniques, modeled the stages forming pull factors that increase the competitive advantages of Latin America and improve its investment attractiveness. To analyze country and regional international case studies in this context and derive current and future policy implications, a reliable and econometrically robust quantitative measure of the prevailing degree of capital mobility, such as an estimate of the savings–retention coefficient, is warranted. The main objectives of this study are to test whether capital mobility exists and to quantify its degree using the size of the savings–retention coefficient by investigating a panel of 16 Latin American and 4 Caribbean countries during the period 1960–2017. To investigate capital mobility in Latina American and Caribbean countries, Murthy (2009) applies the panel group fully modified ordinary least squares (FM-OLS) estimator developed by Pedroni (2000, 2001) for the period 1960–2002. Our study employs panel data over a longer period (1960 to 2017) by using a recently developed robust panel data estimation technique, the dynamic common correlated effects mean group (DCCEMG) estimator from Chudik and Pesaran (2015). To test whether our results are robust, we also report the savings–retention coefficients estimated from applying another panel data estimator, Pesaran’s (2006) common correlated effects mean group (CCEMG). Furthermore, to test whether there is a cointegrating relationship between the saving and investment ratios in the presence of cross-sectional dependence, we conduct the Gengenbach et al. (2008, 2016) error-correction tests at the panel and individual country levels. To the best of our knowledge, no other study in the literature has employed these panel data estimations along with a relatively long period sample to examine Latin American and Caribbean countries. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Literature survey section briefly reviews the literature on capital mobility; Model specification and data section provides the specification of the employed model and the data; Empirical results section presents results of the empirical analysis conducted in this study and finally the last section concludes with the discussion of policy implications.",3

The size of the cryptocurrency market is continuously increasing due to (a) the decline in public trust toward the central banking system after the global financial crisis (Weber 2016), (b) the fourth industrial revolution and use of smart technologies, (c) its acceptance as legal currency in different countries, and (d) its acceptance by large companies like Facebook, Microsoft, Shopify, JPMorgan, and Tesla.Footnote 1 Therefore, it is important to understand the dynamics of the cryptocurrency market, especially the interlinkages between the cryptocurrencies during the COVID-19 crisis. If, for example, volatility is transmitted from one cryptocurrency to another during the crisis period, then portfolio managers need to adjust their asset allocation to diversify risk, and financial policymakers need to adapt their policies in order to mitigate the contagion-related risk. The time-varying return and volatility linkages between different cryptocurrencies, especially during a crisis, have important implications for asset allocations, option pricing, and risk management (Kou et al. 2014; Caporin and Malik 2020). In the related literature, numerous studies have examined the return/volatility spillover between different cryptocurrencies (Chu et al. 2017; Yi et al. 2018; Koutmos 2018; Baur and Dimpfl 2018; Ji et al. 2019; Katsiampa 2019; Katsiampa et al. 2019a, b; Canh et al. 2019; Beneki et al. 2019; Liu and Serletis 2019). For example, Yi et al. (2018) analyze the volatility connectedness between the 52 cryptocurrencies and find a volatility transmission from Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies. Several other cryptocurrencies also transmit strong volatility effects; thus, Bitcoin is not the dominant transmitter of volatility to other cryptocurrencies. Koutmos (2018) examines the return and volatility transmission between the 18 major cryptocurrencies by using the approach of Diebold and Yilmaz (2009). Bitcoin is reported as the main transmitter of return and volatility effects to the other cryptocurrencies. Katsiampa (2019) employs the diagonal BEKK model and finds significant volatility co-movement between Bitcoin and Ethereum. Ji et al. (2019) study the return and volatility transmissions across six major cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Stellar, and Dash) using the approach of Diebold and Yilmaz (2012) and find that Bitcoin and Litecoin are the net transmitters of return and volatility effects to the other cryptocurrencies. However, Ethereum, the second-largest currency, is the net recipient of the spillovers. Katsiampa et al. (2019a) uses the BEKK-MGARCH model to examine the shock and volatility transmission between three leading cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin) and finds a bidirectional shock transmission between the pairs of Bitcoin–Ethereum and Bitcoin–Litecoin. Moreover, bidirectional volatility transmissions are observed between the Bitcoin–Ethereum, Bitcoin–Litecoin, and Ethereum–Litecoin pairs. Canh et al. (2019) investigate volatility dynamics across the seven major cryptocurrencies by employing the DCC-MGARCH model and find significant volatility transmission between all cryptocurrencies. Liu and Serletis (2019) employ the GARCH in mean model and find significant shock and volatility transmission between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. Beneki et al. (2019) apply the BEKK-GARCH technique to investigate the volatility transmission between Bitcoin and Ethereum. They find a unidirectional volatility spillover from Ethereum to Bitcoin. Based on the literature mentioned above, we noticed that none of the studies examined the spillovers between the cryptocurrency market during a crisis period. During various crises, many studies have examined the return/volatility spillover between different asset classes, for example, equity, bond, and commodity (Chen et al. 2002; Forbes and Rigobon 2002; Diebold and Yilmaz 2009; Aloui et al. 2011; Bekaert et al. 2014), but none have investigated cryptocurrencies. Hence, this study will address this literature gap. The contribution of our study to the literature on cryptocurrencies is four-fold. First, this study investigates the return and volatility spillover between the cryptocurrencies during crisis (COVID-19) and pre-crisis (pre-COVID-19) periods. The reason for selecting the COVID-19 crisis is that almost all financial markets declined sharply worldwide, including stock, bond, commodity, energy, and cryptocurrency markets. Here are few glimpses of the fall of big markets during COVID-19. The Bitcoin price was down 19 percent on 23 March 2020 from its price on 01 January 2020. Moreover, the largest one-day fall in the price of Bitcoin was 36% on 13 March 2020. The S&P 500 and DJIA indices were down 33 percent and 36 percent, respectively, on 23 March 2020 from their peaks on 19 February 2020. The price for West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell to an unbelievable $37.63 a barrel on 20 April 2020,Footnote 2 and the China Manufacturing Purchasing Manager’s Index (PMI) was down 33% in February 2020.Footnote 3 As cryptocurrencies have also been affected by COVID-19, the findings on spillovers can provide useful insights to crypto investors regarding portfolio and risk management during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, we estimate the return and volatility spillover using the VAR-AGARCH approach, proposed by McAleer et al. (2009). Previous studies have used various models/approaches, including the diagonal BEKK model, BEKK-MGARCH model, DCC-GARCH model, and the approach of Diebold and Yilmaz. While several studies have used the VAR-GARCH and VAR-AGARCH model to estimate spillover between different asset classes (Arouri et al. 2012; Jouini 2013; Yousaf and Hassan 2019), but no previous study has applied the VAR-AGARCH model to estimate return and volatility spillover between cryptocurrencies. The model used in this study includes the constant conditional correlation (CCC-GARCH) model of Bollerslev (1990) as a special case. This model is selected for three reasons: (a) the most commonly used multivariate models, like the BEKK and DCC-GARCH models, often suffer from unreasonable parameter estimates and data convergence problems (Bouri 2015). The VAR-AGARCH model overcomes these problems regarding parameters and convergence. (b) It incorporates asymmetry in the model, and (c) this model also calculates the optimal weights and hedge ratios. Third, we use high frequency (hourly) data to examine linkages between the cryptocurrencies, which provides a better and deeper insight to crypto investors. In the above-mentioned literature, all studies use daily data to study linkages between cryptocurrencies, except Katsiampa et al. (2019b). Finally, we also estimate the optimal weights and hedge ratios for pairs of cryptocurrencies during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods in order to provide useful insights to portfolio managers regarding asset allocation and efficient portfolio management during crisis and non-crisis periods. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Second section describes the “Methodology”, and third section provides the “Data and preliminary analysis”. Fourth section reports the “Empirical findings”, and fifth section “Conclude” the paper.",52

The Sharpe ratio based on the ARMA-GARCH forecast,December 2020,Lin Liu,Qiguang Chen,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Since Fama (1970) published his influential paper, there has been a thorough assessment of market efficiency. Various methods have been proposed over the decades to test the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), but the empirical results vary according to the specific markets chosen, periods of time, and even the selected methods. For instance, like the frictionless state in physics, the efficient market could just be viewed as an ideal state with no real existence in the world. However, it could serve as a useful benchmark for measuring relative efficiency of markets over space and time. In fact, it is more relevant to measure the relative efficiency of markets from the empirical perspective. Just as Campbell et al. (1997) pointed out, “The notion of relative efficiency—the efficiency of one market measured against another—may be a more useful concept than the all-or-nothing view taken by much of the traditional market-efficiency literature.” So far, researchers have tended to measure and investigate market efficiency using various statistical methods. One market efficiency measure is based on autocorrelation of returns. The idea behind this method is that a strong autocorrelation reflects a deviation from random walk pricing and is indicative of violations of the EMH. For example, the Q-statistic of Box and Pierce (1970) is usually used as a measure for market efficiency. Lo and Mackinlay (1988) proposed a test statistic, the ratio of variances, which is also used as a measure for market efficiency. Another type of market efficiency measure reflects the degree to which returns are associated with past market returns; it is similar to the delay measure of Mech (1993) and Hou and Moskowitz (2005). The logic behind it is that a security price has a lower efficiency if it incorporates the information contained in the market index movement slower than another. The literature mentioned above is based on the EMH, which uses many assumptions to describe the model, such as independence, limited variance, normality, and linear paradigm, among many others. However, some literature that tests the market efficiency relies on an alternative theory known as the fractal market hypothesis (FMH). This theory does not have the aforementioned strict assumptions but instead focuses on the nonlinearities in the financial market and supposes that the behavior of investors is affected by their level of understanding of the information along with the investment period. Based on the FMH, Liu et al. (1999) used a Hurst exponent and a time-varying Hurst exponent to describe the dynamic changes of market efficiency in the Hong Kong REITS market. They determined that the market had not yet reached the state of weak efficiency. Han et al. (2019) compared the efficiency of five primary indexes of different boards of the Chinese stock market using multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA). This method measures the multifractal degrees. The authors found that the SHSE-SZS300 index that reflects the overall trend of the Shanghai and Shenzhen main board markets was less efficient than the ChiNext index, which had the lowest multifractal lever among five indexes. Moradi et al. (2019) used the L-Co-R algorithm analyze the fractal features of the Tehran Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange. In essence, fractal theory is a type of chaos theory to some extent. Ola et al. (2014) applied the local polynomial approximation model, which is a method relating to chaos processes and testing to determine the efficiency of the Tehran Stock Exchange and found that the efficiency of the market could not be confirmed. Moreover, as the efficiency of the market is related to investor behavior, some works have indirectly analyzed the efficiency of the market from this perspective, for example, Wen et al. (2019). In principle, profitability is at the core of market efficiency. According to Malkiel (1992), “Moreover, efficiency with respect to an information set … implies that it is impossible to make economic profits by trading on the basis of [that information set].” However, the traditional measures of market efficiency do not reflect profitability. For example, using data from 56 markets, Griffin et al. (2010) found that variance ratios and market delay measures often showed greater deviation from random walk pricing in developed markets than emerging markets. However, they also found that short-term reversal strategies and momentum strategies could earn similar returns in both types of markets. Therefore, they argued that the usual efficiency measures might yield misleading inferences. It is regarded that a proper measure of market efficiency should directly reflect the expected return and the relevant risk. The Sharpe ratio (SR) is one of the main criteria of portfolio assessment, and it has been widely used to evaluate the performance of mutual funds. Sharpe (1966) proposed the now well-known Sharpe ratio to evaluate a fund’s return in excess of the risk-free rate, adjusted by the additional risk the fund assumes. A high Sharpe ratio indicates superior risk-adjusted performance. The Sharpe ratio can help measure market efficiency. Fortunately, one can derive the formula of the Sharpe ratio from the ARMA-GARCH model. Financial returns are often modeled as autoregressive time series with random disturbances having conditional heteroscedastic variances, especially with GARCH type processes that have been extensively used in the financial and econometric literature as risk models of many financial time series. The relationship between the SR and the R2 of the ARMA-GARCH model is investigated in this paper. This is related to the research on return predictability by the R2 of the regression of stock return on predictors implied by the rational asset pricing model. These research studies compare the observed R2 of predictive regressions with the maximal bounds permitted by asset pricing models, and through the comparison, they conclude whether the market is effective. Kirby (1998) first proposed the frame of analyzing the restrictions on predictability implied by the rational asset pricing model. Based on similar frameworks, Levich and Potì (2015) constructed an upper bound on the explanatory power of predictive regressions motivated by “no good-deal” restrictions in the currency market and found that the currency predictability exceeded the bound, thereby showing that the market is not effective. Huang and Zhou (2017) provided two theoretical upper bounds on the R2 of the regression and reported that the predictive R2 was significantly larger than the upper bounds. Their bounds were tighter than Ross (2005), who is a pioneer of providing the bounds on predictability for all asset pricing models under no arbitrage conditions. Potì (2018) proposed an upper bound on the predictability of asset returns, which was at least as tight as Huang and Zhou (2017). However, we do not make a comparison between the predicted R2 and the theoretical boundaries based on asset pricing models under capital market equilibrium because we do not measure the degree of market efficiency precisely but only compare the market efficiency among markets. So, we focus on testing whether the SR can show differences in market efficiency. We find that the SR can be formulated with a monotonic increasing function of R2. We also compare the SR with another indicator proposed by Zhang (1999), namely conditional entropy. This paper proceeds as follows. In ""The Sharpe Ratio based on the ARMA-GARCH Forecast"" section, the formula of the SR is derived from the ARMA-GARCH model. ""Stochastic simulation"" section applies the method through stochastic simulation and provides a comparison with the conditional entropy indicator. ""Empirical Research"" section presents the empirical results of the S&P 500 Index and the SSE Composite Index. ""Conclusion"" section gives concluding remarks.",7

Investor sentiment is the expectation of market participants about the future cash flows (returns) and investment risk (De Long et al. 1990). Because traditional stock market theories comprehended market dynamics under the theoretical framework of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) and random walk theory, they did not consider investor sentiment as an important aspect. However, they failed to explain the heterogeneous behaviour of investors in the capital market. Investors’ sentiment is a vital aspect of the capital market, as it contributes to frequent fluctuations in the stock price and thus creates uncertainty about future returns on investments. In the past few decades, there have been radical changes in the Indian financial environment, especially in the basic structure—for example, shifting from a savings-oriented economy to an investment-oriented economy. These changes have increased heterogeneity in the composition of participants and impacted investors’ risk-taking behaviour. As per the EMH in classical financial theory, market participants exhibit rational risk aversion. Moreover, the information efficiency of the market does not allow participants to outperform the market (Fama 1965). The classical theory fails to explain the presence of systematic mispricing in the capital markets resulting from sentimental factors. Behavioural financial theories claim that irrational behaviour of noise traders and arbitrators causes a disparity in asset prices from their intrinsic (fundamental) values. Recent theoretical advances in behavioural finance and empirical evidence both have rejected the hypotheses of classical financial theory because of its assumption of rationality of agents in capital markets. In the previous decade, rational participants did not seem to have played a leading role in bringing the value of assets up to the then current value of anticipated cash flows (Baker and Wurgler 2007). Behavioural finance offers an alternative model that claims that economic phenomena can be better understood if the investors are accepted to not be entirely rational. In this context, the asset pricing not only includes the risk-related anticipated rates but also the impact of investor expectations on the returns. Behavioural finance explains the relationship between investment and the investor’s psychology. Investor behaviour is reflected in the stock prices, and market fluctuations, which ultimately shape the market, are themselves shaped by the psychology of the investors. Baker and Wurgler (2006) argued that market sentiment creates a tendency for investors to be optimistic or pessimistic while speculating prices instead of deciding on fundamental factors. Previous studies sought to detect the predictability of sentiments as a systematic risk factor valued as per certain conditions in the market. Studies from developed economies like the USA are far ahead in understanding the sentiment-related market dynamics (Barberis et al. 1998; Lee et al. 2002; Neal and Wheatley 1998). Academic study of investor sentiment in developing economies with rapidly growing capital markets is still in infancy. Previous research has mainly focused on the influence of investors’ sentiment on investment returns, whereas the effect of sentiment on the conditional volatility structure of the market is less explored. Also, even among those studies that consider sentiment as a critical factor influencing the time-varying stock return, volatility and potential profitability relating to noise traders were the main aspects of focus. During the periods of high sentiment and low sentiment, noise traders act differently to keep their positions secure. During the high sentiment episodes, their participation and trading is more aggressive compared to that during a low sentiment episode. This is caused by naive and unaware noise traders’ misjudgement of potential risk. Past academic studies about emerging economies have not explored such factors in-depth. The present study is an attempt to address the above-mentioned issues by using a market-oriented sentiment index. We developed an investors’ sentiment index by using multiple sentiment yardsticks mentioned by Baker and Wurgler (2006). Considering the investors’ sentiments’ contribution to volatility in emerging markets, the current study aimed to establish new empirical evidence to add a more comparative dimension to the existing literature. The findings can help market participants to understand the role of investor sentiment in the determination of conditional volatility of the market and to take decisions to optimise the portfolio. This study developed the aggregate sentiment index (ASI) from market-oriented sentimental factors such as trading volume, put-call ratio, advance-decline ratio, market turnover, share turnover and number of initial public offers (IPOs) in the period. The use of a constructed sentiment index under the GARCH framework to estimate the association between stock market volatility and investor sentiment makes this study different from existing studies. The findings indicate the persistence of volatility in market indices. Such persistent connection between the sentiment index and stock volatility suggests that investor sentiment is one of the most crucial determinants of Indian stock market volatility.",21

The savings are a source for investments, ensuring the continuity of the economy in a holistic manner. The main objective in converting savings into investments is to obtain additional income while avoiding the depreciation of assets due to facts such as inflation. In the past, investment instruments were limited to precious metals such as silver and gold. Due to the challenges in the use of precious metals in trade, paper money and the banking system emerged, resulting in countries starting to use their national currencies. Thus, money and capital markets have evolved with the increase in transaction volume and opportunities in the communication system. Consequently, new financial investment instruments (foreign currency, deposit interest, stock, bonds, etc.) have been added to traditional ones (precious metals, etc.), creating the investment instruments of today. Therefore, many investment instruments have become available in financial markets for individuals to evaluate their savings options. This has raised the question, “Which investment instrument should be selected under the current conditions?” To answer this question, the factors affecting financial investment instruments should be determined first. Several hypotheses and theories have been presented to answer the questions of how security prices change in financial markets and what affects price changes. Markowitz (1952) developed the modern portfolio theory (MPT) to determine how a rational individual would create a portfolio to ensure high returns when making an investment decision. Before Markowitz (1952), economists (Keynes and others) considered distributing portfolios as wrong because they believed the investors had insufficient experience. Therefore, they encouraged investors to use the investment instruments they were accustomed to. In contrast, MPT determines the best possible portfolio by distributing it according to the selected risk level. In fact, it suggests that it is more logical to use investment instruments in different sectors rather than use the ones in the same sector when distributing portfolios (Fischer 2019). The core point of MPT is that high return comes with high risk.Footnote 1 Capturing the many basic points of MPT, Eugene Fama (1965) and Paul A. Samuelson (1965) developed the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) in the 1960s. Completing Markowitz's (1952) MPT, EMH provided diversity through the concept of indexing or a broad-based market index by holding an array of stocks without having to select individual securities (Fischer 2019). According to EMH, financial markets are effective in terms of activity, resource allocation, and information distribution. In other words, there is no cost for security supply and demand in the market; market resources are optimally distributed and prices in the market reflect all information. In addition, it is given that investors in the market are rational individuals who have full and precise information and try to maximize their benefits (Bayraktar 2012). According to Fama (1965), since prices act according to the random walk model, they will fluctuate around their real value and eventually reach the real value (Delcey 2019). In the random walk model, since the prices move randomly, the future estimation cannot be made with available data. Therefore, it is impossible to estimate the future prices of securities using technical analysis in the market (Yıldırım 2017). Roberts (1967) stated that the effectiveness of markets is categorized into three different levels based on different information sets. These are (Fama 1970; Malkiel 1989):
 Weak form: Current prices in the market are considered to reflect all information from past prices in the market. Semi-weak form: Market prices reflect public information in addition to past prices. Strong form: All information about the prices in the market is available to all investors and the prices reflect this information. Therefore, even in the weakest form, the prices in the market are permanently at the equilibrium price. If the equilibrium price deviates from its original level, the market factors will work quickly to bring the price to the new equilibrium level. Consequently, no investor can make excessive profit using the information in the market. In the late 1970s, discussion began on how effective the markets are because of the “bubbles” that appear in the markets, and also whether all investors are rational individuals like the theories suggest. In other words, an ordinary investor who has just entered the market and an investor who has spent years in this business cannot be expected to make a decision with the same rationality. In the 1980s, “behavioral finance” was established by the psychologists Kahneman and Tversky (1979), the founders of “prospect theory” which argues that the investor makes decisions based on the potential value of profit and loss rather than the profit of the decision, and Richard Thaler (1980) who is the finance theorist applied the prospect theory to economic issues first (Hammond 2015). Shefrin (2002) organized behavioral finance phenomena around three themes, which are:
 Heuristic-driven bias, which includes investors’ biases that cause them to make mistakes. Frame dependence, which includes how decision-making problems are framed, which affects investors’ perceptions of risk and return. Inefficient markets due to market prices that are affected by heuristic-driven bias and frame dependence. Individuals who make financial investments will make mistakes. Behavioral finance can help investors identify and predict both their own mistakes and other investors’ mistakes (Shefrin 2002). The premise of behavioral finance is that investment decisions are made to satisfy the investor rather than maximizing the profit. Consequently, while examining the accuracy of the model put forward by empirical studies in traditional finance, it is also important to create models that explain the behavior patterns in the market based on behavioral finance (Sümer and Aybar 2016). Whichever theory one follows, the primary purpose of an investor is to make profit, for which the investor has to choose an investment tool. In this context, decision-making is the process of selecting the most appropriate option by evaluating the important criteria among the available alternatives. In cases where there is too much data and too many alternatives, making a decision with the human mind may result in a wrong decision. In such cases, a mathematical model can be created to arrive at the most appropriate alternative. Many studies discuss decision-making methods that use mathematical modeling. Among these, the leading method is known as analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which was first described by Saaty (1977). Several other studies that examine models other than AHP are Al-Harbi (2001), Kou et al. (2014), Kou et al. (2019), Li et al. (2018), and Wang et al. (2008). Moreover, studies that apply decision-making problems for financial investment are Gerlein et al. (2016), Korczak et al. (2016), Nobakht et al. (2012), and Wei et al. (2005). In this study, we created a model to help the investor select the most profitable investment instrument among several others. The model we used, which includes different methods such as autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL), AHP, and L-Fuzzy sets, is a new method that has not been used before. The difference is that this is a multidisciplinary study that combines mathematical analysis with econometric analysis. To examine the usability of the model, we selected three different investment instruments, gold, USD, and EURO, which are the most preferred investment instruments in Turkey. We divided this paper into five sections. In Section 2, we examine the financial investment instruments that we selected to apply to our model. Section 3 provides information about the factors affecting these investment instruments. Section 4 provides a brief review of the literature. In Section 5, after providing information about the data and the variables, we first conducted econometric analysis to determine the factors that affect each of the selected investment instruments. We then provide information about the fuzzy soft sets and how to implement them into the decision-making algorithm. Section 5 illustrates the application of decision making for financial investment by using the results obtained from econometric analysis and the investment preferences of the selected investor. Section 6 concludes the study.",16

Iheonu,Simplice A. Asongu,Patrick K. Ojiem,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"The growth and development of every economy depends on the performance of various sectors of the economy. An important sector that contributes towards economic growth and development is the financial sector. Development of the financial sector enhances efficient access to financial services and products. Developments in the financial sector enable the flow of funds, which drives consumption and investment, thereby increasing employment, lifting individuals out of poverty, and thus improving economic performance (Tchamyou & Asongu, 2017). An efficient intermediation process and improved financial sector increase the magnitude of domestic savings and boost the effectiveness of monetary policy in any nation or region by ensuring that scarce financial resources are channelled to the highest priority economic alternatives, outcomes and investments (Asongu & Odhiambo, 2019; Tchamyou, 2020). In the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the financial sector is still developing; its shortcomings are reflected in the difficulties faced by households and corporations to acquire credit. In fact, Alfaro et al. (2004) and Choong, Yusop and Soo (2004) have pointed out that inadequate development of the financial sector either in the market aspects or relating to institutions restricts the readiness of an economy to enjoy the benefits accruing from foreign direct investment (FDI) spillovers. The benefits of other forms of capital inflows can also be reduced as a result of an inadequate development in the financial sector. Data for some selected ECOWAS member countries show substantial differences in the level of financial sector development as reflected by domestic credit to the private sector. Of the seven countries shown in Fig. 1, the level of financial sector development in Sierra Leone can be seen to be relatively low compared to other ECOWAS countries. A similar case can also be said about Nigeria on the average. Compared to other emerging countries in Africa such as South Africa and Egypt, financial sector development in the ECOWAS is low. For example, between 2001 and 2017, domestic credit to the private sector as a percentage of GDP in Egypt averaged 37%, whereas in South Africa it stood at 142%. However, in Nigeria, domestic credit to the private sector as a percentage of GDP averaged 13.03% between 2001 and 2017, and it was 4.85% in Sierra Leone in that period.
 Domestic Credit to the Private Sector (% of GDP). Source: WDI (2019) The weaknesses in the financial sector in the ECOWAS could reflect the suboptimality of domestic investment levels and a poor general economic performance. Jalilian and Kirkpatrick (2007) and Odhiambo (2010) highlighted some benefits of a developed financial sector, such as facilitating domestic enterprises’ access to local funds that will enable them to purchase new equipment, adopting advanced technology, attracting skilled labour, easing the credit constraint encountered by foreign companies and the ability to guide foreign direct investment in creating backward linkages with the rest of the economy. It is important to note that financial sector development is not only essential for investment in businesses but also has a positive impact on income distribution (Xu et al., 2003; Tchamyou, Erreygers & Cassimon, 2019) by enabling the poor to invest in physical and human capital. Contemporary growth theories (Kapur, 1976; Mathieson, 1979; Romer, 1986; Romer, 1990; Grossman & Helpman, 1991; Pagano, 1993) have acknowledged the supportive role finance plays on the levels of capital accumulation and savings. Savings respond positively to variations in financial variables (Oyaromade, 2005) and influence the rate of technological development. Investment theories such as the Tobin Q theory and the Duesenberry (1958) financial theory of investment have also acknowledged the importance of financial sector development for new investment. Hamuda et al. (2013) reported that developed nations have accumulated a substantial level of investment over time. This is a clear indication of the key importance of increasing investment in the ECOWAS. Although theoretical considerations suggest that financial sector development drives (domestic) investment, empirical evidence for the ECOWAS is sparse. Empirical research by Asare (2013) and Sakyi et al. (2016) has focused on the Ghanaian economy. However, our study is different from the highlighted studies, as it adopts a panel data procedure and thus accounts for more countries in the estimation procedure. The present research also departs from panel data studies of similar scope (e.g., Ndikumana, 2000; Misati & Nyamongo, 2011) by utilising a more contemporary dataset and accounting for cross-sectional dependence as well as the long-run country-specific heterogeneity. It is helpful to have rich information on the interrelations among macroeconomic variables based on updated datasets to help policy-making decisions be made in an informed manner, especially including long-run cross-specific heterogeneities to derive more robust findings. The relevance of this study is also premised on the importance of investment in boosting economic activities that can lead to better living standards and lower poverty rates in the selected African countries. The African Development Bank (2018) has stated that the ECOWAS region has the highest number of countries where more than 30% of the population live on less than $1.90 a day. Murthy and Soumya (2007) presented some arguments for the importance of investment on poverty reduction. The unfavourable economic conditions in ECOWAS countries have made it critical to identify key factors that can aid in the improvement of investment. This study analyses financial sector development with the help of three different indicators to mitigate the potential issue of generalisation on the impact of financial sector development on domestic investment. This study captures financial sector development with (1) domestic credit to the private sector; (2) bank credit to bank deposit; and (3) broad money supply. The study also employs the augmented mean group (AMG) estimator, which is robust to the cross-sectional dependence that is likely to be significantly present in ECOWAS. The remainder of the paper presents a brief literature survey, the methodology and data employed, description and analysis of results and conclusions with relevant policy recommendations.",11
6.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,12 July 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-020-00188-z,Effect of financial constraints on the growth of family and nonfamily firms in Turkey,December 2020,Bahadır Ergün,Ömer Tuğsal Doruk,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Access to financing is a significant constraint for firms operating in developing countries with incomplete financial liberalization processes (Chauvet and Jacolin 2017; for Turkey, see Gezici 2007). Such financing constraints have attracted research interest (for seminal studies, see Fazzari et al. 1988; Carpenter and Petersen 2002). Similarly, research on family firms has increased in recent years, with a particular focus on the differences between family and nonfamily firms (Zellweger et al. 2010). Along these lines, the present study aimed to reveal the relationship between financing constraints and firm growth in family and nonfamily firms in the context of the developing Turkish economy. Business growth is affected by the costs and availability of financing (Binks & Ennew, 1996). Financing sources include internal cash flow and external debt or (new) equity. According to Modigliani and Miller (1958), in perfect markets, these sources are perfect substitutes for firms. However, a large body of literature has suggested that these sources do not have the same impact on all firms, and their accessibility may differ as well (Andres 2011). If a firm cannot obtain external financing, the only source left is its own internal cash flow. This means the firm is financially constrained. The present study has its roots in Fazzari et al. (1988); Andres (2011); and Carpenter and Petersen (2002). Since Fazzari et al.’s (1988) seminal paper, many subsequent studies of financing constraints have demonstrated the dependency of firm investment on internal cash flow. In this strain of literature, Andres (2011) was one of the earlier studies to focus on family firms. That study suggested that founding family firms are less vulnerable to external financing constraints and face relatively lower agency costs. While the main concern of prior studies had been investment, Carpenter and Petersen (2002) moved the financial-constraint literature forward by focusing on firm growth. Following these studies, the present study explored the financing-constraint–firm-growth nexus in the context of family and nonfamily firms in Turkey. Unlike previous studies, this study applied the literature on financial constraints, firm growth, and family firms to the context of Turkey as a developing economy and employed an advanced econometric panel-data method. We propose that family firms have some structural features that tend to mitigate financing constraints in the Turkish economy context. The existing literature tends to assume that family firms are financially constrained (Andres 2011; Coleman and Carsky 1999; Croce and Marti 2017; Lopez-Gracia and Sanchez-Andujar 2007; Poutziouris 2001). The present study, however, assumes they are financially unconstrained. Since family firms are controlled by large family groups who tend to be highly reputable and have close ties to financing institutions, we assume they are financially unconstrained. We also estimated our model based on the “Big Six” family groups, who manage more than 50% of the manufacturing sector. Thus, this study contributes to the literature by focusing on the nexus of financing constraints and firm growth in the context of family firms and the related effects of network and reputation in a developing country where equity markets are limited, and credit rationing occurs. Several studies have found that, in developing countries, financial liberalization policies are insufficient for supporting the finance–growth nexus and for mitigating firms’ financing constraints (Demir 2009a; Gezici 2007; Laeven 2003; Ro et al. 2017). Likewise, there is no clear evidence that financial liberalization eases financing constraints in Turkey (Demir 2009a; Günçavdı et al. 1998). Turkey still has an underdeveloped capital market, even though it has initiated financial liberalization processes.Footnote 1 Capital market imperfections persist in Turkey, including credit rationing (Günçavdı et al. 1998) and a lack of capital market deepening (Demir 2009a, 2009b, 2009c; Capital Markets Board [CMB; in Turkish, SPK] 2019). Turkish capital markets are dominated by public bonds (SPK (CMB) 2019), which account for more than 75% of the capital market. Further, the market capitalization of publicly traded firms is lower than that of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the global average (see World Bank World Development Indicators (World Bank 2019) for details). It is structurally harder to obtain external financing in Turkey, even for large publicly traded firms.Footnote 2 Moreover, the Turkish economy has been dependent on manufacturing since the structural transformation of the early 1980s.Footnote 3 In 2018, manufacturing accounted for approximately 20% of the gross domestic product (GDP). Furthermore, listed family-owned manufacturing firms have close ties to six influential families (i.e., the “Big Six”: Koç, Sabancı, Anadolu, Zorlu, Doğan, and Ülker), who hold more than 50% of the total equity in this sector. Thus, in the present study, nonfamily-affiliated firms are considered financially constrained since family membership offers the advantage of mitigating financing constraints. Because of data limitations for family-based SMEs (small- and medium-sized firms) in Turkey, we studied large publicly held family firms. These are large companies owned and managed by a small number of families. This perspective provides for a unique analysis of the link between financing constraints and growth in emerging markets. This study aimed to fill a gap in the literature by focusing on the differences between family and nonfamily firms’ growth dependency on internal cash flow in a developing-country context. To the best of our knowledge, this study is among the first to consider the link between financing constraints, firm growth, and family-firm status in a developing country, with a focus on mitigating financing constraints in the face of capital market imperfections. In Turkey, the pyramidal state-organized business system has dominant characteristics; therefore, family firms are closely linked to reputation channels, and they show competitive dominance in the oligopolistic manufacturing sector. Thus, examining the financing-constraint hypothesis with regard to family ownership has important implications for the current related literature, especially the literature on emerging economies. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: The second section presents the literature review and hypotheses. Then, we provide detailed information about the dataset and estimation methods. The fourth section discusses the econometric estimation results. In the fifth and final section, the findings, limitations, and suggestions for future research are discussed. As previously mentioned, this study combined three strands of financial economics literature to examine the relationship between financing constraints and firm growth in the context of family firms in Turkey. Financing constraints are considered a significant obstacle for firms that need external financing for their intangible or fixed capital investments (or research and development [R&D] investments) to meet their growth or profit goals. Thus, access to external financing plays an important role in firm growth. According to modern finance theories, under perfect capital market conditions, access to financing is dependent on corporate behavior (Harris and Raviv 1988; Myers and Majluf 1984). However, the reverse of the Modigliani and Miller (1958) theorem is the case in developing countries where, under imperfect capital market conditions, financial frictions are more often observed than in developed countries. The financing-constraint hypothesis has been widely examined in the literature from the perspective of investment (Andres 2011; Ataullah et al. 2014; Bertoni et al. 2010; Chen and Chen 2013; Chowdhury et al. 2016; Cleary 1999; ; Fazzari and Mott, 1986-1987; Fazzari and Petersen 1993; Fazzari et al. 1988; Hoshi et al. 1991; Hovakimian 2009; Kaplan and Zingales 1997; Serrasqueiro et al. 2016; Ughetto 2014). Those studies focused on financing constraints in developed countries. Only a handful of studies, however, have explored the financing-constraint hypothesis in developing countries (Bhaumik et al. 2012; Crnigoj and Verbic 2014; Demir 2009a; Ganesh-Kumar et al. 2001; George et al. 2011; Gezici 2007; Guariglia and Yang 2016; Laeven 2003; Lin and Bo 2012; Ro et al. 2017; Saeed and Vincent 2012; Shin and Park 1999). In the financial constraint–investment nexus literature, a few studies have examined financially constrained firms in developing countries in terms of family ownership or business group affiliations (Andres 2011; Bhaumik et al. 2012; George et al. 2011; Hoshi et al. 1991; Lensink et al. 2003; Shin and Park 1999). In Hoshi et al.’s (1991) sample, firms unaffiliated with a business group faced problems accessing external financing. Shin and Park (1999) investigated the investment–cash-flow dependency of Korean firms in terms of their membership in conglomerates (i.e., chaebols, which are owned by a single large shareholder or by families). They found that chaebols were significantly less dependent on their cash flow for investment; however, nonchaebols were significantly reliant on internal cash flow. Lensink et al. (2003) suggested that business group–affiliated firms in India had better access than nonaffiliated firms to external financing. Bhaumik et al. (2012) suggested that business groups in India had easier access to external credit. Andres (2011) found that founding-family ownership was associated with lower agency costs and could reduce information asymmetry regarding external financing sources. In summary, the literature has indicated that being a business group member or a family firm is beneficial for overcoming cash-flow constraints for investments. Such firms are less dependent on their own cash flow. Carpenter and Petersen (2002) developed a new approach to the financing-constraint hypothesis. Their approach, which has been adopted in subsequent studies, focuses on the relationship between financing constraints and firm growth (Coluzzi et al. 2015; Donati 2016; Fagiolo and Luzzi 2006; Guariglia and Mizen 2012; Guariglia et al. 2011; Hutchinson and Xavier 2006; Miroshnychenko et al. 2019; Oliveira and Fortunato 2006; Quader 2017; Serrasqueiro et al. 2010; Wagenvoort 2003; Yazdanfar and Turner 2013). Some of the above-mentioned studies focused on the relationship between firm growth and financial constraints. Others have tested Gibrat’s lawFootnote 4 or other determinants of firm growth. In these studies, cash flow was used as an indicator of internal financing-generation capacity. Difficulty accessing external financing and having to finance growth through internal cash flow has produced larger cash-flow coefficients in models built to depict the determinants of growth. From another perspective, a decrease in firm growth resulting from a lack of internal cash flow indicates reliance on increasing internal cash flow and problems accessing external financing. According to Carpenter and Petersen (2002), most small firms are constrained by internal financing for growth. Thus, only the small number of firms that use a great deal of external equity financing are less reliant on internal financing. Wagenvoort (2003) found that the relationship between growth and internal cash flow increases positively with a decrease in firm size. Meanwhile, listed firms suffer less from financing constraints. Hutchinson and Xavier (2006) explored differences in financing constraints between Slovenia and Belgium. They found that the growth of Slovenian firms was more constrained by internal financing than was the case for Belgium firms. In addition, the effect of cash flow on firm growth increased with a decrease in firm size. Oliveira and Fortunato (2006) suggested that the growth of young and small firms hinges on their internal cash-flow capacity. Fagiolo and Luzzi (2006) found that firm size was negatively affected by an increase in liquidity constraints. Serrasqueiro et al. (2010) demonstrated that cash flow is an important factor in the growth of SMEs; in addition, its influence increases when firm size decreases. Guariglia et al. (2011) found evidence that state-owned firms had access to external financing for growth; however, private firms were financially constrained. Exploring internal fund dependency in some Asian countries, Guariglia and Mizen (2012) found that firms used all their internal cash flow for growth, even during the 2008 global financial crisis. Yazdanfar and Turner (2013) found that internal cash flow had a positive effect on firm growth while Coluzzi et al. (2015) found that in five Euro-area countries, especially those with a larger percentage of small firms, the availability of internal cash flow had a more apparent effect on firm growth. Donati (2016) observed a positive effect of cash flow on firm growth in most sectors while Quader (2017) found that firm growth was dependent on profit-generation capacity. Therefore, an easing of financial constraints facilitates firm growth through access to external financing sources, and the incremental influence of cash flow on firm growth decreases monotonically. Finally, Miroshnychenko et al. (2019) found a positive effect of internal cash flow on firm growth. Table 1 provides more detailed information about the aforementioned literature.
 In summary, the review of the literature revealed that firms are financially constrained by their cash-flow-generation capacities. Researchers have explored differences in financing constraints based on firm size, age, geography, and other characteristics. Our literature review suggests that the present study is the first to focus on the effects of differences in dependence on internal cash flow on the growth of family- and nonfamily-owned firms. The current literature indicates that family firms have their own characteristics and have limited access to financing since they are relatively small (Anderson and Reeb 2003; La Porta et al. 1999; Shleifer and Vishny 1986; Ali et al. 2007; Anderson and Reeb 2003; Andres 2008; Asaba 2013; Block 2012; Chen et al. 2014; Chrisman et al. 2004; De Massis et al. 2014; Herrero 2011; Luo and Chung 2013; Maury 2006; Songini & Gnan, 2015; Villalonga and Amit 2006). However, family ownership may enable access to external finance channels. Such examples may not be generalizable given the nature of family firms. However, the pyramidal state-organized business system provides insight into the link between financing constraints and firm growth in developing countries (see Akkemik and Özen 2014, on the pyramidal state-organized business system in Turkey). The main hypothesis of this study is that family-owned firms have advantages for accessing external financing for growth. Despite the perfect-market assumption, which dates back to Modigliani and Miller (1958), where all of the financing sources are perfect substitutes for each other, firms may have limited access to external financing in incomplete and imperfect markets, especially in developing countries. The sources of such distortion include asymmetric information, agency costs, and transaction costs (Andres 2011). We argue that being a family firm reduces the asymmetric-information problem (Shin and Park 1999).Footnote 5 Further, family firms are subject to fewer agency costs (Anderson and Reeb 2003). The incentive structures in family firms reduce agency conflicts between debt and equity claimants. Moreover, bondholders believe that family firms can better protect their interests (Anderson and Reeb 2003). These factors lead to easier access to external financing. Moreover, we claim that, relative to nonfamily firms, family firms have structural advantages that mitigate financing constraints. Reputation and network effects are other factors that may facilitate access to external sources. Lensink et al. (2003) emphasized the significant effect of reputation on access to financing, noting that “the group name may serve as a high-quality brand name, or familiarity with other firms of the same group may induce a creditor to be more willing to lend to a firm” (p. 95).Footnote 6 In addition, the information-gathering channel might also be more effective for family firms than for their nonfamily peers. CEOs and other executives use information disclosure more efficiently than their nonfamily-firm peers since agency costs are expected to minimal for family firms in our sample. This is because the family firms in this study belong to well-regarded small families, and therefore their executives are able to sustain their corporate cultures. Stiglitz (2000) emphasized that information gathering is important for efficient firm-level decisions under imperfect capital markets. Family firms are managed by small families with a good reputation, and therefore they can gather relevant information about the financial markets. Akkemik and Özen (2014) and Gökşen and Üsdiken (2001) noted that the Turkish institutional environment is a kind of state-organized business system, and Turkey is dominated by large family firms. A majority of Turkey’s nongovernment firms are owned by families (Gunduz and Tatoglu 2003). Among publicly held firms in Turkey, 80% are controlled by families (Yurtoglu 2003). Further, the pyramidal structure of family firms amplifies family ownership (Oba et al. 2010). The essential characteristics of the Turkish institutional environment include its financial system and business-group membership. Most banks in Turkey belong to families that operate a large number of financial and manufacturing firms. This could lead to those families’ interests being favored in terms of monitoring (Yurtoglu 2000).Footnote 7 Given Turkey’s underdeveloped capital market, firm growth may be reliant on internal cash-flow-generation capacity. We assert, however, that family firms can tackle such financing constraints based on their natural characteristics and their reputation and network channels. Thus, the main study hypotheses are expressed as follows: 
H1a: For family firms, there is no relationship between financing constraints and firm growth.
 
H1b: For nonfamily firms, there is a positive relationship between financing constraints and firm growth.
 The results obtained from testing these hypotheses may offer insight into the firm growth–financial constraint nexus in terms of family membership, especially in “state-organized business” markets in developing countries.",8

6.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,22 May 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-020-00186-1,Portfolio optimization of credit risky bonds: a semi-Markov process approach,December 2020,Puneet Pasricha,Dharmaraja Selvamuthu,Raimondo Manca,Unknown,Unknown,Male,Male,"The problem of credit risk, which consists of finding the likelihood of default of an obligor going into debt, is one of the most important problems in financial world. The credit risk, also known as default risk, is the risk of lender that borrower may not be able to meet its debt obligations. Credit risk analysis consists of finding the likelihood of default of an obligor going into debt. Credit risk models are basically divided into reduced-form models and firm value models (also known as structural models). Firm value models consider the model in Merton (1974) as the base model, which gives a mechanism of default in terms of the relation between liabilities and assets at maturity time T. On the other hand, reduced-form models do not specify the actual mechanism of default but model it as a non-negative random variable with distribution depending on the economic co-variables, interested readers can refer Duffie and Singleton (2012). There are many parameters associated with bond issuer or bond itself, which quantify the credit risk associated with it. Credit rating is one of the important parameters. Credit rating of a credit risky bond, assigned by a company, is an evaluation of its likelihood of default and ability to pay back the loan. Better the credit rating of a bond, safer it is. Banks and the firms that issue bonds are most concerned to quantify the default risk. International organizations like Standard & Poor’s assign ratings to the companies that issue bonds in order to evaluate the credit risk. A credit rating is given to each company that issues a bond, specifying its capacity to repay the debt. Clearly, a higher interest rate is expected from a firm whose rating is lower. Credit ratings have become important since they are used as an input in many models for calculating economic capital for banks. Therefore, estimating the transition matrices of credit ratings is at the core of risk management and has applications in pricing derivatives and credit portfolio optimization. Models for credit quality based on ratings are also frequently used in the pricing and risk management literature, see for example Jarrow et al. (1997); Kijima and Komoribayashi (1998); Akutsu et al. (2003). In 1997, Jarrow et al. (1997) applied for the first time Markov processes to capture the time evolution of credit ratings. These models are called “migration models"". One of the drawbacks of this model is that it gives, in small time interval, zero probability of default to bonds with high credit ratings. Other papers (Hu et al. 2002; Nickell et al. 2000; Baillo and Fernandez 2007; Grimshaw and Alexander 2011)) followed the same approach to generate the transition matrix. More recent contributions include the quantification of the impact of business cycles on the dynamics of credit ratings and corresponding computation of conditional migration matrices (Boreiko et al. 2018), the proposal of parsimonious higher order Markov chains models able to reproduce downgrade rating momentum effects (Baena-Mirabete and Puig 2018) and the modeling of credit default data with intensity-based model stemmed from hidden Markov chains (Yu et al. 2017; Yu et al. 2019). In 2017, Dharmaraja et al. (2017) proposed a Markov chain model with catastrophe to determine the mean time of default of a risky asset. Centanni et al. (2017) modelled the dynamics of defaults for a dynamic set of firms in a given time period under the Markovian assumption. They assumed that there are some observable variables such as the total number of defaults, the total number of firms operating in the market at time t and some unobservable variables such as the number of firms alive or defaulted in each class at time t. Then, they using particle filtering techniques they obtained an approximation of the distribution of unobserved variables. Later, Tardelli (2018) extended this idea to find the probabilistic prediction of the actual partition of the population, and of the conditional distribution of the distance to defaults. In other direction on empirical analysis, Kou et al. (2014) studied the effectiveness of multiple criteria decision making methods in evaluating clustering algorithms by performing experiments on real-life credit risk and bankruptcy risk data sets. In the papers by Nickell et al. (2000); Kavvathas (2001); Lando and Skødeberg (2002), appropriateness of Markov process for the description of accurate rating dynamics was addressed. Carty and Fons (1994); Nickell et al. (2000) proved that the current rating of a company depends not only on its last rating but on all the previous ones, the effect called rating momentum. Thus, the evolution of credit rating dynamics is non-Markov. Carty and Fons (1994); Duffie and Singleton (2012), showed that a complete information of the time spent inside the states is of major interest in the credit risk problem. The credit migration probability depends on the time spent by a company in a particular rating. In a continuous-time homogeneous Markov chain, durations in states follow an exponential distribution. An exponential distribution has a constant hazard function. But for credit rating dynamics, the hazard function is not constant. Hence, Markov model for credit rating is not appropriate (Frydman and Schuermann 2008). The other issue is time dependence. It means that in general, transition probabilities tends to change with the state of the economy, being low during periods of economic expansion and high during recession. Rating evaluation at two different time points is different (Nickell et al. 2000) and hence the process describing the evolution of rating dynamics is time non-homogeneous. The literature proposing models that addresses the non-Markov behavior of credit rating dynamics is of recent origin. Korolkiewicz and Elliott (2008) proposed a hidden Markov model assuming that the Markov chain governing the true credit quality evolution is hidden in noisy or incomplete observations about credit ratings. In the paper by D’Amico et al. (2005), they have considered the credit risk problem as a reliability problem. They applied time-homogeneous semi-Markov processes (SMP) to solve the first issue. The second issue has been solved by extending the state space by the same authors (D’Amico et al. 2016) and many further developments have been made in their model (D’Amico et al. 2011; D’Amico et al. 2010; D’Amico et al. 2012). In 2017, Pasricha et al. (2017) proposed a credit rating model based on a Markov regenerative process which is a generalization of semi-Markov process model. By optimization of portfolio consisting of credit risky bonds, we mean to find the optimal allocation of the wealth to the risky bonds in the portfolio such that the overall credit risk is minimum. In order to formulate a optimization problem, we need to define the risk measure to be used. For example, in equity portfolio optimization, the pioneering work by Markowvitz (1952) considers the variance of portfolio return as the risk measure. Konno and Yamazaki (1991) introduced mean absolute deviation as measure of risk and Young (1998) considered l∞norm as a risk measure. In credit portfolio optimization, value at risk was considered to quantify the portfolio credit risk in Morgan (1997). Later, Andersson et al. (2001) proposed a credit portfolio optimization model based on conditional value at risk (CVaR). Further Kalkbrener et al. (2007) considered risk measures VaR and CVaR (referred therein as Expected shortfall) for credit risk optimization formulation with importance sampling technique for calculation of risk measures. Their formulation overcomes the numerical problems associated with calculation of CVaR allocation in credit portfolio models. The other models proposed in the literature considered l1 norm i.e., mean absolute deviation and l2 norm i.e., variance as a measure of risk. In (2017), Singh and Dharmaraja (2017) proposed a l∞ based credit portfolio optimization using credit rating dynamics modeled by a Markov chain. In 2015, Ma et al. (2015) proposed a model based on extreme value theory to evaluate the default risk of bond portfolios. On similar lines to Singh and Dharmaraja (2017), this article considers a l∞ norm i.e., min-max absolute deviation credit portfolio optimization model. However, due to the limitations of the Markov chains to model the credit rating dynamics, we assume that the credit rating dynamics of the risky bonds are assumed to follow a semi-Markov process and propose new risk premium adjustments for the pricing purposes. The transition probabilities of the rating migration is obtained using the historical data. Based on the transition probabilities, future credit ratings are obtained and hence following Jarrow et al. (1997), the price paths of credit risky bonds are obtained. These generated paths of returns of bonds are input parameters to the optimization model. Extensive numerical illustrations are given to show the applicability of the proposed model and is compared with Markov chain model proposed by Singh and Dharmaraja (2017). This article uses semi-Markov process to obtain the transition probabilities of the rating migration, however, one can consider the models by Centanni et al. (2017); Tardelli (2018) to obtain the dynamics of credit quality of firms and generate the path of bond returns. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. “The proposed framework” section introduces the min-max absolute deviation model followed by the semi-Markov credit rating model. “Proposed methodology” section proposed the algorithm to generate the future credit rating scenarios credit rating followed by the methodology to solve the portfolio optimization model based on the generated ratings. Numerical illustrations are given in “Empirical analysis” section, and “Conclusions and future work” section concludes the paper with future work.",4

It generally occurs as a result of a substantial descent in asset prices (Kaminsky et al. 2001; Kyle and Xiong 2001; Yuan 2005). Observations of high volatility in seemingly unrelated economies perplexes researchers and policymakers worldwide (Claessens et al. 2001). The cause of propagation of a financial crisis may be investors’ internationally diversified portfolios, whereby liquidity constraints faced by international investors can have repercussions for all markets where they have holdings. In times of crisis, international investors may compensate for the loss in a crisis country by selling stocks they have invested in other markets not affected by the crisis, thus triggering a panic amongst domestic investors. The concept of stock “reachability” for international investors can be used to reflect the potential transmission of a crisis signal to reachable stocks, which can also be compared to the effects observed in relation to “remote” or unreachable stocks (Boyer et al. 2006). Yuan (2005) suggests that there is a noisy signal of a borrowing constraint, which informed investors receive in terms of asset payoffs. The subsequent price fluctuation observed by uninformed investors’ associated with information asymmetry and borrowing constraint seeks a bailout from declining prices and causes crisis to spread to emerging markets. Thus the repercussions of the crisis are not confined to the crisis country: the ripples are observed in other countries as well. Several stock market crises have occurred in emerging and developed markets over the past few decades, namely, the great depression of 1930, the 1992 exchange rate mechanism crisis, the Mexican Peso crisis in 1994, the 1997 East Asian crisis, the Russian collapse of 1998, the 1999 Brazilian crisis, the 2008–2009 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and the 2009 European sovereign debt crisis. All these crises emerged in a particular country but had worldwide repercussions (Gallegati 2012; Forbes and Rigobon 2001). Before 1997, the term contagion was used to refer to the transmission of a medical disease. However, the scope of the term broadened since the currency crisis in Thailand. Beginning in July 1997, the Asian financial crisis beset East Asia and elevated the economic meltdown worldwide. The repercussions of the Thailand crisis worldwide initiated the use of the term contagion, specified as financial contagion. After the great depression of the 1930s, the subprime crisis of 2008–09 has been marked as the gravest financial crisis (Bekaert et al. 2014; Claessens et al. 2010; Jaffee 2008; Hwang et al. 2013) affecting the financial markets worldwide (Majid and Kassim 2009). Therefore, the present study concentrates on the 2008–09 subprime crisis as a reference point to investigate the channel of contagion. The study is closely related to the literature on international transmission of shocks where investor asset holdings are the mechanism through which crises propagate. The theoretical models of portfolio rebalancing (Kodres and Pritsker 2002), wealth constraints (Kyle and Xiong 2001; Calvo 1999; Yuan 2005; Boyer et al. 2006), and information asymmetry (Kodres and Pritsker 2002; Gennotte and Leland 1990; Romer 1993; Hong and Stein 2003; Barlevy and Veronesi 2003) establish the worldwide crisis propagation through the asset holdings of international investors as an antecedent to contagion. Kyle and Xiong (2001) demonstrate the ramifications of a crisis in one country for other countries as the investment loss suffered in the crisis country forcing investors to liquidate their holdings in other countries. Similarly, Kaminsky et al. (2004) and Valdes (1997) show that the crisis affects the liquidity of market participants and propagates it to the other markets. The larger liquidity shock in the crisis country increases credit rationing, thus coercing investors to liquidate their holdings in other countries to meet their margin requirements. Consequently, the asset prices in other countries decline and disseminate the crisis to other markets. Motivated by Kaminsky et al. (2004), Valdes (1997) and Kyle and Xiong (2001), the present study tries to examine whether the liquidity constraints that emerged at the time of crisis in the United States (US) is accountable for its transmission to the Indian market. First, the present chapter clarifies the theoretical explanation of the propagation of the price drop in one market to another, thus affecting the local investors who are not directly connected to the crisis-prone country. The study investigates how the liquidity constraint emerging in the US affects other assets in the Indian market using a regime switching model. Contrary to the aforementioned studies, the present study adopts a varied attribute to further classify emerging market assets. Namely, stocks are classified as “reachable” or “remote” and the regime-switching model is estimated to test the role of the “reachability factor” in terms of how international investors contribute to the propagation of liquidity constraints. The model portrays the movements of reachable stocks, which move in line with US stocks, and also shows the variability of remote stock price movements. Estimating the asymmetry in the persistence of two regimes during the downturns supports the theory of asymmetric contagion, as validated by Longin and Solnik (2001), Connolly and Wang (2000), Ang and Bekaert (2002) and Ang and Chen (2002). Boyer et al. (2006) estimated the cross-market correlation dynamics of the crisis country return with the returns in what they term “accessible” and “inaccessible” assets during the Asian crisis of 1997. However, the present study extends on this research by also estimating the regime shifts from one state to another state (calm to a crisis and crisis to calm). Further, the change in the regimes coupled with the similarities between the crisis country return (US) with the reachable and remote return in the Indian market during the subprime crisis is investigated. The objective of the study is to estimate the extent of how the crisis in the US motivated international investors to liquidate their holdings in Indian reachable stocks and its recurrent impact on the remote stocks. The extent of the margin calls arising at the time of crisis motivated international investors to sell reachable Indian stocks, in addition to their domestic stocks (i.e., US stocks). The visibly severe price reduction in reachable stocks compelled local investors in India to reduce their holdings in remote stocks as well. As such, the liquidity constraint faced by international investors initiated contagion in domestic markets. This research enables inferences about the timing of the subprime crisis of 2008–09 to be made and the material side effects of the crisis on the Indian market to be tested based on the reachability factor of Indian stocks to foreigners. Furthermore, testing the material side effects enables the reactions to the crisis in the Indian market to be investigated based on the reachable factor and the corresponding trigger on the remote factor to be further understood. The adoption of a regime-switching model is necessary to detecting the crisis timings for the reachable and remote stocks of the Indian market in relation to the crisis country. The model assumes that, at a point in time, the stock markets in the US is in one of two regimes, crisis or stable. The regime specifically determines the beginning and end of the crisis to develop a model where the movements of the Indian reachable and remote stocks capture the ramifications of the crisis in the Indian Market. As opposed to other studies on crisis transmission, the novelty of the present study is to capture the extent to which the reachability of Indian stocks to foreign investors determines the crisis transmission. Further, the study investigates whether Indian stocks can signal a crisis event by making a demarcation between reachability factors of Indian stocks to foreigners and investigating reachable and remote stocks separately. While capturing the timing of the crisis impacts on Indian stocks, the study estimates the material side effects of the crisis on Indian reachable and remote stocks in a Markov regime-switching framework. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines the literature review. Section 3 presents the methodology applied to capture the timing and the side effects of the crisis emanating from the US on the Indian market. Section 4 discusses the empirical interpretations and section 5 concludes.",

The failure of several banking institutions in the 2000s and the financial crisis of 2007 led to weaknesses in bank governance, especially since the measures adopted in terms of corporate governance discredited the role and specificities of banks. Therefore, new measures were taken to strengthen the internal governance of banks, which are considered a key factor in explaining banking performance. The latter has been the subject of several research studies, yet there continues to be a lack of unanimity regarding its determinants (Adams and Mehran 2008; Laeven and Levine 2009; Belkhir 2009a,b; Pathan 2009; Lee Siew and Mansor 2015; Caspar 2016; Chenini and Jarboui 2016; Ruhul et al. 2016; Fernandes et al. 2016; Basuonya et al. 2017; Hung et al. 2017; Manas and Saravanan 2017; Ataur and Jahurul 2018; Chen et al. 2018, Haris et al. 2019). The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of internal governance on the performance of Tunisian banks. Tunisia serves as an interesting case study since its banks are considered the most important source of funds. Domestic credit to the private sector provided by banks continues to contribute greatly to the Tunisian gross domestic product, which grew from 46.49% in 1998, to 60.81% in 2011, and 68.54% in 2017.Footnote 1 In recent years, Tunisian banks have been subject to new governance rules, specifically Circular N° 2006–06 for the implementation of a system of control, Circular 2006–07 concerning the Executive Credit Committee, Circular 2006–19 concerning internal control, and Circular N° 2011–06 concerning strengthening the rules of good governance in credit institutions, among others. As far as we know, no published empirical study has simultaneously taken into account the new measures that aim to strengthen the internal governance of banks (existence of a banking risk control committee, remuneration and incentive policies, structure, and size of the board of directors, etc.), especially for the Tunisian case. This paper seeks to fill this gap and contribute to the existing literature on two levels. First, the majority of research works that deal with the effect of banking governance on performance consider large banks only. Our study enriches the existing literature by including small and medium-sized banks in the survey. We consider our study as an initiative to better understand the relationship between governance and performance in the Tunisian banking sector. This paper highlights governance factors, which are driving down the performance of Tunisian banks, with a view to proposing solutions to limit their negative effects. Second, this study takes into consideration two dimensions of internal governance that can have an effect on the performance of banks and yet were neglected by previous works. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published empirical studies that combine, in the same econometric model, both the risk monitoring committee and CEO compensation to explain the performance of Tunisian banks. Despite the existence of numerous previous research papers exploring the topic, there continues to a lack of consensus on a definite relationship between the bank performance and its most influential factors. Thus, this study seeks to strengthen the argument of the relationship between the two by considering risk monitoring committee, compensation, and different sizes of banks. Because the Tunisian economy is mostly financed by banks, the performance, the survival and the success of these institutions are crucial. Based on this, it is of great interest to know what contributes to success and failure of banks, and how bank executives and the state can help through policy and strategy. To reach our aim, we used the annual data of ten Tunisian banks observed during the period 1998 and 2015. These data were collected from annual reports and the financial statements of banks, and based on it we performed an econometric model based on the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), which seems to be the most appropriate method for estimating parameters. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: section 2 presents our literature review, section 3 provides an overview of the Tunisian bank system, section 4 is our empirical investigation; Section 5 discusses the results of our study, while section 6 concludes and presents some interesting implications.",15

6.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,13 April 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-020-00176-3,Bitcoin pricing: impact of attractiveness variables,December 2020,Rodrigo Hakim das Neves,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Concurrent with a rapid price appreciation, the increase in financial market interest in digital currencies and in Bitcoin in particular, as well as global integration of virtual networks, have prompted the emergence of new academic studies related to economic behavior of this new asset that has been inserted in the world financial market. Factors that make the asset extremely volatile to information and market variables include the absence of a centralized institution that controls and guarantees the value of Bitcoin and the understanding that its price is based on the belief that the virtual currency will continue its upward trajectory. It seems that there are yet opportunities to get benefits from Bitcoin volatilities and its market inefficiencies (Bouri et al. 2018). It is important to highlight that this inefficiency is getting weaker over time since liquidity seems to have a positive effect on the informational efficiency of Bitcoin prices (S Kumar and Ajaz 2019). This study seeks to advance knowledge of how Bitcoin prices are set by the market, to identify the relevant variables affecting the Bitcoin market, and to provide a technical reference for the investors that believes in its appreciation over time and invests in this asset. The findings are also relevant for policymakers and monetary authorities in order to understand why people are seeing increasingly their interests to trade or hold Bitcoin. Understanding these interests is fundamental to create alternatives to avoid governments having their currencies depreciated against Bitcoin. Some studies point to three major variables that influence the Bitcoin price: macroeconomic/financial, such as dollar quotation and stock exchange index; attractiveness, such as increased interest in the asset evidenced by its increasing appreciation over the years; and the dynamics between demand and supply. The initial hypothesis of the research is that attractiveness factors influence the Bitcoin price at both global and local levels, updating previous studies of attractiveness pricing. These combined attractiveness factors define the interest of the world’s population in the asset, as measured by the number of Google searches for the terms bitcoin and bitcoin crash between December 2012 and February 2018. This study adds to the analysis the crisis variable through a measurement of the number of Google searches using the term crisis. It seeks to verify if, in troubled periods of crisis with repercussions at the global level, Bitcoin tends to be more attractive as an alternative investment, as evidenced by an increase in its price. The vector error correction model is the methodology chosen to test the hypothesis that the number of Google searches using the terms bitcoin and bitcoin crash affects the Bitcoin price and that, in times of increasing searches for news about crisis, there is an accompanying increase in the value of the digital currency. It is anticipated that the hypotheses and a feedback effect between endogenous variables will be confirmed. Nakamoto (2008) described Bitcoin as an electronic currency embedded in a peer-to-peer system and capable of being transferred directly from one participant to another without the intermediation of a financial institution. A process called proof of work helps to assure that duplicate transfer expenses are avoided. Through this process, the Bitcoin network confirms each transfer as legitimate and unique by analyzing the digital signature and recording the chronological order in which the transaction took place. The transactions recorded and confirmed are inserted into a block that becomes part of the blockchain, through a process known as mining. This chain of blocks, which contains all transaction history, is constantly sent to network participants to inform them of the new operations. In this sense, Nakamoto (2008) compared the digital currency to a stream of digital signatures. This entire technological and cryptographic framework already makes Bitcoin different from sovereign currencies, primarily because of its ability to be cited as a representation of digital value and its virtual decentralization. In this sense, there is no consensus among scholars about using of the term currency when referring to Bitcoin. Some relevant aspects of Bitcoin differ from traditional fiduciary currencies that will be analyzed. Initially, it is important to review some of a currency’s economic functions: as a medium of exchange, enabling the purchase (or sale) of products and services upon delivery (receipt) of the currency; as a unit of account, from which goods and services are priced; and as a store of value that ensures the maintenance of purchasing power and wealth over time, and sometimes allowing interest income through investment in financial assets. The question is whether Bitcoin has all these properties to be termed as currency. Yermack (2015) and Ciaian et al. (2016a) differ in this regard. Virtual money use has increased as a medium of exchange in the e-commerce environment where major brands such as Microsoft and Subway have offered it as a payment method in online purchases. The speed and low cost of transferring Bitcoin, the anonymity of the transference, and the transparency of transactions recorded in the blockchain are positive aspects that promote adoption of Bitcoin as cash. However, legal issues may compromise Bitcoin’s role as a medium of exchange since sovereign governments has authority to prohibit its adoption by their populations and emphasize negative aspects such as cyberattacks and virtual crimes—all characteristics that are cited by an analysis by Ciaian et al. (2016a). While investigating fraudulent activities at the MtGox brokerage firm aimed at leveraging the Bitcoin price, Gandal et al. (2018) highlighted threats to the Bitcoin network, such as Ponzi schemes, theft of Bitcoin brain wallets, and malware. Also, cryptocurrencies could be illegally used to facilitate Trade-based Money Laundering (TBML) schemes and it can be justified by the easy way the digital coins are transferred. Chao et al. (2019) say that TBML is seriously concerned by emerging markets and developing economies in a way that regulations and methods to monitor and fight against it have been created. The lack of regulation is also an unfavorable criterion, since it eliminates judicial settlements of disputes and makes it difficult to obtain reimbursement from operations prejudiced against cryptocoins. In November 2017, the Central Bank of Brazil - Bacen (2017) said that does not regulate or supervise virtual currencies even though it monitors related discussions in international forums. In addition, the bank emphasized the imponderable risks of this type of investment to the market, including the loss of all invested capital. Concerning the unit of account function, Ciaian et al. (2016a) highlighted the high volatility of Bitcoin pricing as costly from the point of view of the virtual re-mark of goods and services prices denominated in Bitcoin monetary units. This function is the main differentiating factor between Bitcoin and sovereign currencies. Another striking difference concerns to divisibility since the coin can be denominated beyond two decimal places (the smallest fraction of Bitcoin is called satoshi and corresponds to one hundredth of millionth of Bitcoin). Yermack (2015) stated that the market can be disconcerted about the use of multiple decimal places, hindering price comparisons by the consumer. Regarding the store of value function, Ciaian et al. (2016a) also stated that Bitcoin has two important advantages over other currencies: the fact that the offer is predetermined by the platform and is protected by cybersecurity since all registrations made in the blockchain are unchangeable. Volatility and cyberattacks are negative factors in this regard. In addition, investment in virtual currencies can generate interest income, including through available platforms, such as BitPass, that offer interest payments to customers who leave their bitcoins stored for a certain period of time. Bitcoin pricing has been the subject of research by scholars who seek to infer the variables that affect Bitcoin value. In the literature, basically, three groups of these variables are found: macroeconomic and financial; attractiveness; and the dynamics between demand and supply. There are studies that focus on just one of these groups and others that seek to conduct a more holistic analysis by covering all of them. Some authors have verified in their research that macro-financial variables do not have a statistically significant influence on Bitcoin pricing in the long term (Bouri et al. 2017; Chao et al. 2019; Ciaian et al. 2016a; Polasik et al. 2015). The price of gold, much compared to Bitcoin, also does not seem to be related to Bitcoin pricing (Bouoiyour and Selmi 2015; Kristoufek 2015). However, in the short term, economic factors seem to have a significant impact, as in the U.S. dollar quotation (Dyhrberg 2016; Zhu et al. 2017) and in the Chinese market represented by the Shanghai index (Bouoiyour and Selmi 2015; Kristoufek 2015). It is interesting to note that most published studies give important prominence in their analyses to attractiveness factors, such as the variable number of searches over time using the term bitcoin in Google Web Search. In the early years of Bitcoin consolidation, tests based on vector autoregressive and vector error correction methodologies indicated that the amount of searches on Google and Wikipedia had a strong temporal association with the price curve, i.e., that public interest in increasing knowledge about the asset’s operation was followed by the increase in its price (Buchholz et al. 2012; Kristoufek 2013; Kristoufek 2015). However, with the subsequent consolidation of the currency and the population’s greater knowledge concerning Bitcoin’s operation, the attractiveness factor has increasingly failed to have the same relevance as before (Ciaian et al. 2016a; Hayes 2017) even though attractiveness is still a valuable variable for pricing analysis. The final group concerns the dynamics between demand and supply. The equilibrium point of the supply and demand curve determines the Bitcoin price in a brokerage firm. However, what is peculiar about this digital currency is that the supply curve is known and pre-determined since there is a definitive limit on the quantity of virtual money offered in the market. Therefore, variations in the factors that determine and directly impact the demand curve enable the high volatility of this currency over time. In this sense, research seeks to use the variables that directly influence demand to predict currency pricing. Zhu et al. (2017) is one of the most recent studies about the impact of macroeconomic-financial factors on Bitcoin pricing. The author used some of the variables that affect gold pricing to identify those that have the same effect on Bitcoin pricing. The study defined Bitcoin as an investment asset rather than as a currency, because of its sensitivity to variations in macroeconomic indices. The study also noted that there was evidence of Granger causality in relation to gold price (GP) and dollar index (USDI) factors as applied to the dependent variable Bitcoin price. According to Zhu et al. (2017), the influence of the USDI was negative, possibly because a valuation of the U.S. dollar currency against other currencies is also applicable to the virtual currency Bitcoin. Therefore, it was inferred that at the moment of U.S. dollar appreciation, there would be a devaluation of the Bitcoin price denominated in dollars. In the second half of 2014, for example, there was a continuous increase in the USDI caused by the resumption of the U.S. economy and, at the same time, there was a significant drop in the Bitcoin price. Based on this behavior, Dyhrberg (2016) said that bitcoin could be used as a hedging product for the dollar exposure in the short term and as an additional instrument for market analysts to protect against specific risks. It should be noted that the dollar quotation against other currencies was negatively correlated with the Bitcoin price, not only in the short term but also in the long run, according to Van Wijk (2013) and Zhu et al. (2017). Zhu et al. (2017) also stated that changes in the federal funds rate (FFR), established by the Federal Reserve System, had a negative impact on the Bitcoin price in the short term. The study cited two main reasons for this conclusion: an increase in the dollar’s exchange rate on the foreign exchange market due to migration of financial capital to the U.S.; and a reduction in the attractiveness of speculative investments that entail high risk because of an increase in the U.S. fixed income market. The Dow Jones index, according to Van Wijk (2013), seemed to be positively correlated in the short and long term with the Bitcoin price. The study suggested an improvement in the performance of the U.S. economy could generate positive effects on Bitcoin pricing. Bouoiyour and Selmi (2015) saw the Shanghai index as a positive and short-term influence because of their perception that the Shanghai market was one of the big players in transactions with the virtual currency. Kristoufek (2015) also highlighted the impact of the Chinese economy on the Bitcoin price. In contrast, Dyhrberg (2016) said Bitcoin might be a possible hedging instrument against FTSE index variations, having no correlation with the 100 largest listed companies on the London Stock Exchange. There are authors who report that they find no consistent evidence regarding the causal relationship between macroeconomic variables and the Bitcoin price. When including demand and attractiveness variables in their model, Ciaian et al. (2016b) concluded that there was no significant statistical relevance of macroeconomic factors such as the Dow Jones index and oil prices and suggested speculation was the primary driver of price. Polasik et al. (2015) concluded that the correlation between Bitcoin returns and the fluctuations of sovereign currencies was weak and statistically insignificant. Al-Khazali et al. (2018) argued via a GARCH model that Bitcoin is weakly related to macro-developments due to low predictability for Bitcoin return and volatility after macroeconomic news surprises. According to Al-Khazali et al., the cryptocurrency acts more like a risky asset than a safe haven instrument. Bitcoin emerged at a time of massive expansion of the Internet, search engines, and social networks. Because it is a virtually mined coin and with peculiar characteristics, there is a certain unfamiliarity with its modus operandi, even to those who use in their day-to-day interactions with the Internet. Bitcoin it is not simple to understand since this is a new technology based on encryption and codifications that are more technically familiar to information technology professionals. Searches on electronic media for information about what Bitcoin is and how it works may be a variable that explains demand increases for the coin and, consequently, its price. Some authors sought to estimate a relationship between the search history of the term Bitcoin on platforms such as Google (Kristoufek 2013; Buchholz et al. 2012; Bouoiyour and Selmi et al. 2015; Polasik et al. 2015; Nasir et al. 2019), Wikipedia (Kristoufek 2013), Twitter (Davies 2014) and online forums (Kim et al. 2017). Polasik et al. (2015) described popularity as a strong factor for Bitcoin price returns. The authors further stated that a 1 % increase in the number of articles mentioning the term bitcoin generated an approximate return of 31 to 36 basis points in its price. This percentage is even higher when an analysis is based on Google’s database, where the return can be from 53 to 62 basis points. Buchholz et al. (2012) concluded that Google searches had a causal effect on Bitcoin transactions; however, the opposite did not seem to be applicable. Nasir et al. (2019), by using copulas and a nonparametric approach, confirmed that Google searches have a direct relationship with Bitcoin performance, particularly in the short run: the more often the investors look for information about the cryptocurrency, the higher the returns and trading volume that follow. Although the attractiveness variable, represented by quantification of searches and use of the term bitcoin in certain relevant sites, was of great value for predicting the price of the currency for some authors, it is limited by the horizon of long-term analysis. Ciaian et al. (2016b), when analyzing a database with a higher data history between 2009 and 2015, indicated that online searches were better predictors of punctual returns in the early years of bitcoin. With the consolidation of the currency, we can see a reduction in the relevance of this prediction. Hayes (2017) believed that searches for the term bitcoin would lessen with the spread of knowledge about the currency and make the variable unsatisfactory for inclusion in predictive models. Bouoiyour and Selmi’s analysis also did not find evidence of the impact of Google searches on price in the long run. Ciaian (2016a) demonstrated that the increase in the number of available bitcoins (inventory) was related to a decrease in its price, while the increase in the number of addresses (virtual portfolios) accompanied an increase in price. Civitarese (2018) analyzed the value of Bitcoin based on the growth of network users using the Metcalfe law, and verified the existence of a consistent relationship between the number of portfolios and the short-term Bitcoin price, although the study rejected the hypothesis of cointegration between the real price and prices calculated by law. Considering that the amount of currency offered by the Bitcoin platform is finite and known, Buchholz et al. (2012) stated that fluctuations in the Bitcoin price occurred mostly because of shocks in the demand curve. In addition to the factors highlighted above, there are others that measure the size of the Bitcoin market and cause a direct shock to the curve. Such examples include the volume variables of daily transactions and transfers by network users. The volume variable, according to Bouoiyour and Selmi (2015), impacts Bitcoin pricing in the short term. Balcilar et al. (2017) emphasized that the variable can predict returns, except in up- or down-market periods. Therefore, under normal market conditions, investors have transacted volume as a prediction tool; in contrast, during stress scenarios, an association between the variable and price returns is not identified. The increasing realization of Bitcoin transactions tends to stimulate its adoption by other economic agents, boosting the demand for bitcoins. Ciaian et al. (2016b) noted that the size of the bitcoin economy’s impact on demand tends to grow over time. The expectation is that the more frequent the use of money, the greater the demand and, consequently, the higher the price for bitcoins (Kristoufek 2015). Polasik et al. (2015) cited e-commerce as a major driver of payment systems that do not involve banking institutions and, in this sense, payment service providers aid in the development and adoption of virtual currencies.",17

6.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,20 February 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-020-00180-7,Impact of petroleum and non-petroleum indices on financial development in Oman,December 2020,Faris Nasif Alshubiri,Omar Ikbal Tawfik,Syed Ahsan Jamil,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Natural resources, specifically crude petroleum, play a vital role in the economic development and sustainable growth of countries. Petroleum and non-petroleum wealth are major sources of government revenue for many economies worldwide (Basnet and Upadhyaya 2015), as they have a pivotal role in shaping a country’s internal policy through economic programs that are compatible with its economic and oil price policies (Lardic and Mignon 2008). Among natural resources, petroleum and non-petroleum wealth determine a country’s economic policy and trade relations with other countries, especially imports and exports and the balance of payments position (Nkomo 2006). Therefore, many oil-dependent countries, including Oman, rely heavily on oil sector revenue to finance infrastructure projects and achieve sustainable development. However, there are concerns regarding the sustainability oil wealth, resulting from the decline in revenue during the recent global financial crisis, which has led to all Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries focusing on the development of non-oil activities. The global financial crisis of 2007made many oil-reliant countries realize the perils of a global economic slowdown and its negative impact on their own economic growth, which could potentially lead to social unrest and upheaval (Ajmi et al. 2015). Therefore, these countries have realized the urgent need to diversify their revenue sources and reduce their dependence on the petroleum sector (Oladosu 2009). Petroleum-related activities, especially for oil-producing and oil-exporting countries, are important in shaping the main source of income for these countries. However, the recent global financial crisis led these countries, including Oman, to consider how to distribute income from these sources to non-oil activities to overcome the fall in their income because of the drop in oil prices in recent years, which led to a decrease in the total income of these countries. Consequently, this income decline has led to the collapse of these countries’ infrastructure plans, delaying the improvement of the economic and competitiveness indices of such countries and hindering the process of their sustainable development. The success of a country is measured by how it can overcome financial and economic crises that increase the risks related to its environmental resources. Oman’s growth and welfare are also heavily dependent on oil wealth. The risks surrounding oil price fluctuations have cautioned the government to consider actively promoting non-oil environmental resources through industrial diversification and service and financial infrastructure development (Iwayemi and Fowowe 2011). Presently, given the low petroleum prices, revenue has been severely affected, which has led to a large budget deficit even in 2018. The promotion of petroleum and non-petroleum activities contributes directly as well as indirectly to the sustainable development of domestic credit (Ibrahim et al. 2014) Therefore; the banking sector plays a crucial role in the country’s financial and economic development. Oman is still committed to an economic diversification plan and to reducing its reliance on the oil sector, but oil prices have begun to affect its efforts toward the development of the non-oil sector. That is, government and private spending declined in 2016, while the value of approved projects reduced by USD 7 billion in 2016 (Central Bank of Oman 2017). If the expected oil prices remain below the parity price, there will be greater pressure on Oman’s reserves. The fiscal burden from 2016, 2017, and 2018 are greatly affecting the economic growth of the country. To continue to finance the deficit, the government has resorted to foreign loans. As such, Oman, represented by its Central Bank, has to find solutions to the budget deficit caused by the decline in oil prices, which has reduced the main source of revenue for the country. The Central Bank of Oman (2017) has taken the following steps. First, Oman has managed to borrow OMR 5.5 billion internationally to finance the fiscal deficit of 2016 through international bonds and syndicated loans, which were supported by its credit rating. Although the level of government debt is still relatively low compared to that of neighboring countries, it is expected to increase in the future. Second, in light of the decline in oil prices, the government reduced current and investment expenditures, supported by the revenue, which aided the financial situation in 2018 (e.g., increased gasoline prices, government fees, and corporate taxes, and reduced spending in government institutions). Third, small- and medium-sized enterprises also play a prominent role in the growth of the economy, and prudent credit regulation could leave the industry in good health. Fourth, a flexible liquidity policy puts risks at equilibrium to determine the direction of oil prices over the medium term, which governs the performance of the banking sector. Finally, several infrastructure projects began in 2018 and the government once again aimed to achieve a 3% growth by the end of fiscal year 2018. Finance and banking are considered important for developing other sectors. However, the development of bank credit is not sufficient to classify a country as advanced; rather, it is a reflection on long-term survival through the provision of competitive services to customers. A long-term view explains the concern of Oman regarding sustainable development. Recently, all GCC countries have starting working towards achieving sustainable development goals. To date, no study has investigated both the petroleum and non-petroleum activities in GCC countries and their impact on financial development, as proxied by bank credit. This study aims to address this literature gap by focusing on Oman over the period 1978 to 2017.Its importance lies in its aim to analyze the activities of the oil and non-oil sectors in an attempt to highlight which activities have a positive and significant impact on the financial development of Oman as well as the reasons behind the diversification of its industrial sectors. This remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The subsequent two sections review the related literature and present the background of the topic. The fourth section presents the research methodology and the proposed models, and the fifth section the empirical results and their interpretation. Finally, the last section draws the conclusions and presents policy implications.",9

6.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,10 February 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-020-0174-9,Predicting changes in Bitcoin price using grey system theory,December 2020,Mahboubeh Faghih Mohammadi Jalali,Hanif Heidari,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Cryptographic currencies represent a growing asset class that has attracted much attention from financial communities. Cryptocurrencies are digital cash and payment systems that are encrypted in a blockchain system (Hayes 2016). The four main cryptocurrencies currently on the market are Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, and Litecoin. The list is constantly changing as investors grow. Bitcoin, Etherum, and Litecoin use the same network of computers to store the same copies of all transactions. Therefore, the possibility of any anomalies is highly unlikely and the network is completely safe (Iwamura et al., 2019). Bitcoin is currently trading at the top of the cryptocurrencies list. Moreover, Bitcoin’s algorithm is used in most cryptocurrencies (Gandal & Halaburda, 2016). Each cryptocurrency has its own rules concerning the maximum amount of money, currency production, privacy, transaction rates added to the blockchain, and the various mechanisms used by miners to compete among each other and earn rewards (Indera et al. 2017). Bitcoin is a decentralized electronic exchange system and represents a major change in the global financial system. Its system is based on peer-to-peer and cryptographic protocols and is not managed by any government or bank (Vidal 2014). It operates on the basis of a collusive and uncertain system in which all transactions are placed in an open ledger called blockchain (Guo and Liang 2016). Due to limited resources, low transaction costs, and ease of transferring, Bitcoin has gained popularity rapidly in recent years across the globe. It has led to cryptocurrencies being recognized as an asset to the economy, and its reach extends to markets around the world (Hayes 2016). Stock market prediction is difficult due to its volatile and changeable nature (Kou et al. 2014; Kou et al. 2019); however, it has been extensively investigated by researchers. For example, Adebiyi et al. (2012) used a neural network to predict stock prices. It presents a hybridized approach which combines the use of the variables of technical and fundamental analysis of stock market indicators for prediction of future price of stock in order to improve on the existing approaches. Alrasheedi and Alghamdi (2012) used a linear discriminant and logit model to predict the SABIC (Saudi Basic Industries Corporation) price index, and Sathe et al. (2016) investigated share market prediction. More details can be found in other works, such as Cocianu and Grigoryan (2015) and Ma et al. (2010). Bitcoin is a fresh market that is still in its transition phase; therefore, a lot of fluctuations can still be observed (Briere et al. 2013). Due to its unstable nature, cryptocurrency prediction is not an easy task. Interestingly, based on the information provided from the website www.coindesk.com, Bitcoin has more than 50% of the market share in the cryptocurrency market at the time of this study. Therefore, studying its prediction is of great importance and researchers are becoming focused on it. This study aims to investigate Bitcoin price and its fluctuation using grey system theory. The rest of this study is structured as follows: in Section 2, the history of Bitcoin and previous works are discussed, while Section 3 provides an introduction to the grey system theory. The model GM (1,1) is applied for predicting Bitcoin prices in Section 4 and examples and numerical results are also provided in this section. Lastly, the conclusion to our study is provided in Section 5. Satoshi Nakamoto is the creator of Bitcoin (Nakamoto 2008). This name was used for the first time in 2008 and it is still unclear if this is a real name or nickname. In 2008, he published an article about cryptography on a mailing list of the website “www.metzdowd.com”. The article introduced a kind of digital currency that later became Bitcoin. In early 2009, he released Bitcoin’s source code, along with binary code compiled on “www.sourceforge.net”. In June 2009, Nakamoto launched the peer to peer Bitcoin network (Kaushal 2016) that allows individual members of the network to track all transactions, and started to mine Bitcoin. During the early days of crypto mining, there were few miners in the network. Therefore, the mining difficulty was low (Franco, 2014). These few miners were able to extract huge amounts of Bitcoin. Franco’s (2014) study used a Bitcoin data analysis and discovered that Nakamoto extracted nearly 1,000,000 Bitcoins. Interestingly, none of these Bitcoins had ever been spent, but the reason behind it is unknown. However, it is obvious that as soon as these Bitcoins are spent by Nakamoto, his identity will be known, as blockchain transactions are trackable by everyone in the network and the transfer of these Bitcoins to a person can be tracked in the real world (Franco, 2014). Nakamoto deliberately created a decentralized network and stated that after the bitter experiences of the nineties and more than a decade of public trust in third parties and their systems, many people use a decentralized network (Nakamoto 2008). The creator of Bitcoin believes that within the next 10 years, digital currency will replace conventional currencies. Bitcoin is a digital currency that uses protocols and cryptographic algorithms to determine the security of transactions and to create new ones (Renato and Dos 2017). Bitcoin is the first transfer and transaction system that uses nodes and that does not use third party processing and confirmation of transactions. Bitcoin allows direct transactions between individuals, which is the main feature that distinguishes it from traditional currencies. The fact that Bitcoin does not need third-party agencies is one of the reasons for its popularity. This unique characteristic means that the entire system is decentralized (Brito and Castilllo 2013). The network assumes that most nodes—which are, in fact, individuals—are honest and intercepts all transactions. The Bitcoin system does not have a mediating entity and no third party for managing transactions; therefore, several existing nodes process each transaction. These nodes are responsible for registering each transaction in a public ledger called a blockchain. The nodes that process transactions are called “miners” and the process “mining.” As compensation for the registration of each transaction in the blockchain, a reward is given to the miner. Miners perform the calculation needed to record the data and a completed and verified process chooses a miner as the winner to update the blockchain. Each participant has a revised version of the audit, and therefore, the entire system is decentralized (Elwell et al, 2014). Recently, Shi (2016) proposed a new proof-of-work mechanism that improves decentralization and reduces the risk of attacks by 51% without increasing the risk of Sybil attacks (a cyber security attack wherein a reputation system is subverted by forging identities). Renato and Dos (2017) examined the system type of Bitcoin and concluded that the Bitcoin network is not a complex system with only algorithmic complexity, and that it will probably not enter a chaotic phase. The advantages of using a blockchain network are: transparency of information, no need for third parties, the possibility of international payments, anonymity of users, irreversible payments, no transaction tax, low transaction costs, and a low risk of theft. Bitcoin is traded in more than 40 exchanges around the world, and currently has a market worth of US$ 16 billion. As Bitcoin is used by ordinary people and because of its lack of relevance to other assets, Bitcoin has become an attractive option for investors. Therefore, the ability to predict prices would be a great help for investors. Considering the importance of the topic, many researchers have recently studied Bitcoin price prediction. Almeida et al. (2015) reviewed an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the Bitcoin price using the last day price and turnover volumes. The main problem with their method is the requirement of a large amount data for the prediction. McNally’s (2016) research concerns predicting Bitcoin prices using machine learning. This was achieved by using several RNN, ARIMA, and LSTM patterns. The error percentages of the RNN, ARIMA, and LSTM models were 5.45%, 53.47%, and 6.87% respectively (James et al. 2013; McNally 2016). Greaves and Au (2015) investigated the characteristics of the blockchain network based on Bitcoin’s future price using an ANN. The results showed that the average accuracy is approximately 55%. Shah and Zhang (2014) used the nonparametric classification technique developed by Chen et al. (2013) to predict price trends, claiming that a successful Bitcoin strategy would be based on Bayesian regression if its accuracy is 89%. Madan et al. (2015) used Bitcoin blockchain network properties to predict Bitcoin prices. Using SVM algorithms, binomial logistic regression classifiers, and random forests, they predicted the Bitcoin price with an accuracy of 55%. Georgoula et al. (2015) investigated the determinants of the Bitcoin rate along with an emotional analysis using SVM. The result showed that the amount of Wikipedia hits and hash rates in the network had a positive relationship with the Bitcoin price. In another study, Matta et al. (2015a) aimed to predict Bitcoin trading volumes. They examined whether the general feeling that aggregates in a set of Twitter posts could be used to predict changes in the Bitcoin market. The results showed that there was a significant association between Bitcoin’s upcoming price and the volume of tweets during a day. Similarly, the volume of Google searches for the term “bitcoin” affect the Bitcoin price (Matta et al. 2015b). Some studies obtained similar results using wavelets (Kristoufek 2015; Vidal 2014). For example, Kristoufek found a direct connection between search engine views, hash rates, and bitcoin mining complexity in the long term by analyzing the dependency of the microwaves on the Bitcoin price. Ciaian et al. (2016) studied the price formation of Bitcoin using both traditional and digital specific factors affecting currencies. They found that market forces and Bitcoin attractiveness are two major factors in determining the Bitcoin price. Bouri et al. (2017) studied the relationship between Bitcoin and commodities, focusing on the energy market. Their results showed that Bitcoin could work as a diversifier in this market. Based on these previous studies, it is clear that the Bitcoin price is dependent on many nondeterministic factors, and that predicting the price is not an easy task. This study proposes grey system theory for predicting the Bitcoin price. The next section introduces a grey model for predicting the Bitcoin price and shows that this method is more suitable and more accurate than existing models. The grey system theory is a non-statistical method of forecasting non-linear time series (Cen et al. 2006). The grey system theory was introduced by Deng in early 1982 and it quickly developed in the field of forecasting concerning—among others—economics, industry, and natural phenomena (Deng 1982). The grey system theory is concerned about small samples and poor information and is classified according to the “colors” of systems. Black represents unknown information and white represents known information, while grey signifies information that are partially known (Deng 1989; Liu et al. 2012). The GM (n, m) model is a grey prediction model in which n denotes the degree of differential equation used in the model and m denotes the number of variables. The GM (1,1) model is a classic grey prediction model. The key reasons for researchers using the GM (1,1) model is the simplicity of its modeling, the implementation of the model, and the low need for time data. In this system, four observation points are needed to check for uncertain data and to reduce the error rate (Liu and Lin 2006). The GM (1,1) model is a first-order grey pattern used to predict a time series. In this model, a system is easily described by a first-order differential equation and the template is updated whenever new data becomes available. To coincide the randomness of the data, an accumulative generation operator (AGO) is used. The differential equation GM (1,1) calculates the values associated with n steps ahead of the prediction system. The end goal of using this predicted value and the inverse accumulative generation operator (I-AGO) is to obtain the main value of the predicted data (Liu and Lin 2010). The GM (1,1) algorithm is as follows:
 Assume that X0 = {x0(k)}, {k : 1, 2, …, n : n ≥ 4} is a non-negative sequence of raw data and that n is the size of the sample data, with the first order sequence of its accumulative generation operator equal to X1 = {x1(k), k = 1, 2, 3, …, n} where The average generated value of successive neighbors is obtained by the following formula where
 The whitened equation of the GM (1,1) pattern will be as follows By the discretization of eq. (4), the differential equation is grey, as follows: Next, we calculate the values of a and b using an ordinary least squares estimation We then calculate the time response of the GM (1,1) equation based on the values of a and b The reconstructed values of raw data are obtained using the following equation In our model, the parameter a is the development index and b is the grey trigger value. The accuracy of the GM (1,1) model depends on the values of a and b as well as the selection of the initial conditions during the modeling process. Thus, selecting the initial values of the parameter is imperative to improve the accuracy of this method (Liu et al. 2017). A time window analysis is therefore used to achieve a more accurate prediction (Li et al. 2016; Liu et al. 2017). For this study, the data concerning the Bitcoin price are obtained from the website www.coindesk.com. The final Bitcoin price in a day is considered as its closing price. This means that the Bitcoin price at 23:59 PM is considered as its value for that day (Garcia and Schweitzer 2015). To predict the Bitcoin price using GM (1,1), we used MATLAB version R2016b software. At first, four initial data points are considered and the fifth data is predicted. For example, as shown in Table 2, we assume that the Bitcoin price in the period May 23, 2018 to May 26, 2018 exists and the prediction is done based on these initial data. We call this procedure a five-days prediction, as the Bitcoin prices for all 5 days are approximated using this method. The mean average percentage error (MAPE) is used to compare the results and is calculated as follows:
 where N is number of data, yi is the i th data, and \( {\hat{y}}_i \) is its prediction. MAPE is the most widely used forecasting accuracy measurement, as it is a unit-free measurement and can be used for all the information concerning the error (Christodoulos et al. 2011; Ma and Liu 2017). Lewis (1982) introduced a scale to judge the accuracy of the model based on the MAPE measure, which is shown in Table 1.
 This study aimed to investigate the potential application of the grey system theory in Bitcoin price prediction. We consider a period of 5 days and another period of 6 months for the prediction. It is well known fact that the grey system theory prediction works better with small datasets, as the error of prediction will increase when the dataset is larger (Wu et al. 2013). Therefore, the average of the Bitcoin price is considered based on 6 months’ data. In other words, for a six-month dataset, the averages of Bitcoin prices are considered in five sequential months and the average of the Bitcoin price for the sixth month is predicted. Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 show the prediction of Bitcoin prices for 5 days and 6 months for different dates chosen randomly. Based on Tables 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, the 5 days and 6 months predictions show high accuracy and good accuracy, respectively.
 To illustrate the robustness of the proposed method, predictions are done in a five-day time window, from July 18, 2010 to May 27, 2018. The error of prediction is shown in Fig. 1. The average MAPE value is 1.14 for the last 2 months of the period. This shows that a single five-day time window is robust and accurate for predicting Bitcoin price.
 Error of Bitcoin price in the period 1 year To illustrate the validity of the method, a Lilliefors test is used to investigate the normality of error distribution (Abdi and Molin 2007). The Lilliefors test is an improvement of the Kolmogorov Smirnov test and is used when the expected value and its variance are unknown. The 5 days and 6 months data are considered where the end of each period is May 28, 2018. The results show that the histogram of errors is not normal for 6 months, but that it is normal for a five-day prediction period with the p-value at 0.2219. The histogram of errors for the five-day prediction period is shown in Fig. 2. The value of skewness for 5 days is - 0.4530. Therefore, the results show that the error of prediction has normal distribution and is unbiased in the five-day time window prediction.
 Histogram of prediction errors in 5-days time window Non-statistical methods are powerful tools for forecasting non-linear time series. ANN and grey system theory are both non-statistical methods that are widely used for forecasting non-linear time series (Cen et al. 2006). Bahrammirzaee (2010) showed that the ANN method outperforms traditional and statistical approaches in the financial prediction. A comparative study between a recurrent neural network (RNN) and a vector autoregression (VAR) was done by El-Abdelouarti Alouaret (2017) to predict the Bitcoin price. Their results show that RNN models have better performance than the VAR method. Recently, Jang and Lee (2018) compared the linear regression method (LRM), the support vector machine (SVM), and the Bayesian neural network (BNN) for predicting Bitcoin price. They used 16 and 26 input variables to predict Bitcoin price for the next day and concluded that BNN is more accurate than both LRM and SVM. Therefore, we compare the proposed method with RNN and BNN to show the accuracy and robustness of method proposed in this study. A comparison between the grey system theory and different neural network models is shown in Table 10. The comparison confirms that the grey system theory outperforms both RNN and BNN. Table 10 also shows that neural network models are sensitive to input variables. Previous works such as that of Chen et al. (2014), Georgoula et al. (2015), Kristoufek (2015), and Matta et al. (2015a, 2015b) emphasize that the Bitcoin price depends on different inputs with complex behaviors. Based on new technologies, economic policies, and cultural behaviors, these inputs may change. Therefore, neural network models are not suitable or stable enough for predicting the Bitcoin price. The main advantage of the grey system theory is that it works well with small samples and poor informations. Therefore, the grey system theory is highly recommended for predicting the Bitcoin price.

6.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,07 February 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-020-0171-z,Development of E-banking channels and market share in developing countries,December 2020,Ali Nazaritehrani,Behzad Mashali,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Today, due to the global competition among financial organizations, market share plays a vital role in banks’ success. Studies have recognized that a bank’s market share is a key element of a bank’s profitability, growth, and survival (Khan, Ahmad, & Chan, 2018). It is also considered as an indicator of a bank reputation (Dunbar 2000). According to Buzzell et al. (1975), possessing a large market share can result in creating economies of scale, market power, and management quality, which leads to a superb return on investment and a great profit. Therefore, striving to achieve a significant share of the whole market is of great importance for all banks and financial organizations wanting to grow and to survive in a competitive environment. Studies have asserted that some elements, such as customer satisfaction (Anderson et al. 1994; Rust and Zahorik 1993), brand extension (Smith and Park 1992), dynamic marketing methods (Davcik and Grigoriou 2016), customer retention (Rust and Zahorik 1993), and forming joint ventures (Shen and Cheung 2018), highly influence market share. In general, an organization can boost its market share by lowering its prices, and/or by improving its product and service quality (DeYoung and Nolle 1996). Financial organizations can take advantages of most innovative technologies for a variety of activities from financial regulation (Chao et al. 2019) to providing services (YuSheng and Ibrahim 2019; Laukkanen and Lauronen 2005). By the means of new technologies, to increase service quality, and consequently, increase market share, banks can present their services through innovative channels like electronic banking (hereafter e-banking) and its components (Bloemer et al. 1998). Although it is claimed that banks should improve their services (Bloemer et al. 1998) to increase market share, there is little research on the relationship between the different channels of presenting innovative banking services and a bank’s market share. The current literature on bank marketing considers innovative banking services agents of bank growth, but it neglects the effect of developing various channels of innovative services on a bank’s market share. In addition, most of the studies of innovative banking services were performed in developed countries. Chen and Puttitanun (2005) asserted, however, that developing countries may radically differ from developed countries when exerting and exploiting innovation. It is useful to study the relationship between the development of e-banking channels and bank market share in developing countries like Iran. Based on the above discussion, we theorized that the development of e-banking channels, including Automated Teller Machines (hereafter ATM), Point-of-Sales (hereafter POS), internet banking, telephone banking (TB), and mobile banking (Abor 2005; Agwu 2018; Felix 2018; Kashmari et al. 2016), positively influences banks’ market share. In this study, we outlined how the development of e-banking platforms may affect increasing banks’ market share, and addressed this issue by analyzing data collected from 154 experts at branches of Shahr bank in Tehran, Iran. The units of analysis in this study were the Shahr Bank branches. Based on rankings published by the Central Bank of the Islamic Republic of Iran,Footnote 1 Shahr bank is the most innovation-driven bank in the Iranian banking industry, and therefore it was the best environment for performing this research. This article contributes to the theory and practice within the domains of bank marketing. This research contributes to bank marketing literature and practice in two ways. First, this research helps develop a better understanding of whether innovative banking services can influence marketing concepts like market share by combining Agwu (2018), Felix (2018), Abor (2005), and Kashmari et al.’s (2016) e-banking channels. Second, by revealing the direct impact of each e-banking platform on market share, this article will enable bank managers and authorities to make their market grow by means of improving their innovative service channels. Organizations always pursue success and growth. One of the fundamental factors of an organization’s success, survival, and growth in a competitive market is market share. According to the resource-based theory of competitive advantage, firms apply their resources to boost their position against their competitors to gain competitive advantages and a greater share of the market (Grant 1991). In studies, market share has been mentioned as an important agent of company performance. Studies have confirmed that there is a positive relationship between market share and economic profit (Dunbar 2000). The market share of corporations has, also, a vital role in setting the equilibrium price. That is, the more corporations in the market with less market share, the better the market movement towards a competitive market (Tash et al. 2014); it should be noted that the banking industry is not an exception (Bahrami et al. 2014). In general, absolute market share and relative market share are two different types of market share. Absolute market share is defined as the number of customers (or the cash value achieved from those customers) compared to the total number of customers (or the cash value of the total sales in the market) (Kaplan and Norton 1996). Relative market share measures the organization’s sales or cash value compared to the organization that has the largest market share in the same market, or to the market share of three large rivals (Rawash 2012). Overall, a large market share is the consequence of the prosperous accomplishment of a competitive strategy and the corollary of a company’s market growth (Ghemawat 2002). Bahrami et al. (2014) believed that some factors, including human factors, bank facilities, technology, bank services, bank accessibility, and physical factors, can affect the bank market share. As mentioned earlier, some key elements, such as customer satisfaction (Anderson et al. 1994; Rust and Zahorik 1993), brand extension (Smith and Park 1992), dynamic marketing methods (Davcik and Grigoriou 2016), customer retention (Rust and Zahorik 1993), forming joint ventures (Shen and Cheung 2018), low prices, and a high quality of products and services (DeYoung and Nolle 1996), can significantly influence the growth of a bank’s market share. Moreover, obtaining market share is not simple for firms or for their competitors (Maymand and Fard 2015). Banks are prone to technological obsolescence, and market share is a backward-looking metric (Maymand and Fard 2015). As a result, banks should respond to economic and technological changes rapidly to maintain and improve their market share in the future (Kajuju 2016). Information Technology (IT) is the most important cause of changes in the worldwide banking system (Argamo 2015). In this situation, if banks take advantage of the benefits of various service channels and a combination of innovative IT-based solutions as their main strategy, they will obtain a greater share of the market (Gupta 2013). Therefore, banks should present new banking services through innovative channels to remain competitive, create excess added value (Laukkanen and Lauronen 2005), and achieve a greater share from the market (Cetina and Mihail 2007). In the literature, new banking services are referred to in various terms, such as novel banking services (von Hippel and Riggs 1996), innovative banking services (Kashmari et al. 2016), new banking services (Prugsaapron 2015), and modern banking services (Miranda-Petronella 2009). New banking services are defined as services that utilize modern instruments, platforms, and channels to present banking services to customers (Tash et al. 2014). New banking services are not supposed to be substitutions for traditional types of banking transactions. However, there are many advantages to IT-based services, since they can enhance the quality of services and decrease delivery costs (González et al. 2008). The main benefit of applying information technology and innovative solutions in the banking sector is the improvement of the efficiency and effectiveness of services (Mahmoodi and Naderi 2016) because traditional banking activities are all accomplished manually, and factors related to human mistakes can have a negative effect on banking transactions. Some of the benefits of new banking services include the reduction of the customer wait times at physical branches, a decrease of banks’ physical extensions need, a reduction in the delivery service time, progress in banking transactions and customer tranquility, and a decrease of human-generated mistakes (Hosseini and Mohammadi 2012). Moreover, due to all of these advantages, and despite the trust issues in applying innovative electronic channels, there has been growth in the number of e-banking users (Laukkanen and Lauronen 2005). Several studies have discussed electronic banking and its innovative channels. Hanafizadeh and Zare Ravasan (2018) worked on e-banking outsourcing and found that there are several factors affecting e-banking services outsourcing. They identified 23 key factors affecting e-banking outsourcing decisions and they categorized those into three clusters: technological attributes, organizational attributes, and environmental attributes. Hoehle et al. (2012) reviewed 247 articles about electronic banking that had been published in the most credible journals in the last three decades. They assessed various theoretical grounds and methods used in those articles for researching e-banking adoption. They suggested that, in order to improve electronic banking research, future studies should try to apply different theoretical approaches rather than the extant theories that they already covered. They considered ATMs, telephone banking, internet banking, and mobile banking as key channels of electronic banking. Recently, Li et al. (2017) performed research on the effect of digital banking start-ups on the efficiency of the retail banking system in the United States. They discovered that funding digital banking start-ups (FinTech) has a positive effect on a bank’s stock returns. They asserted that instead of substitution, FinTech can be complementary to traditional banking. Sathye (1999) investigated the factors affecting internet banking adoption in Australia. He discovered that the most important barriers to more use of internet banking in Australia are security doubts and ignorance about internet banking and its profits. Furthermore, Nui Polatoglu and Ekin (2001) studied the conditions of internet banking and its acceptance in Turkey in terms of consumer-related factors and organizational factors. They found that internet banking significantly reduces banks’ operational costs and increases customer satisfaction and customer retention. Their results also showed that internet banking plays a strategic role in the banking sector in emerging economies. In addition, Tiwari et al. (2007) studied the effect of innovative business approaches to banking services on the attainment of a competitive advantage. They delineated the important role of innovative solutions (especially mobile banking) in boosting the position of financial organizations in the market. In Table 1, a brief summary of previous studies in the field of e-banking is shown.
 Innovative channels of delivering e-banking services include POS, ATMs (or out of branch services generally), mobile banking, telephone banking, and internet banking (Abor 2005; Agwu 2018; Felix 2018; Kashmari et al. 2016). Thus, we hypothesized how the development of these innovative channels of e-banking services can affect a bank’s market share. The theoretical model is shown in Fig. 1.
 Research Conceptual Model. we conceptualize the relationship between e-banking channels and bank market share One of the most prevalent channels of providing new banking services is the POS terminal, which is an electronic device used for credit and/or debit cards transactions at retail locations, such as shops, restaurants, and hotels. It enables customers to perform banking transactions using their credit or debit cards, 24 h a day (Kajuju 2016). A POS terminal generally connects to the bank’s main server through a telephone line or other types of communication, like wireless connections, and transfers money from a buyer’s account to the merchant’s account (Hosseini and Mohammadi 2012). POS terminals are accessible, and they significantly facilitate banking transactions; thus, they can lead to improvement of the bank’s market share (Bahrami et al. 2014). We therefore derived the following hypothesis:
 H1: The development of POS terminals has a positive effect on increasing a bank’s market share. The other channel of e-banking is the ATM. An ATM is defined as an automated telecommunication device that enables consumers to access banking services without any need for a bank operator (Sarlak 2010). Sasidharan and Mathews (2008) discussed the advantages of ATMs, such as access to various banking operations, fund withdrawals, bill payments, fund deposits, access to statements, and 24–7 banking services. ATMs are also convenient, innovative, safe, and play a role as a value-added service to attract many new clients. Therefore, according to González et al. (2008), because there is no need for a bank operator, ATMs decrease service costs. Consequently, based on DeYoung and Nolle (1996), ATMs can increase the bank market share. As Bahrami et al. (2014) discussed, out-of-branch service accessibility and other physical factors of banking services can lead to an increase in the bank’s market share. Moreover, ATM services can be found in every location (Sharma, Sharma & Khan, 2019; Singanamalla et al., 2019); thus, developing ATMs can strengthen service accessibility. We derived the second hypothesis:
 H2: The development of ATMs has a positive effect on increasing a bank’s market share. Mobile banking is a service provided by financial companies, and it allows customers to benefit by using their mobile phone devices to perform banking transactions such as transferring funds, saving money, and paying bills. Pousttchi and Schurig (2004) defined mobile banking as a way of administering financial services via mobile technology. Mobile banking is accessible through short message service (SMS) technology, wireless application protocol (WAP), and mobile applications (Scornavacca Jr and Barnes 2004). In its initial form, it let customers obtain information about their accounts and transactions via SMS. Thereafter, financial institutions provided a wider diversity of financial services through WAP- and Java-enabled mobile phones (Mallat et al. 2004). Mobile banking has many benefits. As a case in point, the problem of inaccessibility to physical branches has vanished because of these kinds of practical and frugal services. Consequently, financial services are available to the majority of people (Morawczynski and Pickens 2009). Furthermore, mobile phones have improved service quality, since customers can accomplish transactions whenever they want (Schierholz and Laukkanen 2007). Moreover, mobile banking has a high potential for providing additional banking services and should be further developed by banks (Brown et al. 2003). Therefore, based on DeYoung and Nolle (1996) and Bahrami et al. (2014), mobile banking can significantly contribute to a bank’s market share. As a result, we developed the following hypothesis:
 H3: The development of mobile banking has a positive effect on increasing a bank’s market share. Internet banking is defined as the acquisition of banking services via the internet. It provides a vast range of potential advantages because of the attainable and user-friendly application of technology (Yiu et al. 2007). It handles banking transactions on the internet via websites (Sarlak 2010). Clients have direct access to the bank’s information system from anywhere they have access to the internet. Internet banking provides various online services, such as balance enquiries, ordering checks, instructions for various services (such as balance transfer, opening accounts, perusing account balances), making payments (Argamo 2015), paying bills, transferring cash, saving and investing money (Kajuju 2016), printing statements (Martins et al. 2014), and other information related to accounts (Miranda-Petronella 2009). Internet banking has numerous benefits, such as faster marketing because of the easier access to customers, simpler launching of new services, a wider propagation of information (Gomez 2011), competitive advantages, attracting and retaining clients, higher revenues, fewer costs (Simpson 2002), a higher potential to economize time (Miranda-Petronella 2009), a high capacity of innovation, improved communications, and higher customer satisfaction and loyalty (Thulani et al. 2008). This channel enables consumers to have most of their banking needs met with a minimum of human intermediation (Tan and Teo 2000). In general, internet banking enables banks to form and maintain an effective relationship with their clients and to lessen operating costs and fixed costs (Mols 1999). Therefore, according to Anderson et al. (1994), Rust and Zahorik (1993), and DeYoung and Nolle (1996), all the above-mentioned benefits of internet banking can help banks achieve a greater market share. We therefore developed the following hypothesis:
 H4: The development of internet banking has a positive effect on increasing a bank’s market share. The last channel studied in this research was telephone banking (hereafter TB). TB is a service that enables clients to accomplish some banking transactions like applying for account balance information or transferring money through the telephone (Hosseini and Mohammadi 2012). The origin of TB dates back to October 1989; in that year, Midland Bank Plc., which operated in the mature UK banking sector, made a drastic innovation and connected the first direct telephone banking subsidiary in Leeds (Doyle and Bridgewater 2012). For over 3 decades, telephone banking has played an important role as a useful banking feature, and almost all banks have endeavored to provide TB as one of their main services (Alikhani et al. 2013). TB has several positive characteristics. It can provide customers with access to data, personal information, personal accounts, and several banking services, like transferring money (Mahmood, 2019). TB services do not need physical places, and they are accessible all day and night (Rabiu et al., 2019). Bahrami et al. (2014) said that proper banking facilities, accessibility, and other physical factors can lead to an increase in market share; therefore, TB can positively influence a bank’s market share. This led us to derive the fifth hypothesis:
 H5: The development of telephone banking has a positive effect on increasing a bank’s market share.",28

This investment is crucial for the much-needed industrialization in a country (Mujeri and Chowdhury 2013). In the absence of adequate local investment, FDI has been attracted from industrially advanced countries to accelerate the path of industrialization, to foster and maintain sustained economic growth, and to reduce the level of unemployment (Hussain and Haque 2016). In addition, the effectiveness of FDI in the host countries depends on the efficiency of domestic investment (Razin and Sadka 2003). Gradually, countries are becoming more integrated to achieve faster economic growth and are opening up for free trade as a result of globalization (Middleton 2007). Economic and technological factors drive the growth of international production, which is facilitated by the liberalization of trade policies and increased FDI flows. In this context, globalization provides an unparalleled opportunity for developing countries to foster and achieve economic growth through trade and investment (Arndt 1999). Hence, many countries—especially the least developed countries—are implementing liberal economic policies to encourage more capital inflows from developed countries (Bengoa and Sanchez-Robles 2003). Today, the importance of FDI has increased in the form of technology transfer and market networks that can result in efficient production and sales globally (Lipsey and Sjöholm 2010; Urata 1998). Over the past few decades, FDI inflows also have increased remarkably in developing countries. Foreign investors benefit by utilizing their assets and resources efficiently through FDI, while the recipients are expected to benefit by securing technologies and becoming involved in international trade networks (Louzi and Abadi 2011). The question, therefore, naturally arises as to whether these FDI inflows have any impact on local development, and vice versa. This issue, therefore, demands an empirical inquiry (Figlio and Blonigen 2000). Because gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the measures of the level of development, this study aims to explore the relationship between FDI and GDP in Bangladesh. FDI often is considered to be an important vehicle for economic growth (Vu Le and Suruga 2005a, b). A vast majority of empirical studies have focused on the effect that FDI may exert on economic growth along with the causal link from FDI to growth. As noted by Chakraborty and Basu (2006), however, the causal link from economic growth to FDI and the feedback relationship deserve further attention. Therefore, the direction of this relationship between FDI and economic growth needs to be stressed because the FDI-related spillover effect of knowledge encourages economic growth, which, in turn, attracts more FDI (Chakraborty and Basu 2006). Empirical studies, such as Vu Le and Suruga (2005a, b), Durham (2004), Borensztein et al. (1998), and Balasubramanyam et al. (1996), have investigated the FDI-growth nexus. They have stressed that the possibility of a positive impact of FDI on economic growth depends on such mechanisms as the technology-upgrading progress, human capital investment, absorptive capacity, and trade policy adopted by the host country (Gönel and Aksoy 2016; Katircioglu 2009; Silajdzic and Mehic 2016). These studies generally considered a panel of countries, suggesting that FDI can have a positive but indirect effect on economic growth. In contrast, in the case of India, Vu Le and Suruga (2005a, b) suggested that FDI, public capital, and private investment all played important roles in promoting economic growth. They also advocated against uncontrolled spending in public capital expenditure, which can impede the positive effects of FDI in a country. The mobility of capital and technology is the single most important reason for low-income countries to grow at a higher rate (Li and Chen 2010). The stability of FDI inflows and required macroeconomic and financial adjustments have been identified as the contributing factors for economic growth in developing countries (Chao et al. 2019; Sridharan et al. 2009). The issue that FDI enhances and accelerates economic growth has not received common empirical support. The positive effect that FDI may exert on economic growth may start only if the financial market, an interdependent system with a broad and interconnected network (Kou et al. 2019), is developed more than at a threshold level (Azman-Saini et al. 2010). The positive impact of FDI and foreign trade on economic growth may be realized only by the FDI inflows in the economies that are expected to grow faster and follow open-trade policies (Adhikary 2010; Shimul et al. 2009). FDI has been channeled effectively by transferring technology and promoting economic growth in developing countries within the framework of the neoclassical models (Bitzer and Kerekes 2008; Solow 1956; Sridharan et al. 2009). Therefore, the host countries should facilitate a financial liberalization and stabilization policy before experiencing any increase in FDI (De Gregorio and Guidotti 1995). Bashir (1999) found that foreign firms tended to increase the level of human capital and accelerate the growth rate of an economy. It has been argued that although the effect varies across geographic regions and over time, FDI, for the most part, has led to economic growth. Feridun (2004) conducted a study on the causality between FDI and GDP per capita in Cyprus and found strong evidence of GDP being Granger caused by FDI, but not vice versa. Results further suggested that Cyprus’s capacity to achieve progress on economic development will depend on how much the country attracts foreign capital (Borensztein et al. 1998). Moreover, Wu (2000) emphasized the development of infrastructure, growth of the non-state sector, and economic reform for host economies to realize the positive effects of FDI. The internationalization theory implies that FDI takes place in countries as multinational corporations are replacing external markets with more efficient internal markets (Asghar et al. 2012; Dunning 1977; Rugman 1985, 1986). Empirically, a lot of disagreement has been observed in the relationship between FDI and economic growth as most of the studies either have provided mixed results or have failed to reach any definite conclusions (Borensztein et al. 1998; Carkovic and Levine 2002). Various empirical studies have focused on the significant role played by FDI inflows to foster economic growth of the developing countries through its contribution of human resources, capital formation, and enhanced organization and managerial skills, as well as the transfer of technologies because of their scarce capital (Aitken and Harrison 1999; Barro 1990; Blomstrom and Wolff 1989; Markusen and Venables 1999; Zhang 2001). To date, the existing empirical evidence on the relationship between FDI and economic growth nexus has not been conclusive. Therefore, this has become the basis for academics and policy makers to analyze this relationship further using recent developments in econometric modeling (Asghar et al. 2012). Figure 1 shows GDP and FDI inflows (in million US dollars and natural logarithm) in Bangladesh over the period from 1972 to 2017. The amount of FDI inflows was not significant until 1996. This may be partly due to the fact that the country was ruled by a long-held military regime, and that year, a democratic government was formed. The volume of FDI inflows increased gradually from 2002 onward with little fluctuation. In recent years, the growth rate of FDI inflows in Bangladesh has declined, although it is considered to be a potent vehicle for economic development. The Seventh Five-Year Plan (2016–2020), however, set a target of FDI increase of $5.87 billion by 2018. Figure 1 exhibits the increasing trend in both variables, which confirms that GDP increases gradually over the considered time period. The growth rate of GDP increased slightly after 2004 and continued to increase up to recent periods, with an average growth rate of 6.0% or more (Bangladesh Bank 2017).
 GDP and FDI inflows in Bangladesh from 1972 to 2017 The previous literature on FDI and economic growth nexus in Bangladesh, for example, Shimul et al. (2009), using a smaller dataset (1973–2007), utilized the ARDL technique, and found no causal relationship between FDI and economic growth. Conversely, Tabassum and Ahmed (2014), using data for the period 1972–2011 and applying a multiple regression model, found FDI to be insignificant in influencing economic growth. Therefore, the literature is limited on the selected topic in the case of Bangladesh. In addition, the FDI and economic growth relationship is one of the debatable issues in the literature, which needs further investigation. This study, however, used a longer dataset (1972–2017) than previous studies. It revealed the causal nexus between FDI and economic growth in Bangladesh by applying appropriate time-series econometric tools and robustness check techniques. Therefore, this study filled in the gap in the literature using relatively upgraded time-series econometric techniques and a newer and larger dataset. The remainder of this study is organized as follows: Section 2 provides a brief overview of data and the methodology used to analyze the results. In section 3, empirical results based on the time-series econometric methodology are presented and discussed in detail. Section 4 gives the conclusion and recommendations of this study.",26
6.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,05 February 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-019-0167-8,Does the EVA valuation model explain the market value of equity better under changing required return than constant required return?,December 2020,Sujata Behera,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"Valuation is an important topic in finance, as it is needed for companies to get their equity capital valued for purposes such as borrowing, merging, acquiring, and making public offerings. The importance of valuation in attracting foreign investments has grown in emerging economies such as that of India. Even so, the rising globalization, market liberalization, and drastic competition have made it difficult for academics, practitioners, company owners, managers, and consulting firms to accurately estimate the value of equity. The shareholders’ value theory places shareholders at the top of a hierarchy in analyzing the economic performance of a business. The EVA is a modified version of the shareholders’ value theory (Banerjee, 2000). The selling point of EVA is that it increases stock return. It also stands out from the crowd for its association with stock prices. As such, EVA gained popularity toward the end of the twentieth century, most notably when the executives of big companies such as AT&T and Coca-Cola publicly declared that a 27% rise in EVA performance increased stock return by about 200% (Chen and Dodd, 1997). Moreover, an article in Fortune magazine praising EVA as a measure of corporate success attracted a flurry of research papers that detailed EVA success stories and promoted EVA adoption (Chen and Dodd, 1997). A huge body of literature isnow available on success stories of the EVA model. EVA performs better than accounting measures in explaining stock return (Behera, 2019; Gounder and Venkateshwarlu, 2017; Khan et al., 2016; Ahmed, 2015; Bhasin, 2013; Zhao and Wang, 2012; Worthington and West, 2004; Misra and Kanwal, 2007; Singh, 2005; Lefkowitz, 1999; Saxena, 1998; Easton et al., 1992). EVA advocates have claimed that upward and downward trends in stock prices are strongly associated with EVA. Some found that EVA could be used to more accurately determine the intrinsic value of equity by adding the book value of equity with the present value of EVAs under the assumption of constant required return and constant return on equity (Stewart, 1991). Later, O'Byrne et al. (1996) found that EVA better predicted the expected market value of equity by adding the book value of equity capital, the perpetual value of the current EVA, and the present value of the perpetual value of incremental EVAs generated by future invested capitals under the assumption of constant required return and constant return on invested capital. Despite these success stories of using EVA as performance measurement metric, little attention has been paid to examining the efficiency of the EVA valuation model. Using an EVA valuation model formulated with the assumption of constant normal market return raises the question of whether the normal market return remains constant. Growing empirical evidence hints at the volatility of financial return and emphasizes that the relative importance of the volatile component of competitive advantage rises when compared to the long-run component of the sustainable competitive advantage (Thomas and D’Aveni, 2009). Normal market return never remains constant, and asset values are better explained under time-varying discount rates than under constant required return (Campbell and Mei, 1993; Mei and Lee, 1994; Ahrendsen and Khoju, 1994; Geltner and Mei, 1995; Saha and Malkiel, 2012; McLemore et al. 2015; Gelter and Mei, 1995; Ang and Liu, 2003). Similarly, D’Aveni et al. (2010) explained that the environment has become more dynamic and disruptive because of technological change, globalization, industrial convergence, aggressive competitive behavior, deregulation, the privatization movement stimulated by government or hedge funds, government subsidiaries, the rise of emerging economy, and global political instability. The drastic competitive actions and counter responses among rivals have increased the volatility of financial returns. In the current market scenario, expecting constant return on investment equity capital is unrealistic. Thus, an EVA valuation model that operates under the assumption of constant required return and constant return on equity cannot be implemented under the scenario of a changing required return. To address the above limitations, we first posited that the book value of equity of the existing EVA-based valuation model needs to be replaced with the present value of normal market earnings in order to implement the valuation model under the scenario of changing required return. Next, we examined whether the assumption of changing the normal market return leads to a better estimation of the intrinsic value. Therefore, this study compared the explanatory ability of the EVA-based valuation model operating under a changing required return with the explanatory ability of the existing EVA-valuation model that operates under a constant required return. To stay focused on the objective, this study did not include a deeper discussion on how the discount rate changes over time. We made this choice because finance is all about practical application, not just deep explanation (Cochrane, 2011). Moreover, discount return variation can significantly change application (Cochrane, 2011). We determined the required rate of return or normal market return in two different ways: a static estimate with no variation in risk-free return, the market premium, and the beta over the periods of each company; and a variable estimate with periodic variation in risk-free return, the market premium, and the beta. For better exposition, this study considered sample data from over 15 years (from 2002 to 2003 to 2016–2017) of 69 large-cap, 88 mid-cap, and 79 small-cap companies, and included a relative information content analysis. The results of the analysis indicated that the explanatory ability of the EVA-based valuation model is better under changing required return than under constant required return. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the existing literature on EVA and the gap. Section 3 discusses the derivation process of EVA and the EVA valuation model. Section 4 includes our hypothesis. Section 5 covers the data source and sample selection. Section 6 reports the results and focuses on the overall discussion. Section 7 provides the conclusion.",7

6.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,25 January 2020,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-020-0172-y,Privacy-preserving analytics for the securitization market: a zero-knowledge distributed ledger technology application,December 2020,Sophie Meralli,,,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"The securitization market presents inefficiencies due to the inherent complexity surrounding its structured products. The process of bundling thousands of loans and issuing related securities involves many intermediaries, with diverging incentives and access to information (European Central Bank Publication N. 975 2008; Fligstein and Roehrkasse 2013). Due to information delays, lack of data standardization and limited traceability of collateral flow throughout the securitization chain, there is a lack of transparency about the performance of the many loans backing up these securities (Sindle et al 2017). This lack of transparency prevents investors from making their investment decisions independently and in a timely manner, and has led to significant regulatory reforms (Code of Federal Regulations Title 17 Commodity and Securities Exchanges Chapter II Part 246 Credit Risk Retention 2017) in the past recent years to improve disclosure requirements, network governance and accountability mechanism. The inherent complexity and lack of transparency involved in the securitization industry makes it a compelling use case for distributed ledger technology (DLT) application. Recently, financial institutions and regulators in the industry have investigated DLT’s potential (Sindle et al 2017;Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) 2017). DLT uses independent computers (referred to as nodes) to record, share and synchronize transactions in their respective electronic ledgers (instead of keeping data centralized as in a traditional ledger) (The World Bank 2018). Blockchain is one type of distributed ledger where data is organized into blocks, which are chained together in an append-only mode. In this paper, blockchain and DLT are used interchangeably. Blockchain/DLT enable recording of interactions and transfer ownership of asset (e.g. money, securities, land titles and specific information) peer-to-peer, without a need for a centrally coordinating entity (The World Bank 2018). Applied to the securitization market, DLT may enable market participants to store and update securely the information of thousands of individual loans on a near-real time basis on one unique shared ledger, without the need for reconciliation among each party’s database (Sindle et al 2017). It has the potential to bring secure, traceable near-real time performance data to the industry. However, DLT adoption faces a dilemma between data privacy-preserving and public sharing that can be described by two limitations: 1) participants will lose data privacy if they are to share data in the public ledger (such as loan level data); 2) encrypting loan level data will keep privacy but will therefore not support data analytics at the asset pool-level. As security issuers do not have the incentive to reveal sensitive proprietary loan-level data to investors and third-partiesFootnote 1, current blockchain applications cannot scale at industry level. In order for blockchain applications to scale, there is a need for flexible privacy settings that can reflect the subtleties of current market interactions. We aim to address this dilemma by introducing a decentralized market platform, zkABS, powered by zero-knowledge proofs and designed for the securitization industry. In cryptography, a zero-knowledge protocol or proof is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that he knows a secret statement without revealing the secret itself (Goldwasser et al. 1989). Our platform is based on zkLedger (Narula et al. 2018), an experimental system developed by the MIT Media Lab that leverages zero-knowledge proofs to preserve data privacy while providing its users with a suite of publicly verifiable analytics at the aggregate level (e.g. sums, averages and variances). Applied to the securitization industry, we argue that zkLedger could preserve the confidentiality of individual loan data while providing participants with publicly verifiable near-real time analytics at the asset pool level. It could therefore power a decentralized digital platform where all market participants (e.g. investors, issuers, regulators, rating agencies) could get access to publicly verifiable market analytics in near-real time. We introduce the concept of near-real time frequency to address the security vulnerability and privacy leaks that real-time frequency solutions entail. In the securitization market, near-real time analytics is defined as data analysis based on up-to-date information and can range from bi-weekly updates to daily updates, depending on the types and volume of assets hosted in the systemFootnote 2. Our system has applications throughout the value chain: in the security construction and issuance steps, it could enable investors to pick up loans on an aggregate basis, without revealing data on the individual loans. In the trading phase, it could provide anonymity of trading in the primary and secondary issuance side and enable investors to get analytics about security ownership concentration. Post-issuance, investors could get anonymized performance analytics and query about trends in the market at any point of time. Overall, our system could reduce asymmetry of information and improve transparency in the securitization market. In summary, the contributions of this paper are:
 Identification of inefficiencies in the securitization market that could benefit from DLT technology, specifically related to information asymmetry between the sell-side and the buy-side of the industry. Review of current blockchain initiatives in the industry and their privacy limitations Introduction of zkABS, a decentralized platform based on zkLedger that aims to reduce the information asymmetry in the market. In our use case, zkABS is used as a model to share loan electronic records among distrusting participants in a secure and confidential way without compromising the independent verifiability of the data. Due to its selective visibility property, zkABS allows all market participants to interact on the same platform and to benefit from more timely market data.",8

Under data envelopment analysis (DEA), productivity is defined as the ratio between efficiency and is measured by MPI for the same decision making unit (DMU) in two different periods. Caves et al. (1982a;1982b) proposed an MPI as the ratio of two input distance functions to calculate the relative performance of a DMU in different periods. Färe et al. (1994) extended the approach of Caves et al. (1982a) and constructed an MPI directly using input and output data as the geometric mean of the MPIs calculated in the two base periods. Using Farrell’s (1957) methodology for the measurement of efficiency and that of Caves et al. (1982a) on the measurement of productivity, Färe et al. (1994) constructed an MPI directly from input and output data using DEA. However, this conventional profit MPI requires the input-output quantity and exact input-output prices to be available. However, in many situations, some inputs and/or outputs and input-output prices have imprecise data. Therefore, conventional profit MPI models are not suitable or applicable to measuring overall profit MPI. Asmild et al. (2007) presented a framework in which DEA was used to measure the overall efficiencies of different behavioral objectives. Furthermore, they showed how this framework could be applied to assess the effectiveness of more general behavioral goals. These objectives are revenue maximization, cost minimization, and profit maximization. Asmild et al. (2007) clarified the relationships between various cone-ratio DEA (CR-DEA) models and those used to measure overall efficiency. Aghayi et al. () evaluated the MPI of DMUs with desirable and undesirable interval outputs. To deal with data uncertainty, a fuzzy approach was proposed by Wanke et al. (2016), who also calculated the efficiency of banks. Mashayekhi and Omrani (2016) used a fuzzy approach for sorting genetic algorithms with uncertain data. Salehpour and Aghayi (2015) calculated revenue efficiency under price uncertainty to find a solution to minimizing the worst-case performance with uncertain data. Hatami-Marbini et al. (2018) developed an overarching evaluation process for estimating the RTS of DMUs under imprecise DEA (IDEA), where the input and output data lie within bounded intervals. For more on IDEA, see Shabani et al. (2019), Ebrahimi (2018), Fazelabdolabadi (2019), Toloo et al. (2018), Shokouhi et al. (2014), Hatami-Marbini et al. (2017), Ureña et al. (2019), Zhang et al. (2019), Kao et al. (2014) and the references therein. The MPI computation using DEA with uncertain data has not been studied widely in the literature. For instance, Emrouznejad et al. (2011) studied the overall profit MPI using DEA with fuzzy and interval data. They extended the model (39) of Asmild et al. (2007) and proposed two methods for measuring the overall profit MPI when the input, output, and price vectors are fuzzy or vary over intervals (see Emrouznejad et al. (2011), models (3a) and (3b)). To the best of our knowledge, to compute the overall profit MPI of each DMU, the profit efficiency at time period t[(t+1) must be computed using the technology and input-output prices at time period t+1](t) (see (Tohidi et al. 2010; Tohidi et al. 2014). However, in Emrouznejad et al.’s (2011) method, the input-output prices in periods t and t+1 are used simultaneously, meaning the results are not reasonable (see subsection 2.2. for details). As such, this paper overcomes the shortfall of Emrouznejad et al.’s model (3b) (Emrouznejad et al. 2011). Park (2001) introduced an approach to deal with IDEA involving variable input and output. He considered the multiplier and envelopment IDEA models (Cooper et al. 1999; Lee et al. 2002) and clarified the relationships between them. These models yield an upper and a lower bound on efficiency, respectively. Mostafaee and Saljooghi (2010) extended the classical cost efficiency models to include data uncertainty. However, Fang and Li (2012) showed that Mostafaee and Saljooghi’s (2010) approach had some drawbacks. Then, Fang and Li (2013) extended Park’s approach and presented an alternative IDEA method to calculate an upper and a lower bound of cost efficiency measurement in the presence of imprecise price inputs. Based on the studies of Park (2001) and Emrouznejad et al. (2011), this paper introduces alternative methods for measuring the overall profit MPI when the input, output, and input-output prices are uncertain and also measures the lower and upper bounds of overall profit MPIs. We show that the upper bound of the overall profit efficiency is obtained by incorporating uncertain data as interval data directly into the overall profit efficiency models. In addition, the lower bound of the overall profit efficiency is achieved by incorporating the same uncertain data as weight restrictions into a CR-DEA model. The main contributions of this paper are as follows: (a) we calculate the overall profit MPI assuming that input, output, and input-output prices are imprecise; (b) we characterized these imprecise data with interval methods; (c) we propose models to measure the overall profit efficiency in adjacent periods, which has a reasonable interpretation (see model (4)); (d) we establish new models to compute the upper bounds for the profit efficiency measures; (e) we extend the model using CR-DEA; and (f) we demonstrate the practical aspects of our model using a numerical example. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. “Overall profit efficiency and MPIs” section presents an overview of overall profit efficiency and Malmquist indices. “Main results” section proposes models to calculate the lower and upper bounds of the profit efficiency of each DMU within the period and for adjusted periods. In “Computational aspects” section, we develop new methods to calculate the upper bounds of the overall profit efficiency of each DMU. A numerical example is also provided in “Computational aspects” section. Finally, “Conclusions” section concludes the paper.",4

7.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,05 November 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-021-00299-1,"Spillovers of US unconventional monetary policy: quantitative easing, spreads, and international financial markets",December 2021,Zekeriya Yildirim,Mehmet Ivrendi,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In response to the great recession in 2007–2009, the Federal Reserve (the Fed) used conventional and unconventional monetary policy (UMP) instruments. Figure 1 depicts these instruments and shows that the Fed began to lower the federal funds rate—a conventional monetary policy instrument. After several cuts, at the end of 2008, the rate reached the zero bound (shown by the dashed red line on the right side of Fig. 1). This phenomenon indicates that the Fed cannot do anything to get the economy out of the great recession by using its conventional monetary policy tool. The Fed, then, used UMP instruments—so-called large-scale asset purchases (LSPAs) or quantitative easing (QE) and forward guidance—to stimulate economic activities. Thus, the Fed’s balance sheet holdings of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and treasuries (TS) sharply increased (the right panel of Fig. 1). The difference between conventional and unconventional US monetary policies is that conventional policy uses a short-term interest rate to affect financial conditions and the economy, whereas UMP uses QE and forward guidance as policy instruments. The present study focuses on a specific UMP measure conducted by the Fed, that is, QE. US monetary policy instruments: Conventional: The Federal Funds Rate is initially colored light red and then dark red (left scale); Unconventional: The Fed’s TS and MBS holdings are initially colored light blue and orange and then dark blue and orange (right scale), respectively Kuttner (2018) emphasized that the QE instrument refers to a set of four asset purchase programs: the three LSAPs, commonly known as QE1, QE2, and QE3, and the maturity extension program (MEP) (see Fig. 2 for the QE periods). During the QE1 period, the assets purchased by the Fed were agency debt, MBS, and TS at $1750 billion. During the QE2 period, the assets purchased were longer-dated treasuries with a value of $600 billion. During the MEP period, the assets purchased were 6–30-year treasuries with a value of $667 billion. Furthermore, during the QE3 period, the purchased assets by the Fed were MBS and longer-dated treasuries at a value of $40 and $45 billion/month, respectively.Footnote 1 Fed’s quantitative easing policy (US UMP). Note: The US mortgage spread is calculated as the difference between the 30-year fixed rate mortgage rate and 10-year Treasury bond rate. The US term spread is also defined as the difference between 30-year and 10-year Treasury yields. MBS and TS represent the Fed’s balance sheet holdings of MBS and TS, respectively. The QE1, QE2, operation twist, and QE3 span the periods, respectively: November 25, 2008 to April 11, 2010 (the QE1); August 10, 2010 to November 3, 2010(the QE2); September 21, 2011 to September 30, 2012(the operation twist); September 30, 20132 to February 24, 2013 (the QE3) A sharp decline in the US interest rate spreads, particularly the mortgage spread, coincides with the period of US UMP (Fig. 2). This case raises the question of whether this decline in the spread can be attributed to US UMP. The answer provided by the recent studies is “yes”.Footnote 2 For instance, Hancock and Passmore (2011) reported that the Fed’s MBS purchases have substantially reduced the mortgage spread. Wang (2019) revealed that the Fed’s market-based approach to UMP of providing direct financial support to the MBS market is effective in reducing MBS spreads. Additionally, Fig. 2 shows supportive evidence for this argument that the Fed’s asset purchases substantially decreased the mortgage spread. This strong evidence on the tight link between US UMP (the Fed’s asset purchases) and the spreads suggests that decreases in the spreads can be used as indicators of the effectiveness of UMP,Footnote 3 which is consistent with the argument of Blinder (2010). He argued that the US UMP primarily aimed to reduce interest rate spreads, such as term and/or risk premiums. The reason was that “since private borrowing, lending, and spending decisions presumably depend on (risky) non-Treasury rates, reducing their spreads over (riskless) Treasuries reduces the interest rates that matter for actual transactions even if riskless rates are unchanged.” Accordingly, UMP actions can be considered effective or successful if such actions remove risks from private securities and decrease costs of private borrowings, thereby reducing spreads between private and government securities or among interest rates with different maturities. In this paper, motivated by Blinder’s (2010) argument and Hancock and Passmore (2011) and Wang (2019), we assess the international financial spillovers of US UMP by estimating the effects of a US mortgage spread shock on international financial markets and comparing them with those from a US term spreadFootnote 4 shock. The US mortgage spread—defined as the difference between the interest rate on the mortgage and government securities—is considered an instrument for the counter cycleFootnote 5 policy. Thus, the Fed chose to reduce the interest rate on the mortgage as a part of its UMP and started to purchase MBS to reduce the mortgage spread, which was very high before the great recession (Fig. 2). In other words, a US UMP measure, such as the Fed’s purchases of MBS, intends to stabilize the US financial market and economy by decreasing the mortgage spread. The stabilizing role of the mortgage spread decline has been documented by two recent studies. First, Walentin (2014) revealed that negative mortgage spread shocks have significant expansionary effects on the US economy. Second, Cheng and Chiu (2020) looked at a different angle and analyzed the nonlinear effects of mortgage spread shocks on the economy. They reported that mortgage spread shocks have substantial effects on the US economy, which are much larger during recessions. They also revealed that these shocks can be interpreted as credit supply shocks in the mortgage market. Given the significant role of mortgage spread shocks on the US business cycle, one could expect that US mortgage spread shocks should also exert a substantial influence on foreign financial markets. However, to the best of our knowledge, no empirical study regarded the international financial effects of US mortgage spread shocks.Footnote 6 The present study is the first to attempt to fill this gap. Additionally, to deepen our analysis, the term spread—defined as the gap between the long- and short-term interest rates of two securities with different maturities—is also considered a measure of UMP. Two factors make the term spread a good measure of US UMP, along with the mortgage spread. First, in the zero-lower-bound (ZLB) environment, the direct and observable consequence of US UMP is a fall in the term spread (see Blinder (2010, 2012)). Thus, during the ZLB period, the term spread can accurately represent the stance of the US monetary policy although the conventional monetary policy tool loses its information contents (Figs. 1 and 2). Second, the term spread has predictive power for the US economic activity, particularly during the US UMP episode (see, Hännikäinen 2015). In that regard, several studies used the term spread to assess the effects of UMP (see, for example, Chen et al. (2016), Huang (2019), and Olani (2020) for the United States; Feldkircher et al. (2020) for the Euro area; and Koeda (2019) for Japan). We follow these studies and use the term spread as another measure of US UMP in this study. Overall, we extend the above arguments by stating that if the LSAPs (UMPs) are successful or effective, spreads should fall because of the reduction in risk premiums for private securities and the fall in borrowers’ costs of credit (Fig. 2). Considering that the mortgage spread and the term spread have been largely driven by the Fed’s asset purchases during the US UMP period, we use them as means to assess whether the US UMP affects the financial markets of advanced economies (AEs) and emerging market economies (EMEs). To quantify the effects on the international financial markets, we estimate a daily structural vector autoregressive (SVAR) model for each US UMP measure (mortgage and term spread) and each of 40 countries (20 EMEs and 20 AEs) from July 2007 to February 2013, covering all three QE periods. The price-based measures (interest rate spreads [the top panel of Fig. 2]) were used instead of asset-based measures (the Fed’s asset holdings [the bottom panel of Fig. 2]) because of the following reasons. First, the empirical analysis with asset-based measures may cause the problem of better anticipation of the asset purchase program. However, the spread shocks capture both asset purchase announcements and market expectations, and the analysis with these shocks should avoid this problem (Hesse et al. 2018). Second, the UMP sample is very short compared with the conventional monetary policy sample (Fig. 1). Thus, vector autoregression (VAR) studies, notably with low-frequency measures of US UMP, may generate imprecise estimates. This problem may be alleviated by using high-frequency daily measures of US UMP, such as the interest rate spread.Footnote 7 The present study reveals the following: (1) US spread shocks significantly affect financial markets in EMEs and AEs through the risk-taking channel, suggesting that US UMP drives global risk perceptions and thereby shapes global financial conditions. (2) US mortgage and term spread shocks produce similar financial spillovers into the rest of the world. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the estimated spillovers depends on the type of shocks; mortgage spread shocks relative to term spread shocks have more sizable effects on foreign financial markets. (3) Expectedly, the estimated spillovers from US UMP shocks vary across countries and within country groups. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. “Stylized Facts” section documents stylized facts characterizing the role of the Fed’s UMP measures in shaping global financial conditions. “Channels of US UMP and Literature Review” section discusses the theoretical channels of US UMP and reviews the literature. “Empirical Analysis” section introduces the empirical model and explains the identification assumptions. “Empirical Results” section reports empirical findings regarding the effects of US UMP on the financial markets of EMEs and AEs. “Robustness” section documents the results of the robustness tests. “Conclusion” section concludes the study.",5

However, after the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, banks set higher standards of lending due to greater regulations. Low returns on public markets lured investors into alternative forms of investments. COVID-19 crisis could further shift investors’ preferences towards non-traditional markets, which are less liquid and transparent (Sindreu 2020). This might allow a new generation of non-banks to come of age and transform shadow banking (banking by non-banks) within the broader development of the FinTech industry. One of those businesses is marketplace lending platforms that manage to diversify risk while not holding borrower loans in their balance sheets. This method of diversification tends to protect them against borrower defaults and maintain the required level of liquidity (Cumming and Hornuf 2018). During the last decade, the marketplace lending industry expanded outside stringent government regulations and more than doubled in size in China, the US, and the UK between 2010 and 2014 (Aveni et al. 2015). The rise of the marketplace lending market is often attributed to the stringent regulation of traditional bank lending after the global financial crisis, while the central cause of the crisis was growing credit default risk because of information asymmetry (Emekter et al. 2015). At their early stages, marketplace lending platforms essentially took a ‘passive’ role in their borrower assessment and loan provision. Individual investors mostly made investment decisions based on ‘soft’ information provided by the borrowers (Balyuk and Davydenko 2019). When the loan volumes grew larger, platforms automated investment decisions, developed individual scoring systems and algorithms distinct from banks or credit bureaus (Iyer et al. 2016; Jagtiani and Lemieux 2017). These changes transformed the lending decisions from investors to platforms and made them more similar to ordinary banks (Balyuk and Davydenko 2019; Ryan and Zhu 2018). By getting more involved in investing decisions, marketplace lending platforms should constantly improve their risk assessment for avoiding unsustainable losses (Flögel and Beckamp 2020). The global pandemic of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) triggered extreme government measures worldwide that restricted economic activity. In the absence of a vaccine or treatment, lockdown and social distancing measures were broadly perceived as an effective way to contain the disease. These measures had a systematic impact on the financial sector and the broader economy via business closures and disruptions of the global value chain. Ongoing economic downturn as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic increases the likelihood of unsustainable losses by the marketplace lending industry. Losses in the industry are expected to increase substantially over a major economic downturn, which can quickly exhaust investor funds (Bolt et al. 2012). Unlike prior infectious disease pandemics, the COVID-19 pandemic has a vast global economic and financial impact, allowing us to study this emerging issue in a large cross-country context. The literature related to the COVID-19 pandemic is currently in its infancy, primarily due to its ongoing and rapidly evolving nature. Nevertheless, several studies have reported the early impact of COVID-19 on banks, financial markets and the economy overall (Agosto and Giudici 2020; Auer et al. 2020; Baldwin and Di Mauro 2020; Civelek and Xiarewana 2020; Demirguc-Kunt et al. 2020a, b; Stiller and Zink 2020; Wu and Olson 2020; Bose et al. 2021). A limited number of studies examined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on FinTech adoption and its popularity (Fu and Mishra 2020; Najaf et al. 2021). However, no prior studies, to our knowledge, explore the implications of the COVID-19 pandemic for the risk levels and defaults in non-bank or FinTech lending markets. To investigate the effects of COVID-19 risk on FinTech lending, we examine the likelihood of loan default due to the COVID-19 pandemic among marketplace lending loans. The central question of this study is: How does the COVID-19 risk affect marketplace lending market defaults? We use the loan book dataset of Mintos (Latvia) marketplace lending platform in conjunction with the borrower- and country-specific factors. Our logistic regression estimates indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic risk increases the likelihood of loan default. Specifically, the odds ratio indicates a 2.5 times higher likelihood of default in the post-pandemic period than the pre-pandemic period. We also document that marginal changes in the probability of default are 0.39–0.63% lower among the countries with high FinTech adoption than countries with low FinTech adoption. Our analysis further shows that the impact of COVID-19 risk was not solidly reflected in loan defaults until April 2020. Loans with lower ratings are also more likely to default, with a 2.30% higher likelihood of default in the post-pandemic period than the pre-pandemic period. Our paper contributes to the existing literature in several ways. First, we provide early evidence that COVID-19 pandemic risk significantly increases the likelihood of loan default. Second, we evaluate the monthly impact of COVID-19 pandemic risk on default risk and provide evidence that the likelihood of loan defaults is highest in the month of May and June. Third, we find that borrowers credit ratings and country-level FinTech adoption act as a cushion to prevent the likelihood of loan default. Overall, we provide a unique insight into how the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the likelihood of loan default in particular. In this regard, the findings of our study might have important implications for both marketplace lending investors, platforms and policymakers. Most of the marketplace lending platforms are currently revising their main security tool against the financial hardship, ‘provision fund’. Platforms now withhold up to 50% of investor interest income to contribute to a ‘provisional fund’ (RateSetter 2020). This type of extreme measure may be helpful to solve short-term liquidity problems but drives away yield-hungry investors in the long term. Our study allows for quantifying risks and analysing risk factors in the marketplace lending market during financial distress. Thus, it fills the gap in the existing literature by developing a cross country model tested via econometric analysis. The findings of this study in terms of COVID-19 risk can guide platform management in overcoming or controlling various risk factors. The model used in our study by including both loan and economy specific variables might serve as a framework of risk management in marketplace lending platforms. By extending the modelling and findings of the current study marketplace, lending platforms and investors can improve their risk management models. Marketplace lending platforms can improve their security mechanisms, and investors can adjust their loan portfolios. The rest of this paper is organised as follows. Second section describes the background of the topic, and third section explains the methodology and data. Fourth section discusses the empirical findings of the study. Fifth section is the discussion and conclusion.",10

These new exchanges must be considered, in order to accurately analyze the recent banking and financial sectors. As regulatory authorities worldwide extend the application of financial regulations from traditional financial institutions to cryptocurrency exchanges, there is an urgent need to study the regulation of cryptocurrency transactions. Theoretically, cryptocurrency market regulations have two conflicting effects. On the one hand, regulations can function as restrictions for market participants, negatively impacting the market. On the other hand, they may boost the market by strengthening its credibility and stability. Under this framework, empirical studies assess the impact of regulations on the cryptocurrency market. Borri and Shakhnov (2020) identify that cryptocurrency investors react negatively to regulations or announcements about forthcoming regulations. Chokor and Alfieri (2021) and Shanaev et al. (2020) also draw similar conclusions, using the reaction of price movements as a proxy for the impact of regulations on the cryptocurrency market. In contrast, Feinstein and Werbach (2021) investigate the reaction of trading volume, criticizing the use of price movements as a proxy, and find no sufficient evidence to assert the significant impact of the regulations. In addition, Borri and Shakhnov (2020) and Feinstein and Werbach (2021) draw inconsistent results on the international spillover of regulations. However, compared to studies on other financial assets, those on cryptocurrency regulations are in an early phase. To integrate the conflicting ideas suggested by existing studies, more in-depth theoretical research considering both the investor and exchange intermediary sides is required. One of the most important purposes of cryptocurrency regulations is to prevent money laundering (ML). Owing to the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, criminals can use cryptocurrency exchanges to launder dirty money; proper anti-money laundering (AML) actions in the cryptocurrency market can, therefore, improve overall AML performance in the economy. This study specifically focuses on the duty to report suspicious activities imposed upon cryptocurrency exchanges. Governments do not directly detect ML activities. For several reasons, such as privacy rights, governments do not have the right to directly monitor all transactions made through private banks or cryptocurrency exchanges. Even if a government did have the right to do so, it would not be able to thoroughly check every individual transaction. Thus, although the exact processes may vary by country, financial authorities usually require banks and exchanges to monitor and report transactions for which ML activities are suspected. The authorities then analyze the reports of suspicious transactions thoroughly and identify whether they are true ML transactions. Some studies, such as those of Brenig et al. (2015) and Dupuis and Gleason (2020) particularly investigate cryptocurrency-backed ML activities. Furthermore, Bhaskar and Chuen’s (2015) study implies that exchanges may go out of business because they are not capable of complying with strict AML regulations. Unfortunately, no prior studies have focused on the duty of cryptocurrency exchanges to report suspicious activities. The lack of research explicitly studying whether a cryptocurrency exchange can faithfully comply with this reporting duty may stem from the fact that such exchanges are still in the early stages of adoption. Compared to traditional private financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges are new, small, and illiquid. This study pays attention to these distinct characteristics. We analyze the impact of a newly emerging type of AML regulation requiring cryptocurrency exchanges to report transactions for which ML is suspected. Based on background information on ML practices, the structure of the AML regulations, and the characteristics of cryptocurrency exchanges, we build two models to derive some findings on exchanges’ behavior. The first model illustrates a cryptocurrency exchange’s decision structure to report a transaction as an ML-suspected case. The second model describes the proportion of total illegal gains that a money launderer chooses to launder. Whereas the first model focuses on the decision of a representative cryptocurrency exchange, the second model focuses on the decision of a representative money launderer. The second model extends the discussion of the first model by endogenizing the money launderer, which is treated as an exogenous actor in the first model. We claim that when cryptocurrency exchanges are obligated to report suspicious transactions, they will not faithfully comply with this regulation, but rather will report an excessive number of transactions, which is uninformative to the regulatory authority. Our models suggest two main findings on the potential consequences of applying AML regulations to cryptocurrency exchanges. First, the relatively short history, small exchange size, and illiquidity of the cryptocurrency market increase the threat that a cryptocurrency exchange will be punished by authorities for reporting an excessive number of ML-suspected cases. Second, some cryptocurrency exchanges that largely depend on revenues from ML transactions may intentionally lower the ML detection probability by increasing the number of reports of suspected ML. This study makes some additional contributions to the literature. We develop a model describing the reporting decision structure of a financial institution entrusted with monitoring ML. Furthermore, this study relaxes the assumption in the existing literature that all illegal pecuniary gains must be laundered for use. With this assumption relaxed, our study attempts to make a novel approach to analyze ML using portfolio choice theory. Our study is also expected to provide policy implications for global financial regulatory authorities. Financial authorities around the world have already begun to design AML regulations for cryptocurrency exchanges. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an intergovernmental organization to combat ML, suggests guidelines on how financial authorities worldwide should respond to cryptocurrency technology (FATF 2012, 2019). To mitigate the risk associated with this new technology, it recommends that global financial authorities encourage cryptocurrency exchanges to be licensed or registered and subject to ML monitoring compliance. In accordance with the FATF’s recommendation, global authorities are expected to arrange measures to adopt reporting obligations for cryptocurrency exchanges. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. “Research background” section provides background information; Cryptocurrency exchange’s decision” section explains the model of a cryptocurrency exchange decision; “Money launderer’s portfolio choice problem” section incorporates the portfolio choice model of a money launderer; “Policy implications” section suggests policy implications based on the findings; “Conclusion” section concludes the paper.",3

These analyses have important implications on diversification benefits, hedging strategies, and portfolio risk assessment. Cryptocurrencies have exhibited spectacular growth since their inception in 2008, with the range of different currencies recently surpassing 3000. This digital money (Financial technology) reduces the transaction costs, provides higher quality services, and increases customer satisfaction (Kou et al. 2021a). Their emergence in such numbers underpins their importance to market participants, governments, firms, and economists. Interestingly, the increasing integration and interdependence among international markets reduces the diversification opportunities. In addition, cryptocurrencies have been considered a viable alternative to traditional assets, especially in the wake of the global financial crisis (GFC) of 2008 (Corbet et al. 2019; Rehman and Vo 2020). Thus, a better understanding of the multiscale interactions among major cryptocurrencies may provide new opportunities for investors. In the literature, different econometric methods can be used to analyze the relationships among markets (causality test, cointegration, bivariate GARCH models, structural vector autoregression (SVAR), spillover index, copula functions, and quantile regression approach, among others). However, these methods are not able to examine the relationships under both time–frequency domain. Our research philosophy is to account for the evolving relationship between cryptocurrency markets not only over time but also over frequencies to account for market heterogeneity (traders and speculators are interested in short-term investment (high frequencies) and institutional investors are concerned by the long term investments (low frequencies).
 This study contributes to the emerging empirical literature in three important fronts. First, it uses high frequency data to examine the multiscale interactions among main cryptocurrencies—Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Ripple, and Monero—in terms of market capitalization and their remarkable trading volume in the last few years (Bouri et al. 2020a). The relatively large sample used in this study adds to the literature on co-movement and interconnectedness of cryptocurrencies—by providing a richer and an extensive empirical analysis. This contrasts with many earlier studies that limit their analyses to a few cryptocurrencies—see e.g., Corbet et al. (2018a), Phillip et al. (2018), Aslanidis et al. (2019) and Qureshi et al. (2020). The use of high frequency data offers an additional useful information on how crypto markets co-move and respond to local and international shocks. The high frequency data has significant power in predicting stock prices and more advantageous than low-frequency data (Zhang and Wang 2019). Koopman et al. (2005) argue that volatility models based on high-frequency estimators enable forecasts that are superior to those generated by models grounded in low-frequency data. Thus, the high frequency data researchers can set a sufficiently narrow time window around each market announcement to check if markets are surprised or not by a specific news. Measuring the surprise on this limited time horizon allows to remove the noise deriving from other events that might influence the instrument’s quote along the day and potential crowding-in or out effects. Second, it overcomes the static full sample analysis by relying on rolling window wavelet correlation (RWWC) coefficients to analyze the co-movements among cryptocurrency returns over different time scales (Polanco-Martínez et al. 2018). We notice that the rolling window analysis assesses the stability of the coefficients over time. Despite their advantage, RWWC is unable to identify the directional causality (uni- or bi-directional causalities) and the magnitude of causalities at different frequencies. To do this, we use the non-linear directional Granger causality at multiple scale to identify the origin of information transmission. We notice that the presence of unidirectional causality from market \(i\) to market \(j\) indicates that market \(i\) can be used to predict the price return of market \(j\). In addition, the decomposition of raw return series is fundamental to account for the heterogeneous investors. Thus, we apply for a deepen analysis the nonlinear Granger causality test of Diks and Panchenko (2006) to find out the wavelet decomposition coefficients. The advantage of this nonlinear causality testing method is that, while the wavelet correlation coefficients measure the co-movements, they are unable to establish direction of causation in different wavelet scales. Determining the direction of causation allows us to determine the direction of information flow (and perhaps spillover of volatility and contagion) across different time horizons to construct a more complete picture of the cryptocurrency marketplace.
 Third, the findings of RWWC and multiscale Granger causality methods are relevant for cryptocurrency investors in terms of portfolio design. For this aim, we assess an investment strategy of mixed portfolios composed from Bitcoin and each of other cryptocurrency by quantifying the optimal weights, hedge ratios and hedging effectiveness under different wavelet scales. We select Bitcoin as a benchmark because it is the largest cryptocurrency asset and widely traded and accepted by investors. From a practical perspective, considering these methods together provide an accurate and rich information to cryptocurrency investors and fund managers to enhance their funds allocation and investment trading strategies. Our results demonstrate that the cryptocurrencies move together—largely in a positive direction—and experience long-term memory. This observation holds more strongly for the cryptocurrency pairs involving Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Monero. Bidirectional causality exists between most of the cryptocurrency pairs as per the Diks and Panchenko (2006) tests. The implication of these findings is that there exists substantial scope for arbitrage, portfolio risk assessment, diversification, and improvement (Corbet et al. 2018b; Makarov and Schoar 2019). Portfolio managers and investors who engage across investment horizons (i.e., multi-prospect and/or high-frequency traders) can avail these findings for their strategic decisions (Qureshi et al. 2020). The analysis of cryptocurrency pricing data at 15-min intervals may help the agents in managing and stabilizing their intra-day transaction portfolio to manage risk and ensure predictability of returns. Of late, the high levels of volatility exhibited in the cryptocurrency markets make them a perfect candidate for high-frequency volatility analysis. As mentioned above, high-frequency analysis provides richer and more useful insights regarding market response to specific news, noisy events, and/or shocks. The findings from this high-frequency analysis may additionally allow agents and policymakers to improve stability of the system’s connectedness network (Bouri et al. 2021a). The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: “Literature review” section  presents the succinct literature review; “Data and methodology” section  explicates the materials; “Results” section discusses the empirical results; “Conclusion” section concludes the paper.",9

7.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,06 December 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-021-00278-6,Network DEA based on DEA-ratio,December 2021,Dariush Akbarian,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is an approach used to measure the relative efficiency of a set of DMUs with multiple inputs and outputs, first introduced into the operations research and management science literature by Charnes et al. (1978). DEA has been used in various environments and numerous applications (Kou et al. 2021; Zha et al. 2020; Castelli et al. 2004 and references therein). The traditional DEA considers each DMUs as black boxes consuming some inputs to produce some outputs without regarding the internal structure. In real-world problems, DMUs may have a network or internal structures; see, for example Färe and Grosskopf (1996) (who introduced the concept of network DEA for the first time), Castelli et al. (2004), Tone and Tsutsui (2009) and Guo et al. (2017). Kao (2014) presented a review of network DEA. In some cases, DMUs may consist of two-stage network structures where the outputs of the first stage, known as intermediate measures/ outputs/ products, are inputs to the second stage. Many authors have studied two-stage network DEA. Kao and Hwang (2008) proposed a multiplicative efficiency aggregation approach in which the overall efficiency of the two-stage process is expressed as the product of the efficiency of two individual stages. Chen et al. (2009) revealed that Kao and Hwang’s (2008) two-stage DEA model assumed constant returns to scale (CRS) and did not apply the variable returns to scale (VRS) assumption. So, they developed an additive efficiency decomposition approach in which the overall efficiency is expressed as a weighted average of the efficiency of the individual stages under VRS technology. Despotis et al. (2016) showed that the additive decomposition approach proposed by Chen et al. (2009) is biased toward the second stage and presents a composition approach to estimate unbiased efficiency scores for the individual stages. Chen and Zhu (2004) offered a two-stage DEA model and indicated that the units with individual stages were efficient overall. However, using an example, they pointed out that overall efficient units do not necessarily indicate efficient performance in the two stages. Wang and Chin (2010) defined the overall efficiency of two-stage DMU under evaluation as the weighted harmonic mean of the efficiencies of the two-stage DMU in each stage. They also generalized the additive efficiency decomposition model of Chen et al. (2009) to taking into consideration the relative importance weights of two individual stages (see models (24), (26) and (28) of Wang and Chin 2010). Zha and Liang (2010) presented a method for studying a two-stage production process in which initial inputs of a two-stage DMU are freely allocated in both stages. However, their method does not allow for the existence of shared intermediate products or additional direct inputs to be used in the second stage. Yu and Shi (2014) improved the method of Zha and Liang (2010) and proposed a two-stage DEA parametric model where part of the outputs of the first stage are used as inputs in the second stage and additional inputs are allocated in the second stage but, does not allow for final outputs to be produced directly in the first stage or shared inputs. To overcome the aforementioned problems, Izadikhah and Farzipoor (2016) considered a two-stage DEA model in which initial inputs of a two-stage DMU are freely allocated in both stages and additional direct inputs are used in the second stage. Lozano et al. (2013) proposed a directional distance approach to deal with undesirable outputs. Lozano (2015a, 2015b) proposed slack-based measures (SBM) models for general network structures in which the exogenous inputs and outputs are considered at the system level instead of the process level. This model also relaxed the constraints for both the fixed-link and the free-link cases, thus enhanced the discriminating power of the model. DEA models usually deal with data as absolute numeric values, while in the real world there are cases where data are ratios, for example, in efficiency measurement of financial institutions where financial ratios are included as output variables. There are two types of ratio data. In the first category, the DMUj is considered as follows: \({\textit{DMU}}_j=(X_j^V, X_j^R, Y_j^V, Y_j^R)\) in which \(X_j^V\) and \(Y_j^V\) are the input and output components with absolute numeric values and are non-ratio, respectively. \(X_j^R\) and \(Y_j^R\) are the input and output components with ratio scores, respectively. Therefore, in the first category, some input and output components are ratios and others are non-ratio measures. Emrouznejad and Amin (2009), Olesen et al. (2015), Olesen et al. (2017) and Hatami-Marbini and Toloo (2019) are examples of the first category. In the second category, the inputs and outputs of the \({\textit{DMU}}_j\) are as follows: \({\textit{DMU}}_j=(X_j^V, Y_j^V)\) where \(X_j^V\) and \(Y_j^V\) are non-ratio input and output components which have absolute values. But, the ratio \(\frac{Y_j^V}{X_j^V}\) or \(\frac{X_j^V}{ Y_j^V}\) are defined. Despic et al. (2007), Liu et al. (2011), Gerami et al. (2020) and Gerami et al. (2020) are examples of the second category. Emrouznejad and Amin (2009) proposed DEA models for dealing with ratio data. In turn, Olesen et al. (2015) showed that the use of ratio inputs and outputs in the variable returns-to-scale (VRS) and constant returns-to-scale (CRS) models generally violates the stated production assumptions. They developed new Ratio-CRS (R-CRS) and Ratio-VRS (R-VRS) models that allow the incorporation of ratio inputs and outputs. In the following, Olesen et al. (2017) developed radial and non-radial models under variable and constant returns-to-scale technologies. Hatami-Marbini and Toloo (2019) showed several problems in both solutions extended by Emrouznejad and Amin (2009) and introduced modified envelopment and multiplier DEA models for measuring performance to avoid the problems associated with Emrouznejad and Amin (2009). Despic et al. (2007) combined DEA methodology and Ratio Analysis (Fernandez-Castro and Smith 1994) and introduced the DEA-Ratio (DEA-R) model. In DEA-R all possible ratios “output/input” are treated as outputs within the standard DEA model. The DEA-R is an approach to apply expert’s opinions in performance evaluationn of DMUs. For example, if a certain output cannot be produced by a certain input, then, the corresponding ratio “output/input” can be deleted from the model. Also, if the ratio data is important to managers, traditional two-stage DEA models are not applicable. Tohidnia and Tohidi (2019) applied DEA-R for evaluating the efficiency and productivity change of DMUs over time. For more discussions on the advantage of DEA-R see Mozaffari et al. (2020), Ostovan et al. (2020), Kamyab et al. (2021), Sotiros et al. (2019), Sexton and Lewis (2003), Zhang et al. (2015) and Gerami and Mozaffari (2013). Considering the advantage of DEA-R models over the CCR-based models, we evaluate the efficiency of two-stage DMUs by DEA-R models. To this end, we combine DEA-R and two-stage DEA methodologies and propose two DEA ratio models to evaluate overall ratio efficiency and individual stage ratio efficiencies of two-stage DMUs. These two models are called Range Directional DEA-R (RDD-R) and (weighted) Tchebycheff norm DEA-R (TND-R) models. We state and prove some facts about these two models. In the TND-R model, the Decision Maker can impose the preference of each stage over the other stages and project inefficient divided data on the Pareto front by selecting convenience weights. Additionally, RDD-R model is translation invariant and unit invariant and projects all divided DMUs under evaluation on the strong frontier of production possibility set, under some conditions (see proposition 6. Moreover, we compare the RDD-R and TND-R models with the proposed models in Chen et al. (2009), Despotis et al. (2016) (models (21) and (24) of Despotis et al. 2016) and Wang and Chin (2010) (models (24), (26) and (28) with (\(\lambda _1=\frac{2}{5}\), \(\lambda _2=\frac{3}{5}\))) by some examples in order to show the validity and reliability of the proposed RDD-R and TND-R models and “two-stage DEA based on DEA-R.” This paper is organized as follows. “Literature review” section presents the literature review on two-stage DEA and ratio analysis. “Proposed methodology” section develops two models based on DEA-R to evaluate overall ratio efficiency and individual stages ratio efficiency of each two-stage DMUs under evaluation. Finally, “Numerical examples” section concludes the paper. A two-stage DMU",4

It is a series of new business models, new technology applications, and new products and services that have a significant impact on the financial market and supply of financial services. It has attracted wide attention because of the following advantages: improving the efficiency of operations, reducing operating costs effectively, disrupting the existing industry structures, blurring industry boundaries, facilitating strategic disintermediation, providing new gateways for entrepreneurship, and democratizing access to financial services (Agarwal and Zhang 2020; Cao et al. 2020; Admati and Hellwig 2013; Loubere 2017; Pinochet et al. 2019; Philippon 2016; Yang et al. 2020; Suryono et al. 2020). The key technologies of FinTech include internet technology (including Internet and Web of Things) (Ruan et al. 2019), big data (Chen et al. 2017; Gai et al. 2018a), artificial intelligence (Belanche et al. 2019), distributed technology (blockchain and cloud computing) (Belanche et al. 2019; Gomber et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2019; Wamba et al. 2020; Miau and Yang 2018), and security technology (biometric technology) (Gai et al. 2018a, b; Wamba et al. 2020). Under the influence of these technologies, the traditional development model of the financial industry has changed. Furthermore, scholars have done studies involving theories and applications. To examine FinTech adoption and use from the technology acceptance perspective, Singh et al. (2020) proposed a research framework by adding substructures of the technology acceptance model. The FinTech ecosystem consisting of FinTech startups, technology developers, government, financial customers, and traditional financial institutions was presented by Lee and Shin (2018). Accordingly, the application of FinTech has been involved in many areas, such as mobile payment (Gomber et al. 2018), mobile networks (Gai et al. 2016; Wen et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2013; Zhang and Soong 2004), big data (Yin and Gai 2015), blockchain (Wamba et al. 2020; Iman 2018), P2P lending (Gomber et al. 2018; Ge et al. 2017; Suryono et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2020a, b), cloud computing (Castiglione et al. 2015; Gai et al. 2018a, b), banking service, investment funds, retail groups, and telecom operators (Singh et al. 2020), image processing (Castiglione et al. 2007), and data analysis techniques (Qiu et al. 2015). FinTech promotes the development of the financial industry. Specifically, it will be easier to collect and analyze data in the financial market to reduce information asymmetry. Trading and investment strategies based on artificial intelligence and big data can redefine the price discovery mechanism of the financial market and improve transaction speed, promoting the liquidity of the financial market and enhancing the efficiency and stability of the financial market. Regulators analyze, warn, and prevent systemic risks in the financial market more efficiently. Additionally, the smart FinTech helps save labor costs and reduce staff duplication by combining big data with artificial intelligence. Next, the development and application of FinTech help more people, especially the poor, obtain financial services at a lower cost and more conveniently, and share more reform results. Moreover, because of the “Belt and Road”, many countries share the achievements of FinTech. For example, our country’s mobile payment helps the economic and financial development of countries along the “Belt and Road”. To explore the boundaries and research paradigms of the financial disciplines that have been broken and reconstructed, this paper analyzed the current research characteristics and development trends according to the publications in the field of FinTech. 95.28% of all publications were published after 2015 (according to Web of Science (WoS)). The explosive growth and the advantages of bringing great convenience to economic management activities have prompted us to conduct a comprehensive analysis and explore the current challenges and opportunities facing the field of FinTech. It is essential for scholars who are interested in this field to conduct better and more in-depth research. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis helps investigate the development track characteristics and disclose statistical patterns through bibliometric analysis (Borgman and Furner 2002; Wang et al. 2018). Furthermore, this paper investigated the current research hot topics, identified the challenges, and predicted the future development trends. Bibliometrics, as a statistical and quantitative analysis of academic literature, has access to visualizing the analysis results using science mapping analysis tools, such as CiteSpace and Vosviewer (Chen 2006; Stopar and Bartol 2019; Van Eck and Waltman 2010), thereby improving the readability of analysis results. Bibliometric analysis has been widely applied in different research areas, such as bitcoin (Merediz-Solà and Bariviera 2019), blockchain (Miau and Yang 2018), fuzzy decision making (Liu and Liao 2017), deep learning (Li et al. 2020), social sciences (Nasir et al. 2020), business and economics (Merigo et al. 2016), COVID-19 (Lou et al. 2020), financial innovation (Li and Xu 2021), poverty cycles (Qin et al. 2021), blockchain and cryptocurrency (Nasir et al. 2021), and journals (European Journal of Operational Research (Laengle et al. 2017), Information Sciences (Yu et al. 2017), IEEE Transaction on Fuzzy Systems (Yu et al. 2018), Environmental Impact Assessment Review (Nita 2019), and International Journal of Systems Science (Wang et al. 2021)). The two visualization tools, i.e., CiteSpace and Vosviewer, can assist the bibliometric method in revealing the static and dynamic characteristics of FinTech publications from various aspects. For example, the co-occurrence network of author keywords demonstrates the main research topics; the citation and co-citation analysis highlight the top influential objects; the burst detection analysis and timeline view can exhibit changes in a certain period. These processes are called science mapping analysis (Van Eck and Waltman 2010; Cobo et al. 2011). The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (1) Illustrate the basic features of FinTech publications, including the types, annual publications, main research directions by co-occurrence analysis of keywords, and dynamic changes of research focus by timeline analysis; (2) Explore popular countries/regions, institutions, journals, and authors and the collaboration relationship networks, and present the citation and co-citation networks to highlight the influential authors and journals; (3) Furthermore, detect the dynamic changes of cited authors, cited journals and cited references based on burst detection analysis, and more intuitively show the citation process of all FinTech publications based on overlay analysis; (4) With the current special environment, discuss the challenges FinTech faced and future possible development directions. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: “Data and methods” section briefly describes the data and methods used in this paper. “Fundamental characteristics of FinTech publications” section presents the foundation characteristics of all FinTech publications, in terms of types, annual publications, current research directions and themes, co-occurrence, and timeline analysis of author keywords. The top productive countries/regions, institutions, and journals are presented in “Productive object analysis and cooperation relationship analysis” section. Additionally, the cooperation relationship is demonstrated. “Citation structure analysis” section investigates the citation structure, including citation and co-citation of authors and journals, respectively. Meanwhile, a burst detection analysis of cited journals, cited authors, and cited references is conducted. Furthermore, the current challenges and future possible research directions are discussed in “Discussion” section. “Conclusions” section ends this paper with some conclusions.",31
7.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,01 October 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-021-00286-6,Shadow banking: a bibliometric and content analysis,December 2021,Ridoy Deb Nath,Mohammad Ashraful Ferdous Chowdhury,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Shadow banking (SB) has been an essential and largely disputed issue in finance literature for over a decade. Its macroeconomic implications and institutional-level importance have made it a fascinating area of study for researchers and business professionals. After the Global Financial Crisis of 2007–2008 (GFC), scholars, legislators, and business professionals had SB in their sights. Many scholars have argued that the GFC initially sprouted from the SB sector, and that SB was the main culprit in the crisis (Gorton and Metrick 2010; Pozsar et al. 2010; Ashcraft and Adrian 2012; Acharya et al. 2013; Ban and Gabor 2016). The SB sector’s vulnerability was in its financing of risky, long-term, and illiquid assets with short-term borrowings, resulting in a breakdown in the credit market that forced SBs to sell long-term holdings at fire-sale prices (Geithner 2008). However, some studies argue that SBs were not entirely responsible for the sub-prime mortgage crisis during the GFC. Moreover, SBs may be a key to mitigating damages if a liquidity crisis caused by traditional banks arises in the future (e.g., Wallison 2012; Culp 2013; Culp and Neves 2017). There is also evidence that the SB system provides commercial banks with sources for increased loanable funds and assumes some of the risks associated with loan origination (Culp and Neves 2017). As the future of SB and the new financial innovations within the SB sector hangs in the balance, some suggest taming the wild horse, and others suggest letting it roam free. To that point, Wallison (2012) argued that the diverse financial innovation that is SB could be regulated away, leaving us with boring banking. On the other hand, some say that if SB remains unregulated or is regulated differently than the traditional banking sector, it will bring about the next global financial crisis (e.g., Moosa 2017). Clearly, proponents and detractors of SB have much to debate in the literature. Our intention was to capture the diversity of positions and arguments in literature on SB. Accordingly, our main objectives were to examine the structure and development of SB research, explore the major research streams, and summarize the current state of knowledge in the field. Furthermore, we present inconsistencies in prior studies and possible explanations for them. Finally, we identify gaps in the SB literature and address needs for future research. We conducted bibliometric and content analysis on the SB articles we collected. The bibliometric analysis revealed the popular most keywords and the most influential studies, authors, and sources, along with various other aspects of SB research. Our content analysis identified four distinct research streams in SB literature, and we present important arguments from each such stream. That is, we first systematically analyzed the relevant literature retrieved from the Scopus database in our bibliometric analysis, and then, in our content analysis, we reviewed the most necessary and pertinent documents, as identified in the bibliographic analysis. This study contributes to SB literature because few review studies on SB literature exist. This review is unique in that it presents both bibliometric and content analysis of SB research from 2008 to 2021, and it further contributes to the field by identifying seven research questions that should be addressed in future studies on SB. The remainder of the essay advances as follows: in ""An overview of SB"" section, we present a general review and the definitions, evolution, and functions of the SB sector, followed by a description of the study’s ""Methodological approach"" in second section and the ""Bibliometric analysis"" findings in third section. In fifth section, we present ""Content analysis"", describe each of the research streams, and summarize the articles most critical to each stream. Section ""Content analysis"" also features the seven future research questions and a thorough guide to them. Finally, in ""Conclusion"" section, we conclude with thoughts on the SB sector and further research opportunities in the SB literature.",14
7.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,06 September 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-021-00280-y,Implied volatility estimation of bitcoin options and the stylized facts of option pricing,December 2021,Noshaba Zulfiqar,Saqib Gulzar,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The emergence of Bitcoin futures and options contracts as cryptocurrencies develop received considerable attention recently. Options and futures contracts are valuable, sophisticated trading tools widely used by investors in traditional markets for speculation and hedging purposes. Keeping pace with the growing market capitalization of cryptocurrency ($ 183.9 billion)Footnote 1 and overnight popularity, an increasing number of innovative derivative instruments (Bitcoin options, Bitcoin futures, and Bitcoin perpetual) were designed to protect potential investors from defined Bitcoin price risk. This ultimately provides a wide range of return opportunities (Deribit 2020). Moreover, well-designed strategies for cryptocurrency derivative instruments improve cost efficiency for potential investors by replacing more capital-intensive strategies (Bitcoin-News 2019). Therefore, taking advantage of the host of opportunities from crypto-market volatility, especially Bitcoin market volatility, the trading of Bitcoin options, futures, and perpetual contracts marks the beginning of a new era. Bitcoin options are in a nascent stage of development and traded on a handful of Bitcoin futures and options exchanges (Deribit,Footnote 2 LedgerX,Footnote 3 IQ options,Footnote 4 Quedex,Footnote 5 Bitmex,Footnote 6 Bakkt,Footnote 7 and OKEXFootnote 8 internationally to trade Bitcoin futures and options contracts. The recent announcement of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) group to launch Bitcoin options on Bitcoin futures contracts in the first quarter of 2020 could be seen as a way to help institutions and professional traders in a regulated exchange environment manages spot market Bitcoin exposure, as well as hedge Bitcoin futures (CoinDesk 2019; CME-Group 2020). In this context, Bitcoin options contracts are of immense importance and are now widely adopted and acknowledged by option practitioners, cryptocurrency traders, and policymakers as an effective tool to leverage assets or control portfolio risk by strategically hedging some portion of the risk.Footnote 9 Option valuation plays a fundamental role in managing portfolio returns. It provides a basis for a forecast that assists in rigorous decision making in portfolio management (Pagnottoni 2019). This is particularly true when dealing with the most volatile and immature markets, especially the Bitcoin market. The most popular and widely accepted Black–Scholes option pricing model (Black and Scholes 1973) to determine the fair price of an option (Rebonato 2004; Mayhew 1995) is studied extensively. Options studies are not limited to stock and bonds options; an extraordinarily broad and deep body of the options literature also examines currency options, commodity options, and even interest rate options (Mayhew 1995). The volatility smile, implied volatility surface, and volatilities implied by the option prices are the key phenomena or the stylized facts studied for almost all financial markets globally in the context of option pricing (Jackwerth and Rubinstein 1996; Dupire 1994; Rubinstein 1994; Derman and Kani 1994b; Dupire 1992). Hence, the existence and verification of these phenomena in the option pricing literature motivated us to determine whether we observe the same stylized facts in the most actively traded, and highly volatile, cryptocurrency derivatives market, that is, the Bitcoin options market. Therefore, Bitcoin options could be considered as important as stock, bond, commodity, currency, or interest rate options. To the best of our knowledge, the study of the stylized facts of option pricing for the newly developing Bitcoin options has not yet been addressed. Besides being an area of intense interest, the results of this study would be helpful in defining the appropriate asset class (equity, currency, commodity, etc.) for Bitcoin. The implied volatilities of Bitcoin options carry important information that is crucial for decision-making process in portfolio management. The closed-form approximations, forecasting ability, and information content of implied volatility is a topic of great interest for option practitioners and academicians. Moreover, producing an accurate and reliable implied volatility forecast is central to derivatives market research, which will be true for the Bitcoin derivatives markets as well. There is an observed absence of root-finding forecasting techniques in the financial literature for estimating implied volatility (Chance et al. 2016). This gap motivated us to estimate the implied volatility of Bitcoin options using root-finding iterative techniques, specifically the Newton Raphson method (NRM)and Bisection method (BM). Notably, this is the first use of numerical approximation techniques to estimate implied volatility for the cryptocurrency derivatives market, to the best of our knowledge. The data sets for the study emphasize short-dated Bitcoin options (14-day maturity), traded on Deribit Bitcoin Futures and Options Exchange, a Netherlands-based cryptocurrency derivative exchange. To address the issues of generalizability, which requires that we account for the prevailing macroeconomic market conditions, we analyze two different periods: Bitcoin options traded from September 28 2019 to October 11 2019 (dataset-I) and from March 7 2020 to March 20 2020 (dataset-II). To summarize, we lack a complete understanding of the stylized facts of option pricing (volatility smile and implied volatilities implied by options prices) for Bitcoin options. This study contributes to the cryptocurrency literature and option pricing literature in two ways: (1) we verify the existence of widely accepted volatility smile in Bitcoin options and (2) we estimate the implied volatility of Bitcoin options using the Newton Raphson and Bisection numerical approximation techniques. The results strongly suggest that Bitcoin options belong to the commodity class of assets based on the presence of the volatility forward skew in Bitcoin options data. We employed Black–Scholes implied volatility (\(\sigma _{BMIV}\)) as a benchmark for the accuracy analysis (Ewing 2010; Poon and Granger 2003; Isengildina et al. 2007; Li 2005). It is calculated from the pricing error equation \(c(\sigma )-c_M=0\); by putting each observable variable into the Black–Scholes option pricing formula and iteratively finding the implied volatility value \((\sigma _{BMIV})\) that satisfies the zero difference between the predicted call premium \(c(\sigma )\) and the actual call premium \(c_M\). The results show that the newton Raphson and Bisection numerical estimation techniques are effective in estimating the implied volatility of Bitcoin options. However, the Newton Raphson forecasting technique converges faster than does the Bisection method for the at-the-money and out-of-money scenarios. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the literature on Bitcoin and the estimation techniques to calculate implied volatility. Section 3 presents the research methodology along with the pseudo code of the Newton Raphson method and Bisection method. Section 4 defines the data specifications. Section 5 outlines the stylized facts of option pricing for Bitcoin options. Section 6 describes the implied volatility estimation of Bitcoin options and the pseudo code for the benchmark Black–Scholes implied volatility calculations. Section 7 concludes.",6

Evidence from a two-stage data envelopment analysis,December 2021,Mohamed Mehdi Jelassi,Ezzeddine Delhoumi,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The banking sector in Tunisia has long been considered a cornerstone of the country’s development process. It has acted as the principal financial intermediary by reallocating collected funds to meet investment and consumption demands. From 1995 to 2017, deposit money banks provided, on average, 81% of all domestic credits demanded by the private sector. In particular, from 2011 to 2017, the domestic credit provided by banks to the private sector has been steadily increasing, representing, on average, 63% of Tunisia’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and reaching as high as 69% of GDP in 2017. Despite such a crucial role played by banks to channel funds to the economy, the government did not cease from calling on banks to improve their efficiency. In fact, banking efficiency was recognized as the main actor in the overall financial development of any emerging economy (Andersen and Tarp 2003; Chan and Karim 2010). Starting from the 1990s, Tunisia’s willingness to integrate into the world economy urged the government to launch several economic and financial reform programs. Vast restructuring programs revolving around the deregulation and modernization of the banking sector were initiated as a key pillar to the government’s development plan. The Tunisian government’s unceasing efforts to amend banking operational efficiency can be deduced from the various regulations instituted over the last three decades. In fact, three main influential interventions by the Tunisian central bank, which undoubtedly shaped the technical efficiency of Tunisian banks, can be distinguished. The first is circular No. 91-24, issued in 1991 regarding credit classification and provisioning. Second, the promulgation of law No. 2001-65 in 2001, listing and defining the banking operations of credit institutions and reinforcing it in 2006 by circular No. 2006-06, implementing an internal conformity system. Third, releasing circular No. 2011-06 in 2011 to reinforce the rules of good governance within credit institutions. Hence, banks were continuously exhorted to establish a healthy and prudent management by keeping track of their own performance and working on improving their managerial operations. However, how efficiently were banks actually operating in Tunisia? Did their technical efficiency improve over time in accordance with the central authority’s objectives? Were private banks more technically efficient than their public counterparts? Did the recent ongoing changes in the political system affect bank efficiency? What are the main determinants of the banks’ technical efficiency? Such questions are worth studying not only for Tunisia but for any country. In particular, as noted by Berger and Humphrey (1997), investigating banking efficiency can bring about many insights to decisionmakers and policymakers. Not only can the evolution of technical efficiency detect the impact of reforms on bank’s organizational performance, but the determinants of technical efficiency can also help in designing banking regulations to enhance banking performance. Numerous studies employ the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) technique, and a second stage regression to explain the technical efficiency of banks in some emerging economies. Among such studies are Sufian (2009) and Saha et al. (2015) for Malaysia, Sufian and Habibullah (2010) for Thailand, Ben Naceur et al. (2011) for the Middle East and North African (MENA) countries (including Tunisia), Ayadi (2014) for Tunisia, Repkova (2015) for the Czech Republic, Tan (2016) for China, Shazida Jan et al. (2017) for various Southeast Asian countries, Batir et al. (2017) for Turkey, Tadesse (2017) for Ethiopia, Banya and Biekpe (2018) for ten African countries including Tunisia, Banna et al. (2019) for East Asian countries, and Jiménez-Hernández et al. (2019) for Latin American countries. The determinants considered in these studies differed according to the study’s purpose, and the findings varied from one country to another. Most of the studies employed an input-oriented approach to estimate technical efficiency, claiming that bank managers tend to control inputs more than outputs. Nevertheless, managers are more likely to be confronted with the objective of minimizing the quantity of resources used and asked to produce the maximum outputs possible. In order to allow for such practical considerations and further examine the robustness of the estimated efficiency scores, the present study estimates technical efficiency according to both the input-oriented and Range Adjusted Measure (RAM) approaches. In the case of Tunisia, since banks are far from realizing economies of scale (World Bank 2014b), estimates for technical efficiency are obtained under the assumption of variable returns to scale (VRS). In addition to the fact that the Tunisian case has not been studied extensively, we provide an analysis for the largest time period ever examined in the literature. Our sample period spans 23 years, from 1995 to 2017. First, since our sample covers a relatively long period, both the amounts of inputs and outputs could be adjusted by managers, justifying the RAM approach. Second, substantial technical progress in the banking industry has certainly occurred overall: to address this problem, time is included as an explanatory variable in the second stage regression of technical efficiency, along with other explanatory variables. During the sample period, Tunisia also experienced the 2011 social uprising which led to the ending of an authoritarian regime and the implementation of a democratic one. Thus, the effect of the 2011 revolution on the technical efficiency of Tunisian banks, as well as their ownership structure, was also analyzed. This paper proceeds as follows: the following section introduces Tunisia and its need for an efficient banking sector. Section Literature review presents the literature review on the determinants of technical efficiency of banks in some emerging economies. Section Methodology and data provides the methodologies and data used to estimate the technical efficiency of Tunisian banks. Section Results and discussion presents the results and discussion and Sect. Conclusions concludes.",5

S. Wei,N. Anuradha,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"A futures contract is an agreement between two parties to transfer ownership of an underlying asset at a fixed time in the future. It is a standardized contract, so the trade takes place through an exchange. The underlying quantity is physical gold in the case of a gold futures contract. This type of financial contract acts as an insurance to the investor as it allows them to benefit from favorable price movements and acts as a hedge against systemic financial risk (Kou et al. 2019) during unfavorable future price movements (Choudhry et al. 2015; Iqbal 2017). There is evidence that metals play an important role in diversifying risk (Beckmann et al. 2015; Lean and Wong 2015; Daskalaki et al. 2017; Alkhazali and Zoubi 2020). Forecasting futures prices is an integral component of a profitable futures trading strategy. In this respect, this paper uses one of the most popular methods for forecasting and econometric analysis, namely, ARIMA models (Box and Jenkins 1970; Al-Shaib 2006; Box et al. 2016; Guha and Bandyopadhyay 2016; Challa et al. 2018; Mallikarjuna and Rao 2019; Challa et al. 2020; Dong et al. 2020). The effects of seasonality are prevalent in the gold market (Ball et al. 1982; Ma 1986; Lucey and Tully 2006; Wang et al. 2019; Xiao and Maillebuau 2020) and are attributed to the Halloween effect (Bouman and Jacobsen 2002; Zhang and Jacobsen 2013; Pariyaprasert and Boonchuaymetta 2018; Schmidbauer and Rosch 2018), the calendar effect (Jain 2019), the festival season in India (Source: World Gold Council report), hours of daylight (Kamstra et al. 2003), and the autumn effect (Baur 2013). Behavioural issues such as investor sentiment play an important role in gold prices (Aggarwal and Lucey 2007). Investment in gold has always been of great sentimental value to Indians due to cultural relevance and its objectification as a secure financial investment. Consequently, India ranks second largest in private gold holdings (Source: NITI Aayog report). The position of a major consumer is strengthened when the domestic economic need is linked with the international market for efficient price discovery and risk management. The presence of an established spot market provides members in the Indian value chain an opportunity to offset price risk through the futures market. The gold futures market allows investors to take positions by paying small initial margins, yielding higher returns, and the difference can be invested in risk-free government bonds. This additional incentive to invest in returns with zero risk, is possible when holding a portfolio containing the gold futures contract, unlike with equity investments and gold Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs). The role of gold as a stabilizing force in the financial system during market shocks (Baur and McDermott 2010, 2016) highlights the need to investigate the volatility properties of the asset. Understanding and explaining the behavior of commodity volatility is imperative as it is useful in designing optimal hedging strategies for derivatives such as futures and options (French et al. 1987; Chou 1988; Kocaarslan et al. 2017; Shakil et al. 2018; Mo et al. 2018). Analyzing the residuals after fitting an ARIMA model may suggest the need for volatility models (Ping et al. 2013; Todorova 2017) and volatility forecasting to aid investment decisions (Samouilhan and Shannon 2008; Thupayagale 2010; Kumar 2014; Mukherjee and Goswami 2017; Emenogu et al. 2020). In India, trading in gold futures began in 2003 and the derivative contract was initially listed in the Multi Commodity Exchange of India (MCX) and launched under the commodity derivatives segment in the National Stock Exchange (NSE) and Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in 2018. Therefore, MCX accounts for 95% of the trade. The spot price on the MCX for the gold contracts is arrived at from polling a panel of representatives from the value chain of the physical market, with ex-polling conducted twice in a day (12.15 pm to 12.45 pm and 4.00 pm to 4.30 pm). The price is ex-Ahmedabad, which is based on the location of delivery, and on the lower tax structure, although the latter has become irrelevant after the imposition of the Goods and Service Tax (GST) in 2017. The price excludes GST and any other additional tax. The trade volumes in gold futures fell to half and have remained stagnant in the last five years. This is due to the imposition of the Commodities Transaction Tax (CTT) of 0.01% in the 2013–2014 Union Budget. While the imposition of a transaction tax on the commodities futures market reduces speculative trading, it may not be able to reduce price volatility in futures or spot markets (Edwards 1993). In the Indian context, it is observed that the transaction tax will be a burden on the operators in the commodity market and act as a deterrent of entry to hedgers who may choose to shift to illegal platforms (Pavaskar and Ghosh 2008). The liquidity in the Indian commodity derivatives market started recovering in the first half of 2018–2019 from a steady decline during 2015–2018. A report published in the last quarter of FY 2019–2020 showed that returns from Indian gold funds were up 27% in the last one year, and up 11.93% in the last three years (Source: The Economic Times) This evidence suggests that investment in Indian gold investment products is a good portfolio diversification option and investment analysts and fund managers may be tempted to allocate more than the prudential 10%. Therefore, our study is aimed to assist fund managers by modelling the volatility using time series forecasting models used in the estimation of Value at Risk (VaR), which is a measure of risk of loss for investments. From the above introduction about the Indian gold market, we see the importance of finding suitable methods of analyzing this time series and the impact of seasonality, intervention, volatility, and forecasting. Thus, Sect. 2 will introduce seasonal time series models, an intervention test, and methods for describing non-constant variances. Section 3 discusses forecast performance of different time series methods, and Sect. 4 provides concluding remarks.",1

Vukovic,Carlos J. Rincon,Moinak Maiti,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"Over the last decade, scholars have become increasingly interested in the field of price distortions and municipal bonds premiums. Except for taxation reasons (fiscal policies and distortions), which are mostly analyzed in the studies of Ang et al. (2010), Babina et al. (2015), and Landoni (2018), the focus of the studies are also on default premium (Wang at el. 2008; Schwert 2017; Vukovic et al. 2020a, b, 2021a, b) and liquidity premium (Longstaff 2011; Jiang 2019; Li and Schürhoff 2019). Price distortions, by definition, describe significant gaps between mark-to-market prices and a plausible range of economic values of certain assets. Like information inefficiency, price distortions draw mispricing of financial assets relative to their fundamental value. This phenomenon is especially pronounced in conditions caused by shocks (crisis events), affecting banks (Kou et al. 2021b), companies (Kou et al. 2021a; Maiti et al. 2020), markets (Grubisic et al. 2011; Wen et al. 2019) and almost all other stakeholders whose agents (or groups of agents, in Zha et al. 2020) have decision-making challenges. Herewith fiscal policy and risks arising from sudden events, price distortions, and municipal bonds premiums are also affected by the monetary policy and exchange rate changes. On January 15th, 2015 the Swiss National Bank (SNB) suddenly announced that it would no longer hold the Swiss franc (CHF) at a fixed exchange rate with the euro (EUR) (Swiss National Bank 2015). As a result, the Swiss franc soared, from a 0.8325 CHF per one EUR as of closing on Tuesday, January 14th, to 1.0014 CHF/EUR (source EIKON Refinitiv platform, Fig. 1) on Thursday, January 16th, for an immediate appreciation of 20% in one day. While the Swiss stock market collapsed, many mutual and hedge funds around the world realized large losses, and the 10-year Swiss treasury yield dropped some 251 bps in the same couple of days. Source: EIKON Reuters Swiss Franc/Euro FX Cross Rate. This figure presents the Swiss franc to euro currency exchange price time series. In it, two price shocks can be identified, one in early August 2011 and another one on January 15th, 2015. It is clear to say that the second one was a rather sharper price shock. The SNB started to peg its currency to the euro in 2011, in the middle of the European sovereign crisis. The Swiss franc is a safe asset for global investors, who buy it when there is a global risk. Likewise, investors believe that the Swiss government is one of the safest for investments, globally, and their money is safe in their hands. This preference led to the raised price of the Swiss franc when the aforementioned crisis caused financial damages in Europe. A higher franc value hurts Switzerland though, as their economy is heavily dependent on selling their production abroad, that is, exports of goods and services are worth around 70% of GDP (Swiss National Bank 2015). As a way to bring down the franc’s value, the SNB created new francs and bought euros with them, in a very active intervention in this market for the next few years. The increase in the supply of francs in the foreign exchange markets caused the franc’s price to fall as low as 0.7946 against the euro, in May of 2013 and never fluctuating above 0.833, which reflects a price reached in June of 2012 (Swiss National Bank 2015). By 2014, the SNB, with this policy, had accumulated more than 500 billion dollars in foreign currency (Lleo and Ziemba 2015), equivalent to about 70% of Swiss GDP. Finally, the SNB suddenly ceased to intervene in the foreign exchange market on January 15th, 2015, for a few reasons. First, the Swiss feared that the printing of so many francs would eventually lead to hyperinflation. Second, there were expectations that the European Central Bank would introduce a quantitative easing package that would result in the creation of money to buy the government debt securities of euro-zone countries, and thus may push down the price of the euro, requiring the SNB to print even more francs to maintain a ceiling of its price. Third, during 2014, the euro depreciated against other major currencies, meaning that the franc, while pegged to the euro, had depreciated against those currencies too. As the US economy recovered from the great recession, the franc depreciated around 13% against the dollar, deteriorating the Swiss exports to the US and other countries. Therefore, if the Swiss franc was not so competitive anymore, then the SNB had no reason to continue keeping it weak (The Economist 2015). Freeing up a low enough Swiss franc, and having no-threat of a possible re-intervention, made foreign investors heavily purchase the Swiss treasury securities with them. Figure 2 shows that although the Swiss treasury yields were in an already downward trend since 2011, the trend strengthened with the dis-intervention in the franc rates. For instance, the (at the time) 10-year Swiss treasury bonds were trading at 1.123% yield in the spring of 2011, dropping to a low of − 0.571 on January 14th, 2015, right before the event, for a drop of more than 550 bps in 4 years; while the 10-year Swiss treasury bonds were trading at − 0.182% yield, at the time, on January 14th, 2015, dropping to a low of − 0.733 on Friday, January 23rd, 2015, for a drop of the same 550 bps, in a matter of just a week and a half. Source: EIKON Reuters CHGV Apr-2021 and Jul-2025. This figure presents the 10-year Swiss government bond yields time series. While the trend in the 2021 maturity treasuries shows decreasing yields from 2021 until early 2015, the opposite happens on the 2025 maturity treasury yield trend for the period after the currency price shock. The Swiss treasury yields, and their municipal bond yields dropped dramatically after the currency shock. As with the safety of their treasuries, the Swiss municipalities’ debt securities offer investors a safe haven when risks appear. Should a Swiss municipality fail to meet its financial obligations, the Swiss government would back them as a last resort guarantor. Most Swiss municipal bonds had the same downward trend since 2011 as the treasuries, and one expected that the trend would strengthen with the dis-intervention in the franc rates (Eikon Refinitiv platform 2020). The rational investor would have expected the yield spread to the treasury's benchmark of these municipalities to remain the same or even to narrow. In Fig. 3, it can be seen that the benchmark spread of the 10-year Zurich municipal bonds, at the time, accounted for an average of about 40 bps during 2011–2012, narrowing below 20 bps on January 14th, 2015, right before the event. Meanwhile, the 10-year Zurich municipal bonds at the time were trading at a benchmark spread of 21 bps on January 14th, 2015. This led to the widening of up to about 60 bps by the end of 2015, a spread even wider than that in 2011 (EIKON Refinitiv platform, Fig. 3). Source: EIKON Reuters ZURICH Apr-2021 and Feb-2025 Benchmark Spreads. This figure displays the 10-year Zurich municipal bond yield spreads series. While the trend in the 2021 maturity municipals shows decreasing spreads from 2011 until early 2015, the opposite happens on both the 2021 and 2025 spreads for the period after the currency price shock. Price distortions describe significant gaps between mark-to-market prices and a plausible range of economic values of certain assets. Like information inefficiency, price distortions draw the mispricing of financial assets relative to their fundamental value. In the context of this study, we identify that the SNB’s constant intervention in the Swiss franc rates for the 2011–2015 period led to its currency value, to the euro, being priced at levels significantly different from its fundamental values. Proof of this identification is provided in this research with a structural break test in the currency series that followed the January 15th, 2015 currency dis-intervention, when the then freed currency prices drastically initiated a search toward its fundamental values. In our study, we analyze municipal bonds premiums rather than government bonds premiums. Some studies claim that both premiums are affected by similar events and factors, especially in the 4 weeks after they were initiated. For example, Knezevic et al. (2021) claim that in the case of the event study concerning sudden decrease in the government bond yield primarily increases the municipal bond yield spread. However, this event will be offset after 4 weeks due to the municipal bond yield spread being lower than it was in the beginning. In the context of this paper, we identify that the SNB’s constant intervention in the Swiss franc rates for the 2011–2015 period led to its currency value, to the euro, being priced at levels significantly different from its fundamental values. The aim of this study is to identify the effects of currency price distortions on the municipal bond spread in Switzerland. The objective of this research is specifically aimed at determining whether the spread has indeed widened after the currency shock and if so, to determine the percentage of change in the premiums after the currency shock. In this paper, the dis-intervention in the Swiss franc rates of 2015 will be used as a quasi-natural experiment, to explore whether a “no government intervention” in the foreign exchange markets policy may have impacted the spreads and changed the default, liquidity, and/or maturity premiums of municipal bonds in Switzerland. This study uses the daily trading settlement data of municipal bonds in the Swiss inter-bank bond market as samples from January 2012 to January 2018 (three years before and three years after the currency shock). The study uses a two-stage least squares method to derive its conclusions. More details of the model have been provided in the data and methodology section. The following questions are addressed: Does a raise in the local currency prices contribute to a widening of the municipal bond spreads? Do changes in the currency price levels make a long-run impact on the municipal bond spreads? We used an instrumental variable approach in our study to answer these questions. The following should be noted in respect to the current practical knowledge: firstly, our results may have policy implications. For example, since they may imply that if policymakers wish to reduce the relative cost of financing for state and local government investments, all efforts to reduce transaction costs and improve liquidity will have no significant impact on borrowing costs, and all efforts to lower default risks by municipalities would be wasted. Secondly, this area is insufficiently researched (especially in the case of municipal bonds with price distortions), and any additional study represents a contribution to literature and current theoretical knowledge. In the remainder of this paper (after the 1st section), we review different arguments concerning the effects of price distortions on municipal bond spreads. The second section discusses and reviews the literature on such effects, including studies with the issues of default premiums, liquidity premiums, and foreign exchange premiums. As part of this section, we also focus on applied mythology in similar studies. The third section explains the applied methodology with the cross-sectional instrumental variables model and the instrumental variables with the panel data model. The results are reported in section four, and the discussion and implications are presented in section five. Section six contains the conclusion.",1

Lending marketplaces, also referred to as peer-to-peer (or P2P) lending, have become abundant by gaining huge market shares in consumer and small business loans over the last decade. P2P platforms are designed as a two-sided marketplace that, through leveraging innovative technologies, enables investors to lend to borrowers directly and provide broad benefits in cost and speed investment decisions. However, some suspect that the reliability of the P2P lending market has decreased over the last few years.Footnote 2 In 2016, the Department of Justice (DOJ)Footnote 3 and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) accused LendingClub of false statements to financial institutions, wire fraud, and covered conduct. Renaud Laplanche was removed as CEO of the company by the board of directors. All the fraudulent activities were aimed at increasing LendingClub’s volume of loan originations by approving borrowers who did not satisfy the Credit Policy.Footnote 4 Lending platforms have generated internal risk rating models to gauge the riskiness of underlying applicants by using sophisticated algorithms and also by relying on self-reported borrower information (e.g., annual income and employment length). With such models, lending platforms prescreen loans, list some on their websites, and allocate applications into respective risk baskets. However, traditional concerns related to the burden of information asymmetries are intensified in the unsecured online market, as economic agents have no face-face contact. Some borrowers may have incentives to alter the submitted data by inflating asset information (Lucas 1976; Jagtiani and Lemieux 2018). However, the P2P lending platform acts without skin in the game, and lenders bear the credit risk. Borrowers could be encouraged to boost loan volumes by increasing their remuneration. This work aims to analyze players’ incentives in the growing crowdfunding market. Specifically, this is a pioneering attempt to investigate how the platforms’ incentives shape their behavior, leading them to act as dishonest brokers and not identify misleading borrowers. Therefore, this work measures the platform misconduct through two proxies. The first one is the Prudence index, created to capture the borrower screening quality on the platform. The second proxy lies in the internal verification process to identify whether a lack of checking the information reported by borrowers (annual income and employment length) could hamper lenders in their collections’ performance. The goal is achieved in two steps. To start, I construct a new index that attempts to capture the degree of prudence by the platform at the loan origination. The new index is built through the computation between the FICO score (e.g., the external rating provided from Credit Agencies Bureau) and LendingClub (LC afterward), taking the following values: 1 (low prudence, as if LC has been underestimating borrower riskiness), 2 (neutral level, the assessment of borrower riskiness is the same in both models) and 3 (high prudence, as if LC has been overestimating borrower riskiness). The Generalized Ordered Logistic (Gologit) regression is implemented because of the response variable’s features. The ratios of false statements, adopted in the financial literature of borrowers’ misreporting, are used as the main predictors of the prudence index. Following Garmaise (2015), I use the ratio of rounded reported income and loan amount. The relationship between rounded self-reported value and the delinquency rate is well documented in previous works (Eid et al. 2016; Pursiainen 2020; Talavera and Xu 2018).  Polena and Regner (2018)  find that more words in the loan purpose description are associated with less creditworthy borrowers and higher default rates. Based on this work, I construct a third indicator that measures the number of words provided by the borrower in the description of loan purpose. A fourth indicator finds that the borrower inflates the length of employment to access better credit-line conditions. The empirical analysis shows that borrowers with ten years of employment are associated with a higher delinquency rate. The platform’s screening quality has been decreasing over the previous years, suggesting the implementation of more aggressive underwriting to recover lost volumes. Regression results confirm that all misreporting variables negatively impact the response variable, implying that the Fintech platform does not adjust the credit grade based on the potential borrowers’ false statements. In the second step, to evaluate whether the missing platforms’ verification process may harm lenders by not granting them minimal coverage in the case of borrowers’ default, I investigate the determinants of recovery rate (RR) on non-performing loans in P2P loans. I introduce the RR modeling of defaulted loans in the P2P lending market by using a mixed continuous-discrete model already established and applied in other studies in the mortgaged market (Chawla et al. 2016; Tanoue et al. 2017). Using a novel loan-level dataset from LendingClub between July 2007 and September 2018, I test the RR’s principal determinants on defaulted loans. Because RR distribution presents a higher concentration at a zero value, I apply a mixed continuous-discrete model based on the work byCalabrese (2014).Footnote 5 The regression results show that loan amount and the interest rate are positive determinants of the RR; unverified loans, rating volatility, and the number of borrower delinquencies negatively impact the RR. I test the robustness of the results by implementing the regressions within each risk class, leading to similar conclusions. The relationship between unverified loans and the RR is significantly negative. Therefore, if the P2P platform had enacted the verification process on information self-reported by borrowers, the RR and the loss given default would be higher and lower, respectively, resulting in better lenders’ collection performance. As a robustness check, I regress the variable verification process on the probability of default in an unreported analysis. The results confirm a positive relationship between the verification process and the borrowers’ default. However, to first address potential endogeneity by correcting for omitted variables, I have rerun the regression analysis by including the rating grade as a predictor. The positive relationship between the verification process and the probability of default is still held, as shown in Table 12. I split the initial sample by rating classes to further strengthen the results, proceeding with regressions for the three loan risk classes (e.g., A-B, C-D, and E-F-G). The positive relationship between the verification process and the probability of default is still confirmed in all risk classes, as shown in Table 13. This finding suggests that the verification process of borrowers’ self-reported information should be improved. Thus, this result may identify some negligent and opportunistic behavior of the online lending platform. This study contributes to the literature in several ways. First, the paper contributes to the burgeoning literature on the P2P lending market, filling a literature gap by examining the trade-off between maximizing profits and inferring borrowers’ quality in a completely unbiased manner. Thus far, the literature on the online lending market has mainly focused on how borrower’ soft and hard information affects the likelihood of default (Emekter et al. 2015; Carmichael 2014; Lu et al. 2012; Serrano-Cinca et al. 2015; Polena and Regner 2018) and the roles of alternative data and machine learning in improving access to credit and screening quality (Berg et al. 2018; Balyuk and Davydenko 2019; Duarte et al. 2012; Everett 2015; Freedman and Jin 2017; Hertzberg et al. 2018; Jagtiani and Lemieux 2018; Pope and Sydnor 2011; Shen et al.  2021). To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to investigate how the Fintech platform could affect loan screening by inflating the borrower’s quality. Iyer et al. (2016) and Vallée and Zeng (2019) study how peer lenders can predict an individual’s likelihood of defaulting on a loan with greater accuracy than the borrower credit score, showing that sophisticated investors screen loans differently. Second, this work adds to the extensive stream of research on the financial and accounting misconduct that encompasses the relationship between CEO equity incentives and false statement (Bergstresser and Philippon 2006; Burns and Kedia 2006; Cheng and Warfield 2005; Efendi et al. 2007; Jensen and Meckling 1976; Efendi et al. 2007). It is also linked to this stream of research because similar to how CEOs could have personal incentives to falsify corporate balance sheets, the P2P lending platform could underestimate the borrowers’ credit risk to increase their remunerations by not adopting due diligence (Cumming et al. 2019). Third, the study integrates the literature on borrower misreporting in the mortgage market that finds a strong association between borrower’ misreporting and adverse loan outcomes (Agarwal and Ben-David 2014; Garmaise 2015; Griffin and Maturana 2015; Jiang et al. 2014; Piskorski et al. 2015). Also, this study is linked to works by Oleksandr and Xu (2018) based on loan verification and Pursainen (2020) that show that the LendingClub platform does not adjust the pricing on loans for misreporting borrowers. Finally, this paper contributes significantly to the growing literature on the estimation of the loss given default (LGD) and RR in the unsecured market (Calabrese 2014; Gourieroux and Lu 2019; Ye and Bellotti 2019; Siao et al. 2016; Zhou et al. 2018), advising lenders to focus on additional credit risk measures to accurately assess borrower creditworthy. In marketplace lending, the information asymmetries between borrowers and lenders lead to higher default rates and large LGD. Additionally, this study provides valuable insights to policymakers by highlighting critical factors that could lead to financial stability concerns due to the drying up of funding due to consumers’ loss of confidence. The paper also gives novel practical insights for lending platforms that might represent a concrete solution to credit rationing. Through its results, this study provides suggestions for lending platforms to improve the loan verification process to detect misreporting information by some borrowers and to strengthen their internal corporate governance, for instance, through the adoption of measures aimed to punish false statements by some applicants. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Related literature is reviewed in second section. Summary statistics are reported in third section. The empirical methodologies on the RR and prudence index are in fourth and fifth sections, respectively. Sixth section concludes the manuscript.",6
7.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,08 July 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-021-00268-8,Impact of learning through credit and value creation on the efficiency of Japanese commercial banks,December 2021,Joseph Jr. Aduba,Hiroshi Izawa,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that bank experience could contribute to improved bank performance. For example, bank experience has been found to significantly improve performance when: competition triggered learning (Barnett et al. 1994), merger-acquisition triggered knowledge integration and codification, thereby reducing bank failure rates (Zollo and Singh 2004), and survival-enhancing learning resulting from both success and failure experience potentially improved camel ratings (Kim et al. 2009). Recently, a study by Bush (2015) found that bank operating experience could create a mechanism that reduces the cost of producing financial services and improves the efficiency of the banking sector. The rationale is that bank production [intermediation] experience resulting from the sustained effort in value addition and asset transformation processes create knowledge that lowers the cost of producing financial services and ultimately improves bank performance [efficiency]. As a financial intermediary, banks create specialized commodities, such as loans and other asset portfolios, using labor and capital goods, and sell them at a price that is expected to cover the direct cost of production, including the opportunity cost (Benston and Smith 1976). The process of creating these specialized financial commodities may include risk management (Berger and Humphrey 1992), service/utility provision (Grigorian and Manole 2006), and value addition (Drake et al. 2006). These processes involve extensive documentation, information gathering, monitoring, and other inputs that incur substantial costs. Rational banks minimize these input costs and realize cost efficiency. Cost efficiency in the banking sector is sometimes associated with scale economies or bank size (Asongu and Odhiambo 2019; Berger and Mester 1997; Bossone and Lee 2004; Clark 1984). However, organizational learning literature suggests that cost efficiency could also be associated with production experience (Argote 2012). Moreover, economies of learning (experience) differ from economies of scale in that the former explains cost efficiency in relation to accumulated knowledge in human capital or technology, whereas, the latter links cost efficiency to large scale production at a point in time (Besanko et al. 2013). In the context of loan production, for example, the efficiency gains from experience could cause a decline in the amount of monitoring labor (cost) required for the same volume of loans as the bank recognizes what information is crucial and sufficient for efficient monitoring, or as more effective screening technologies and characteristics of the applicant population are learned over time (Bush 2015). Additionally, to the extent that financial firms can capture knowledge gained from experience, changing processes, and organizational structure, policymakers would not want these experienced firms to disappear as this could lead to loss of information capital (i.e. information on existing borrowers), which has been adequately captured in these financial firms (Bush 2015). The foregoing describes learning-by-doing, which is defined as a mechanism that reduces the costs of production by leveraging on the experience gained in the production process. This phenomenon has been quantified using the learning curve theory. The learning curve theory suggests that unit cost decreases with cumulative experience (output) at a uniform rate called the learning rate. The learning curve, which is designed to explain efficiency in the manufacturing process, has found limited application in the financial sector (banking sector). Applying the learning curve to banks poses a challenge because outputs in banks are either micro products (Clark 1984) and/or a multiproduct (Mörttinen 2005). Empirical banking literature suggests that the choice of bank outputs largely depends on the study objective. In this study, we theorized that the process of creating credit/investment (converting deposit to loans and securities), creating value (generating economic returns such as shareholder returns and gross value added), and managing risk in banks generate knowledge that may reduce the amount (cost) of inputs, labor, physical capital, and financial capital used. A policy question is whether bank experience accounts for cost efficiency in bank productions. More specifically, whether bank experience have significant impact on the efficiency of credit and value creation. The answer might improve our understanding of organizational learning in the banking sector, and more importantly, the role of bank intermediary experience in cost efficiency gain in banks. Motivated by the above question, we investigate the efficiency gains that might result from learning-by-doing in banks using a sample of Japanese commercial banks. Footnote 1 This study has two main contributions; first, we introduce a cost function adjusted to capture learning in bank production, while considering bank-specific features. Second, and arguably the most significant contribution, we test for bank experience in credit creation, proxied by the total amount of loans and other interest-bearing investment, and value creation, proxied by economic value added (EVA) and gross value added (GVA). These proxies capture the fundamental roles of the banking sector and, in our opinion, should provide empirical outcome that is useful to both bank managers and policymakers. Our findings show that bank intermediary experience significantly accounts for cost efficiency gain in loan production, security investment, and gross value added (GVA). However, bank intermediary experience does not have significant effect on the efficiency of shareholder returns (EVA). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Second section reviews relevant literature on the measurement of productivity using the learning curve theory. Third section presents the empirical approach and the data. Fourth section presents the empirical results and discussion. Final section presents the implication of the findings, recommendation, conclusion, caveat, and future research directions.",4

7.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,05 July 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-021-00270-0,Signals in equity-based crowdfunding and risk of failure,December 2021,Felix Reichenbach,Martin Walther,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"In recent years, the importance of crowdfunding has increased significantly. In particular, the brokerage for equity-like forms of financing to startups via Internet-based crowdfunding platforms has showed strong growth (Pichler and Tezza 2016). Consequently, the interest in the research on this topic has grown (Block et al. 2018b, 2020). Extensive research has thus been conducted on the signals provided during crowdfunding campaigns that influence investors’ investment behavior (Vismara 2018b). However, since Internet-based crowdfunding is a relatively new phenomenon, only a few studies have been conducted on venture performance after the completion of the crowdfunding campaign (Cumming et al. 2019; Hornuf et al. 2018; Signori and Vismara 2016, 2018). Such studies are important because they can clarify whether the signals used by investors actually offer valuable information on the future success of the financed ventures. Our study attempts to address this research gap on signal validity by examining whether the signals provided during the crowdfunding campaign, which have an impact on offering success, also correlate with the subsequent failure risk. It differs from other studies that have investigated factors influencing the post-offering performance of startups by explicitly focusing on previously identified signals in the equity-based crowdfunding literature on offering success. In other words, our study examines whether the signals used by crowd investors actually increase their financial success. Thus, our study also examines the rationality and wisdom of the crowd. We use a hand-collected data set from Companisto, one of the leading German crowdfunding platforms with a market share of more than 20% in 2018 (Crowdfunding.de 2018). Our data set contains data about over 64,000 investments and 742 updates. We collect data on potential venture insolvencies until October 2020. During the period considered, Companisto offered lending-based and equity-based crowdfunding. We only examine the latter, which accounted for the largest share by far. In 2019, Companisto transformed from a crowdfunding platform for small investors to a platform focusing on more sophisticated investors. Initially, the platform was characterized by small minimum investments, public campaigns, and equity-like participatory loans. However, since the end of 2019, only accredited investors are provided access to the campaigns offering equity shares. Using logit and Cox regression models and in line with the literature on signals, we demonstrate that a venture’s risk of failure decreases if its chief executive officer (CEO) states that they hold a university degree. A higher number of business-related updates is associated with a lower risk of failure. The number of updates on external certification, promotions, and the team is associated with a higher risk of failure. However, contradicting the findings of recent research on offering success, we find that large investments during the crowdfunding campaign and the number of updates on campaign development are associated with a higher probability of failure. Furthermore, we show that the risk of failure decreases with the equity stake offered. Our findings have implications for entrepreneurs, investors, and platform design. For example, entrepreneurs can send credible signals by indicating their university degree or industry experience in the campaign description and by choosing a legal form with high personal liability for their venture. Crowd investors who are interested in maximizing their financial gains and minimizing the risk of failure should not consider small equity stakes and large investments of other investors as positive signals. They should also avoid investing in ventures that have already conducted another crowdfunding campaign. Regarding platform design, our result on large investments suggests that platforms could reduce misinterpretations about large investments by providing information on the investors’ level of professionalism or investment experience, such as by giving them the option to mention their profession. Furthermore, our study emphasizes the importance of regulating investors’ maximum investment amounts in equity crowdfunding, as has been recently introduced in the US (Securities and Exchange Commission 2015). The remainder of our study is organized as follows: Section “Theory” presents the theory. In Section “Hypotheses development”, we develop our hypotheses. Section “Data and variables” offers a description of the data set and variables. In Section “Methods”, we explain the methods used. In Section “Results”, we present the analysis results. In Section “Discussion”, we discuss the implications and limitations of the study. Section “Summary” summarizes the paper.",6
7.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,05 July 2021,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-021-00271-z,Analysing the behavioural finance impact of 'fake news' phenomena on financial markets: a representative agent model and empirical validation,December 2021,Bryan Fong,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Intentional disinformation, or ‘fake news’, is defined as “false stories that appear to be news, spread on the internet or using other media, usually created to influence political views or as a joke” (Cambridge Dictionary 2021). Though disinformation in the media has long existed in a myriad of forms, the modern fake news phenomenon has garnered significant attention recently due to its pronounced pervasiveness and impact in the social media era. Commonly linked to several major recent world events, such as the US elections and Brexit, modern fake news has had significant and well-documented influence in contemporary politics and society—and has subsequently received substantial attention, both in popular discourse and academic research. In addition, though less commonly discussed, recent studies have shown fake news similarly capable of significantly impacting security prices and financial markets (Clarke 2018; Kogan et al. 2019). For instance, Clarke et al. (2018) and Kogan et al. (2019) both analyse the fake news articles on Seeking Alpha which were identified by a 2017 SEC crackdown to have artificially inflated certain stock prices. In another high-profile case, a series of fake WhatsApp messages shared on Twitter incited a bank run on the UK-based Metro Bank in May 2019—and are associated with the subsequent plunge that hit Metro Bank’s share price (Makortoff et al. 2019). However, despite fake news’ recent general popularity as a research focus, the amount of research available on fake news’ impacts specifically in financial markets remains notably limited. The overwhelming majority of studies remain focused on fake news’ political and social impacts, and these are additionally largely isolated to methods for detecting and countering fake news. In particular, while prior literature has proven that fake news can have statistically significant impacts on financial markets (Clarke et al. 2018; Kogan et al. 2019), no research currently exists to formally provide an economic rationale or model for how this is at all possible. According to the tenets of the efficient-market hypothesis (a popular base economic model for financial markets), fake news should not be able to impact market prices as it conveys spurious information that should be rejected by rational agents in an efficient market (Fama 1970). This implies that fake news’ observed impacts in financial markets are irrational and should not exist as they contradict the efficient-market hypothesis—despite the empirical proof to the contrary. Yet, in spite of this stark disjoint between economic theory and empirical evidence, no existing literature or model currently provides an applicable and effective explanation for how fake news’ impacts could rationally persist in financial markets in contradiction of the efficient-market hypothesis. As such, this paper aims to initiate this research by proposing a novel theoretical base model that provides a formal and rigorous economic explanation covering the primary drivers of how fake news generates statistically-significant impacts in financial markets—as well as empirical validation for the model’s dynamics and predictions. By providing a formalised starting point, this paper additionally hopes to stimulate future research to build upon this base model, to account for further conditions and variables, and more fully explain fake news’ financial impacts. This paper seeks to provide a formal economic explanation of how fake news can generate impacts in financial markets, through a combination of theory and empirics—and offers several novel contributions to the literature. As previously described, this primarily centres around proposing an original formal economic model to explain the empirically-proven impacts that fake news can have on financial markets. An extended version of the model also provides a hypothesis for an additional novel impact of fake news in financial markets which has not been formally analysed by prior literature—which is validated along with the overall model’s qualitative accuracy through empirical testing. The paper progresses as follows. First, established behavioural finance biases are introduced to explain and reconcile empirically observed price overreactions to fake news with empirically observed price underreactions to real news. This occurs through the structure of a novel unified representative agent model, driven by bounded rationality over uncertainty in information veracity. This model is then extended with established fake news-specific characteristics, and predicts a new secondary impact of fake news: that fake news in a security amplifies underreactions to subsequent real news for the security. Next, the model’s dynamics and predictions are evaluated through a large-sample empirical event study. This is conducted as a novel event study over the 2019 Chinese ADR Delisting Threat fake news and debunking event—one of the only large-sample events which allows the full model (including the novel hypothesised secondary fake news effect) to be tested. Using the Adjusted Patell test with bootstrapped normal critical values, the event study accounts for cross-sectional correlation, unrepresentative excessively volatile observations, and non (standard) normal distributions—ensuring the robustness of the empirical test. The empirical results indicate statistically significant price overreactions to fake news and price underreactions to debunking over the event, and provide qualitative support for the model’s predictions—including the proposed secondary fake news effect. As such, the empirical results validate this paper’s model, and reinforce the robustness of the paper’s proposed formal economic explanation of fake news’ impacts in finance.",8

In this regard, foreign investors have often been perceived as highly influencing in terms of stock prices in these markets and, therefore, their trading behaviors were of interest to policymakers and many academic researchers. The studies in this regard frequently labeled foreign investors as trend chasers who often follow positive feedback trading strategies, which may potentially destabilize emerging stock markets.Footnote 1 Despite the fact that the trend-chasing behaviors of foreign investors are consistently supported by empirical evidence from studies at multiple-country level (e.g., Froot et al. 2001; Griffin et al. 2002; Richards 2005; Chai-Anant and Ho 2008), and at a single-country level such as Karolyi (2002) on Japan, Chai-Anant (2003) on Thailand, Tayde and Rao (2011) on India, and Bae et al. (2011) on South Korea, the findings from some recent studies have pointed to a negative relationship, which is often hypothesized as “portfolio rebalancing” behavior (e.g., Hau and Rey 2004; Ülkü and Ikizlerli 2012; Ülkü and Karpova 2014; Ülkü 2015). Furthermore, the literature on international finance has provided several explanations about foreigners’ positive feedback trading. Home-bias models describe foreign investors as uninformed traders and attribute their positive feedback trading to lack of information about the local market (Brennan and Cao 1997; Griffin et al. 2004). However, some studies contrasted this finding and provided evidence on foreign investors’ outperformance of their domestic counterparts (e.g., Grinblatt and Keloharju 2000; Froot and Ramadorai 2008). In light of these results, Albuquerque et al.’s (2009) global private information model argues that positive feedback trading is not a symptom of inferior knowledge at a domestic level, but it is actually due to the foreign investors’ superior information at a global level. Although there is a considerable body of research on the relationship between foreign equity flows and stock returns, several aspects of this relationship require further investigations. As highlighted by another stream of research, emerging stock markets are characterized by high volatility and more frequent price changes compared to developed markets (e.g., see Bekaert and Harvey 1997; De Santis and Imrohoroglu 1997; Schaller and Van Norden 1997; Bekaert et al. 1998; Kawakatsu and Morey 2014; Harvey et al. 2000). Besides being highly volatile, other studies have confirmed that the volatility of returns in emerging stock markets is time-variant. Ahmed and Sehgal (2015) investigate the volatility of stock returns in seven emerging markets using the Markov switching model. The study revealed that volatility switches between two regimes in each of the studied markets. Similarly, Maharaj et al. (2011) observe that volatility of stock returns is time scale-dependent in all the countries in their sample of emerging and developed markets. In a similar fashion, the net foreign portfolio flows can be highly inconstant and may deteriorate in a short period. Pagliari and Hannan (2017) conducted a study on 65 countries including emerging markets, and found the portfolio flows to be following different trends over time. According to the authors, the volatility of overall portfolio flows is lower at certain periods. More precisely, they find that the volatility of equity flows is following a slight upward trend until the global financial crisis and a downward trend thereafter. In addition, the net portfolio flows have been frequently changing in size over time; it has occasionally surged then suddenly reversed with dramatic falls over the past 2 decades. These types of changes are capable of generating regime shifts and structural breaks. Consequently, the relationship between foreign equity flows and stock returns is likely to be time-variant and non-linear. Based on this perspective, the current study analyzes the dynamic interactions between the net foreign equity flows and stock returns using a time-varying parameter VAR with stochastic volatility (TVP-VAR-SV), which is a novel approach to this line of literature. By investigating the net flow-returns relationship from a time-varying perspective, we aim to address the following questions: Are foreign investors only trend chasers regardless of the economic conditions in the host market? If this is not the case, what are the economic circumstances that urge such investors to change their trading behaviors? To answer these questions, we must include a control variable that enables us to examine the relationship between foreign equity flows and returns in the context of the economic and financial conditions of the host market. To this end, we include the economic uncertainty index developed by Baker et al. (2016).Footnote 2 Several studies have detected a widespread impact of economic uncertainty on economic activities through several channels. The stock market, in particular, is closely linked to economic uncertainty through direct channels such as volatility and performance of the market (Antonakakis et al. 2013; Liu and Zhang 2015; Arouri et al. 2016) and indirect channels such as investment decisions (Gulen and Ion 2016), financing and production costs (Gilchrist et al. 2014), and interest rate and expected risk premiums (Pastor and Veronesi 2013). Furthermore, the economic uncertainty index could possibly bear some global information as policymaking is globally connected (Faruk et al. 2017). Therefore, the inclusion of economic uncertainty gives the advantage of capturing larger amounts of information at both global and domestic levels, thus potentially turning the VAR model into a factor model. The estimation of the TVP-VAR-SV model is completed using monthly data from South Korea. As seen in some seminal studies (e.g., Choe et al. 1999, 2005), the South Korean stock market has been one of the most relevant examples to study the behavior of foreign investors. In addition, being one of the largest Asian stock markets with characteristics similar to developed stock markets also makes it particularly attractive to international investors. For this reason, foreign investors’ interests in the Korean stock market substantially increased after the 1997–1998 Asian crisis. Foreign investors currently own more than 30% of the stocks and are allowed to freely trade most of the shares on the exchange except those of public corporations and government-controlled utilities. This study fundamentally differs from existing studies by accounting for the possible time variations in the interactions between foreign investors and stock returns. Moreover, the inclusion of economic uncertainty in the empirical model is, to the best of our knowledge, unprecedented in this line of literature. Therefore, this study provides a unique in-sample empirical analysis for the interactions between foreign investors and stock returns with respect to the changing economic conditions in an extensively studied market. The empirical analysis reveals several new findings about the trading behaviors of foreign investors. The main results indicate that economic policy uncertainty is an important determinant of the trading behaviors of foreign investors in the South Korean stock market. Their positive feedback trading uniquely emerges during periods of high economic uncertainty, whereas negative feedback trading frequently appears in periods of low economic uncertainty. The feedback trading behaviors mostly appear to be well-timed and often lead the time-varying economic uncertainty except in periods of global crises. The study also documents an asymmetric response of foreign investors to negative and positive shocks of economic uncertainty. On one hand, such investors turn to positive feedback trading instantly after a negative contemporaneous response of net flows to shocks of economic uncertainty. On the other hand, they slowly move toward negative feedback trading after a positive response of net flows to uncertainty shocks. As for stock returns, the impact of past uncertainty news is found to be economically less significant beyond one month. The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section two reviews the related literature. Section three describes the data and the empirical sample. Section four outlines the empirical methodology while section five analyzes the empirical results. The final section summarizes the results and presents concluding remarks.",1

This paper extends theory to explain the impact of financial technology and the Internet on the nature of banking. It provides an analytical framework for academic investigation, highlighting the trends that are shaping scholarly research into these dynamics. To do this, it re-examines the nature of financial intermediation and transactions. It explains how digital banking will be structurally, as well as physically, different from the banks described in the literature to date. It does this by extending the contribution of Klein (1971), on the theory of the banking firm. It presents suggested strategies for incumbent, and challenger banks, and how banking as a service and social media payment will reshape the competitive landscape. The banking industry has been evolving since Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena opened its doors in 1472. Its leveraged business model has proved very scalable over time, but it is now facing new challenges. Firstly, its book to capital ratios, as documented by Berger et al (1995), have been consistently falling since 1840. This trend continues as competition has increased. In the past decade, the industry has experienced declines in profitability as measured by return on tangible equity. This is partly the result of falling leverage and fee income and partly due to the net interest margin (connected to traditional lending activity). These trends accelerated following the 2008 financial crisis. At the same time, technology has made banks more competitive. Advances in digital technology are changing the very nature of banking. Banks are now distributing services via mobile technology. A prolonged period of very low interest rates is also having an impact. To sustain their profitability, Brei et al. (2020) note that many banks have increased their emphasis on fee-generating services. As Fama (1980) explains, a bank is an intermediary. The Internet is, however, changing the way financial service providers conduct their role. It is fundamentally changing the nature of the banking. This in turn is changing the nature of banking services, and the way those services are delivered. As a consequence, in order to compete in the changing digital landscape, banks have to adapt. The banks of the future, both incumbents and challengers, need to address liquidity transformation, data, trust, competition, and the digitalization of financial services. Against this backdrop, incumbent banks are focused on reinventing themselves. The challenger banks are, however, starting with a blank canvas. The research questions that these dynamics pose need to be investigated within the context of the theory of banking, hence the need to revise the existing analytical framework. Banks perform payment and transfer functions for an economy. The Internet can now facilitate and even perform these functions. It is changing the way that transactions are recorded on ledgers and is facilitating both public and private digital currencies. In the past, banks operated in a world of information asymmetry between themselves and their borrowers (clients), but this is changing. This differential gave one bank an advantage over another due to its knowledge about its clients. The digital transformation that financial technology brings reduces this advantage, as this information can be digitally analyzed. Even the nature of deposits is being transformed. Banks in the future will have to accept deposits and process transactions made in digital form, either Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDC) or cryptocurrencies. This presents a number of issues: (1) it changes the way financial services will be delivered, (2) it requires a discussion on resilience, security and competition in payments, (3) it provides a building block for better cross border money transfers and (4) it raises the question of private and public issuance of money. Braggion et al (2018) consider whether these represent a threat to financial stability. The academic study of banking began with Edgeworth (1888). He postulated that it is based on probability. In this respect, the nature of the business model depends on the probability that a bank will not be called upon to meet all its liabilities at the same time. This allows banks to lend more than they have in deposits. Because of the resultant mismatch between long term assets and short-term liabilities, a bank’s capital structure is very sensitive to liquidity trade-offs. This is explained by Diamond and Rajan (2000). They explain that this makes a bank a’relationship lender’. In effect, they suggest a bank is an intermediary that has borrowed from other investors. Diamond and Rajan (2000) argue a lender can negotiate repayment obligations and that a bank benefits from its knowledge of the customer. As shall be shown, the new generation of digital challenger banks do not have the same tradeoffs or knowledge of the customer. They operate more like a broker providing a platform for banking services. This suggests that there will be more than one type of bank in the future and several different payment protocols. It also suggests that banks will have to data mine customer information to improve their understanding of a client’s financial needs. The key focus of Diamond and Rajan (2000), however, was to position a traditional bank is an intermediary. Gurley and Shaw (1956) describe how the customer relationship means a bank can borrow funds by way of deposits (liabilities) and subsequently use them to lend or invest (assets). In facilitating this mediation, they provide a service whereby they store money and provide a mechanism to transmit money. With improvements in financial technology, however, money can be stored digitally, lenders and investors can source funds directly over the internet, and money transfer can be done digitally. A review of financial technology and banking literature is provided by Thakor (2020). He highlights that financial service companies are now being provided by non-deposit taking contenders. This paper addresses one of the four research questions raised by his review, namely how theories of financial intermediation can be modified to accommodate banks, shadow banks, and non-intermediated solutions. To be a bank, an entity must be authorized to accept retail deposits. A challenger bank is, therefore, still a bank in the traditional sense. It does not, however, have the costs of a branch network. A peer-to-peer lender, meanwhile, does not have a deposit base and therefore acts more like a broker. This leads to the issue that this paper addresses, namely how the banks of the future will conduct their intermediation. In order to understand what the bank of the future will look like, it is necessary to understand the nature of the aforementioned intermediation, and the way it is changing. In this respect, there are two key types of intermediation. These are (1) quantitative asset transformation and, (2) brokerage. The latter is a common model adopted by challenger banks. Figure 1 depicts how these two types of financial intermediation match savers with borrowers. To avoid nuanced distinction between these two types of intermediation, it is common to classify banks by the services they perform. These can be grouped as either private, investment, or commercial banking. The service sub-groupings include payments, settlements, fund management, trading, treasury management, brokerage, and other agency services. How banks act as intermediaries between lenders and borrowers. This function call also be conducted by intermediaries as brokers, for example by shadow banks. Disintermediation occurs over the internet where peer-to-peer lenders match savers to lenders Financial technology has the ability to disintermediate the banking sector. The competitive pressures this results in will shape the banks of the future. The channels that will facilitate this are shown in Fig. 2, namely the Internet and/or mobile devices. Challengers can participate in this by, (1) directly matching borrows with savers over the Internet and, (2) distributing white labels products. The later enables banking as a service and avoids the aforementioned liquidity mismatch. The strategic options banks have to match lenders with borrowers. The traditional and challenger banks are in the same space, competing for business. The distributed banks use the traditional and challenger banks to white label banking services. These banks compete with payment platforms on social media. The Internet heralds an era of banking as a service There are also physical changes that are being made in the delivery of services. Bricks and mortar branches are in decline. Mobile banking, or m-banking as Liu et al (2020) describe it, is an increasingly important distribution channel. Robotics are increasingly being used to automate customer interaction. As explained by Vishnu et al (2017), these improve efficiency and the quality of execution. They allow for increased oversight and can be built on legacy systems as well as from a blank canvas. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are bringing the same type of functionality to m-banking. They can be used to authorize third party use of banking data. How banks evolve over time is important because, according to the OECD, the activity in the financial sector represents between 20 and 30 percent of developed countries Gross Domestic Product. In summary, financial technology has evolved to a level where online banks and banking as a service are challenging incumbents and the nature of banking mediation. Banking is rapidly transforming because of changes in such technology. At the same time, the solving of the double spending problem, whereby digital money can be cryptographically protected, has led to the possibility that paper money will become redundant at some point in the future. A theoretical framework is required to understand this evolving landscape. This is discussed next.",37

People around the world connect and interact via FinTech (Milian et al. 2019). People have many electronic devices in their pockets, on their desks, and in their homes, which means that they can send money across the world at any time, purchase products on the Internet from people they have never met, and manage their personal wealth with fast, accessible, and convenient electronic devices (Callen-Naviglia and James 2018). The explosive growth of mobile computer, communication, and consumer (3C) devices and the introduction of mobile payments are forcing traditional retail banks and electronic commerce (e-commerce) retailers to increase the flexibility of their businesses to meet the challenges of new business pipelines and models in the FinTech era (Jonker 2019; Kou 2019). A complex action to balance the interests of all parties was derived from financial services providers, who attempt to moderate the relationship among privacy, convenience, and security or other latent concerns, and showed that the opinions of financial services providers about security issues had to change (Liébana-Cabanillas and Lara-Rubio 2017; Alhassany and Faisal 2018; Hu et al. 2019; Norma and Farah 2020). However, it is impossible to protect the security of information assets by using locks and keys. We often trust people and systems that we cannot identify even if face-to-face. High levels of online information exchange and interaction provide opportunities for hackers who are attempting to steal people’s identities and credentials for illegal purposes (Costigan 2016; Callen-Naviglia and James 2018). The highly regulated financial services industry has a large amount of sensitive financial and personal information, so it needs to maintain a high level of attention to information security issues. In addition, banks are also driven by technology and are transforming and innovating at an extraordinary rate to meet regulatory requirements and customer expectations (Costigan 2017; Patil et al. 2020; Singh et al. 2020). Almost any certification technology can be destroyed, so financial services providers cannot rely on one method to authorize high-risk activities. In FinTech applications, financial services providers use a variety of identification technologies to improve fraud monitoring and user experience (Wang et al. 2019; Zhu et al. 2020). Biometric technologies are expected to provide enhanced identification solutions for these problems. From a technological viewpoint, the technical research process of identity verification via people’s physical characteristics began with the emergence of computer systems in the second half of the twentieth century (Ogbanufe and Kim 2018; Wang et al. 2019). As an emerging technology concept, biometrics was not widely applied until Apple introduced fingerprint recognition technology as a feature of its electronic devices (Liu et al. 2015; Wu et al. 2018; Murakami et al. 2019). Biometrics could be well applied to application software or devices to enable users to directly utilize these technologies (Liu et al. 2015; Barkadehi et al. 2018). This technique is consistent with the need for intuitive and frictionless certification experiences (Murakami et al. 2019). For mobile device providers, biometrics is an ideal technical solution because it can collect rich data obtained by many sensors in intelligent mobile devices to strengthen not only identification but also security (Ogbanufe and Kim 2018). These results are difficult to achieve in traditional networks. Considering the widespread use of intelligent mobile devices, this technology is particularly suitable for the identification of mobile payments and even the future security of various FinTech applications (Wang et al. 2019; Kim et al. 2019; Dubey 2019). Based on these two arguments, it is understood that biometrics have gradually been designed in FinTech applications because it is convenient for user login and accessing cloud financial services (Fenu and Marras 2018). Mehrban et al. (2020) also considered biometrics as an alternative to enhance the security of FinTech applications in protecting privacy and trust. Biometrics can apparently reduce the leakage of personal information by simplifying the identification process of FinTech applications. For example, Ant Financial launched face recognition to complete a payment system that took security and the user experience to a new level (Qi and Xiao 2018). Beyond the cybersecurity of FinTech applications, the customer experience has the potential to be changed as a result of increasing reliance on biometrics (Imerman and Fabozzi 2020). On the other hand, concerns about user acceptance have arisen. Regarding privacy and trust with respect to biometrics, most studies have discussed biometrics penetration from a technical viewpoint (Dubey 2019; Tanimoto et al. 2019; Iyer et al. 2020), but there is less research from the perspective of users. Therefore, this study applies the research objective to explore customers’ acceptance related to biometric identification in FinTech applications. Further, the technology acceptance model (TAM) is utilized to define the possible influence variables and realize their significance. The TAM has been widely employed to examine user acceptance of new technologies (Cheng and Yeh 2011; Rashed and Alajarmeh 2015; Shachak et al. 2019). The TAM can adjust the variables with the research object to further and effectively explain and predict (Wu et al. 2017; Chopdar and Sivakumar 2019). In FinTech, the TAM has been applied to investigate mobile payment (Norma and Farah 2020), cryptocurrency (Singh et al. 2020), and financial service innovations (Hu et al. 2019). Many sophisticated analytical methods identify the best solution for a multi-objective problem, and these methods can also be used for exploratory research. As one of the most widely employed techniques, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) can evaluate each alternative based on established criteria (Saaty 1980; Kou and Lin 2014; Lee et al. 2018; Galankashi et al. 2020). Thus, the current study applies the AHP to explore the improved TAM to confirm the weights and priorities of criteria that are critical for biometrics in FinTech applications. Second, the AHP provides quantitative output to use in sensitivity analysis to comprehend the variations in weights or priorities and how these affect the scenarios of the research aim (Srdjevic et al. 2012; Başar 2018; Lin et al. 2020). Sensitivity analysis also increases the reliability of AHP by appropriately answering “what if” questions. This approach is specifically useful for multi-objective decision problems (Wang et al. 2013; Schmidt et al. 2015; Atmaca and Karadaş 2020; Yu et al. 2021). By including scenario construction and analysis via sensitivity analysis, the research contributions of AHP are broadened (Başar 2018). Analysts can construct scenarios to describe situations that may affect the weight of the criterion or the attributes of each choice (Wang et al. 2013; Kou et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2021). We performed a sensitivity analysis to adjust the weight of every object for simulating practicable biometric identification in FinTech application scenarios. Using these technical evaluation schemes, we can identify the impacts of variables of the modified TAM on the determination for biometric identification in FinTech applications. This study describes the security used in FinTech applications and then essentially introduces four common biometric technologies. Next, based on the TAM and related literature, we construct a multi-object framework to evaluate biometrics in FinTech applications. The third and fourth parts introduce the AHP and sensitivity analysis methods. Section 5 describes the empirical and sensitivity analyses that are performed by employing the AHP. Based on the results, the conclusion and management implications are discussed in Sect. 6.",18

8.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,07 November 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-022-00409-7,The social representation of fintech from the perspective of traditional financial sector professionals: evidence from Brazil,December 2022,Luiz Antonio Joia,Rodrigo Proença,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"The financial sectorFootnote 1 operates in a changing world, which is characterized by greater complexity, interconnectivity, and speed (Gomber et al. 2018; Salampasis and Mention 2018). Amidst a wave of new business models and disruptive technologies, the expression “fintech” arises from the term “FINancial TECHnologies” (Arner et al. 2015; Neenu and Hemalatha 2016; Puschmann 2017; Reed 2016; Wang 2021). To date, schools of thought emphasize the potential of fintech to improve the financial sector customer experience, whereas others focus on the social role of fintech, perceiving them as enablers of financial inclusion, particularly for low-income classes (Arslan et al. 2021; Joia and Cordeiro 2021a; Moro-Visconti 2021; Salampasis and Mention 2018).Footnote 2 Moreover, there is a discussion on whether fintech is meant to be associated with a specific group of companies, namely startups (Chuen and Teo 2015), or might be present within the operations of traditional banks and financial institutions (Arner et al. 2015). More radical academics also exist, such as Figurelli (2017), who believed that fintech has the potential to cause a structural collapse in the traditional financial sector—fully transforming the way people deal with their finances and impacting the way competition takes place in this industry. Thus, we perceive a lack of consensus on the definition of the fintech construct, which can lead academics and practitioners to have distinct perceptions of this new social phenomenon (Choi et al. 2019; Eickhoff et al. 2017; Thakor 2020). According to Dorfleitner et al. (2017), Schueffel (2016), and Thakor (2020), no common definition of fintech has yet been presented. However, the question “what is a fintech” has occupied a prominent place in queries related to fintech on Google, which seems to demonstrate a desperate search for a common understanding of this construct. Indeed, the term fintech has been applied in various business environments, often in a conflicting and ambiguous way, and no effort has been made thus far to seek a consensual definition of this construct (Schueffel 2016; Wang 2022). For example, even in developed countries (e.g., Germany and England), there is ambiguity in how fintech is portrayed by the popular press and addressed in Information Systems Research (Zavolokina et al. 2016a, b). Similarly, Choi et al. (2019) investigated how fintech are socially represented by their major stakeholders (i.e., financial authorities, financial companies, and Information Technology firms) in South Korea.Footnote 3 They found that each had a divergent awareness and understanding of the fintech phenomenon. Therefore, a common understanding of fintech must be sought to assess the nature of developments in banking and financial services and to create a solid foundation for scientific research on the topic (Milian et al. 2019). Schueffel (2016) argued that this common understanding is necessary for establishing direct and unambiguous communication between academics and practitioners regarding the potential of fintech to transform the current financial sector through competition with traditional banks. Thus, only with this common understanding will financial companies and their professionals be prepared to face a new financial sector accrued from this paradigm shift. Emerging marketsFootnote 4 exist globally where, although financial exclusion is still high by the standards of developed countries, the number of fintech operating in the financial sector has consistently increased—as in Brazil (Frost 2020; Lyon et al. 2021). Gomber et al. (2018) stated that fintech may have a significant impact on the financial inclusion of low-income people and small companies that have little or no access to the traditional banking sector. This conclusion is corroborated by Herrera and Vadillo (2018). Based on a survey conducted for Latin America and the Caribbean, Herrera and Vadillo (2018) concluded that 46% of the fintech in the region is directed toward this type of client. In addition to a well-established traditional banking sector, as of December 2018, there were 423 fintech institutions in Brazil, a 36% increase over that in 2017 (Finnovation 2019). Furthermore, according to Lyons et al. (2021), Brazil (along with India) has led, among all emerging economies, the implementation of fintech in its financial sector, managing to financially include a part of the unbankedFootnote 5 population. This case highlights the importance of studying the fintech phenomenon in emerging markets, as also pointed out by Joia and Cordeiro (2021a). Fintech in emerging markets has created social valueFootnote 6 for the unbanked population and small businesses that would otherwise not be inserted in the financial sector (Joia and Cordeiro 2021a; Thomas and Hedrick-Wong 2019). In addition, much of the financial inclusion generated by fintech in Brazil and other emerging markets has been driven by the high penetration and use of cell phones in these countries (Arner et al. 2020; Senyo and Osabutey 2020; Thomas and Hedrick-Wong 2019). Brazil can be seen as a proxy for emerging markets that have high financial exclusion coexisting with a large number of fintech operating in the financial sector in frank and open competition with large traditional banks (Bunea et al. 2016; Godinho 2021; Lyons et al. 2021; Tambunlertchai et al. 2021). These facts support our choice of using the Brazilian context and back our option of investigating the perception of professionals in the traditional financial sector on the fintech concept. The reason is that other emerging economies might take advantage of the results herein presented. To achieve this, we applied the social representations theory to identify and compare this perception with the existing literature on the concept of fintech to identify cognitive similarities and gaps. Information technology has given rise to new constructs that need to be properly defined such that academics and practitioners perceive them in the same way (Joia and Marchisotti 2020). For example, cloud computing, blockchain, the Internet of things, smart city, information technology governance, and fintech, to name just a few, are new constructs associated with recent technological innovations. Thus, academia has continually faced the challenge of consistently defining new constructs associated with technological innovations, such as fintech, such that they are similarly perceived by practitioners. Therefore, we intend to answer the following research question: what is the social representation of fintech from the perspective of traditional financial sector professionals in Brazil? In other words, how these professionals perceive and understand fintech. Our motivation to analyze the perception of traditional financial sector professionals in Brazil about fintech stems from the very need to investigate whether the abovementioned professionals are aware of the real business discontinuities that may arise from the new paradigm associated with the operation of fintech (Lee and Shin 2018). The findings will enable us to propose strategies that can be implemented by the traditional financial sector to compete with these new ventures. In other words, our motivation for developing this study is mainly based on the very need to make traditional financial sector professionals aware of the importance of correctly understanding the fintech concept, including its potential to redesign the current financial sector (Dapp et al. 2014; Ozaee and Sohrabi 2017). Without knowing precisely what a fintech is and how it can operate, it is hard to believe that the traditional financial sector is prepared to face the challenge of competing against it (Alt et al. 2018; Mirchandani et al. 2020). For this reason, we adopted the social representations theory associated with the central nucleus theory, operationalized through the Words Evocation Technique. The reason is that this approach, as detailed below, aims to investigate how people perceive and give meaning to a specific concept—in this case, fintech. This paper is structured, in addition to this section, in five more sections. In the second section, the literature review used in the research is presented, including fintech, social representations theory, and the central nucleus approach. In the next section, the methodological procedures upon which the study was based are presented. Data analysis is then carried out, followed by a section where the results are discussed and compared with the scientific literature on the definition of fintech. Finally, conclusions and implications derived from this research are presented.",2
8.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,27 October 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-022-00398-7,‘Smart’ copycat mutual funds: on the performance of partial imitation strategies,December 2022,Roberto Stein,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"“The problem with being a leader is that you’re never sure if you’re being followed or chased.” Claire A. Murray. Imitation is a fact of life and its importance in business has been acknowledged as far back as Levitt (1966), often cited as the first paper to call attention to imitation in business. Imitation has been studied in all business disciplines, such as strategy, marketing, organizational behavior, etc. For example, Semadeni and Anderson (2010) look at data from consulting firms to study what they call the ‘follower’s dilemma’, where firms must weigh the uncertainty of imitating the first mover’s innovation, versus the uncertainty of not imitating. Hsieh and Hyun (2018) look at imitation in the form of firms matching their competitor’s entry into a new geographic region, focusing on the decisions of IT firms in different regions in China. Xie and Li (2017) argue that the actions of perceived peers are more likely to be imitated those of others, and show that cross-border acquisitions by Chinese firms are more likely to be imitated by similar firms, emerging market multinationals, than by developed market multinationals. Posen et al. (2013) use simulations to show that even imperfect imitation can help underperforming firms improve performance, and even eventually outperform industry leaders. Ross and Sharapov (2015) innovate by ignoring the followers, and instead looking at how market leaders also turn to imitation in a bid to avoid dethronement as a leader. Giachetti et al. (2017) expands on this to show that imitation by some firms in an industry puts pressure on the rest of the competitors to also imitate, and that imitation may not necessarily be an ‘all or nothing’ strategy, but instead can be a component within a broader corporate strategy.Footnote 1 These results combine to show that it is possible for there to be widespread imitation in any industry, as both industry leaders and non-leader firms all incorporate some level of imitation into their strategies in an attempt to improve performance. In this paper we explore these ideas in the context of mutual funds and the imitation of stock trades as a mechanism for some fund managers to improve performance. In the mutual fund industry, recent work has focused on the imitation of trades by fund managers, usually referred to as “copycatting”. However, there are significant gaps in the existing literature. The earliest papers to analyze imitation do not identify actual copycats funds. Instead, they focus on a sample of funds and then estimate what would be the potential performance of hypothetical mimicking portfolios that copy all security holdings of these selected funds. For example, Frank et al. (2004) speculate that the best funds to imitate are those with high expenses, and show that simulated funds that imitate them can match their performance, after expenses. Verbeek and Wang (2013) generate simulated portfolios that imitate every fund in the domestic equity market, and find that the average performance of the mimicking portfolios is a few basis points above that of the real funds. More recent work introduces actual imitation measures. Based on these measures, funds are labeled as either copycats or non-copycats (see for example, Phillips et al. 2014; Koch 2016). There are important shortcomings in the way these measures are constructed. Existing measures characterize copycatting as an all-or-nothing decision, in which a copycat is modeled as selecting a single fund to imitate, and then attempting to track that manager’s portfolio as closely as possible. This view of trade imitation is problematic for various reasons. First, fully tracking a single fund would be easy to detect by fund sponsors, investors, legislators, and anyone who cared to look, potentially triggering negative outcomes for the copycat manager. Second, the management literature provides ample evidence that partial imitation strategies can be superior to full imitation. For example, Posen et al. (2013), Wang et al. (2019), and Gaba and Terlaak (2013) show that imperfect imitation can lead to superior outcomes, in particular when it is combined with a firm’s or manager’s innate capabilities to innovate in areas where they do not imitate. For example, a fund manager might prefer her own information to trade stocks in which she has an informational advantage, and imitate others’ trades where she is at a disadvantage. Likewise, an imitator might find it best to diversify in the fund managers she chooses to follow. For example, she might follow a tech expert when trading technology stocks, and a financial services expert when trading bank stocks. In fact, these strategies that combine innovation with imitation can be so successful that they can sometimes enable followers to outperform the leaders themselves (e.g.: Posen and Martignoni 2018). This last point brings us to the next problem with all-or-nothing measures of trade imitation, which is that they do not allow for a more nuanced approach, one that allows for the possibility that followers may lead in some trades, or that leaders might also engage in partial imitation themselves. This last, industry leaders engaging in imitation, has also received support in the literature as a valid strategy used by incumbents to defend their leadership position (Ross and Sharapov 2015; Aron and Lazear 1990; Sharapov and Ross 2019). Finally, all measures introduced thus far are single period models, which gauge imitation by comparing the trades made by two funds within one quarter of each other. The single period structure renders them particularly sensitive to spurious detection. It is often the case, for example, that two funds alter their portfolios in response to the same exogenous signal, such as index listings, earnings announcements, analyst recommendations, etc. If this signal happens close to the end of a reporting period, we could observe one fund trade before, and the other after the period’s cutoff. This, in turn, would incorrectly be taken as evidence of imitation by a single-period measure. We introduce a novel methodology which measures mutual fund trade imitation at the individual stock level. This approach lends itself to a more precise and nuanced analysis of trade imitation, and reveals a number of previously hidden patterns in imitation and performance in the U.S. domestic mutual fund market. Many of our results on actual imitation behavior are shown to be more intuitive, and consistent with the management literature, than those shown so far in the relevant literature. Using 5 years of trading data in a VAR-Granger framework, we label each stock in a fund’s portfolio as one in which the fund manager imitates another fund’s trades (‘follows’), or is imitated (‘leads’). We then aggregate this data at the fund level obtaining a “Copycat Score” for each fund, which consists of the sum of portfolio weights of stocks in which the fund imitates someone elses trades, minus those in which it leads. Our measure can identify fund managers who imitate trades of different funds for each stock in their portfolio, or avoid imitation in favor of their own information. One advantage of this approach is that it is able to identify imitation even if it is highly diversified among peer funds. “All-or-nothing” measure would not identify this as copycatting, as the amount of imitation of a single fund would be very low. Also, by using a time series of trades in a VAR-Granger setting, our measure is far less likely to identify a spurious trade pattern as imitation. Finally, our approach does not produce a binary variable, “copycat” or “not copycat”, but rather a continuous measure that gauges not just the general direction of the fund manager’s behavior, as tilted towards leading versus following, but also the intensity in either direction. Our results show that the increased precision of our copycat analysis pays off. We show that imitation is pervasive in the mutual fund industry. Almost every fund in our sample imitates another fund’s trades to some degree. However, for most funds trade imitation does not lead to outperformance. In fact, the average return of these imitated trades is equal to, and in some cases inferior to, the return of the average stock in our sample. Only a small number of fund managers appear to posses the skill of picking the best funds and stock trades to emulate, so that their copycat trades actually outperform. We consider this ‘smart imitation’ as a hitherto unreported form of fund manager skill. Within this framework, we define a ‘smart copycat’ as a fund manager who trades on her own private information when it is superior, but can choose the best managers to imitate their trades where they have an advantage. The result is a fund that benefits from a partial imitation strategy: performance is aided by the manager’s skill to select stocks investments by herself, as well as the best trades made by other managers which are worth imitating. With the U.S. mutual fund industry managing 22% of all household assets at the end of 2016 (assets in excess of 16 trillion dollars, 52% invested in equity funds), the question of the skill of fund managers has become one of the most important open issues in modern financial research. The performance and skill of active money managers has important implications for retail investors, financial markets, and for the economy as a whole. So far, evidence of persistent outperformance in mutual funds, or fund manager skill, has been mixed. While some authors find that most mutual funds underperform their benchmark (see for example, Jensen 1968; Malkiel 1995; Fama and French 2010), others find that a small group actually outperforms (Chen et al. 2000; Avramov and Wermers 2006; Kosowski et al. 2006; Cuthbertson et al. 2008). Our results contradict the assumption of past research in this area, that imitation is solely employed by fund managers with inferior skill. We find that smart partial imitation is correlated to measures of fund manager skill. In our sample, smart imitators do not just pick good stock trades to emulate, but also outperform with their own stock picks, and manage all around superior funds. Funds with high values of the Copycat Score are those with a strong tendency to imitate others with their trades, while funds with low values of the score tend more towards leading. However, funds observed at both extremes of the measure’s scale are highly active in both, leading and following trades. It is precisely these funds that outperform all others in the sample, particularly those with a Copycat Score of zero, which indicates they lead about as much as they imitate. Funds that tend the most towards leading outperform the zeros by 16 basis points per month, while those that tend towards imitation do so by 27 bps. In brief, these fund managers show signs of a combination of talents, including smart imitation, which they employ to outperform their peers. Further tests show that both types of funds at the extreme ends of the Copycat Score scale, leaders and imitators, employ strategies which are persistent in time, as is their outperformance. We also show that the Copycat Score is a good predictor of long term mutual fund performance, matching, and sometimes surpassing, the predictive power of other measures of performance and skill. However, this is not the case for the measure’s components individually, the amount of leading and following. This result highlights the importance of our methodology which takes into account partial imitation strategies, compared to those which measure imitation only. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section ""Data, methodology and summary statistic"" presents the VAR-Granger methodology and the data employed. Section ""Empirical results"" shows our empirical results, and section ""Conclusions"" offers concluding remarks.",

It is designed as a financial contract between two parts by which the owner of an asset, the lessor, sells the use of the asset to the lessee for a specified period without necessitating a transfer of ownership. It provides a separation of ownership from the user, with the lessee receiving the benefits of the use and the lessor receiving the lease payment flow, plus the residual value of the asset. Pricing and credit risk management is one of the most popular research topics since the world economy has experienced deep crises affecting almost all industries. Nevertheless, financial engineering has not ceased proposing innovative alternative solutions to mitigate the adverse impacts of these economic crises. In this study, we deal with the problem of the valuation of leasing contracts by providing this type of contract, which is used mainly by small- and medium-sized companies, with more flexibility through the possibility of conversion in case of default. Although the lease and rental agreements are similar, they are not the same. The lease agreement is specific in terms of detailing the responsibilities of both parties during the lease. It includes all necessary information to ensure that both parties are protected. In a classical lease agreement, the length of the lease and the amount of periodic rent are documented and cannot be changed. This ensures that the lessor cannot arbitrarily raise the rent, and the tenant cannot just leave the lease whenever they want without repercussions. The lease agreement is relevant for the specific time stated in the agreement and is then considered invalid. A rental agreement differs from a lease agreement in that it is not a long-term contract allowing the lessor to renegotiate the terms of the agreement when rental amounts can rise quickly. Both parties must enter a new lease agreement if tenants wish to keep the asset. The issuance of contingent capital is initially reserved for banks and, to some extent, insurance companies in times of crisis. Nevertheless, there have been attempts to propose contingent capital and rentals as risk management solutions for companies. The Michelin Committed Long-Term Capital Solutions (CLOCS) Agreement may be an example of how companies can use contingent capital as a source of financial inefficiencies, as Culp (2002) reported. Song (2014) studied the effect of capitalizing operating leases and lease-contingent payments on accounting and financial indicators using a sample of US companies from 2001 to 2010. He finds that the capitalization of lease-contingent payments entails significant changes in the magnitude and relative rankings of total liabilities, debt ratios, current ratios, and ROA. Contingent rentals are commonly based on price changes or inflation indices on the lessee's financial or operating performance and the lessee's use of the leased asset. Corporate risk management using contingent lease agreements can be demonstrated through contingent rentals based on the lessee's operating performance derived from the leased asset. Although lease agreements based on contingent rent are mainly used in estate leasing, this study extends this type of agreement to equipment leasing. In this study, three models of asset lease agreements were developed to manage the credit risk of corporate finance lessees using a contingent claims approach. In particular, the defaultable-convertible-Leasing contract with a payback option (DCLCP) is an option-based valuation model. In these three models, it is assumed that firms have existing assets financed by equity and a growth option to increase existing assets, such as after investment expansion, earnings before interest, and taxes (EBIT) increase by a constant factor. Investment costs are financed by the issuance of equity and contingent leases. We developed pricing models for the leasing defaultable contract (LDC), leasing convertible contract (LCC), and DCLCP triggered by an event of default aimed at preserving the continuity of the business and preventing the lessee's default in times of financial difficulties. In the event of default, the LDC model allows the lessor to receive a fraction of the remaining lease value due to the default costs. The LCC model provides two possibilities. The first occurs when the tenant does not default until the maturity of the lease. In this case, the asset receives a periodic lease payment. However, the second occurs when the lessee cannot continue to pay the outstanding amount. In this case, the lessor agrees to convert this amount into shares and thus becomes a shareholder while alleviating the burden on the firm's liquidity. The DCLCP, with the payback option model, grants the owner the choice to convert the remaining lease payments into equity or sell the leased asset on the market upon default to cover their position. There are also two possibilities to consider: the first is when there is no default, the lessee receives the benefits of using the asset, and the lessor receives the lease payment flow plus the residual value of the asset at the maturity of the lease. In this case, leasing is simply a mechanism for selling an asset for a predetermined period. Second, when the tenant defaults, the lessor has the right to choose the most relevant scenario that minimizes bankruptcy costs, either to trigger the conversion event or to obtain a set number of shares if the market value of the asset is less than the conversion value or to sell the leased asset in the market if the market value is higher. The difference between the LCC and DCLCP is the timing of the conversion and the existence of the payback option. The timing of the conversion in the LCC is determined when the lessee's stochastic cash flow falls to a lower conversion threshold; therefore, conversion occurs automatically and compulsorily. However, for the DCLCP, the conversion event is optional. This occurs when the lessor's financial situation falls to a certain level, and the benefits obtained from the conversion are greater than the market price of the leased asset. This paper proposes to study contingent lease as a risk management instrument that extends and complements contingent rent agreements based on the operating activity of the firm or the use of the leased asset. The relationship between leasing and contingent capital may be explored from the risk management perspective between lessors and lessees. It may contribute to recent innovations in contingent capital and lease rentals, along with a discussion of their role in integrating corporate finance and risk management. A numerical analysis was performed for the three types of contracts to examine and compare the sensitivities of different parameters. The results indicate that if the conversion rate is high enough, insolvency and asset substitution inefficiencies can be reduced, regardless of the financing policy, namely LCC or DCLCP equity. However, when the conversion rate is zero, the risk of inefficiencies increases. Moreover, it shows that the value of the company after the investment expansion first increases and then decreases with asset volatility. Since the conversion in the LCC occurs automatically at the moment of default, the numerical analysis reveals that the risk-shifting incentive under LCC equity financing is less than that under DCLCP equity for different conversion rates. For a conversion rate close to one, the risk-shifting incentive under the financing of DCLCP-equity if the lessor chooses to exercise the convertible lease option is less than abandoning it and selling the asset in the market. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Second section presents the “literature review”. Thrid section presents the “pricing methodology and contingent lease modelling”. Fourth section examines the “numerical results and sensitivity analysis”. Fifth section wraps up the closing part and exhibits some “concluding remarks”.",1

DEA has been used in various environments and in numerous applications [Kou et al. (2021), Zha et al. (2020), Castelli et al. (2004), Chao et al. (2021), Zhang et al. (2021), and references therein]. Anchor points form a subset of the extremely efficient DMUs. More precisely, an anchor point in DEA is an extremely efficient DMU for which some inputs can be increased and/or some outputs can be decreased without penetrating the interior of the production possibility set. An anchor point is, therefore, an extreme element of the production possibility set that lies on the transition between the strong efficient frontier and the “free-disposability”(unbounded face) part of the boundary. Anchor points play a major role in defining the shape of the DEA production possibility set. They were first identified by Allen and Thanassoulis (2004), who generated unobserved DMUs to extend the DEA efficient frontier (Thanassoulis and Allen 1998). Anchor points also allow identifying unobserved DMUs, as in the work of Thanassoulis et al. (2012). Allen and Thanassoulis (2004) proposed a special procedure for identifying anchor points. The scheme applies specifically to DEA models with one input and multiple outputs under constant returns to scale, and requires assumptions on the geometry of the efficient frontiers; such assumptions are not verified. Therefore, the procedure is not guaranteed to always identify all anchor points. Bougnol and Marie-Laure (2009) identified anchor points based on their geometrical properties, focusing on production possibility sets with variable returns. In this method, the PPS of the BCC model is projected on all coordinate hyperplanes, and an extremely efficient DMU is considered an anchor point if and only if it belongs to the boundary of at least one simple projection. Rouse (2004) used this approach to identify healthcare service prices. Mostafaee and Soleimani-damaneh (2014) used sensitivity analysis techniques to find the anchor points and presented some conditions for their characterization. They made a connection between DEA and sensitivity analysis in linear programming theory to identify anchor points, Akbarian (2021) and Soleimani-damaneh and Mostafaee (2015) studied anchor points using non-convex technologies. Bani et al. (2020) used a mixed-integer linear program to identify the anchor points of the PPS of the BCC model. Koushki and Soleimani-damaneh (2019) considered anchor points as special properly nondominated solutions of multiobjective optimization problems and provided two algorithms to check whether a given feasible solution is an anchor point. Akbarian (2017) proposed to identify the anchor points of the PPS of the CCR model in the multiple inputs and outputs case through testing all CCR-efficient DMUs by a variant of super efficiency models [refer to Krivonozhko et al. (2015), Bougnol (2001) and Shadab et al. (2020) for more details and applications]. In this paper, by analogy with the work of Mostafaee and Soleimani-damaneh (2014), we establish a connection between the anchor points and super-efficiency models and propose a novel method to identify anchor points of the PPS of the BCC model by testing all BCC-efficient DMUs with a variant of the super-efficiency models (5 and 6) and their duals (8 and 9) (after eliminating the BCC-inefficient DMUs from the PPS). In addition, we present a new characterization of anchor points and the necessary and sufficient conditions for an extremely efficient DMU to be an anchor point. Some useful facts related to the properties of models (5), (6), (8) and (9) are proved. In addition, three numerical examples are provided.",

An increasing number of stores are now accepting payments in the form of cryptocurrencies; thus, there are more opportunities for consumers to make payments using cryptocurrencies. Currently, 60% of Worldpay’s merchants are interested in accepting cryptocurrency as a form of payment (Crypto.com 2022). It has been noted that Bitcoin is a close substitute for cash in the shadow economy (Marmora 2021). The development of blockchain technology has enabled us to issue original cryptocurrencies, which are also called tokens. The ERC-20 token standard, which is based on Ethereum, is a prime example of this phenomenon, as it enables us to issue original cryptocurrencies by writing ERC-20-compatible codes and deploying them to the Ethereum main-net. Notably, the number of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, with more than 18,000 cryptocurrencies existing as of March 2022 (CoinMarketCap 2022). In recent years, numerous fintech-related research works, especially cryptocurrencies, have been conducted (Xu et al. 2019; Kou et al. 2021; Li et al. 2022; García-Corral et al. 2022). Cryptocurrencies have been increasingly used as assets, contributing to growing interest among people. These interests go beyond individuals, as many hedge funds and asset managers incorporate cryptocurrency-related assets into their trading strategies. The number of research papers on cryptocurrency trading has been increasing over the years (Fang et al. 2022). Attaining a currency function would be a topic of interest for cryptocurrency holders and traders. This study addresses the question of whether cryptocurrencies can function as “currency.” In an academic context, currency, also known as money, is defined as a commonly accepted medium of exchange (Hazlett and Luther 2020). We investigate whether cryptocurrencies can function as currency under this definition, that is, whether cryptocurrencies can serve as a means of payment when purchasing various goods at many stores. Furthermore, as the number of original cryptocurrencies is increasing, it is important to determine what paths issuers can take to enable their cryptocurrencies to function as currency. Some cryptocurrencies are designed to define their own economic zone, which is referred to as a token economy. Establishing whether a cryptocurrency can have a monetary function within its scope of use in the token economy is essential for issuers. Research concerning whether cryptocurrencies are or can become currencies in general has been conducted (Yermack 2015; Hazlett and Luther 2020; Kunal et al. 2021; Luther 2016; Folkinshteyn and Lennon 2016; Hazlett and Luther 2019) in particular argue that cryptocurrency is a currency in some parts of society (Hazlett and Luther 2020). However, another study has concluded that it is difficult for cryptocurrencies to be widely used as currency owing to network effects (Luther 2016). Furthermore, studies have investigated whether cryptocurrencies have sufficient ability to play the role of currency in situations wherein cryptocurrencies are used for payment in certain parts of society (Cachanosky 2019; Schilling and Uhlig 2019). Issuers want their cryptocurrencies to function as currency, but merely a few studies have addressed the question of how these cryptocurrencies can acquire a monetary function. This study aims to determine whether issuers can take steps to stimulate cryptocurrencies to acquire a monetary function. This research advances the work of Shibano and Mogi (2021). Two major scenarios are discussed in this study. The first scenario investigates whether increasing the number of stores that accept cryptocurrency goods for payments and raising the awareness of people to such stores can enable cryptocurrencies to attain a monetary function. This situation is related to a sales effort on the part of the issuer to convince existing stores to accept payments in this form and public relations activities. The second scenario studies the conditions of airdrop cases whereby the issuer devises attractive services that make people want to acquire and save cryptocurrencies. The conditions under which a cryptocurrency becomes a currency are analyzed using the Yasutomi model (Yasutomi 1995a, b, 2000, 2003). The Yasutomi model is a multi-agent simulation model for analyzing the emergence of money. The Yasutomi model assumes rational behavior on the part of the agent as an active entity and shows that money, which is a medium of exchange, naturally emerges among goods. The benefit of this model is that it allows computer simulations to be conducted to investigate the emergence of currency, and conditions can be assigned to agents and goods as part of the simulation. Once the code is written, complex manual calculations become unnecessary, and the code can be executed many times under different conditions with slight modifications. In other words, the advantage of this model is its ability to perform simulations of the consequences of issuers’ actions repeatedly and under a variety of assumed conditions. We modify the original Yasutomi model by introducing a fiat money good that represents fiat currency and a cryptocurrency good. We can simulate cases in which the cryptocurrency good either becomes a second currency, which circulates in addition to the original fiat money good, or acquires a monetary function in place of the fiat money good. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section “Introduction” describes the purpose and significance of this study. Section “Literature review” introduces some related existing studies. Section “Simulation model” describes the model used in the study: the modified Yasutomi model. Section “Simulation analysis” presents and explains the results of the analysis of the two scenarios using the proposed model. Section “Discussion” presents a discussion of the issues raised in Section “Introduction” in terms of what can be learned from the results obtained in  Section “Simulation analysis”. Finally, Section “Conclusion” summarizes the conclusions of this study.",3

Complexity in R&D is not isolated to vaccines alone but extends to medical care in general and to all high-end pharmaceutical products. Development of new pharmaceutical products proceeds sequentially, and each step must be satisfied before the compound is approved by health authorities. On average, the entire process takes seven years (Pammolli et al. 2020). Success is rare, with a failure rate of over 96% (Hingorani et al. 2019), caused by economics, lack of efficacy, or safety concerns (Di Masi 2001). Consistently high risks mean that pharmaceutical companies prioritize compound development, given their limited fundingFootnote 1 and the need to provide shareholder returns. The social implications of the current schemes are, therefore, of the utmost importance. Among these concerns are a fair price (Balderrama et al. 2020), the varying negotiation skills of governments and insurance companies, accessible health care in every country, regardless of its economic wealth (Proelss et al. 2021), and ensuring that governments and institutions give the highest priority to health research funding (European Commission 2021), as was the case of Covid-19 vaccines. In this highly complex landscape, crowdfunding − defined as the provision of “financial resources in the form of donations, a future product, service, or some other reward or exchange for shares or debt securities of a company” (Bassani et al. 2019)—is emerging as an alternative mechanism to traditional financing (Cai 2018; Wonglimpiyarat 2017; Kou et al. 2021), which can potentially generate returns (e.g. lending and equity crowdfunding, Martínez-Climent et al. 2018). Crowdfunding in health care, also known as medical crowdfunding (Ren et al. 2020), has already been used in a number of cases. The funds raised have facilitated access to treatment (Kubheka 2020; Snyder 2016), and communities of interest have been built around funded projects (Wilson 2019). However, there are also concerns about exacerbating social inequalities (Berliner and Kenworthy 2017) and the overall effort that is needed (Wilson 2019). Several established crowdfunding platforms regularly host health care-related campaigns: GoFundMe, for example, has reported that one-third of its campaigns are related to medical practice (Allon and Babich 2020). The purpose of this paper is, therefore, to survey and investigate the literature on crowdfunding in order to describe its relations with the health care industry and identify any gaps in the research, whether empirical or theoretical. With this study, we aim to delve into the foundations of health care industry funding standards, seeking the crowdfunding levers and the effects that crowdfunding has on the innovation and accessibility of medical treatments. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. “Theoretical Background” section highlights the extant research and concentrates on the relevant features of the health care industry, exploring innovation in finance, particularly in crowdfunding, and then fills in previous results in literature with additional details. “Methodology” section describes the research methodology. “Results” section gives a first overview of the results, while the emerging themes and trending topics are discussed in “Concept Mapping and Discussion” section. “Conclusions and Implications for Future Research” section contains the conclusions and introduces potential new avenues for research.

8.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,15 September 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-022-00387-w,Consumer choices under new payment methods,December 2022,Jaemin Son,Mehmet Huseyin Bilgin,Doojin Ryu,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Distributed ledger and blockchain technologies, which have emerged with advances in information technology, have created cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Because of the proliferation and rapid rise in the value of many of these cryptocurrencies, some observers have questioned whether these new cryptocurrencies will eventually replace existing fiat currencies. It has also sparked debate about the digitalization of money, prompting several central banks to consider introducing new digital currencies, commonly known as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). The CBDC is a central bank-issued digital currency denominated in the national unit of account (Kiff et al. 2020).Footnote 1 Research on, and issuance, of CBDCs is a global trend. About eighty percent of central banks worldwide are currently conducting extensive research on CBDCs (Boar and Wehrli 2021). Moreover, some developing countries are introducing and piloting CBDCs. For example, the Commonwealth of the Bahamas has adopted a CBDC as its national currency.Footnote 2 CBDCs have several distinct characteristics as a result of digitalization, including the ability to pay or charge interest on the CBDCs, allowing for negative interest rates if desired (Jia 2020). Policy researchers are studying CBDCs, which have distinct characteristics from cash, to evaluate the effectiveness of new monetary policies. Owing to CBDCs’ special characteristics, they not only replace physical currencies but also influence deposit demands. Unfortunately, the existing CBDC studies oversimplify individual payment portfolio changes because of the lack of research on related payment portfolio models. Also, stablecoin, which represents a newly emerging payment instrument,Footnote 3 is not considered in policy research. As cryptocurrency exchanges emerge and the demands for cryptocurrency increase, the interest in cryptocurrencies, such as stablecoins, is also increasing. Stablecoins can be used as a payment instrument. Related to CBDCs and stablecoins, previous studies have narrowly focused on the changes associated with the specific characteristics of these new payment instruments (Auer et al. 2020; Kumhof and Noone 2018). For instance, the previous studies only consider the fragmentary properties of CBDCs, such as their interest rates and abilities to provide transparency and avoid anonymity in transactions (Agur et al. 2022). Although most portfolio theory studies focus on asset selection, only a few analyze payment portfolio models. Unlike other financial instruments, such as stocks and bonds, money is a general payment method that stores nominal value and serves as a medium of exchange. As technology has advanced, the types of available payment methods have expanded from cash to checks, credit cards, debit cards, and direct transfers, thus increasing the need to consider payment portfolios (Schuh and Stavins 2013, 2014). Moreover, because many new payment assets, such as CBDCs and cryptocurrencies, are expected to emerge soon, the number of assets to be included in future payment asset portfolios will likely increase accordingly. Therefore, the introduction of cryptocurrencies and their use as payment assets should be considered in finance and investment studies. In this paper, we (1) investigate economic agents’ demands for newly emerging payment assets and discuss how payment asset properties influence their decisions; and (2) shed light on how demands for the assets’ properties interact with exogenous shocks (e.g., regulatory changes in cryptocurrency exchanges). Our study contributes to the literature by analyzing an agent’s optimal portfolio under new payment systems. First, we classify and present the types and properties of payment assets, including those of new currencies that have emerged as technology advances. Several empirical studies consider agents’ payment asset choices, but only a few delve deeper into the characteristics of each payment asset (Bagnall et al. 2016; Borzekowski and Kiser 2008; Borzekowski et al. 2008; Klee 2008; Qu et al. 2022). CBDC issuances are being considered globally; thus, developing a new portfolio model with CBDCs is important. Moreover, although stablecoins are used only for trading crypto-assets now, they can be more commercialized and used on various payment platforms in the near future. Therefore, our analysis aids in the classification and analysis of future payment assets’ characteristics. Second, we focus on the features of these payment assets to explain the substitutions between payment assets when the exogenous conditions change. Analyzing the relationships between these features and an agent’s portfolio can help guide future policy studies investigating how an agent’s choices change when either the characteristics of payment assets or the agent’s preferences change. Considering the possible impacts on payment asset properties, we discuss the agents’ subjective utility factors and policy variables such as the interest rate. Moreover, we provide macroeconomic implications such as banking crises and financial stability by considering the impact of a CBDC issuance on agents’ payment asset choices and presenting the effects of changes in the interest rate gap between CBDCs and deposits. While previous studies on payment asset portfolios have not examined the role of policy interest rates in depth, our study incorporates policy interest rates directly into the model, which yields policy implications for financial market specialists, such as government departments and central and commercial banks.

Alkabaa,Mustafa Tahsin Yılmaz,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"Declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) has affected the lives of many people in over 192 countries, as it rapidly spread from China to other countries (Qureshi and ul Rehman A 2020; Ye et al. 2020), leading to large-scale quarantine, isolation, travel restrictions, and social distancing measures. Recent estimates indicate that the global economy has experienced a sharp decline by the end of the following year (IMF 2020a, 2020b; McKibbin and Fernando 2020; OECD 2020a; World-Bank 2020). As one of the most severe pandemics worldwide, COVID-19 will have an impact on firm finance and the cost of capital over the next few decades (Goodell 2020). Due to several factors, there is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the future course and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic (McKibbin and Vines 2020). As reported by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2020b), due to the immense drop in sales volumes, logistics problems, and the inability of companies to pay for their suppliers, employees, lenders, and investors, the world has been facing unsurmountable financial issues that cause liquidity problems. Initially, there was an underestimation of the impact of pandemics on the global economy based on these trends. Consequently, weak steps were taken by the financial prudence that inclines investing less and became evident in the aftermath of the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic when the consumption patterns in the global economy changed greatly (Nigmonov and Shams 2021). The failure to establish the necessary cooperation by the G20 countries has caused a sharp increase in the number of consumers who have discontinued their business. The purchasing behavior of consumers has changed, and this has turned into a global crisis, devastating the economy and health sector, ultimately leading to socio-economic changes in the world (Mehta et al. 2020). Therefore, since the collapse of the South Sea Bubble in 1720, global economic activity has suffered the largest collapse caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, a much greater collapse than the global financial crisis in 2008 or the Great Depression in the 1930s (McKibbin and Vines 2020). In addition, in comparison to previous pandemics, COVID-19 is a unique pandemic because it affects not only the population’s health but also their transportation and societal welfare (Sadang 2020). Curfews began suddenly, and people felt as if they were psychologically imprisoned. This has pushed scientists and policymakers to exert a worldwide effort to mitigate the medical, economic, and sociological impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such efforts have turned into multidisciplinary endeavors to find solutions and develop strategies to address essential problems. In such efforts, the most important method is applied in the medical field, in which vaccines have been developed to prevent the virus, and many medicines and medical practices have been launched to cure those suffering and prevent them from spreading the infection to other people (Al-Awadhi et al. 2020; Nour et al. 2020). Another method can be the application of policies to provide social and physical distance and the implication of lockdown to curb and/or confine the transmission of the virus. However, even if such efforts assist in controlling the outbreak in most parts of the world by late 2021, the self-reinforcing dynamics of a recession may prolong the slump until the end of Q2 of 2022. Therefore, other economic efforts should also be exerted to neutralize the negative worldwide economic and sociological effects of the pandemic. Since its appearance, recent studies have substantially focused on stock markets to analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and a large number of studies have been published on stock markets using different approaches (Youssef et al. 2021). However, data on the pandemic are heterogeneous; therefore, the problem was considered from a wider perspective, which requires consideration of some clustering techniques, such as data mining, to analyze the data heterogeneity. In this respect, the dynamics based on temporality and geospatial information were scaled, which could enable the prediction of interconnected dynamics in pandemics, such as the number of hospital beds, COVID-19 cases, deaths, recoveries, percentage of vaccinated population, GDP per capita, industrial production, and the amount of money spent by the governments. In this respect, some stochastic approaches have been applied to scale the dynamical progress during pandemics in countries to code similarities using clustering. Therefore, unsupervised (clustering) models have been extensively proposed to identify and uncover hidden patterns in the data (Li et al. 2021). Compared with supervised (classification) models, clustering models play an essential role in industrial and financial businesses. Kou et al. (2021) propose a novel model for predicting bankruptcy based on payment and transactional variables by selecting the best class that includes the optimal variables. It is possible to model the forthcoming dynamics of countries based on established clusters together with their similarities (Murali 2020). Accordingly, to slow down the transmission of the pandemic, various dynamic precautions that are substantially based on metadata from cleanliness, continual disinfecting, social distancing rules, and prohibition of public transmission have been applied in various countries (Murali 2020). For this purpose, the search engine tool to collect data from Google Trends was used to measure people’s interest in the COVID-19 outbreak in six countries (Costola et al. 2020). The effect of the lockdown on financial indices and relevant lead lag indications in Italy was observed based on stock indices employed to carry out time-varying analysis. Cavallo (2020) gathered data from credit and debit transactions in the United States to analyze the alterations in consumption expenditure samples due to the COVID-19 pandemic to predict the consumer price index. As can be seen, the effect of the pandemic has been analyzed based on several sectors, varying from stock indices to consumption habits. In such analyses, q-Gaussian distributions have been used to forecast the S&P500 stock index based on COVID-19 projections (Karina et al. 2020). A large volume of literature has reached conclusions on the effects of the pandemic on stock market dynamics; however, there is still a very limited number of studies that examine the impact of COVID-19 on the aforementioned dynamics leading to the economic recession. In addition, although G20 brings together the leaders of the world’s largest economies (McKibbin and Vines 2020), to the best of our knowledge, no prior study has analyzed the economic recession in the G20 countries; therefore, the focus of the present study is to use data-mining tools to cluster and objectively distinguish G20 countries in terms of their GDP/capita, industrial production, and government spending (Johns Hopkins COVID-19 epidemiological data such as COVID-19 cases per population), COVID-19 deaths per COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 recovery per number of COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 vaccinations per population, and hospital beds per 1000 people. Although the economic activities for investing in public health in the G20 countries differ, this study explored practical evidence that significant economic benefits can be achieved by improving health conditions in the G20 countries and many other countries outside the G20 group. In addition, this study sheds light on significant gaps in the interconnected dynamics of the economy, and the findings can be handled by future researchers interested in the discipline. The objectives and novelty of this study are as follows: To use a data capture framework for integrating data records on GDP/capita, industrial production, and government spending for consecutive economic decision making To suggest a data-mining (DM) tool for generating a dynamic clustering map with a resilient data-driven method that can determine the reactions of G20 countries based on the captured data To explain how clustered G20 countries have reacted to this pandemic concerning the variables mentioned earlier and the reasons for specific countries by focusing on specific economic variables To suggest a new, particularly cogitated clustering algorithm that decision-makers such as medical doctors and administrators of the health industry, economy and finance authorities, politicians, and sociologists can use to identify the possible economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in different G20 countries To present and discuss how policymakers should take steps for economic reforms to improve GDP and public health and maintain the production growth rate during the pandemic",4

Kabir Hassan,Naznin Akther,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The global financial crisis in 2008 instigated developing a stable, transparent, independent, and sustainable financial system worldwide (Kayed and Hassan 2011; Petrick 2009). These financial anomalies have strained regulators consistently restrict managerial activities with rigid rules. However, facts have shown otherwise. Strict regulation in financial sectors probes a lack of investor confidence, which is against the logic of sustainable development (Nguyen 2016). Besides the regular performance agenda among the financial institutions, transparency in corporate data have been critical factors of investor confidence (Berger et al. 2011; Hoff and Stiglitz 1990; Nguyen 2016). Recent financial scandals and the adverse impact of the financial crisis on the performance of microfinance institutions (MFIs) urges for a sustainable financial model. The precondition of a sustainable model is that an institution must have been operating without any significant influence from any internal and external institutions, which may include intermediaries, government, and relevant regulators (Adegbite et al. 2013). In practice, the traditional MFIs operation permits external institutions to privatize profits and socialize the potential losses (Adegbite et al. 2013; McGuire and Conroy 2000). However, the two are not necessarily in tension. Literature indicates that recent digital innovations, such as blockchain, have great potential to change today's business mechanism and an entire economy (Nguyen 2016). As a way out, tech-savvy enthusiasts use the internet and innovate blockchain embedded cryptocurrency. Sulkowski (2018) examined entrepreneurs' opinions who actively bring blockchain-embedded technologies into the potential market. The results reveal that blockchain-enabled technologies improve transparency and reliability which will only be realized when there is a supportive law framework. Besides the 'tamper-proof' technology of blockchain from alteration of data, some high-profile hacks treat blockchain as un-hackable as the Titanic was unsinkableFootnote 1! Even if the technology works flawlessly, the underlying human fascination for corruption while creating the underlying records cannot be tackled using blockchain technology.Footnote 2 Blockchain is just a technology. It could be an immutable database system with excellent tracing records capabilities promoting transparency. Yet, it is just a system in which the accuracy of its output depends on the accuracy of the input. Besides a flawless blockchain-enabled technology for MFIs operation, a supportive legal framework and government policy are prerequisites before offering a sustainable model. The application of blockchain-enabled technologies in recent times reportedly functions well in diverse areas: inventory authentication (Düdder and Ross 2017); proof-of-provinces (Verberne 2018); good labor environment and practiceFootnote 3 along with finance sectors (Chen and Bellavitis 2020; Treleaven et al. 2017; Xu et al. 2019). The first cryptocurrency was launched in 2009 with the name bitcoin that works as both a payment system and a fully digital currency (García-Corral et al. 2022). Today there are more than 6,537 cryptocurrencies on the market and 200 tokens.Footnote 4 Recently the term blockchain has shifted slightly to mean distributed ledger technology, which sheds light on a worldview that blockchain technology has potential application possibilities in many sectors beyond today's imagination (Dujak and Sajter 2019; Iansiti and Lakhani 2017; Wang et al. 2018; Fang, F., Ventre, C., Basios, M. et al.,2021). This paper proposes a blockchain-embedded model for its sustainable development and operations for microfinance institutions. The ability to access credit in MFIs have restricted the potential growth and development of MFIs in many countries (Azad et al. 2016). Having considered the principles of blockchain technology, this paper proposes a theoretical model that will make MFIs operations sustainable. This proposed model is named a sustainable model considering its capacity to reduce profit rate for credit distribution (Hassan 2014; Chong 2021) and reduce information asymmetry due to theoretically meager chances to manipulate information (Hoff and Stiglitz 1990). Islamic MFIs, like other MFIs, aim to provide financial services on a micro-scale to assist poor people who are forsaken by commercial banks (Handayani et al. 2018). Islamic MFIs can only offer contracts to their clients based on pre-agreed profit- and loss-sharing partnerships. Thus, a blockchain embedded interest free model is most suitable for Islamic MFIs by ensuring their stability. The contributions of this proposed model are threefold. First, by challenging the conventional credit system, our proposed blockchain-embedded model solves some critical issues in Islamic MFIs, such as information asymmetry and credit rationing, which ensures the financial sustainability of MFIs and enhances social outreach. A lower profit rate will be charged by the MFIs because the information in blockchain consensus cannot be altered or amended. Thus, the consensus mechanism will enable the risk-sharing character of Islamic MFIs (Mohamed and Ali 2018). Second, we remove the traditional non-negativity restriction in the credit rationing approach, which allows profits to be negative, and developed a model theory that does not need collateral during the loan/credit evaluation process. Third, our proposed model helps ensure sustainable social wealth by enhancing social welfare and provides a reliable and transparent credit system compared to conventional credit systems. Additionally, reliability and transparency will improve quality disclosure to lenders and borrowers and regulatory agencies and governments by facilitating the standardized monitoring of MFIs. In recent literature, monitoring has been identified to reduce loan repayment problems (Berns et al. 2021) and corrupt behavior (Azim et al. 2017). At this point, the decentralized sharing of information through our proposed model will solve the current monitoring challenges of MFIs, helping to build reputation and image by reducing the possibility of corruption scandals. This paper has six sections. The second section reviews the literature on Islamic MFIs. ""Blockchain technology: scope and areas of application in Islamic MFIs"" section explains the scope and principles of blockchain technology for sustainable operations of Islamic MFIs. The proposed model for sustainable MFI operations is given in ""Proposed model for MFIs"" section, followed by propositions in ""Propositions"" section. Finally, ""Conclusion"" section is the conclusion.",1

8.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,23 August 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-022-00383-0,Speculative bubbles and herding in cryptocurrencies,December 2022,Ozkan Haykir,Ibrahim Yagli,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Financial technology—especially payment and money transfer systems—has become quite popular owing to its considerable contribution to the financial system by lowering trading costs and improving trading quality (Kou et al. 2021). Cryptocurrency, powered by blockchain technology, is an exceptionally innovative product that has shaped financial technology in recent years. Rising public interest in cryptocurrencies and soaring cryptocurrency prices has ignited discussion in both academic and political fields. Social and economic aspects, two essential aspects in cryptocurrencies, have received considerable attention. Discussions on the social aspect predominantly focus on using cryptocurrencies in illegal transactions such as money laundering and illicit financing. Conversely, discussions on the economic aspect revolve around issues such as efficiency, diversification benefits, and price dynamics (Corbet et al. 2019; Jalal et al. 2021).
 Our study concentrates on the economic aspects of the cryptocurrency market and attempts to determine whether cryptocurrencies prevail in bubble behavior, given the rapidly increasing prices during the unstable market conditions brought by the COVID-19 pandemic (Jalal et al. 2021). We also investigated co-explosivity among cryptocurrencies to understand the transmission of bubbles from one cryptocurrency to another. Furthermore, we examine determinants of the bubbles by addressing herd behavior and cryptocurrency-specific and market-related factors. Soaring cryptocurrency prices, without any clear justification, have triggered suspicion about whether these sharp price increases represent speculative bubbles. The possibility of bubble formation in cryptocurrency prices originates from several factors. First, a bubble is characterized as a divergence between an asset’s market value and intrinsic value. Cryptocurrencies, for instance, have no fundamental value (Cheah and Fry 2015). Second, digital currency market inefficiency (Urquhart 2016; Zhang et al. 2018; Cheah et al. 2018) may cause explosive cryptocurrencies price movements. Third, bubbles are closely related to technological innovation (Pástor and Veronesi 2009; Frehen et al. 2013). Therefore, expecting cryptocurrency market bubbles is plausible owing to cryptocurrencies being financially innovative products. Fourth, cryptocurrencies seem to be speculative investments rather than real currencies (Yermack 2015). Monetary expansion during the pandemic may cause bubbles in these speculative assets’ prices. Furthermore, common beliefs regarding cryptocurrencies soon becoming a widely payment method also trigger sharp increases in cryptocurrency prices (Chaim and Laurini 2019). Fifth, the limited supply of most cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Cardano, and Stellar) may induce bubble formation in cryptocurrency prices. Tirole (1985) highlights that scarcity is one of three conditions for bubble formation. Cryptocurrencies’ maximum supply limit creates a suitable environment for bubble formation. Scarcity creates an over-expectation of future profits, causing speculative bubbles. Finally, many investors do not have sufficient knowledge on cryptocurrencies. A survey conducted by Cardify (2021) confirms that many investors possess a low level of cryptocurrency knowledge. Lack of financial literacy may also cause inexperienced investors to mimic others’ transactions (Bouri et al. 2019), resulting in extreme price movements. Based on the above possibilities, our study attempts to detect bubble behavior in the cryptocurrency market during the pandemic and determine the underlying factors behind speculative bubbles. This study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, while bubble formation has been addressed empirically in several asset classes (e.g., stocks, currency, gold, energy, and real estate) (Johansen and Sornette 1999; Assenmacher and Czudaj 2015; Sharma and Escobari 2018; Zhang et al. 2021; among others), bubble behavior in the cryptocurrency market is an emerging field of study. Furthermore, while recent studies deal with the speculative bubbles in cryptocurrencies, they predominantly analyze the existence of bubbles in Bitcoin, the best-known and most-traded cryptocurrency (Cheah and Fry 2015; Geuder et al. 2019; Chaim and Laurini 2019). Hence, evidence of the presence of bubbles in alternative coins (altcoins) is scarce (Kyriazis et al. 2020). Unlike other studies, our study analyzes bubble formation in altcoin prices with the highest market capitalization, along with Bitcoin. Second, although several studies have addressed the existence of bubbles in cryptocurrencies (Cheah and Fry 2015; Corbet et al. 2018; Geuder et al. 2019; Chaim and Laurini 2019; Enoksen et al. 2020; among others), no study has investigated bubble behavior in the cryptocurrency market amid the COVID-19 pandemic, where investing behavior has changed due to discontinued operations and measures taken by policymakers (Mandaci and Cagli 2021). COVID-19 has dramatically affected financial assets, particularly stocks; however, cryptocurrency prices, especially those of altcoins, rose sharply during COVID-19 and peaked during the pandemic period.Footnote 1 Several studies have reported that cryptocurrencies acted as safe havens during the pandemic (Corbet et al. 2020; Demir et al. 2020; Goodell and Goutte 2021; Mariana et al. 2021). Conversely, numerous studies have revealed that cryptocurrencies are not a safe havens (Conlon and McGee 2020; Conlon et al. 2020; Będowska-Sójka and Kliber 2021). Additionally, COVID-19 is expected to trigger explosive behavior as it reduces market efficiency (Narayan 2020). Considering ambiguous evidence regarding the safe haven property of cryptocurrency and decreasing market dynamics, we investigated bubble formation in the COVID-19 pandemic. Third, and most importantly, this study attempts to explore the factors behind bubbles in cryptocurrencies. Recently, Enoksen et al. (2020) investigated cryptocurrency bubble determinants by addressing volatility, transactions, volume, popularity, and uncertainty. We extend literature on the determinants of cryptocurrency bubbles in three aspects. We address whether herding behavior is one of the drivers of bubbles (Johansen and Sornette 1999). Cryptocurrencies are new and complex financial assets, and factors affecting their prices remain unclear. Furthermore, many investors have low cryptocurrency knowledge (Cardify 2021). Additionally, the cryptocurrency market is inefficient (Urquhart 2016; Zhang et al. 2018; Cheah et al. 2018), and cryptocurrency price volatility is higher than that of traditional investment tools. Furthermore, one salient property of the cryptocurrency market is its decentralized financial system; hence, no official authority protects uninformed small investors. These cryptocurrency market properties may cause uninformed investors to mimic the transactions of other market participants. Previous studies have also provided strong evidence of herding in the cryptocurrency market (Kallinterakis and Wang 2019; Vidal-Tomas et al. 2019; da Gama Silva et al. 2019; Kaiser and Stöckl 2020; Ballis and Drakos 2020; Susana et al. 2020; Papadamou et al. 2021; among others). More importantly, cryptocurrency investors tend to herd as uncertainty increases (Bouri et al. 2019). Hence, herding behavior is more likely to prevail during the pandemic when global uncertainty is extremely high. In addition to herding, we attempt to understand the effects of other covariates on bubble behavior. Recently, cryptocurrencies have attracted considerable attention worldwide. Jalal et al. (2021) claim that cryptocurrencies’ lower transaction costs, unique peer-to-peer transaction platforms, and fewer regulations are the reasons for its popularity among investors. Rapid cryptocurrency market growth also increases the curiosity, capturing determinants of cryptocurrency returns among academics and investors. Ciaian et al. (2016) suggests that cryptocurrencies have similar underlying characteristics as equities; therefore, factors that can predict equities can be used to understand future price movements of cryptocurrencies. Based on this similarity, studies have used two sets of variables: cryptocurrency-specific and market-related. The first set captures determinants directly associated with cryptocurrencies (e.g., volatility, trading volume, or past returns). For instance, Balcilar et al. (2017) propose that trading volume is key for predicting expected return on Bitcoin. Kristoufek (2013), Panagiotidis et al. (2018), and Aalborg et al. (2018) show that Google Trends’ search volumes are associated with future cryptocurrency returns. Rohrbach et al. (2017) and Bianchi and Dickerson (2019) suggest that a momentum strategy provides abnormal return in the cryptocurrency market. The latter comprises variables associated with the overall market, such as market returns. Finally, the lack of cryptocurrency information (Cardify 2021) and no conventional fundamental pricing models for cryptocurrencies (Shahzad et al. 2022) provide a set ground for explosivity in one cryptocurrency that can be transmitted to others (Bouri et al. 2019). Therefore, we investigate cryptocurrency co-explosivity to understand how bubbles in one cryptocurrency may lead to explosive behavior in others. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. “Theoretical framework and literature review” section summarizes the theoretical framework and prior literature. “Data and methodology” section explains our data and methodology. “Empirical results” section presents our empirical findings, and “Robustness analysis” section provides robustness checks. Finally, “Conclusion” section provides concluding remarks and policy recommendations.",7

8.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,15 August 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-022-00379-w,Raising capital amid economic policy uncertainty: an empirical investigation,December 2022,Dawood Ashraf,Mohsin Khawaja,M. Ishaq Bhatti,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Over the past two decades, firms have operated in an increasingly uncertain economic environment, and financial markets have experienced significant volatility. Consequences of uncertainty include a decline in business activity (Işık et al. 2020), rising financing costs (Waisman et al. 2015), wider yield spreads (Bradley et al. 2016), shorter maturities of debt financing (Datta et al. 2019), and elevated risk premia for equity investments (Li 2017; Pástor and Veronesi 2013). We posit that when firms operate in an uncertain economic environment, there is an increased demand for capital to mitigate adverse effects brought by the macroeconomic environment. Corporate finance literature offers several explanations about firms’ decision to raise capital and their choice of financing instruments (Haddad and Lotfaliei 2019; Nagar et al. 2019; Baker and Wurgler 2002; Myers and Majluf 1984; Jensen and Meckling 1976; Modigliani and Miller 1958; Ross 1977).Footnote 2 However, the intervention of central banks during economic crisesFootnote 3 through quantitative easing and asset purchase programs and shifts in ownership structure of US firmsFootnote 4 has altered funding mechanisms and influenced risk-averse firms’ choice of financial instrument toward relatively “safe” bonds and leverage (Giambona et al. 2020; Kurtzman and Zeke 2017). Building on our initial postulation that firms raise more capital during periods of high economic uncertainty, we hypothesize that the ownership structure of firms plays a significant role in determining the choice of financial instrument to raise capital. As such, this paper addresses three interrelated questions. First, does economic uncertainty lead firms to raise capital more frequently? Second, how does a firm’s ownership structure affect the choice of financing from a range of instruments, namely bank loans, bonds, convertible bonds, preferred equity, and common equity? Finally, what determines the volume of issuance given the choice of financing instrument? We assert that the initial decision to raise capital, followed by a choice of security selection and financing volume, are sequential and reflect a firm’s policy choices.Footnote 5 Addressing these questions concurrently requires the use of a simultaneous equation framework. The application of this framework is an important contribution of this study. This study uses a sample of 45,635 firm-year records with 13,308 instances of capital financing for the period beginning January 1, 2000, until December 31, 2018.Footnote 6 We find evidence suggesting a higher propensity for debt financing by a factor of 27.63% as the volume of debt per issuance, on average, exceeds that of equity during the sample period. We find a positive association between economic uncertainty and the decision of firms to raise capital, supporting evidence that the demand for capital is stimulated by economic uncertainty (Husted et al. 2019; Atta-Mensah 2004; Klein 1977; Hartman 1972). In line with pecking order theory, we find that high economic uncertainty is associated with an increased demand for capital and that debt-based securities are the instruments of choice. We find support for the control hypothesis whereby shareholders, particularly in firms with a higher proportion of institutional investors, prefer to raise capital using debt-based instruments to avoid ownership dilution and higher equity premia (Admati et al. 2018; Badoer and James 2016; Ellul 2008; Levy 2019). This finding also complements Tran (2019) that higher economic uncertainty is associated with low corporate risk-taking. By using interactive variables, we find that large firms raise lower volumes of capital in the presence of political uncertainty, indicating their risk-averse behavior (Chan et al. 1985). Further, we find that certain governance mechanisms play a significant role in the process of raising capital. As an alternative to the economic policy uncertainty index, we use the implied volatility index (VIX) as a measure of market uncertainty. The results remain robust despite using an alternative measure for economic uncertainty. As a further robustness check, we adopt the multinomial logit model with sample selection (MLMSS) as an alternative methodology for empirical estimation. Unlike the sequential model with a categorical choice variable for financing instruments based on the pecking order theory, the choice decision variable under MLMSS does not consider a strict order. Essentially, by treating financing instruments independent of each other in a multinomial logit model, we isolate the appeal for individual financing instruments.Footnote 7 In addition, we estimate the base model using the classic Heckman selection model (Heckman 1979; Heckman et al. 2006) in which the volume decision depends on the initial decision to raise capital, implying that the decision for the choice of instrument is redundant. Our results remain consistent after applying the three models. This study contributes to the literature on corporate finance and political economy by offering evidence on how economic policy uncertainty, ownership structure, and governance mechanisms affect financing decisions. The use of a better estimation methodology, namely a three-step sequential framework with a wide range of instruments, is an important contribution of this paper. The model helps to remove sample selection endogeneity concerns. It also helps to establish that the three decisions are not independent and should be analyzed sequentially. Besides improving estimation methodology, this study also contributes to the literature by quantifying the difference between the average volume of financing using either debt or equity securities during the sample period. The role of corporate ownership structure, particularly the presence of institutional investors in the capital raising process, is another pertinent contribution of this paper. Our findings have implications for investors and policymakers alike. Recent open editorials (Vandevelde 2020; Warsh 2020) highlight, in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic that a loose monetary policy environment and direct intervention by central banks in the secondary markets may induce a moral hazard for issuers and investors. This is particularly relevant to the finding that firms raise more capital during periods of high economic uncertainty. In uncertain situations like the Covid-19 pandemic, the heightened uncertainty increases firms' propensity to borrow through banks, but higher risk aversion and decreased liquidity cause banks to curtail their lending resulting in a sluggish economic recovery.Footnote 8 In response, central banks often loosen monetary policy to encourage lending. The anecdotal evidence suggests that higher demand for debt associated with higher economic uncertainty implies that there is a need for scrutiny of such policies as they may pose a threat to the safety of the financial system through excessive lending and often to failing firms. Therefore, it is pertinent for capital market regulators and financial regulators such as the central bank to assess the behavior of firms raising capital during periods of high uncertainty along with their preferred mode of financing, either debt-based or equity-based, to help shape the monetary policy decisions. Moreover, the findings are helpful for both corporate investors and shareholders who are seeking to determine the target capital structure of their firms in light of changing economic conditions. For example, institutional shareholders tend to prefer debt over equity when seeking capital. A further increase in leverage during uncertain times will increase bankruptcy costs and affect credit ratings. Therefore, corporate investors such as bond holders may impose leverage rationing as a way to reduce bankruptcy costs to the firm. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section presents a brief literature review and develops testable hypotheses. In “Empirical methodology” section presents the empirical methodology used to support this research.

It does this through the lens of the response to regulations imposed by the Frank-Dodd Act of both traditional banks and their online P2P competitors. The later are sometimes colloquially referred to as “FinTechs”, in reference to their use of financial technology. In fact, P2P lenders are a subset of the FinTech sector. As P2P lenders are not deposit takers, they are subject to less regulation than traditional banks. Small businessesFootnote 1 are the backbone of the U.S. economy and the provision of credit is central to their functioning Footnote 2  Since 1995, small businesses have created two—thirds of every new job and have employed half of the private sector workforce (Mills and McCarthy 2014). The sourcing of credit is therefore of practical as well as scholarly importance. Innovation, in the form of FinTech, and P2P lending over the Internet, is changing lending dynamics (Broby 2021). Small firms are now getting access to credit from these non-traditional sources. Small business loansFootnote 3 are also one of the primary sources of external financing for small firms. This type of funding is crucial to helping small enterprises maintain cash flow, purchase new inventory or equipment, hire new employees, and grow their business (Mills and McCarthy 2014). However, after the financial crisis bank loans declined and small business lending decreased by almost 18% over the period from 2008–2011 (Cole and Damm 2020). In contrast, the volume of loans exceeding $ 1 million in size grew by 80% in the same period (Bordo and Duca 2018). At around the same time, P2P lending grew to become a viable alternative source of credit for small businesses.Footnote 4 We build on a growing body of literature. Gopal and Schnabl (2022) address a similar question to us but from the perspective of a shock (based on balance sheet impact of accounting rule FAS 166/167) and their definition of FinTech lenderFootnote 5 is very different from ours. They highlight that the total small business loans held on the balance sheet of the 10 largest banks in 2016 was $10.28 billion. This contrasts with the significantly lower figure of $268.7 million for total small business, loans as at that date, for FinTech lender. This represents approximately a ratio of 3,826 to 1, which highlights the nascent level of the FinTech lenders. It has been documented that the 2008 global financial crisis hit small businesses disproportionately. It was suggested that this was because they had less financing options than larger businesses (Wille et al. 2017). Although large firms have more varied sources of financing, such as direct credit, issuing and selling debt to investors, corporate bonds and commercial paper, small firms have limited or no access to equity capital markets and public institutional debt (Şahin et al. 2011). As such, they rely heavily on bank loans. The innovative nature of P2P lending changed that at around the same time as our study (Brill 2010). P2P lenders employ a process model that we argue widens access to smaller firms (Wang et al. 2015). It has not previously been investigated whether this model affords P2P lenders a regulatory advantage. The Dodd–Frank ActFootnote 6 established new prudential standards including liquidity, enhanced risk–based and leverage capital, risk management and risk committee requirements; single–counterparty credit limits; stress test requirements (The Federal Reserve System 2018). Bordo and Duca (2018) suggest that small business lending from the banks was hindered in the U.S. as a result of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street ReformFootnote 7 (commonly referred to as Dodd–Frank Act) and the Consumer Protection Act enactment on July 21, 2010. According to academic studies (Bordo and Duca 2018; Acharya et al. 2018; Bouwman et al. 2018), the regulations of the Dodd–Frank ActFootnote 8 strained already high operational costs and increased capital constraints on banks, especially those with $10 billion or more in assets under the Federal Reserve's stress test requirements. The cumulative number of regulations are detailed in Fig. 1. Cortés et al. (2020) claim that such stress tests create a direct link from bank lending risk to capital and impose heavy capital requirements on small business loans. Therefore, the Dodd–Frank Act regulatory requirements cut down on the incentives for banks to make loans to serve businesses, especially small businesses, for which bank credit is one of the important sources of external financing (Mills and McCarthy 2014). Source: Regdata Total cumulative regulations from the Federal Reserve Board (FED) from 1999 to 2015. The figure shows how the number of bank regulations have increased steadily over the period 1999–2015. The dotted line in the chart indicates the date when the Dodd-Frank Act passed in 2010 to regulate banks. The bank regulations accumulation accelerated between 2009 and 2010, and there was a more remarkable rise in total regulations in 2010 and after four years, as the FED added over 3,000 new regulations in response to Dodd-Frank Act. RegData can be downloaded from https://quantgov.org/regdata/. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the average tier 1 risk-based ratio of U.S. banks increased by 22–27% between 2008 and 2015 (Buchak et al. 2018). In addition, banks with more than $10 billion in total consolidated assets are subject to an annual stress test which consists of dynamic capital requirements that impose risk-sensitive capital buffers on banks for expected deterioration in an adverse economic scenario (Bindal et al. 2020). In addition, Bindal et al. (2020) state that stress tests impose dramatically higher capital requirements on small business lending. As mentioned, during the same period, the credit needs of small businesses started to be targeted by a new set of lenders that use innovative FinTech to disrupt the small business lending market (Mills 2018). These are collectively referred to as Peer–to–Peer lenders. Although being small relative to incumbents, these alternative lenders provide rapid turnaround and online accessibility for borrowers and use new data-rich credit score algorithms (Palladino 2018). According to Jagtiani and Lemieux (2016), these lenders are enabled by technology and have little (or indeed, are not subject to any) regulation. It could be argued this makes alternative lenders attractive to small business lenders in a post-crisis environment, and thus emerging of alternative P2P lenders had begun to alter the game for how small businesses access financing in the U.S. (Mills and McCarthy 2014). Alternative P2P lender total loan origination volume, loan application number and county number are presented in Table 1. In order to provide causal evidence that the Dodd Frank Act impacted the provision of loans to small businesses, we use a quasi-natural experiment. This allows us to investigate how the new requirements affected treated banks with $10 billion total assets or more small sized business loans supply relative to untreated banks with less than $10 billion assets. It allows us to evaluate how the lack of the regulatory requirements gave FinTech lenders an advantage. Firstly, to address the impact on the banks, we used small business bank and county-level data. We replicate the method used by Tang (2019). After classifying treated and control banks (1), we investigate trends at the county level some counties have banks that were subject to the regulation, and others did not. It is suggested that those counties that had an impact from the Dodd-Frank Act saw less competition in banking, and therefore saw less of an impact. This follows the observations of Boot and Thakor (2000) regarding the development of relationship lending when there is less interbank competition. We measure the banking competition intensity by (1) the concentration ratio of the “big three banks” (C3) and (2) the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (HHI) using the banks’ market share in terms of bank branches number in counties following Degryse and Ongena (2007) and Chong et al. (2013). Treated counties are defined as counties if there is a bank with $10 billion assets or over which subject to the Dodd-Frank Act. We define treatment groups as counties with a high concentration of Dodd-Frank eligible banks. We further classify them as where there is a low banking competition at the 75th percentile of C3 and HHI. This means that where there is a bank asset that is below $10 billion, and there is a high competition at the 25th percentile of C3 and HHI, it is defined as a control county. In this way, our sample can be used to identify the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act impact on (1) aggregate county-level small business lending. Further, it can be used to identify (2) alternative P2P lender activity in treated and control counties. In this regard, according to the results in Table 5, we conclude that treated banks saw a decrease in the amount of small business lending. In addition, we note that county-level aggregate small business loan volume declined after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. At the same time, when bank small business loan supply declines, demand for alternative P2P lending increases. Supportive of our findings in the concentrated counties, Hodula (2022) found evidence that FinTechs may act as substitutes in highly concentrated markets. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first paper to investigate the activities of both traditional banks and innovative alternative lenders in the small business market using the Dodd-Frank Act as an exogenous shock at the county level. In addition, our paper adds alternative P2P lenders to the debate in the literature on small business lending (e.g. Buchak et al. 2018; Tang 2019; Fuster et al. 2019; Hughes et al. 2022; De Roure et al. 2022). We note that Bordo and Duca (2018) and Zou (2019) also focus on small business lending and the global financial crisis. We, however, utilize the Dodd-Frank Act’s impact on small business lending to identify the regulatory advantage of the P2P lenders. Despite a large volume of published studies on bank regulations, a small subset of them focuses on the Dodd-Frank Act (e.g. Krainer 2012; Acharya and Richardson, 2018; Balasubramnian and Cyree 2014; Dimitrov et al. 2015; Akhigbe et al. 2016; Lutz 2016; Li et al. 2016; Andriosopoulos et al. 2017; Allen et al. 2018; Bouwman et al. 2018; Calem et al. 2020; Bindal et al. 2020). After the credit crisis, regulation was focused on both capital and liquidity requirements by regulators, particularly in view of the fact that reserve requirements for U.S. banks. According to Thakor (2018), higher capital requirements can make it more challenging for banks to attract capital, and so they decreased lending in response to an anticipated rise in regulatory capital requirements after the financial crisis. There are several reasons why small business owners might turn to business loan alternatives. These include lower credit requirements, easier qualification and faster approval thanks to innovative technology (Milne and Parboteeah 2016). Akhigbe et al. (2016) present evidence that following the transition of the Dodd-Frank Act, banks discretionary risk-taking decreased due to the rising bank capital ratios and banks decreasing their non-performing loans levels. Andriosopoulos et al. (2017), meanwhile, investigate the impacts of key legislative events of the act and their conclusions support our view that there were changes to the competitive structure of the financial services industry. Allen et al. (2018) further investigate the market’s response to the elimination of too-big-to-fail for large banks against the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act and suggest that act do not eliminate Too-Big-to-Fail banks. In their recent study, Calem et al. (2020) investigate banks stress test exercises impact on the supply of mortgage credit which is implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing (DFAST) regulatory programs and according to the paper that stress tests only alter originations of credit in the jumbo mortgage market. Additionally, Bindal et al. (2020) investigate the Dodd-Frank Act’s size based regulatory requirements impact on banks merger and acquisitions and small business lending. Their results indicate that the size-related regulatory thresholds created by the Dodd-Frank Act has significant real effects on loans to small businesses but have indirect treatment effects on bank acquisitiveness. In summary, our use of the Dodd-Frank Act as a natural experiment ties together separate strands of the literature relating to small business lending and the growing role of innovative alternative lenders.",1
8.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,29 July 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-022-00376-z,The impact of working capital management on credit rating,December 2022,Ala’a Adden Abuhommous,Ahmad Salim Alsaraireh,Huthaifa Alqaralleh,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"In light of the 2008 financial crisis, credit-rating scores (CRSs) released by credit-rating agencies have grown in importance (Hung et al. 2017). Credit-rating agencies play a vital role in capital markets by reducing the moral hazard problem. In addition, credit ratings help investors assess the creditworthiness of issuers and the financial securities issued by them (Lee et al. 2021). Furthermore, credit ratings are used as a benchmark based on which investors manage their portfolios. Finally, they play an important monitoring role, as they may require firms with rating deteriorations to take corrective actions to minimize these deteriorations (Huan and Mohamed 2021). Additionally, CRSs have become a crucial tool that helps investors in their investment decision-making process, as they help investors identify risky assets, price their credit, and allocate their capital more efficiently (Amato and Furfine 2004). Investors are highly concerned about borrowers’ ability to fulfil their obligations (Haspolat 2015). Moreover, Bauer and Esqueda (2017) point out that banks rely on credit rating scales to compensate for information deficits when making loan decisions. Thus, a considerable amount of literature has been published on the impact of factors such as firm-specific characteristics [Return on Assets (ROA), size, and liquidity], corporate social responsibility (CSR), and operational leanness on the corporate credit rating (Attig et al. 2013; Hung et al. 2013; Bendig et al. 2017; Dong et al. 2021). However, to our knowledge, no previous study has investigated the impact of working capital management (WCM) on a firm’s credit rating. A key aspect of a WCM decision is its impact on a firm’s risk, return, and valuation (Smith 1980). Many researchers have attempted to investigate the impact of WCM on firms’ financial performance (e.g., Aktas et al. 2015; Jose et al. 1996; Shin and Soenen 1998; Deloof 2003; García-Teruel and Martínez-Solano 2007). These studies have mainly focused on the impact of WCM on a firm’s profitability performance. The interesting point here is the consensus that maintaining a high level of net working capital (NWC) reduces a firm’s risk and profitability. The results of these previous studies led us to take the research on this topic a step further and investigate the impact of WCM on a firm’s credit rating. Understanding this relationship is of high importance for corporate managers in their quest for external financing, especially after the 2008 financial crisis (Hung et al. 2013). One would expect that maintaining a high level of working capital would enhance a company’s credit rating since it reduces risk. However, is this always the case? Besides reducing risk, previous studies have shown that holding a high level of working capital reduces profits. This particular observation raises a major concern about the effect of low profits on a company’s ability to cover interest payments, especially since a company’s reliance on external financing would increase as the level of working capital increases (Kieschnick et al. 2013). This concern may indicate that maintaining a high level of working capital may enhance a company’s credit rating for a certain period but become harmful thereafter. This argument suggests a concave relationship between WCM and credit rating. Furthermore, this concave relationship postulates that firms could have an optimal working capital ratio to reduce risks and improve credit ratings. Therefore, we expect a positive or negative deviation from the optimal working capital to have an adverse effect on the evaluation of a firm’s risk and ultimately impact the firm’s credit rating. To this end, this study distinguishes itself from previous studies in the following aspects: first, it examines the possible concave relationship between WCM and credit rating; second, it conducts a deeper analysis by investigating the impact of three important components of working capital, namely inventory (INV), accounts receivable (AR), and accounts payable (AP), on a firm’s credit rating; and finally, it investigates the impact of deviation from the optimal working capital on a firm’s credit rating. This study attempts to answer the following questions: (1) Does WCM and its components affect the credit rating? (2) If so, what is the nature of this relationship? Finally, (3) does deviation from optimal working capital affect a firm’s credit rating? Utilizing annual panel data of U.S. listed firms from Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) merged with Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP)/Compustat files for the period between 1985 and 2017, we find evidence to draw the following conclusions. First, there exists a positive relationship between WCM and credit rating. Second, we find that high investments in working capital have an inverse impact on CRSs; thus, our results support the non-linear relationship between WCM and credit rating. Third, there exists a nonlinear relationship between the components of working capital (inventory and accounts receivable) and CRSs, while accounts payable have a negative relationship with credit scoring. Finally, the results show that firms have an optimal level of working capital and deviation from this target harms their credit rating. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: “Literature review and hypotheses development” section discusses previous studies on WCM and credit ratings; “Methodology” section presents the study methodology and research design; “Data and descriptive statistics” section presents the data and descriptive statistics sample and data resources; “Empirical results” section presents the empirical results; and “Concluding remarks” section concludes the paper.",2

8.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,12 July 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-022-00366-1,Measuring the model risk-adjusted performance of machine learning algorithms in credit default prediction,December 2022,Andrés Alonso Robisco,José Manuel Carbó Martínez,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"While machine learning (ML) algorithms seem to outperform traditional quantitative models in terms of predictive capabilities, especially from the supervisors’ perspective, they also pose new risks. Some of them, as cited in the supervisory and regulatory literature (see European Banking Authority 2017a; 2020; Dupont et al. 2020), are associated with interpretability, biases or discrimination, prediction stability, governance or changes in the technological risk profile due to exposure to cyber risk, and dependence on external providers of technological infrastructure. Supervisors face the challenge of allowing financial institutions and clients to maximize the opportunities stemming from technological progress and financial innovation, while observing the principles of technological neutrality, regulatory compliance, and consumer protection. According to the International Institute of Finance (2019b), given the steep learning curve of ML as a technology, supervisors struggle to keep up with its fast-moving pace (Wall 2018). Therefore, it is appropriate to continue refining their knowledge about how financial institutions use ML to monitor new model risks as they arise and understand how they might be mitigated. To overcome this challenge, we suggest a framework that allows the establishment of a bridge between the qualitative list of risk factors usually associated with ML and how to obtain a risk score for each model. As stated in Jung et al. (2019), regulation is not seen as an unjustified barrier, but some firms stress the need for additional guidance on how to interpret it. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate ML algorithms used for credit default prediction via their model risk-adjusted performance. To build our framework, we must first identify the key components of model risk from the supervisor’s perspective. For this purpose, we study the compatibility of ML techniques with the validation process of internal ratings-based (IRB) models to calculate the minimum regulatory capital requirements. Although the IRB approach is restricted to capital requirements, it has an impact beyond this use, considering that the risk components estimated using IRB models (e.g., probability of default) must be aligned with those used internally for any other purpose. We identify 13 components that we refer to as risk factors and classify them into 3 different risk categories, namely, statistics, technology, and market conduct issues. Of these risk factors, we focus on a subset of them to represent the overall risk of the model. For instance, in our exercise, in the statistics category, the risk score is computed only on the basis of the stability of the predictions, measured as the standard deviation of the predictions of the models when using different sample sizes, as well as the number of nonzero hyperparameters. For the technology category, the score depends on the transparency of the algorithm and the latency (number of seconds) of the training as a proxy for the carbon footprint (Strubell et al. 2019). For the market conduct category, the score depends on the latency (number of seconds) of the computation of the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) for the interpretability of the results. The final risk associated with a particular ML model will depend on the final score of each risk category weighted by the importance or intensity of the regulatory requirements of each category, subject to each use case of the model (capital, credit scoring, or provisioning). To compute these weights, we propose a novel approach based on natural language processing (NLP). First, we collect a series of regulatory texts for each use case, and we calculate the importance of each risk category according to the intensity of mentions in the documents, using our own risk terminology based on expert knowledge, representative of the universe of each risk category. For instance, we find that statistical risks are more important for regulatory capital, while technology and market conduct risks are more important for credit scoring. We test our framework with five of the most used ML models in the credit risk literature: penalized logistic regression using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), decision tree (CART), random forest, Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and deep learning. Using a public database available on Kaggle.com for credit default prediction, we compute the potential model risks from validating these models and their potential predictive performance. We find that, for this particular database, XGBoost and random forest are the most efficient risk-adjusted models. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. in “Literature review” section, we review the literature on the use of ML for credit default prediction. In “Identifying the risks: compatibility of ML with the IRB validation process” section, we identify the potential limitations of using ML in credit default prediction by reviewing the IRB system under the Basel Accords. In “Quantifying the model risk” section, we demonstrate how our framework measures the potential model risks and benefits from the use of ML by credit institutions from the supervisor’s perspective. In “An empirical example” section, we show an empirical example of our framework, and the conclusion is presented in “Conclusion” section.",3

M. Virgilio,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The debate regarding the factors affecting the price of securities has persisted for a long time among academics and practitioners. Although the presence of arbitrage opportunities as well as noise traders are theoretically accepted feats, a commonly accepted theory among academics and practitioners is that efficient markets are populated by well-informed, rational investors. Yet, arbitrage, which aligns asset prices to actual values and corrects the damage caused by market anomalies, is regarded as a factor mitigating such damage. As long as arbitrage opportunities circulate among investors, it is impossible to generate abnormal profits consistently. On the contrary, should one agent display a permanent advantage over all other participants, the game would no longer be fair, and markets would cease to be efficient. This phenomenon has been taking place over the last two decades as a result of the introduction of high-frequency trading (HFT). Fortunately, for market fairness, it is never just one player who enjoys high-frequency (HF) capabilities. Although they are a minority, several trading firms access exchange servers at subsecond speed. This phenomenon ensures a clear advantage over traders that operate at “human” speed. However, competition is still possible; HFT is simply a different way of trading. Slower traders exploit their superior capabilities in market analysis and hope to achieve long-term profitability, whereas fast traders act upon other parameters to win a short-term game. The main reason to propose a theory of Very Short-Time Price Changes (VSTPC) is the lack of a comprehensive and coherent theory to explain their characteristics. Numerous hypotheses and vast knowledge about price changes are scattered sparsely among several papers, books, and conference proceedings, but they do not constitute a unified theory. According to the findings of this research, some well-established price change factors do not carry much weight when observed at a Very Short Time (VST) interval, whereas other important factors are often overlooked. Academic research has produced a large body of literature about price changes, yet it fails to differentiate generic price changes from the much more peculiar field of VSTPC or systematize the currently available research into a coherent and comprehensive theory. Indeed, as will be discussed below, most widely mentioned factors are irrelevant at VST. This theory attempts to demonstrate that very often, only four factors affect price changes at VST—volatility, liquidity, volume, and stop-loss (SL) orders. The main hypothesis states that the nonlinear combination of otherwise tolerable factors may lead to a nonlinear outcome, potentially causing financial instability, extreme events, and crises.",2

Time-series evidence supports the notion that corporate investments are influenced by waves of investor optimism and pessimism. According to Arif and Lee (2014), periods of higher corporate investment correspond to periods of investor optimism and are followed by periods of lower aggregate stock returns. Managers increase (decrease) capital investments during periods of optimism (pessimism) because they overestimate (underestimate) the present value of expected future cash flows. Aggregate investments negatively predict future market returns because managers, like investors, are frequently too optimistic (too pessimistic). They conclude that investor sentiment influences real managerial decisions, either because managers rationally exploit market misvaluations (“managerial catering” hypothesis) or because they are caught up in market euphoria (“expectation bias” hypothesis) and make more capital investments. They demonstrate the tendency for aggregate investment to increase during periods of high consumer confidence, high net inflows into equity markets, and high sentiment, as measured by the Baker–Wurgler sentiment index. Baker et al. (2003)’s cross-sectional findings suggest that corporate investment is sensitive to nonfundamental changes in stock prices. Their main prediction is that stock prices will have a greater impact on the investment of “equity-dependent” firms, which require external equity to finance marginal investments. In particular, firms in the top quintile of equity dependence have investments that are nearly three times as sensitive to stock prices as firms in the bottom quintile. Standard corporate finance considerations suggest that equity-dependent firms tend to be young and have high leverage, low cash balance and cash flows, high cashflow volatility (and hence low incremental debt capacity), and strong investment opportunities. They discover average negative investment-future returns sensitivity, which becomes increasingly negative as equity dependence increases. Similarly, prior research indicated a negative relationship between aggregate mutual fund flows, flows from the bond to equity mutual funds, and future market returns. According to Ben-Rephael et al. (2012), mutual fund trading activities generate nonfundamental price pressure on aggregate stock prices, which reverts in the short term. Accordingly, in bullish markets, equity mutual funds receive inflows that must be quickly equitized by fund managers. They are experiencing outflows in bearish markets, and managers reduce their positions because of redemption pressure. Due to the tendency of retail investors to herd, the directional trading of mutual funds is correlated. As a result, mutual funds’ collective actions generate short-term price pressure on aggregate stock prices. Correlated net inflows (outflows) cause upward (downward) price pressure and subsequent negative (positive) returns. Hence, the reversal relationship can be linked to price “noise” caused by uninformed trading stemming from sentiment. In this vein, I investigate the impact of flows between the bond and equity funds on investment factors in the United States from 1984 to 2015. Based on previous evidence, I hypothesize that market euphoria affects retail investors’ and managers’ decisions. Retail investors are shifting their holdings from bond to equity mutual funds, and high-investment firms are investing more aggressively. “Aggressive” managers are caught up in market euphoria; thus, they invest more, and high-investment stocks are overpriced. Because high- and low-investment firms are assumed to be differentially impacted by market-level euphoria during these periods, high-investment firms earn higher returns than low-investment firms. Consequently, the investment factor may be influenced, and the contemporaneous relationship between net exchanges and the investment factor can be interpreted as negative. Subsequently, the reversal relationship is stronger and, therefore, returns for the high-investment portfolio are significantly lower than those for the low-investment portfolio. Hence, if both retail investors and managers are overly optimistic, I anticipate that an investment factor will perform particularly well in the coming period (the lagged relationship between net exchanges and the investment factor can be assumed to be positive). Overall, I find contemporaneous mispricing effects and a statistical reversal relationship between net exchanges, flows from bonds to equity funds, and both legs of the investment factor. The statistical reversal relationship between previous net exchanges and the investment factor is economically significant. Moreover, a one-standard-deviation shock to net exchanges causes a 0.29% decrease in investment factor returns, which are all reversed within 5 months. A trading strategy based on signals from past net exchanges and the investment factor outperforms the market by 0.68% in the months following positive net exchanges and produces significant alphas after accounting for well-known equity risk factors. My findings are interpreted as evidence in favor of a behavioral explanation in which sentiment influences real managerial decisions. Interestingly, in the regressions, my measure of flows from bonds to equity funds, which serves as a proxy for market-level euphoria, outperforms other indicators of investor sentiment. The rest of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the relevant literature. Section 3 describes the data and presents summary statistics. Section 4 discusses my empirical findings regarding the relationship between factor portfolio returns, net exchanges, and market stress indicators. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes with a summary of the major findings.",

Rather than being issued by competent governmental authorities, their implementation is based on the principles of cryptography used to validate all transactions and generate new currency. Every transaction that occurs is recorded in a public ledger.Footnote 1 The blockchain, and more in general distributed ledgers, facilitate innovation in multiple domains of activity. These include, but are not limited to, supply chain management, data sharing, accounting, e-voting, or, as the most prominent area, finance [see, e.g., the overview in Casino et al. (2019)]. While it is indisputable that the blockchain by itself had and has a great influence on public discourse, with innovation potential comparable to that of the Internet (as it fosters a decentralized infrastructure for economic transactions), financial experts remain generally skeptical. The implementation and the characteristics (including the strictly technological ones) of blockchain technology, when proposed as a replacement for standard fiat currency are subject to ongoing discussion (Berentsen and Schär 2018; Dierksmeier and Seele 2018; Ertz and Boily 2019; Glaser and Bezzenberger 2015). A major problem surrounding cryptocurrencies—but also, one of the reasons why they have become well known to the general public—are the heavy tails of their return distribution (Chan et al. 2017) and their volatility (Bariviera 2017), resulting in a rich history of “bubbles” (Gerlach et al. 2018). Although the innovative potential of distributed ledger technologies is vast, the innovation itself does not necessarily translate into trust (see, e.g., Bodó 2021). Traditional markets and exchanges were fairly successful in establishing a trustworthy environment via governmental or international institutions, robust legislative activity, market regulations, and effective monitoring/oversight systems. This development took many decades after a long history of market abuse (Putniņš 2012), and remains an area of active research. It can be said that each new case of market abuse brought a better understanding of market vulnerabilities and often led to viable countermeasures. Furthermore, every new technology potentially brings new techniques for committing fraud. Now, cryptocurrencies, crypto-assets, and various forms of blockchain services are still in their infancy. Therefore, new methods need to be invented or reinvented for this new medium to establish a reliable and fair market environment, ideally while maintaining the decentralized and (semi)anonymous nature of the underlying blockchain technology. With this motivation, we focus in this study on one example where cryptocurrency market was supposedly manipulated via fraudulent actions of one market participant. A data-driven model is developed and validated using historical data. The behavior of the fraudulent entity is investigated in detail and included in the model. Toward the end, we conclude our investigations with a discussion on how our findings can be applied to improve trust by reducing the present vulnerabilities of crypto-markets. In the remainder of this section, we will provide a brief overview of the study on frauds on cryptocurrencies, on agent-based modeling (especially in the context of crypto markets), and we will then highlight the specific contributions of this paper. Several illicit activities are related to cryptocurrencies, such as black-market trading (Foley et al. 2019), money laundering, and terrorist financing (Fletcher et al. 2021).Footnote 2 In our case, we focus on fraud that targets and disrupts the market. A more common form of fraud in crypto markets is wash trading (Cong et al. 2020; Victor and Weintraud 2021). The principle of wash trading is to execute trades where the buyer and seller are the same entity. Thus, false impressions of highly traded assets are created to mislead investors. Another more serious form of fraud observed in crypto markets is pump-and-dump schemes (Kamps and Kleinberg 2018), which typically take the form of coordinated actions to increase the market price in a short time period (Hamrick et al. 2019; Li et al. 2018). In the literature, we find various studies that attempt to explain price as a direct consequence of manipulative behavior. A study (Gandal et al. 2018) analyzed suspicious market practices on the Mt.Cox exchange concludes that fraudulent actions influenced the price growth from $150 to $1000 in late 2013. More recently, Griffin and Shams (2019) argue that the Bitcoin market price might have been inflated by the issuance of Tether. As observed in a 2014 study (Robleh et al. 2014), Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies served as a medium of exchange for a relatively small number of people; therefore, they pose no serious material risk to monetary and financial stability, but today investors increasingly involve crypto-assets in their portfolios, and some large companies or payment services are already accepting payments in Bitcoin. This means that cryptocurrency volatility can potentially be a new source of systemic risk to the entire economy and financial sector. Recent studies have approached risk using methods such as clustering (e.g., Li et al. 2021), multi-objective feature selection (e.g., Kou et al. 2021), or network analysis (e.g., Anagnostou et al. 2018). Focusing more on the source of systemic risk originating in illicit behavioral schemes, although advances in detection of wash trading (Victor and Weintraud 2021) and pump-and-dump schemes (Chen et al. 2019) are already taking place, new models are needed that can explain, simulate, or possibly predict the effects of fraudulent behavior, and that can serve as a testbed for testing the effectiveness of policies, regulations, or monitoring enforcement mechanisms. One way to satisfy this demand is to consider models that combine qualitative and quantitative knowledge, which can be designed with a strong reliance on empirical data and can simulate various scenarios to address questions regarding the effectiveness of regulatory interventions in the crypto market, as discussed in Shanaev et al. (2020). Agent-based models generally aim to explain some complex phenomena, where the emergent behavior at the macro-level is hypothesized to be a consequence of behavioral rules at the micro-level. For a historical review, we refer to Chen (2012). In recent years, this modeling paradigm has been enhanced by more modern data-driven approaches, where behavioral data specific to each agent are used to construct, initialize, or estimate the parameters of a model of each agent’s decision mechanism. Only a relatively small number of parameters are left to be calibrated for the aggregated data, which increases the model’s validity and credibility. With this approach, even large-scale models are capable of rivaling the predictive power of traditional quantitative methods, for example, in the area of economic research (Poledna et al. 2019). These models can be particularly instrumental if the parameters of individual agents are of vital importance, for example, to test interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic (Kerr et al. 2021). In the literature, several examples of agent-based models can be found that have been created to gain insights into crypto markets. Most of these models are based on various financial or behavioral assumptions. To the best of our knowledge, the first study in this area is Luther (2013), where agents are put into a currency market with switching costs and network effects to investigate the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrency. A similar question was studied by Bornholdt and Sneppen (2014). An implicit assumption of demand was made in Cocco et al. (2017), enhanced by speculative traders and restricted by finite resources for each agent, and is the earliest example of a limit order book-based model of the Bitcoin market attempting to explain the price increase from the start of 2012 to April 2014. This model was later extended by mining (Cocco and Marchesi 2016) and evolutionary computation (Cocco et al. 2019). Other order book models are presented in Pyromallis and Szabo (2019) and Zhou et al. (2017), where the focus is mainly on the adaptive behavior of traders. In Lee et al. (2018), a combination of inverse reinforcement learning directly from Bitcoin blockchain data and order book agent-based modeling was used to make short-term predictions of the market price. Recently, models focusing on policy recommendations have also been developed. Shibano et al. (2020) is introducing a price stabilization agent to reduce the volatility, and Bartolucci et al. (2020) investigates design extension of the Bitcoin blockchain to increase transaction efficiency. A strong aspect of the agent-based models is that they provide an experimental environment for policymakers. Once a behavioral schema is identified, methods to measure and assess the consequences are settled, and the consequences are measured; the simulated environment can be utilized to test the effectiveness of certain measures, that is, a set of alternative policies to be tested, given some adaptation rate, monitoring, enforcement, and identify the best one. In recent review (Lopez-Rojas and Axelsson 2016) agent-based models are considered as a tool for generating synthetic data for machine learning models, which can be used, for example, to complement more traditional evaluation methods (Kou et al. 2014). Most notably, agent-based models were developed in the area of urban crime modeling (Groff et al. 2019) or to study the behavioral aspects of tax evasion (Pickhardt and Prinz 2014). In principle, these models are not limited only to observed fraudulent behavior: they can extend the design of fraud committing agents by considering different schemes of market manipulation methods to measure and assess the consequences. By choosing a suitable representation of the fraud schema, it is possible to find more sophisticated patterns of reasoning for a fraudulent agent [e.g., by applying algorithmic evolutionary methods (Hemberg et al. 2016)]. Most studies focus on analyzing the statistical relationship between price and a set of exogenous variables. Conversely, in this study, we focus on the qualitative explanation dimension. Our approach builds on the qualitative findings in Griffin and Shams (2019), but, in contrast to this study, we construct a data-driven model, focusing mainly on the causal influence of the fraudulent behavior that supposedly inflated the Bitcoin price. This methodological innovation can be regarded as the main contribution of this study, along with the conceptualization of a specific fraud schema as an algorithm that can be executed by an agent in a simulated cryptocurrency market. Note that this approach opens the door to a broader view on the role of the fraudulent trader in the Bitcoin market, thus allowing to analyze the situation from various points of view. For instance, as our market model is capable of generating market data such as the market price, the market volume or the Bitcoin inflow of the fraudulent trader, it is possible to compare these quantities to empirical data. In particular, we discover that certain anomalies in market volume or dips in market price can be attributed to the actions of a fraudulent trader, an experimental conclusion, which completes the evidence presented in Griffin and Shams (2019). Furthermore, the model developed in this study allows us to investigate specific reasons behind the success of the market manipulation via the fraud schema. Connections between the efficiency of a specific manipulation strategy and transaction costsFootnote 3 will be explored. To do so: a realistic model of order book liquidity has to be implemented. Most studies implicitly or explicitly assume sufficient liquidity near the mid-price and an exponential decrease in liquidity further away from the mid-price, using a Gaussian assumption, or more relaxed forms.Footnote 4 We propose a new liquidity distribution model based on a mixture of two components. The Gaussian assumption is kept near the mid-price, and beta distribution is used to model the situation more deeply in the order book. The study of market manipulations (and their consequences) has a long tradition in the economic literature (Putniņš 2012). To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first to construct an agent that reproduces the actions of a fraudulent trader directly using blockchain transaction data, and reconstructing the market behavior from this predictor. In addition, our simulation environment can be easily expanded with more sophisticated artificial intelligence models, thus contributing to the active area of research concerned by the integration of artificial intelligence with blockchain technology (Pandl et al. 2020; Salah et al. 2019). Focusing on the economic study dimension of the paper, most of the assumptions we formulate to construct the proposed computational model attempt to provide a sound story (based on previous studies analyzing the Bitcoin market) aiming to reconstruct market behavior in a given time period. Our findings might challenge the opinion that the main predictors of the Bitcoin bubble of late 2017 and the beginning of 2018 would be variables associated with the market sentiment (see Kapar and Olmo 2021). While we do not deny that market sentiment plays a major role, our results confront the thesis that the occurrence of this price bubble is spontaneous or a consequence of the widespread popularity of Bitcoin. In this sense, we contribute to the ongoing discussion among economists on the price formation of cryptocurrencies.",3

Every segment in this group simultaneously produces and consumes clean energy (Sahoo and Hota 2021). Moreover, a common battery is available to store excess energy. If the batteries are fully charged, the excess electricity is supplied to the grid. However, if the energy produced in the system does not meet the needs of the institutions in the group, energy is demanded from the grid (Vanashi et al. 2022). In this system, segments that have extra energy can sell this surplus to parties that demand more energy (Norouzi et al. 2021). Hence, one of the greatest advantages of this system is that excess energy can be used efficiently. Additionally, owing to this system, it will be possible to solve the high-cost problem, which is an important obstacle to clean energy investments (Ghazvini et al. 2021). This situation contributes positively toward increasing clean energy investments such that the carbon emission problem can be handled more effectively. Investments in microgrid energy management systems should be increased to ensure efficient clean energy usage. Therefore, the financing needs of these investments should be satisfied effectively (Atahau et al. 2021). Crowdfunding is also a mechanism that can facilitate the achievement of this goal by bringing project owners and investors together. This system promotes the project through digital platforms so that project owners can reach a wider investor base (Pitchay et al. 2021; Berné-Martínez et al. 2021). Several factors must be considered to design crowdfunding systems appropriately. For example, there should be multichannel communication and rapid feedback on customer questions (Kou et al. 2022; Tang et al. 2021). Furthermore, projects should be introduced adopting user-friendly interfaces. Moreover, security conditions should be satisfied with the help of fraud protection policies and strategies to inhibit misuse by third parties (Peng et al. 2021). Effective crowdfunding platforms contribute positively to the improvement of microgrid energy management systems. Hence, a comprehensive analysis is required to identify the critical issues for success in crowdfunding systems by considering various criteria. In this study, a novel fuzzy decision-making model is developed to evaluate crowdfunding platforms for microgrid project investments. The analysis process includes two different stages. First, the selected criteria for crowdfunding platforms are weighted. Second, alternatives regarding microgrid project investments are ranked. In this process, the multi-stepwise weight assessment ratio analysis (M-SWARA) method based on q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) is considered. Furthermore, intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs) are also used as weight criteria to make a comparative evaluation. Similarly, a sensitivity analysis of the ranking alternatives is also applied with 12 different q values. Another model is also generated for this purpose with the help of the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methodologies to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. In this context, the weights are also calculated based on the DEMATEL methodology, with the aim of comparing the results with those obtained via the M-SWARA approach. Moreover, with respect to the ranking of the alternatives, another evaluation is performed using the TOPSIS approach to check the coherency of the proposed model. Additionally, different analyses are undertaken to compare the two models. Within this framework, comparative ranking alternatives are computed for different q-values. In addition to this issue, sensitivity analysis is applied to understand whether there is any specific impact of the weights of the criteria on the ranking results. Thus, the weighting results are changed consecutively, and six cases are considered based on q-ROFSs. Based on the consistency of the analysis results, it will be possible to determine which model is more successful. The main novelty of this study derives from its comprehensive evaluation to identify the key items of an effective crowdfunding system by considering a detailed list of criteria. The analysis results have a leading role for both investors and academics. This study makes an important contribution to the development of clean energy investment projects. Fossil fuels generate carbon emissions that significantly harm the environment. This situation has had a negative impact on the socioeconomic development of countries (Biswas et al. 2021). Clean energy projects should be increased to minimize this problem. However, high costs are a crucial barrier to improving these projects (Qureshi et al. 2020). The analysis results of this study will help in the construction of an effective crowdfunding platform for microgrid energy management systems. In other words, this platform has a positive influence on society while minimizing the carbon emission problem caused by fossil fuels (Azad and Chakraborty 2020). Additionally, this study has some methodological originalities. For instance, with the help of the SWARA methodology, it is possible to remove some criteria based on expert evaluations (Ronaghi and Ronaghi 2021; Vahabi Nejat et al. 2021; Maghsoodi et al. 2019). In the literature, there are many different studies that consider the SWARA methodology for different purposes (Torkashvand et al. 2021; Yücenur and Ipekçi 2021; Ulutaş et al. 2021; Saraji et al. 2021; Akcan and Taş 2019). However, in this study, an extension of the SWARA method, that is, the multi-SWARA approach, is proposed to determine the relation degrees and weights of the criteria properly. Hence, in contrast to previous studies, this study proposes an original methodology to evaluate crowdfunding platforms for microgrid project investments. Furthermore, the use of q-ROFSs provides the opportunity to consider a more detailed space (Garg et al. 2021; Paryani et al. 2021; Ali et al. 2021a,b). Therefore, more appropriate results can be obtained by considering these sets (Ali and Sarwar 2021; Asif et al. 2020). Thus, the decision-making problem becomes very complicated. Therefore, there is a need for a new approach for this process. Consequently, in many different studies, multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) techniques have been considered with fuzzy logic (Meksavang et al. 2019; Liang et al. 2019). Additionally, different fuzzy sets, such as trapezoidal and Gaussian fuzzy sets, have also been generated to obtain more appropriate results (Yang et al. 2021; Berkachy 2021; Azam et al. 2021). Similarly, in this study, q-ROFSs are considered because they focus on a more detailed space in the analysis process (Akram et al. 2021a,b,c). Hence, these sets help to minimize the uncertainty problem in the decision-making process (Habib et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2020). Furthermore, making a comparative evaluation via the IFSs and PFSs is another novelty of this study. This situation helps to evaluate the results by considering different perspectives. In other words, it provides an opportunity to measure the reliability of the analysis results of the proposed model. Some researchers have proposed a fuzzy decision-making model that considers only one type of fuzzy set (Yüksel et al. 2021; Dinçer et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2019). In these models, the results could not be tested using different fuzzy sets. Moreover, performing a sensitivity analysis with 12 different q-values improves the quality of the proposed model. The main reason is that this analysis helps to check the validity and consistency of the findings (Kirişci et al. 2021; Jafar et al. 2021). The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: second section presents a literature evaluation of the effectiveness of crowdfunding platforms. The methodological information is presented in third section. The results are provided in fourth section, while the findings are discussed in fifth section.",11

8.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,19 April 2022,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-022-00350-9,Cloud economy and its relationship with China’s economy—a capital market-based approach,December 2022,Lichao Lin,Adrian Cheung,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Cloud technology is one of the globally recognized emerging technologies in the new millennium that are most likely to change people’s lives. As quoted in Thornburg (2009), “Cloud Computing” was first proposed by John Gage who envisaged that “the network is the computer.” Precisely, cloud infrastructure comprises server hardware, network equipment, storage systems, and proprietary software (Bayrak et al. 2011), which is designed to help companies to build an accessible program with their infrastructure through web services (SDX Central 2011) to promote software product upgrading (Alarcon and Pavlou, 2017). In 2006, Amazon launched the Elastic Compute Cloud Service, which marked the start of the cloud business model. In August of the same year, Eric Schmidt, CEO of Google, formally introduced the concept of “cloud computing” at the Search Engine Strategies Conference and Expo and announced in 2007 that Google would cooperate with IBM in the field of cloud technology in 2007. Since then, tech giants have flocked to the cloud industry. In the next four years, the development of the cloud computing industry in developed countries accelerated (Lu and Zhang 2020), and the world entered a new era—the cloud economy. As an emerging general technology, cloud computing poses a great challenge to the concepts and practices of traditional computing technology (Coyle and Nguyen 2020). For example, a centralized data center can use a public cloud platform to provide citizens with sufficient public and innovative services (Kaminsky et al. 2020). Thus, using cloud computing, organizations can take advantage of economies of scale to innovate efficiently and quickly (Gkika et al. 2020). Although it is an emerging concept and industry, the economic benefits of the cloud are obvious. The great prospect of the cloud industry is its potential to accelerate and promote the new model of information and communications technologies (ICTs)-driven economic growth (Iansiti and Richards 2012). SAP (2012) pointed out three factors that underline the success of the development of the cloud economy, including the cloud economy ecosystem, the new business environment and business development model, and a vision to help small and medium-sized enterprises out of technical bottlenecks and assist large enterprises in integrating technical standards. Coincidentally, at the 4th Annual American Business Research Conference in New York, from a financial perspective, Yamin and Tsaramirsis (2012) proposed a concept of cloud economy characterized by infrastructure, systems, and services. The cloud has the advantage of “enhancing the financing capacity of enterprises with little capital funding.” There is no doubt that it has made an outstanding economic contribution to modern ICT and played an important role in its development (Riley et al. 2017). The cloud can help enterprises to strengthen their longevity and resilience by reducing operating costs and enhancing flexibility in strategic decisions (Etro 2011). Jin and McElheran (2019) pointed out that, unlike previous technological revolutions, key features of the cloud are particularly useful for firms facing high uncertainty (such as young firms) because a key ability of the cloud is to pool resources across a wide range of firms to obtain shared economies of scale in IT services, providing these firms with more flexible IT solutions at lower upfront or average costs. In addition, this flexibility allows these firms to try different types of IT solutions with much shorter learning curves and lead times, thus significantly reducing trial and error costs. Cloud computing and its related IT services equip these firms with a means to achieve better performance before gaining their own experience and scale. In addition, manufacturing enterprises can benefit from cloud-based sales and marketing, enterprise resource planning, supply chain management, and payment. They increasingly rely on bundled IT services for data collection, storage, analysis, and communication. Despite many benefits, Jin and McElheran (2019) also discussed some limitations of the development and promotion of cloud-based IT services. These limitations include the following. (1) IT solutions are usually very standardized and may not be suitable for important core business functions within a firm. (2) Data security is always a concern. For example, firms may lose control over their data or software upgrade plans if it outsources IT solutions on the cloud (Rashid 2016). (3) Unpredictable and uncontrollable downtime of IT solutions are other issues that cannot be overlooked (Weise 2017). (4) Finally, the unit costs of the cloud may be not competitive when compared with the cost of setting up a data center for personal use (Metz 2016). To a large extent, the cloud has become a positive force for transformation in technology, business, and beyond (Hooton 2020), and applications of the cloud are almost everywhere. Although people find it difficult to track its footprint accurately, it does not prevent the arrival of the third industrial civilization, bringing about a complete overturn of previous norms of human existence. In the past, researchers focused primarily on using cloud technology to enhance business operation efficiency and promote the digitalization of the market to improve public order. Their research was about the development and use of cloud technology. Few scholars have realized the importance of understanding the cloud economy from a valuation perspective; research that has studied the macro-implications of the cloud economy is rare. Although there is an increasingly closer relationship between enterprises and cloud activities, little attention has been paid to measuring the development of the cloud enterprise market and how it is related to the economy. In addition, existing research about the cloud economy is based primarily on developed countries rather than emerging markets (Joia and Marchisotti 2020). Most scholars have studied and explained only the definition and utility of cloud computing but have rarely summarized the economic value of the cloud. Anecdotal evidence (such as cloud-related news, reports, and policies issued by domestic or foreign research institutions or government agencies) suggests that the cloud economy has grown gradually (see some examples in “Appendix”). Therefore, a systematic study of the development of the cloud economy and how it is related to the economy, especially in China, is needed. Using China—the largest emerging market in the world—as the object of this study, we aim to describe and quantify the relationship between the cloud economy and its economy. To understand the relationship between the cloud and the macro-economy effectively and to quantify the substantial contribution of the development of the cloud economy, we first compare the concepts related to the cloud economy, briefly analyze the application of the cloud economy, and propose a reasonable definition. Based on this definition, we construct a China Cloud Economy Index (CCEI) and use this index as a proxy for the cloud economy in China. Using the stock market as a lens to capture the economy, we analyze how the CCEI (as a proxy for the cloud economy) is related to the stock market (as a proxy for the economy). The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. ""Literature review"" section  reviews the relevant literature and develops hypotheses. ""CCEI"" section outlines the design and details of CCEI. ""Market performance of CCEI"" and ""Robustness check of the alternative measure of CCEI"" sections present the empirical results and robustness check results, respectively. The conclusions are discussed in ""Conclusion"" section.",1

9.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,20 June 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-023-00491-5,Latency arbitrage and the synchronized placement of orders,December 2023,Wolfgang Kuhle,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The execution of large stock orders moves prices, which is costly for the investor. To reduce these costs, orders are usually broken-up into several smaller orders, which are then placed on different exchanges. Moreover, to ensure that other market participants cannot engage in arbitrage, these smaller orders are sent to exchanges, such that they are executed simultaneously. One obstacle to such simultaneous order executions are randomly varying latencies.Footnote 1 In what follows, we describe the problem of latency arbitrage for the contemporary stock market design. In a second step, we propose a mechanism that helps investors to avoid the costs of latency arbitrage. Our model assumes that investors buy and sell one homogenous asset on two geographically distinct exchanges. Trading is complicated by randomly varying latencies, and by the presence of high-frequency traders (HFTs), who enjoy lower latencies than all other market participants. This model reveals that contemporary stock market designs, where traders can only choose when to send orders, are prone to latency arbitrage. This observation motivates an alternative market design, which allows traders not only to choose when to send orders but also to specify the time at which their orders are executed after reaching the exchange. Recent latency data indicate that this enables traders to synchronize order executions across different exchanges, such that HFTs can no-longer engage in latency arbitrage. Stiglitz (2014), Budish et al. (2015), and Aquilina et al. (2021) reviewFootnote 2 several proposals aimed at reducing latency arbitrage. One line of research recommends to Tobin-tax financial transactions, or to tax high-frequency trading, or to tax low-latency infrastructure. Other arguments, aimed at diluting the speed advantage of HFTs, involve reductions in the speed with which exchanges process orders, or limits to the speed with which market participants can place/cancel orders. Other models suggest that fast traders should compete in a “fast market,” while slow traders participate in a “slow market.” All these proposals have in common that they place additional restrictions on markets and market participants. The present study offers an alternative perspective: it demonstrates that latency arbitrage can be addressed by removing, rather than adding to, the restrictions that market participants face. Perhaps closest to the present approach is Budish et al. (2015), who argue that latency arbitrage is “a symptom of a flawed market design.” In turn, Budish et al. (2015, p. 1549), propose that exchanges should limit trade to discrete points in time, which makes it harder for HFTs to front-run other traders’ orders. Unlike Budish et al. (2015), who propose a “discrete time trading” constraint, the present study argues that traders should be endowed with finer, rather than coarser, instruments, which make it easier for traders to cope with random latencies. Put differently, the new order type proposed here is a finer instrument in the sense that it gives traders additional choice variables, which help them to better express their preferences over the execution times of their trades. The market design proposed by Budish et al. (2015) is coarser in the sense that it constrains all market participants to trade at discrete, prescribed, points in time. To better understand why our arguments differ from those in Budish et al. (2015), it is useful to note that Budish et al. (2015, p. 1552), view the presence of latency arbitrage opportunities, as an exogenous, empirical, fact. That is, they observe “obvious mechanical arbitrage opportunities, available to whoever is fastest. For instance, at 1:51:39.590 PM, after the price of the ES [Chicago] has just jumped roughly 2.5 index points, the arbitrage opportunity is to buy SPY [NYSE] and sell ES [Chicago].”Footnote 3 In the present paper, on the contrary, such arbitrage opportunities result endogenously whenever traders place orders which, due to random latencies, are not executed simultaneously across exchanges. Creating such arbitrage opportunities is (1) costly for traders and (2) can be avoided if traders can specify the time at which orders are executed after reaching the exchange. Put differently, once traders use the order type proposed here, the arbitrage opportunities, upon which Budish et al. (2015) build their argument for slowing markets, are no-longer present. The present paper shows that there exists a mechanism, which helps traders to avoid the costs of latency arbitrage. In turn, recent results on multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) in the context of financial innovations, as well as on consensus reaching, by Kou et al. (2014, 2021), Chao et al. (2022) and Li et al. (2022), may guide future quantitative work regarding a potential implementation of the present proposal. Budish et al. (2015) and Aquilina et al. (2021) emphasize the practical significance of latency arbitrage rents. Using 2015 data for the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index (FTSE 100) stocks, Aquilina et al. (2021) reveal that latency arbitrage races account for 20% of all trading volume on the London Stock Exchange. More importantly, they identify that latency arbitrage represents a 0.5 basis points (BP) “tax” on trading. To put this number into perspective, Aquilina et al. (2021, p. 500), argue that empirically observed bid-ask spreads average 3 BP, such that latency arbitrage related costs add roughly 33% to the effective spread. Another way to view the importance of the latency arbitrage problem is to note that large EU- and US-based funds have trading costs of roughly 3 BP. Taking this view, latency arbitrage costs of 0.5 BP increase trading expenses from 3 BP to 3.5 BP, that is, by 17%. Hence, the proposed mechanism would reduce trading costs of large funds by 17%. Such a reduction in trading costs would arguably reduce market frictions and benefit investors. Regarding aggregates, Aquilina et al. (2021) estimate that latency arbitrage rents in global equity markets total roughly $5 billion annually. Kauffman et al. (2015) focus more broadly on high-frequency trading practices, rather than just on latency arbitrage. For the years 2008–2014, Kauffman et al. (2015, p. 6), document that such trading accounted for 20–\(40\%\) of EU equity trading and for 35–\(60\%\) of US equity turnover. Kauffman et al. (2015) also highlight that regulatory constraints, such as stamp duties and bounds on the frequency with which stocks can be bought and sold, have limited the growth of HFT practices in many countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Against this background, the present mechanism would allow to relax regulation, for example, on the frequency with which stocks can be bought and sold, without the costs of increased latency arbitrage activity. Hendershott et al. (2011) and others document that modern technologies have drastically reduced overall trading costs.Footnote 4 The problem of latency arbitrage may thus be viewed as a byproduct of a technological revolution that otherwise brought great benefits to markets. In turn, many researchers have argued that some of this technological advance should be sacrificed to address the problem of latency arbitrage. On the contrary, this study aims to present a mechanism, which is complementary to the growth of modern electronic markets. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. We begin with a “Deterministic benchmark” model. In turn, we introduce “Random latencies”, and show that contemporary market designs are prone to latency arbitrage, even if traders strategically delay the sending of orders. The section on “Synchronized order placement” proposes an order type, which helps traders to synchronize order executions across exchanges. Using recent latency data, sections “Calibration”, “Technical feasibility” and “Costs and benefits of synchronized order placements” illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed market design. The section “Open questions, limitations, and directions for future research”   discusses limitations of our study as well as directions for future research. Finally, concluding remarks are provided in the “Conclusion”.",

Therefore, the impact of changes in the market structure on liquidity, volatility, and price formation is of crucial importance for market participants, operators of exchanges, and regulators. Such changes are relatively rare events and usually happen only once, or a few times over a couple of years. Therefore, market players have to base their evaluation of potential changes on research analyzing how these or similar changes have affected the market in the past and serve as a guideline for future adjustments of market organization. Accordingly, empirical research has investigated the effects of changes in the market structure, such as the introduction of call auctions (Agarwalla et al. 2015; Inci and Ozenbas 2017), changes in the call auction design (Park et al. 2022), tick-size reduction (Hsieh et al. 2011), or trading hours extensions. Some studies have examined the effect of trading hours extensions on intraday returns or volatility in stock and futures markets (Barclay and Hendershott 2003; Fan and Lai 2006; Houston and Ryngaert 1992; Kadioglu 2021; Lee et al. 2009; Miwa 2019; Miwa and Ueda 2017). These studies documented that trading hour extensions have a negative impact on price efficiency. However, even though the foreign exchange (forex) market is the world’s largest financial market in terms of turnover and of substantial importance to the economy,Footnote 1 to the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated the effect of trading hour extensions on the forex) market. First, the forex market substantially differs from equity markets; It is a two-tier market, separated into the interbank market, where professional currency traders deal with each other and where price discovery takes place, and the customer market, where customers trade with banks and submit their orders, which will finally be executed on the interbank market. There are no designated market makers, and the trading activity moves around the globe every day since most of the trading platforms are open 24 h a day. However, there are regional trading platforms using the same technology as the global ones, which have dedicated trading hours, such as the Moscow Exchange (MOEX, formerly MICEX, Moscow Interbank Currency Exchange). Trading hours extensions for these markets are extremely rare. While these local exchanges at first sight seem to be less relevant, they can be of substantial importance for the respective currency. In 2018 the MOEX accounted for 68% of the worldwide Ruble-Dollar and 78% of the Ruble-Euro tradingFootnote 2 and is the primary liquidity center for the Russian Ruble (RUB). Price discovery in this currency mainly takes place on the MOEX. Second, different from equity markets, ultra-high frequency data for the forex market is harder to obtain and the available data sets are usually short and cover a few days to weeks, sometimes months. In summary, although analyzing the effect of trading hours extensions on forex markets can provide crucial feedback to market regulators, trading platform operators, and practitioners, and despite its overwhelming importance, empirical evidence is non-existent. Our motivation is therefore to close this gap and provide the first study on effects of trading hours extensions on the forex market. To do so, we use an extraordinary data set from the MOEX which is both extremely long and detailed, an exceptional combination. Different from existing data for other markets, we use a sample of ten years, which includes six trading hours extensionsFootnote 3 and therefore provides high statistical power. To the best of our knowledge, there is no other market and no more recent period for the MOEX or any other market with a similarly high number of trading hours adjustments. Besides its length and depth, another advantage of our data set is the fact that we can observe two different instruments: tick-by-tick data of the same-day (as a proxy of the spot market) and next-day settlement (as a proxy of the futures market) of the RUB against the US Dollar (USD) exchange-rate contracts traded on the Moscow Exchange Foreign Exchange Market segment during the sample period. The bilateral RUB/USD rate is selected over the RUB/EUR since the volume trading exceeds that of the latter by a factor of almost 8. Owing to its role for the settlement of energy and other commodity exports the RUB/USD rate has always been much more important in terms of volume and economic significance. We do not aim to explain the exchange rate dynamics during this period. Instead, we seek to shed light on the impact of trading hours extensions on the forex market (for those platforms that are not open 24/7) from a more general perspective. This means we are concerned with general trading hours, the exchange rate properties nexus, rather than with explaining market dynamics for a particular period. The results reveal that extending trading hours led to a statistically significant increase in the historical volatility of both same- and next-day settlement of the RUB/USD rate in both 5- and 15-min intraday levels after the trading hours extensions. We find the highest increase in volatility when the market opens, and the lowest increase when it closes. The results regarding realized volatility, derived using the autoregressive moving average -autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARMA-GARCH) model, also indicate that the volatility of the RUB/USD exchange rate increased significantly following an extension of trading hours on MOEX. Additionally, the duration of the trading hours extension significantly affects realized volatility. This study determines a significant, positive relationship between realized volatility and the duration of a given trading hours extension. These findings are valid for both 5- and 15-min intraday levels as well as various measures of volatility. Additionally, trading hour extensions caused an increase in volume and a decrease in the spread in all day and midday time and resulted in an increase in volume and spread at opening time. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. “Literature review” section provides an overview of the related literature while “Data and methodology” section describes the data and describes the methodology. “Results” section presents and discusses the results. Finally, concluding remarks are presented in “Conclusion” section.",

Although they perform the same function as money, cryptocurrencies, which are created through encryption, are not dependent on national borders or central banks. In addition, although they share similar features with financial markets, fundamentally, they differ in terms of market structure (Dyhrberg et al. 2018; Maese et al. 2016). In 2012, the European Central Bank stated that cryptocurrencies do not pose a risk to financial stability due to their limited dependence on the real economy, low volume, not allowing wide user acceptance, and limited supply. However, the European Central Bank warned that cryptocurrencies should be monitored because of the surge in their volume and use in transactions. The market for cryptocurrencies has significantly evolved over the past five years since this report was released (Ceylan et al. 2018; Corbet et al. 2018a, b, c). These new digital currencies, which have gained popularity and usage day by day in the past ten years, have taken their place in markets as a new financial instrument (Dierksmeier and Seele 2018; Hudson and Urquhart 2021; Jiang et al. 2021). Cryptocurrencies have various advantages such as no taxation, low transaction and custody costs, no possibility of a seizure by any institution or organization, alternative financing source, and diversification opportunities (Kahraman et al. 2019; Omane-Adjepong and Alagidede 2019; Rejeb et al. 2021). While cryptocurrencies have emerged and developed as an innovative and efficient payment system, they also have disadvantages that can harm investors, consumers, businesses, financial systems, and even national security (Guesmi et al. 2019). There is no consensus in the literature on the classification of cryptocurrencies, whether as money, commodities, or assets (Carrick 2016; Faria 2022; Selgin 2015; Polasik et al. 2015; Corbet et al. 2018a, b, c). The lack of consensus poses a scientific challenge in assessing the position and prospects of cryptocurrencies in financial markets (Levulytė and Šapkauskienė 2021). However, the common views of studies that categorize cryptocurrencies as money are based on the following three criteria: “It can be used for transactions, can be used as a unit of account, and can store value” (Kiyotaki and Wright 1989; Ammous 2018). First, cryptocurrencies have been increasingly used for transactions in recent years. The volume is small in comparison with other currencies. However, there are still weaker currencies with much less daily volume. The currencies of Cambodia, Laos, and Uganda are less active than Bitcoin (BTC). Furthermore, there is no specific value or volume accepted in the currency category, and this situation does not necessarily determine whether it is accepted as a medium of exchange. Second, they can be used as a unit of account. Cryptocurrencies have the unit of account features. For example, a BTC can be divided into an infinite number of parts, and these can be combined to form a complete BTC; all BTCs have the same design; and all are interchangeable. In addition, it is countable and subject to mathematical operations. Finally, the account can be used as a warehouse value. Third, users can store them for portfolio diversification purposes to accumulate value for future use, expecting that they would gain value in the future (Carrick 2016). However, studies that do not use this approach emphasize factors such as the cost of cryptocurrencies, mining, the need for intellectual capital, and anonymity (Kim 2017). In this context, the approach of governments is significant. At best, governments are indifferent to cryptocurrencies, and at worst, they oppose them because their concerns are about illegal activities. Due to the desire of governments to control economies through monetary policy, they do not want to consider cryptocurrencies in the money class as it seems to be a threat to them. For example, China has banned cryptocurrency transactions in financial institutions (Kaplanov 2012; Ponsford 2015). This lack of a classification of cryptocurrencies is because some countries treat them as assets or commodities, whereas others consider them as a means of payment or currency (Ammous 2018). However, cryptocurrencies are no longer a niche topic in the literature but a significant trend in financial markets and an emerging asset class (Ferreira and Sandner 2021). Cryptocurrencies, which were originally supposed to act as an open-source online payment system, have evolved into a new asset class with speculative properties (Demiralay and Golitsis 2021). In the money–asset debate, cryptocurrencies support the latter view because of their high volatility, extreme short-term returns, and bubble-like price behavior (Sebastião and Godinho 2021). This study discusses the existence of a day-of-the-week anomaly in cryptocurrencies. The day-of-the-week anomaly indicates that investors in the markets receive more returns on a certain day-of-the-week than on other days (Chatzitzisi et al. 2021). This study aims to detect the existence of the day-of-the-week anomaly in cryptocurrencies with feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs). Unlike classical time series methods, ANN does not require prerequisites, and it gives better results than other time series method (Tosunoglu and Benli 2012; Fang et al. 2022). In this respect, it is expected that investigating the existence of the day-of-the-week anomaly in cryptocurrencies with ANN will yield more reliable results than other methods. Most studies that have examined the day-of-the-week anomaly in cryptocurrencies were performed with classical time series analysis methods. The use of ANN in this study is a novel approach in the literature. Moreover, this study contributes to the literature by analyzing the first three cryptocurrencies—Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Cardano (ADA)—according to their market value on September 06, 2021.",
9.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,08 May 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-023-00478-2,An impact assessment of the COVID-19 pandemic on Japanese and US hotel stocks,December 2023,Takashi Kanamura,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on tourism management has been enormous. For example, the number of foreign visitors to Japan in fiscal year (FY) 2013 was 10.4 million, which tripled to 31.9 million in FY2019, before the COVID-19 pandemic. However, by FY2020, after the spread of COVID-19, the number of foreign visitors had fallen to just 4.1 million, an 87.1% decline from FY2019. Japan is one of the world’s leading tourism countries, with a travel balance of $25 billion as of 2019, ranking 6th in the world (UNWTO 2020).Footnote 1 Before the pandemic, expectations for the entire industry’s performance were growing, especially with the Tokyo 2020 Olympics and Paralympics Games (Tokyo 2020) scheduled to be held in July–September 2020, and the tourism industry making capital investments in preparation for these events. However, the International Olympic Committee postponed them for a year due to the global spread of COVID-19, and the Japanese government allowed only those involved in Tokyo 2020 to enter the country, making Tokyo 2020 an unprecedented event in which no spectators were allowed. In other words, it was difficult for Japan to balance the control of the COVID-19 pandemic with hosting the games in Tokyo in 2020. In this sense, the postponement significantly eroded investors’ expectations of Japan’s tourism industry. We consider that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on stock prices, expressed as expected values, was enormous for Japan, even as it aims to become a tourism nation (JNTO 2021) among the world’s major tourism nations. Meanwhile, the US had the world’s largest travel balance at $62 billion in 2019 (UNWTO 2020), making it the largest tourism destination. While we expect that the impact of COVID-19 has been tremendous, the situation appears to differ from that in Japan. In the US, which implemented vaccination against COVID-19 relatively early in the pandemic, economic activities resumed earlier than in Japan after the spread of COVID-19. Thus, although the impact of COVID-19 on corporate activities in the tourism industry was huge, the situation differs from country to country, and we expect the impact of COVID-19 on stock prices to differ. The tourism industry includes a variety of sectors, specifically transport, accommodation, food and beverage, and entertainment. Of these, the sector that COVID-19 is likely to affect most is accommodation for long-stay tourism. Therefore, we focus on hotels, which are the main sector of the accommodation industry. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of COVID-19 on stock prices in the hotel industry, one of the sectors most affected by the pandemic. In particular, by comparing Japan, which we can consider a particularly serious situation due to the unprecedented disruption to the Olympic and Paralympic Games, with the US, which has the biggest tourist market but recovered early from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we aim to highlight whether the impact differs from country to country. Specifically, we focus on the transition of the volatility in hotel stock prices due to COVID-19 to examine whether there are persistent impacts of COVID-19. Furthermore, we aim to provide implications for investors and portfolio managers. There are two research questions in this study. How has COVID-19 affected the stock prices of the Japanese hotel industry? How does this impact differ for hotels outside Japan, namely, in the US? Research on the impact of COVID-19 on the financial and commodity markets is accelerating (Zaremba et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Dutta et al. 2020; Akhtaruzzaman et al. 2021; Ashraf 2020; Sharif et al. 2020; Xu 2021; Baig et al. 2021; Kanamura 2021; Athari et al. 2022; Athari and Hung 2022). These studies, in particular those using COVID-19 information explicitly or implicitly, provide meaningful and comprehensive examinations of the impact of COVID-19 on stock and commodity markets, but they do not provide a specific analysis of the travel and tourism industry, particularly the hotel industry, which is our aim. Many researchers have studied the impact of exogenous risks on travel and tourism stocks (Demiralay and Kilincarslan 2019; García-Gómez et al. 2021; Yiwei et al. 2021; Carter et al. 2021; Irani et al. 2022).Footnote 2 However, because these studies, except for pre-COVID-19 analyses of Demiralay and Kilincarslan (2019) and Irani et al. (2022), address the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, they do not directly address information about COVID-19-infected patients. Subsequently, many studies directly deal with COVID-19 information, such as the number of people infected with COVID-19, by examining the performance of hotel stocks under COVID-19 (Kaczmarek et al. 2021; Anguera-Torrell et al. 2021; Wu et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2020). These studies explicitly use COVID-19 information, including infection speed, to examine the impact of COVID-19 but do not model the regime changes in volatility that characterize the impact of COVID-19. While Lin and Falk (2021) and Baek et al. (2020) use regime-switching models, they do not use one in which COVID-19 directly affects returns. Thus, there are gaps in the existing research that have yet to be filled. To the best of our knowledge, no analysis examines the direct impact of COVID-19 on price returns and regime-switching volatilities simultaneously; or investigates the impact of COVID-19 on the stock prices of the Japanese hotel industry. To fill these gaps, the present study compares Japanese hotel stocks with US ones and analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on these stocks using two new regime-switching volatility models whose returns are affected by the impact of the pandemic with and without stock market impacts. This analysis is significant in the sense that the new analytical approach may provide new insights into the impact of COVID-19 on hotel stock returns. In addition, a Japan–US comparison of the impact of COVID-19 on hotel stock prices offers hotel stock investment insights for investors and portfolio managers. This study adopts an econometric approach by using a reduced-type model called a regime-switching model. However, we incorporate the structure of stock market return impacts in the price returns of hotel stocks, along with variables representing the direct impact of COVID-19. In this sense, our analytical approach is a new mixed model between a reduced-type model that emphasizes data fitting and a structural-type model that emphasizes economic background. This study makes three main contributions to the literature. First, it proposes two new regime-switching volatility models based on econometric analysis, in which the speed of COVID-19 infection directly affects price returns, and in which both COVID-19 and the stock market affect these returns. Second, using relatively long-term data from January 2019 to September 2021, we find that Japanese hotel stock returns have negative impacts from the infection speed in a direct and/or an indirect way via the corresponding market, while US hotel stock returns have a limited impact from COVID-19 due to the offset of the impact of COVID-19 on hotel stocks and no impact of COVID-19 on the overall stock market. Third, and most importantly, our analysis of Japanese hotel stock prices using a direct regime-switching volatility model shows that, unlike US hotel stock prices, the regime continues to switch to high volatility during COVID-19 until September 2021. However, analysis using the hybrid regime-switching volatility model, whose regime-switching excludes the impact of the stock market, shows a transition to high volatility in hotel stock prices due to the impact of COVID-19 until around the summer of 2021 in both Japan and the US. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. “Econometric analysis” section presents a simple econometric approach for determining the direction of our model’s selection of hotel stock returns. “The model” section proposes two new regime-switching volatility models, in which the COVID-19 infection speed directly affects price returns based on the results of the econometric analysis, and in which the COVID-19 infection speed and the market affect those. “Empirical analysis” section presents an empirical study of the differences in the impacts of COVID-19 on Japanese and US hotel stock returns. “Robustness checks” section presents the robustness examinations for our results. “Discussion of findings” section addresses the implications for investors, portfolio managers, tourism management, and policymakers with a comparative analysis with previous studies, an analysis of health and economic policies on COVID-19, policy recommendations, and financial flexibility and COVID-19. Finally, “Conclusions” section concludes and offers directions for future research.",3

Evidence from BRICS emerging economies,December 2023,Chafic Saliba,Panteha Farmanesh,Seyed Alireza Athari,Male,Unknown,Male,Male,"As a financial intermediary, the banking system is unquestionably a crucial sector for running any economy, and any banking sector’s performance is crucial for encouraging investments and boosting economic growth (Menicucci and Paolucci 2021; Bucevska and Hadzi Misheva 2017; Athari 2021a, b). Although the banking sector could be a catalyst to promote economic activity, particularly in countries with weak financial markets, it may be a significant driver to impede economic expansion by not controlling increasing risks. Consequently, governments and central banks place a great deal of importance on the banking industry’s stability. Nevertheless, after the global financial mortgage crisis (2008–2009), bank asset quality deteriorated severely and many financial institutions operating in both emerging and advanced countries experienced a massive increase in non-performing loans (NPLs). Among risk factors, credit risk, which is measured by the level of NPLs, is considered the most critical risk that threatens the overall stability of the banking sector, and a rise in credit riskFootnote 1 could increase insolvency, instability, and crisis in a country’s banking sector, eventually resulting in deteriorating economic growth (Boudriga et al. 2010; Ariffin 2012; Vouldis and Louzis 2018). Moreover, rising credit risk could lead to sluggish economic output in the long term by reducing profits and lending in the banking sector. Therefore, understanding and determining the factors reducing credit risk is essential for banks and policymakers and help avoid bank failure and increase the effectiveness of the banking sector in promoting economic growth. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) stated that the management of poor credit risk practices is still a major cause of worldwide banking crises (Ariffi 2012). Over the last three decades, pervasive studies have been conducted to explore determinants that exacerbate credit risk. Empirical studies suggest that both internal and external factors contribute to credit risk. External elements are specific to the country, and internal elements are the factors specific to the banking industry. More specifically, the majority of empirical studies highlight that liquidity, capital regulation, profitability, inefficiency, and income diversification are the significant banking sector-specific or internal determinants (e.g., Imbierowicz and Rauch 2014; Ali et al. 2015; Anastasiou et al. 2019; Kartikasary et al. 2020; Boussaada et al. 2020). Furthermore, macro-level factors such as gross domestic production (GDP), inflation, real exchange rate, lending interest rate, financial market development, and corruption are considered the most significant external factors (e.g., Dimitrios et al. 2016; Bonilla 2012; Nadham and Nahid 2015; Syed and Tripathi 2020). What about the determinants of the banking sector’s credit risk in the BRICS emerging countries and how does country risk impact the BRICS banking sector’s credit risk? Although there is extensive literature on the determinants of the banking sector’s credit risk, limited empirical research has been conducted to assess these of the banking sector operating in the BRICS region. To the best of our knowledge, there is relatively little evidence on the empirical level of the relationship between country risk (e.g., political, economic, financial) and the banking sector’s credit risk in developed and developing markets in general and the BRICS region in particular. BRICS is a vital union of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, and in 2003, Goldman Sachs described this bloc as one of the developing blocs of the world, contributing a substantially important part of world trade and economy in the future (Singh et al. 2022). On the other hand, BRICS countries are also impacted by issues such as increased in inflation, the decline in the oil markets, weakening regimes in some countries, corruption charges, and the influence of the global financial turmoil (Syed and Tripathi 2020). Focusing on the BRICS banking sector, the World Bank (2017) database indicated that the Brazilian banking sector has higher liquidity reserve assets compared to the BRICS region and global countries while the Russian and South African banking sectors have lower liquidity reserve assets, respectively. Additionally, the Brazilian, Indian, and Chinese banking sectors have higher bank Z-scores (less default risk) relative to the BRICS region and global countries. According to the World Bank (2020) database, the global mortgage crisis adversely impacted the BRICS banking sector and significantly increased NPLs. The BRICS banking system experienced a challenging period between 2014 and 2018 in which many banks experienced declining earnings, declining lending, and rising provisioning (Kondratov 2021). Based on these economic settings, critical factors of banking sector credit risk in the BRICS region is an interesting case study and the findings could considerably contribute to the banking literature. This study makes several contributions. The first is to fill the gap in the literature by providing new empirical evidence on the banking sector of the BRICS emerging countries. Second, it contributes by investigating the effect of country risk on the BRICS banking sector’s credit risk in addition to the conventional factors. Third, this study addresses how the country-specific economic, political, and financial risks impact the banking sectors’ NPLs in the BRICS countries that are exposed to the financial, economic, and political instabilities mainly after the global financial crisis (2008–2009). Fourth, as in previous studies (Athari 2021a, b, 2022a; Irani et al. 2022), we adopt a composite index of the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) as a comprehensive and novel proxy for determining a country’s vulnerability. Based on previous studies, the ICRG index is inclusive and accurate and can be used to measure countries’ vulnerability to political, financial, and economic risks. The ICRG rating comprises 22 variables in three subcategories of risk, namely, political, financial, and economic. This study uses a novel proxy of the ICRG political risk index scores to measure the political stability level including government stability, investment profile, socio-economic conditions, internal and external conflicts, corruption, the military in politics, democratic accountability, religious tensions, law and order, ethnic tensions, and bureaucracy quality components. Furthermore, it uses the ICRG economic risk index scores to measure the level of economic stability containing the GDP per capita, real GDP growth, annual inflation rate, budget balance (% of GDP), and Current Account (% of GDP) components. We also use the ICRG financial risk index scores to measure the level of financial stability comprising the foreign debt (% of GDP), foreign debt service (% of exports of goods and services), Current Account (% of exports of goods and services), net international liquidity in months, and exchange rate stability components. This study is significant in that it employs the unique dataset and also opens a new debate in the banking literature. Fifth, this study performs panel quantile estimation for the large panel of data between 2004 and 2020 to derive reliable results. In contrast with ordinary least squares (OLS), quantile regression is more robust to non-normal errors, heterogeneity, and outliers. Using the quantile regression provides an opportunity to explore the relationships between variables across a wide spectrum and specifically examine whether the country risk index and sub-indices impact NPL distributions differently at various points. This study yields some notable highlights. First, the empirical results reveal that the bank-specific variables of profitability, capital regulation, liquidity, and income diversification significantly and negatively impact the BRICS banking sector’s credit risk whereas inefficiency has the opposite effect. This implies that by increasing profitability, capital regulation, liquidity, income diversification, and efficiency, policymakers and bank managers can reduce the banking sector’s credit risk and minimize the negative consequence of credit risk to enhance financial stability and economic growth. Second, country risk significantly impacts the BRICS banking sector’s credit risk, implying that the banking sector experiences higher NPLs via the increasing vulnerability of BRICS countries to domestic risk factors. Specifically, the results revealed that credit risk increases with rising political, economic, and financial risk and an increase in domestic political instability has the most positive prominent effect on the banking sector of environments with a higher degree of NPLs. This indicates that policymakers should be provided more financially, economically, and politically stable environments by focusing on the risk components such as corruption, government instability, internal and external conflicts, the deficit in the government budget, declining inflation, and exchange rate instability to prevent the banking sector’s credit risk from increasing. Lastly, the empirical results reveal that the financial market development, lending interest rate, and global risk are significant drivers of increasing the BRICS banking sector’s credit risk. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Sect. “Literature review” presents a review of the literature. The model specification and data are discussed in Sect. “Model specification and data”. The data analysis and results are provided in Sect. “Data analysis and results”.

Webb,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Since the release of the Bitcoin white paper in 2008, cryptocurrencies have attracted controversy and interest in the financial literature (i.e. Nakamoto 2008). Of the top five cryptocurrencies by trading volume, three are stablecoins, two of the top five by market capitalization are stablecoins. Stablecoins are designed to maintain a “stable” peg to another financial asset, usually the US dollar. They play a crucial role in the market by allowing traders to store value in US equivalents. Stablecoins, particularly Tether which is the third largest cryptocurrency by market value and by far the largest in terms of volume,Footnote 1 may be used as a safe haven for Bitcoin investors (Baur and Hoang 2021). However, stablecoins sometimes trade at a premium to the underlying asset they mimic because of the high fees to trade cryptocurrencies in US dollars, the difficulty of using US dollars on cryptocurrency exchanges, as well as the speed and ease of transferring stablecoins between exchanges (Lyons and Viswanath-Natraj 2020).Footnote 2 Different stablecoins attempt the same goal—maintaining a $1 peg—but with vastly different structural designs and transparency levels. The recent collapse of the TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin and linked Terra (LUNA)Footnote 3 token in May 2022 brought down a $60 billion ecosystem, making this exogenous shock an important natural opportunity for study. At approximately midnight (UTC time) on May 9, 2022, UST began to experience what would soon become a substantial collapse. By the early hours of May 10, 2022, UST had unambiguously lost its peg with the dollar, trading at 98 cents at 2 a.m. (UTC), 90 cents at 8 a.m. (UTC), but only 79 cents by 9 a.m. (UTC). The impact of the decline in UST was observed with a delay in other cryptocurrency stablecoins. Around the time of the crash, UST had a market capitalization of $18 billion,Footnote 4 valuing it similarly to U.S. corporations such as Best Buy or Clorox. During the days surrounding this period of market turmoil, other stablecoins experienced significant price deviations from their $1 peg. Tether, for example, dropped to 97 cents at around 4 p.m. (UTC) on May 12, 2022, while BUSD rose to 1.0149 and USDC rose to 1.01. In contrast, DAI experienced small fluctuations around $1. Although all the above-mentioned stablecoins aim to maintain a stable $1 peg, they experienced vastly different price behaviors, with some trading at a premium and others at a discount during the crash. This study examines the period before and after the collapse of stablecoin UST on May 9, 2022, tests the extent to which this market crash impacted other major digital assets, and investigates the causes of the hypothesized contagion. In particular, we examine whether differences across stablecoins in the mechanism used to maintain the peg help explain the differences in the magnitude, direction, and duration of their response to the UST stablecoin crash. Answering this question is important because the May 2022 collapse of UST, alongside the resultant volatility in multiple important stablecoins, demonstrated the fragility of algorithmic stablecoins and the importance of credible collateral for stablecoins linked to fiat currencies. We use intraday data and a multivariate Baba, Engle, Kraft, and Kroner (1990) (BEKK) model over a sample period of 40 days surrounding the UST crash on the 9th of May 2022, to test how differences in stablecoin designs affect trader behavior and market reactions and investigate the causes of spillover effects in the cryptocurrency markets. Previous studies have also used this method to test whether contagion effects are due to herding behavior (for example Corsetti et al. 2005; Boyer et al. 2006; Chiang et al. 2007; Syllignakis and Kouretas 2011). Indeed, we find evidence of contagion effects across all the cryptocurrency and stablecoins analyzed, with some signs of herding behavior by traders after an information cascade that is apparent in the subsequent event study analysis. Deviations from the $1 peg document how traders “vote with their feet” by moving in or out of various stablecoins. Finally, we demonstrate how smaller market players can cause financial contagion, which infects larger players and finally feeds back to the market as a whole. We contribute to the literature by investigating financial contagion in cryptocurrency markets during turbulent periods such as the UST stablecoin crash. Additionally, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to provide implications for stablecoin design, trader behavior, and contagion effects during the stablecoin markets crisis, which is useful for academics, practitioners, and policymakers interested in the potential destabilizing risk arising from the cryptocurrency ecosystem. The originality of this study lies in its examination of a unique exogenous event, the largest collapse in stablecoin markets to date, using proprietary data. We also extend previous research on the effects of volatility spillovers in cryptocurrency markets to stablecoin markets. Although previous research has attempted to investigate volatility spillover effects between Bitcoin and stablecoins (Hoang and Baur 2021; Grobys et al. 2021), and between stablecoins only (Thanh et al. 2022), to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive investigation of the magnitude, direction, and duration of the response to stablecoin price movements is yet to be conducted. This study fills this gap and extends previous research on volatility spillover across stablecoins by testing whether differences in their underlying design affect market behavior. Moreover, this study investigates possible herding behaviors in cryptocurrency crashes, as the bubbles in Haykir and Yagli (2022), and tests the information cascade effects, as Tse and Hackard (2006) do in different US markets, precipitated by the UST collapse on other stablecoins market activities, which enable us to make an additional contribution to the literature.",

Natural capital abundance and sluggish economic expansion are referred to the “resource curse” and the “Dutch Disease.” The “resource curse” is an economic phenomenon characterized by the fact that states with abandoned natural resources have significantly less developed economies than states with few or no resources (Asif et al. 2020; Okada and Shinkuma 2022). The “resource curse” effect can be mitigated by making better use of the natural capital and having a strong financial system. Financial expansion (FE) can mitigate the “resource curse” effect and boost economic growth. Although FE is a sign of economic progress, other factors, such as the rule of law, democratic accountability, level of corruption, institutional quality (INQ), and human development (HD), should also be considered. This study fills a gap in the literature by analyzing the relationship between FE and natural resource (NR) rents in resource rich developing countries. Deriving from these preliminary remarks, the main research question of this article could be formulated as “What is the effect of NR wealth on FE of Central Asian States (CAS) that have a huge and well diversified NR base?” Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan are important CAS countries due to their strategic geographical location and abundance of natural resources (World Bank 2021). The majority of coal and oil resources are concentrated in Kazakhstan, the highest potential for hydro energy is concentrated in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, and gas reserves are shared by Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Kazakhstan (Mehta et al. 2021; Zakeri et al. 2022; UNECE). The Kazakh financial sector is an important case study for understanding the natural “resource curse” in finance. Kazakhstan is a major oil producer, accounting for 1.8% of the world’s oil reserves, with the oil sector accounting for more than 60% of total exports (BP 2017). Kyrgyzstan has a high potential for a variety of minerals. On its territory, “geologists have discovered several thousand different basins of various types of minerals. Among main minerals are gold, mercury, antimony, tin, coal, non-metallic raw materials, and groundwater” (MFA; Rogalsky 2019). Uzbekistan, another Central Asian country, is also rich in mineral resources. It has all types of fossil fuels, including oil, natural gas, uranium, and brown coal (Kholikov 2019). It also has the most mineral reserves, including copper, gold, uranium, natural gas, and phosphorites. Uzbekistan is one of the top ten gold producing countries (Forbes). Turkmenistan also contains valuable minerals like oil, natural gas, sulfur, lead, and iodine; it ranks second in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in terms of explored gas reserves, trailing only Russia (Neftegaz.ru). Tajikistan is also rich in silver, lead, and boron, and it ranks first in the CIS (Mfa.tj; UNECE). On the basis of the above research question and discussion, this research concentrates on the relationship between NR rents and FE in CAS. The following hypotheses are proposed: \({H}_{0}\): A U-shaped relationship exists between FE and NR rents. \({H}_{1}\): An inverted U-shaped relationship exists between FE and NR rents. As previously stated, the literature primarily focused on the relationship between finance and natural resources in developed and developing countries. However, despite their importance, the natural resources in CAS have received little attention. The potential contributions of this research are as follows: Most of the recent studies have employed one or more proxies for FE. However, financial institutions and markets monitor the performance of investments and corporations. To avoid using proxies for FE (Sandow et al. 2022), this research employs a FE index that comprises financial institutions and markets (IMF 2021). In this study, the emphasis was placed on natural resources and the square of natural resources’ effect on FE to examine whether a U-shaped or inverted U-shaped relationship exists between these variables. The “resource curse” concept reflects public officials’ rent seeking attitude toward the economy. The channel of productive resource rent revenues is mostly corrupted rather than going to economic development. The worst-case scenario occurs when officials transfer funds to their offshore banks. Therefore, strong and stable institutions are critical for FE (Khan et al. 2020). Thus, the stability of institutions may be the most important determinant of the natural resources’ capital effect on FE. Previous studies on “resource curse” or “resource blessing” were conducted for developing countries, but research on CAS was largely ignored. This study employed the sophisticated econometric cross-sectionally augmented autoregressive distributed lag (CS-ARDL) technique (Chudik et al. 2016) that is robust to “serial correlation, presence of misspecification bias, cross-sectional dependency, non-stationarity, and the endogeneity bias problem.” Following the preceding discussions, the study’s structure is as follows: The second section focuses on the theoretical framework and the review of the empirical literature. The third section focuses on data and methodology, the fourth on outcomes and findings, and the fifth on the conclusion. Thus, the following section provides detailed information on the “resource curse” and empirical literature review.",
9.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,12 April 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-023-00481-7,Triggering economic growth to ensure financial stability: case study of Northern Cyprus,December 2023,Ergin Akalpler,,,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"The Ricardian Equivalent Hypothesis (REH), based on the theory that public debt has a neutral effect on the real gross domestic product (RGDP; Ricardo 1951; Barro 1979, 1990; Afzal 2012), has been researched several times. However, the Keynesian economic model plays an important role in the RGDP growth rate. In the Keynesian economic model, savings are part of disposable income, and public debt has an effect on RGDP. Therefore, in this study, not only the REH but also Keynesian and modern monetary views are considered to analyze the impact of public debt and other considered variables' causal relationships to ensure financial stability. I develop a model based on the Keynesian expenditure output approach to estimate its effects on RGDP. While questioning the causal relationship between the parameters considered, the views of four schools of thought (classical, Keynesian, Ricardian, and Modern Monetary) that have contributed to the literature with different arguments as well as my theoretical knowledge, were used as the foundation for creating my model. While using the explanatory variables specified in the equation, I include Consumption (C), Investment (I), Government Expenditure (G), and Net Export (NX) models from the Keynesian spending approach. However, as the REH is also questioned in this study, I specifically decided to include public debt (TD) and total capital (TC). Again, when the current economic conditions and production model were questioned, when considering the dependency on imported inputs, energy, and the effects of the globalizing world, it was deemed appropriate to include both the exchange rate (REER) and employment (E) in the model. In the model created to determine the direct effects, the second cointegration equation for the relationship between the independent variables and components of RGDP was used. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and short-term Wald tests were used to determine the long-term effects of the variables on RGDP. In addition, variance decomposition, impulse response, and Granger causality tests were conducted. However, to determine the indirect effects of the variables, the cointegration equations used in the Keynesian output expenditure model and the variables that make up the components of the RGDP were used. However, this time, each independent variable was questioned as a dependent variable, and its long- and short-term effects were estimated using OLS, Wald, and other tests. The effects on private consumption and public deficit, government expenditure, and the growth of government debt have been examined by researchers who support both REH and Keynesian views. While some researchers have reached conclusions supporting the view of the REH, others have also supported the Keynesian view. Several studies have questioned growth from different perspectives using the REH and Keynesian theories. However, for this inquiry, the interaction between macro variables, such as public debt, public expenditure, budget deficit, and private consumption, has been evaluated in terms of the effects of growth. It is argued that the REH model is no longer a validated model for economies under today's conditions. Therefore, this study questions the REH model while specifically examining the economy of Northern Cyprus in terms of current economic conditions. Through this research, it is predicted that the REH model can be understood more clearly. External borrowing is the easiest way to alleviate the tax burden on states (Ogunmuyiwa 2010). Borrowing power is difficult for states not recognized by the international community, such as Northern Cyprus. The government often uses high taxes and constantly increases fees and penalties to finance spending. In addition, short- and long-term loans are mainly provided by Turkey. However, instead of constantly looking for resources to finance government expenditures in Northern Cyprus, reducing electricity and energy consumption to reduce the amount of expenditures can also be a solution. On an island like Cyprus, where sunlight is abundant, energy needs can also be met by using solar energy panels. Kou et al. (2022) stated in their study that solar energy could not only be used to reduce government expenditures but more energy could also be produced with flexible panels that change position according to the sun's angle. Considering that energy is an important expense today, the widespread and effective use of solar energy on islands with plenty of sunshine should be considered a financially profitable and important economic investment. Moreover, economic activities financed by borrowing are not sustainable (Ogunmuyiwa 2010). As seen in many countries in 2010, domestic or foreign borrowing caused crises and recessions (Donayre and Taivan 2017). Gómez-Puig and Sosvilla-Rivero (2018) also question the problems of public debt and growth. Several studies (Cochrane 2011; Castro et al. 2015; Soydan and Bedir 2015) have reported that public debt halts economic growth and prevents the absorption of international demand shocks. Reviewing the literature shows that sudden tightening in financing conditions affects small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) the most (European Central Bank 2021a, b). Such financial problems affecting SMEs represent the engine of the Northern Cyprus economy; therefore, growth cannot be realized at the desired level. A previous study highlighted that promoting access to finance will contribute to the development of the financial system (Rashidin et al. 2020; Hasan et al. 2020a, b). It is predicted that, while affecting economic growth, the increase in financing would lead to both an improvement in environmental factors and an improvement in carbon emissions in the country (Chienwattanasook et al. 2021). Other researchers (Borensztein et al. 1998) have stated that international financial integration supports investments, and financial instability negatively affects economic welfare. Financial resources are needed for business continuity (Vickers 1970). Reid (1996) states that financial resources are obtained through either subprime bank borrowing or high-cost equity capital to repay capital providers. It has been stated that knowledge of financial services is vital in guiding and developing inclusive finance (Hasan et al. 2021). Unfortunately, state policies in Northern Cyprus are not prepared by competent and experienced people, and programs designed with Turkey’s support are not always effective in financing the economy. Checherita-Westphal et al. (2014) also state in their study that fiscal deficits and debt are affected by unconscious policies. In addition, the state heavily uses taxes, fees, and penalties for capital increases, which negatively affects low-income consumers. When necessary, taxes are not collected from high-income groups, entrepreneurs, and producers, and incentives are given to SMEs that report losses. This is because, as stated by Kou et al. (2021a), SMEs’ annual financial information is not available in banks, and there is no internal control system; therefore, they are unreliable and insufficient to inspect SMEs. Therefore, SMEs turn this into an opportunity and declare bankruptcy, thus avoiding taxes and obtaining financial support from the state. If tax laws are not improved in developing economies, it will not be easy to achieve long-term financial stability in the long run (Wopke et al. 2013). Tax evasion is also a problem in Northern Cyprus. A similar problem was described by González-Fernández et al. (2018), who examined the effects of the interaction between tax evasion and innovation on the economy. Khuong et al. (2021) also question the similar relationship between the informal economy and economic growth. Northern Cyprus imports are very high compared with exports, and savings, investment, and capital inefficiency increase the current account deficit (see Table 1). The state budget deficit, which the Turkish government continuously finances for the survival of the public sector, is not a sustainable model. In Northern Cyprus, tourism, education, trade, and the public sector contribute to the gross national product (GNP), as well as to SMEs. However, the import rate, which is ten times higher than the export rate, causes high public debt, current account deficit, and resource insufficiency. The economy, which developed steadily between 1983 and 2010, had a per capita income of 1305 TL in 1983 and 43,050 TL in 2019 (see Table 1).",

As Bar-Ilan and Strange (1999) indicate, uncombinability and adjustment costs are two main reasons why investments exhibit lumpiness.Footnote 1 However, it is more appropriate to assume that investment is lumpy with variable intensity. For example, landowners must decide the time to change use and density of development (Capozza and Li 1994; Jou and Lee 2007). Similarly, a power-generating company must decide when to replace its facility and the capacity level of a new plant. By contrast, other investments occur incrementally. For example, a government may offer bidders the opportunity to exploit minerals and later expand their investments (Trigeorgis 1993). Auctioneers may offer cash bids at a given royalty rate. However, we contribute to the literature by developing a unified model to investigate the optimal royalty rate across the aforementioned three types of investments, including incremental and lumpy, with an exogenously given or variable intensity. Bar-Ilan and Strange (1999) find that the comparative statics and capital stock evolution of the first two types, which are quite similar, are strikingly different from the last one. This study investigates whether this pattern persists in contingent royalty rate design. We construct a two-stage private value model (Vickrey 1961) in which a seller and multiple potential bidders are risk-neutral and maximize their expected payoffs.Footnote 2 In the first stage, the seller uses a direct revelation mechanism that includes the allocation rule, cash payments, and the royalty rate. Participating bidders have private information regarding their investment costs and bid cash through a first-price auction (FPA). After winning the bid, the winner has the option to engage in one of three types of investments. The equilibrium bid is derived using a perfect Bayesian Nash solution subject to the constraints of incentive compatibility and individual rationality. In the second stage, the winner faces a stochastic evolution in the price of the output generated by exercising the investment option. The winner chooses the timing and/or intensity of investment upon winning the auction and then delivers the royalty payment to the seller after producing the output. A postauction moral hazard problem arises as an unobservable type of bidder, and the stochastic evolution of the output price precludes the seller from contractually setting the exact dates of investment with the winner. We solve the two-stage problem backwards. In the case of lumpy investment, in the second stage, the winner faces an investment decision, as described by McDonald and Siegel (1986) and Bar-Ilan and Strange (1999). The winner chooses the intensity of the investment on the date when the option value of waiting is equal to the sunk cost of investment. In the case of incremental investment, in the second stage, the winner faces a marginal investment decision, as described by Pindyck (1988).Footnote 3 The winner invests in the expansion option on the date on which the option value of investing in an additional unit of capital is equal to the marginal value of that unit, net of the unit cost of capital. Furthermore, in the first stage, the seller sets the royalty rate and participating bidders bid cash for the investment project. The winner maximizes his valuation of the investment less his royalty payment, whereas the seller maximizes her revenue, which equals the winner’s valuation of the investment minus his information rent. Therefore, the seller should set the royalty rate to equate the winner’s royalty payment with his information rent, with the winner acting as if to maximize the seller’s revenue. We derive the following two main conclusions: first, compared with the case in which investment is lumpy with an exogenously given intensity, the seller can set a lower royalty rate on incremental investment because she can collect additional royalty payments from the winner, who has the option to later expand capacity. Second, the impact of output price uncertainty on the optimal royalty rate for the three types of investments exhibits two different patterns. When investment is either incremental or lumpy with an exogenously given intensity, greater output price uncertainty encourages the winner to wait for a more favorable output price to exercise the investment option, which raises the winner’s royalty payment. Therefore, the seller can reduce the royalty rate. When the investment is lumpy with variable intensity, greater output uncertainty induces the winner to choose a larger investment intensity. Although this results in the seller receiving more royalty payments that are subject to decreasing marginal returns to capital, the benefit is outweighed by the increment of the information rent collected by the winner (embedded in the investment cost), which is linear in the capital stock. Consequently, greater uncertainty induces the seller to increase their royalty rate. Our results have implications for auctions in terms of the opportunity to invest in long-lived investment projects, such as the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) lease auctions in the United States. The United States Department of the Interior (DOI) uses auctions to allocate exploration and drilling rights for oil and gas to federal lands on the OCS (Hendricks and Porter 1988; Hendricks et al. 2003; Haile et al. 2010).Footnote 4 These lands are divided into tracts that have not been previously explored, or “wildcat tracts,” and tracts adjacent to wildcat tracts in which a discovery has been made, or “drainage tracts.” Since the introduction of the Area-Wide Leasing program in 1983, the federal offshore leasing program has sold leases using a first-price sealed bid auction with a reserve price. The winner of a lease pays the bid, or “bonus,” on the sale date and 18.75% or 12.5% (16.67% prior to 2008) in royalties on revenues earned from post-sale production. If a wildcat tract lease is sold, the winner has the right to conduct exploratory drilling over a fixed period (typically 5 years). Most sales are wildcat sales (Hendricks and Porter 1996). The winner who leases a wildcat tract is likely to have the option to invest in an incremental project because he needs to decide the timing and initial intensity capacity. After making a discovery, he has the option of expanding capacity.Footnote 5 Thus, our study suggests that the DOI can charge a higher royalty rate for the wildcat tract when the uncertainty is smaller. The rest of this study is organized as follows: ""Literature review"" section presents a literature review. ""Model""  section introduces the assumptions of this model. ""Lumpy investment""  section  analyzes the winner’s choice of lumpy investment with variable or an exogenously given intensity. For each case, we derive the optimal royalty rate and assess how various factors (including output price uncertainty) affect this rate. ""Incremental investment""  section is similar to  ""Lumpy investment""  section for the case of incremental investment. ""Managerial and policy implications""  section describes how the auctioneer’s design of the royalty rate relates to the type of investment and presents the policy and managerial implications of the theoretical results. Finally, ""Conclusion""  section offers concluding remarks and suggestions for future research.",

9.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,13 March 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-023-00470-w,Online payment fraud: from anomaly detection to risk management,December 2023,Paolo Vanini,Sebastiano Rossi,Thomas Domenig,Male,Male,Male,Male,"Fraud arises in the financial industry via numerous channels, such as credit cards, e-commerce, phone banking, checks, and online banking. Juniper Research (2020) reports that e-commerce, airline ticketing, money transfer, and banking services will cumulatively lose over $ 200 billion due to online payment fraud between 2020 and 2024. The increased sophistication of fraud attempts and the increasing number of attack vectors have driven these results. We focus on online and mobile payment channels and identity theft fraud (i.e., stealing an individual’s personal information to conduct fraud )(Amiri and Hekmat 2021). The aim is to identify external fraudsters who intend to initiate payments in their interests. As fraudsters gain access to the payment systems as if they were the owners of the accounts, they cannot be identified based on the account access process. However, the fraudster behaves differently during a payment transaction than the account owner and/or the payment has unusual characteristics, such as an unusually high payment amount or transfer to an account in a jurisdiction that does not fit the life context and payment behavior of the customer. The assumption is that algorithms can detect anomalies in behavior during payment transactions. West and Bhattacharya (2016), Abdallah et al. (2016), Hilal et al. (2021), and Ali et al. (2022) reviewed financial fraud. They found a low number of articles regarding online payment fraud. For example, Ali et al. (2022) cited 20 articles on financial statement fraud and 32 articles on credit card fraud, see Li et al. (2021) for credit card fraud detection. Online payment fraud was not listed. The reviews also clarified that many articles utilized aggregated characteristics. However, we emphasize that fraud in online payments can only be detected based on individual data, as such fraud can only be detected through the possible different behavior of the fraudster and the account holder during payments. As fraudsters learn how best to behave undetected over time, they adapt their behavior. Therefore, self-learning defense methods are expected to outperform static-rule-based algorithms. The correctness of the expectation was shown by Abdallah et al. (2016) and Hilal et al. (2021). Various machine-learning algorithms for fraud detection have been proposed in the literature, including decision trees, support vector machines, and logistic regression to neural networks. Aggarwal and Sathe (2017) discussed various methods for outlier ensembles, and Chandola et al. (2009) provided a taxonomy and overview of anomaly detection methods. A common feature in many studies is imbalanced data (i.e., the low proportion of fraud events in the dataset, see Wei et al. 2013; Carminati et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2022a; Singh et al. 2022). Risk detection involves detecting fraudulent transactions and stopping them before execution. In addition to the efficiency of the algorithms, the data basis is an important reason for the differences in fraud-detection performance. While many studies have utilized either often less rich synthetic or Kaggle data, we were able to work with real data. Log files, which have substantial information content in our work, are hardly expected in Kaggle data. The difference in the data complexity is also reflected in the number of features. Singh et al. (2022) showed that the feature space consists of 31 features compared to our 147 features. Moreover, the proportion of fraudulent transactions in Singh et al. (2022) is more than a hundred times higher than in our case. Consequently, our data are much more unbalanced than any other study we know of, and the task of finding efficient fraud detection algorithms is more difficult. However, limiting risk management to the optimal detection of anomalies does not ensure that losses caused by fraud are minimal. Optimal fraud detection can be economically suboptimal if, for example, it is efficient for small amounts of money but unsuccessful for large amounts. Thus, the machine learning outputs for risk identification must be optimized from an economic perspective. We call this optimization the triage model. Yet, neither fraud detection nor the triage model can provide an answer to the question of how large the losses in a payment channel are. Therefore, we develop a statistical risk model that considers the effects of countermeasures on loss potential. The risk model provides risk transparency and makes it possible to assess which measures in the fight against fraud in various payment channels make sense from an economic and risk perspective. Literature on fraud risk models often refers to qualitative or assessment models for assessing fraud risk or risk assessment models (Sabu et al. 2021). We are not aware of any quantitative fraud risk management framework that explicitly considers the impact of the fraud detection process statistically in risk modelling. For organizational, procedural, and legal risk aspects, we refer to the literature. Montague’s (2010) book focuses on fraud prevention in online payments but does not consider machine learning and risk management in detail. The Financial Conduct Authority’s Handbook (FCA 2021) provides a full listing of the FCA’s legal instruments, particularly those relating to financial crime in financial institutions. Power (2013) highlights the difference between fraud and fraud risk from historical and business perspectives. Van Liebergen (2017) looks at “regtech” applications of machine learning in online banking. Fraud risk events in cryptocurrency payment systems are different from the online banking cases under consideration; see Jung et al. (2019) for fraud acting on a decentralized infrastructure and the review article of Trozze et al. (2022). The development and validation of the three linked models are the main contributions of our work. To our knowledge, this is the first study to develop, validate, and link components of the risk management process. The output of the anomaly detection model (i.e., the ROC curves), is the input for the triage model, which provides economically optimized ROC curves. Fraud statistics data were utilized to calibrate the various components in the risk model. With these three models, the fraud risk management process can be qualitatively implemented at the same level as the risk management of market or counterparty risks (see Bessis (2011) to describe risk management in banks). The performance of our risk management framework is the second contribution, although the performance comparison of our fraud detection method with the literature is limited and cautious, due the use of synthetic data instead of real data, a consideration of different channels in payments with different behavioral characteristics of bank customers, and the publication of incomplete statistics. Nevertheless, we compared our work with Wei et al. (2013) and Carminati et al. (2015), both of which analyze online banking fraud based, in part, on real data. The true positive rate (TPR) at a false positive rate (FPR) of \(1\%\) was \(45\%\). In Wei et al. the TPR is between \(49\%\) and \(60\%\), but unfortunately, the FPR is unknown. In the relevant scenario of Carminati et al. (2015), the TPR is \(70\%\) with an FPR of \(14\%\). This FPR is not acceptable to any bank. Processing by specialists leads to high costs. We discuss all these statements in detail in the ""Validation results"" section. Considering all three models, the theoretical and practical importance of our approach becomes clear. The expected losses in a scenario of CHF 2.023 million, which utilizes the results of machine learning without economic optimization in the triage model, common in the literature, are reduced to CHF 0.800 million with the triage model (i.e., a reduction in the loss potential by more than 60% follows). In addition, if fraud detection is implemented without a risk model, fraud risk can be massively overestimated. Applying our models to three different payment channels, the overestimation of risk ranged from 54% to over 700%. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In ""Fraud risk management framework"" section, the model selection for the fraud risk management framework is motivated and described. In ""Online payment fraud anomaly detection"" section, we consider the anomaly-detection model. ""Fraud detection triage model"" section links fraud detection to an economic perspective utilizing the triage model. ""Risk model"" presents the statistical risk model. ""Conclusion"" section concludes.",1

FinTech refers to the use of technology in global business structures to deliver better financial services to clients. However, the phrase itself is still a subject of debate. In actuality, FinTech is a blanket term encompassing several different technologies that constantly communicate in a common infrastructure (Xu et al. 2019). Traditional banks are under increasing pressure to update their core business operations and services as technology-driven enterprises that provide financial services become more prevalent (Bazarbash 2019; Fang et al. 2022). Many banks are now addressing digitalization concerns by partnering with startups that provide innovative banking services and unique service bundles (FinTech). Banking, traditionally one of the most conservative and traditional areas of the economy, has recently been challenged by potentially disruptive technology-driven innovations and Web solutions (Athari et al. 2022; Ayhan et al. 2022). By creating new information technology (IT)-enabled service models, new startup industries and worldwide technology companies in many contexts have created more customer-oriented and user-friendly automated processes in the banking industry, contributing to increased digital service innovation of financial products. FinTech companies have also played a role in the creation of many of these new banking products. Several of the latest technological advances can alter or potentially destroy the business operations of some of the more traditional institutions. As a result of digitalization and platform-enabled FinTech, banks have been compelled to review their organizational building and increase their accessibility to market interactions (Sebastião and Godinho 2021; Stojanović et al. 2021). FinTech offers identical services to banks, perhaps more effectively as a result of technology improvements, but in a distinct, and unbundled way. For example, crowdfunding platforms transform funds into lending in the same manner as banks. Unlike banks, however, they employ big data instead of long-term connections; access to care is only dispersed via online networks, risk and trust conversion are not conducted, and borrowers, and lenders, along with investors and investment possibilities, are immediately matched. These are all FinTech-related endeavors. However, the scope of these unmetered FinTech activities is limited. For example, platforms struggle to provide a diverse range of investment options to their customers without taking on some risk (Stojanović et al. 2021). Figure 1 shows a general representation of financial technology (FinTech). General representation of financial technology (FinTech) FinTech payment systems have had a huge impact on the financial services industry. Payment systems or credit contracts are transitions that, unlike cars, or other purchases, generally do not involve any physical components. Another reason is that, apart from some physical involvement, such as customer assistance, many activities, such as payment processing or trading industries, are largely carried out without any actual touch (Claessens et al. 2018). The ongoing economic growth and development process is causing a substantial reorganization of the financial advisory production chain, including technological advances such as robo-advisors and new competitors entering the industry because of recent technological advancements, such as those of Apple. “Financial technology,” or “FinTech,” reflects growth induced by IT transformation (Li et al. 2022; Navaretti et al. 2018). Cryptocurrencies are decentralized digital assets that enable safe electronic payments. The notion of cryptocurrency emerged as a division of the digital cash phenomenon, but it was only with the introduction of Bitcoin that it gained widespread acceptance. FinTech has witnessed several significant advancements over the last decade, with Bitcoin at the forefront. Furthermore, the worldwide business, and economic development crisis—which corresponds to the financial collapse that started in the US financial sector in 2007–2008—has reduced public trust in banking organizations, which has enabled cryptocurrencies to become available. Since then, the sector has grown rapidly, propelled by rising acceptability, increased media attention, steady inflows, the initial coin offering mania, and improved transition capacity. Cryptocurrency has the potential to open up new FinTech marketplaces. Cryptocurrency improves the efficiency of money transfers. FinTech benefits from cryptocurrency since it helps prevent fraud (Degerli 2019; Kou et al. 2021). FinTech credit is a credit activity that is made possible by electronic platforms. Borrowers are normally connected directly with investors; however, other platforms lend straight from their financial sheets. FinTech engagement in the credit market and online credit use promote sales and transaction growth for global-level businesses. These factors show the extent of credit market frictions and the advantages of new credit technology in strengthening credit markets (Hau et al. 2019). A peer-to-peer (P2P) market is a networked model in which two individuals engage directly with one another to buy products and services or to jointly develop products and services without the need for a middleman or a commercial business. P2P lending platforms lure customers who have limited or no access to conventional banks' credit capabilities. Although many banks and financial institutions offer online loan application services, only a small number of them verify the applications (Najaf et al. 2022). FinTech involves the new use of knowledge to solve the extensive catalog of transition issues that the insurance business is now experiencing. It incorporates the use of technology to enhance CRM, pricing consolidation, Omni channel marketing acquisition, the Digital Claims Process, and online policy purchase in customer interactions. In the case of blockchain, the use of car telemetry, sensor data, traceability, asset trading, and home security may help insurers generate new income streams. Wearable tech, genetic information, chronic disease management, and preventive healthcare may all change the way insurance companies serve their customers (Yang et al. 2021). Several existing approaches to FinTech transaction, credit, and insurance systems have flaws. Some experts feel that the FinTech revolution is a double-edged sword: on the one hand, it reduces banking costs, while on the other, it adds costs for infrastructure that must be constructed to accommodate FinTech growth. According to Hinson et al. (2019), nonperforming loan risk has increased dramatically with growth in FinTech lending. The explosion in FinTech lending is a direct result of the FinTech revolution. It has increased the likelihood that people and families can obtain loans at reasonable rates. According to Claessens et al. (2018), the low collateral requirements, and insufficient legal backing in FinTech are to blame for the rise in nonperforming loans. However, Lee and Shin (2018) stated that due to the short-term nature of these loans and their focus on the retail rather than the business sector, FinTech loan default risk is lower than that of a traditional commercial bank loan. Some studies have shown that the banking industry has become more vulnerable to competitive pressures because of the rising impact of FinTech. For instance, FinTech expansion has been shown to decrease bank market share, increase banking regulations, and lower bank profit margins, among other negative effects. This paper introduces a blockchain-based finance solution for tackling various transition challenges within the banking sector. First, payment, credit, and insurance are gathered for the dataset. The dataset is then denoised for outliers/noises through the normalization approach. These normalized data are stored in the blockchain through smart contracts to prevent cheats. Due to the limitations of existing approaches, the rolling window autoregressive lag (RARDL) modeling approach is suggested in this research to examine economic improvement. The study contributes to the ongoing literature because blockchain technology is anticipated to improve data protection, help accelerate resolution, and automate processes to reduce expenditures. Open banking may leverage payment systems enabled by blockchain. However, if properly used and controlled, the self-governing capabilities of blockchain might result in systemic changes. Higher hardware prices and computer power requirements could hinder its deployment. The remaining parts of this paper are the (1) literature review and problem statement, (2) proposed work, (3) performance analysis, and (4) conclusion.

9.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,09 March 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-023-00471-9,Is a correlation-based investment strategy beneficial for long-term international portfolio investors?,December 2023,Seema Wati Narayan,Mobeen Ur Rehman,Chaoqun Ma,Female,Unknown,Unknown,Female,"In recent years, numerous academics and research institutions have concentrated on portfolio rebalancing to mitigate portfolio risks. Although some studies have addressed whether diversifying international portfolios into emerging market countries benefits investors, most studies have not yet accounted for the investment strategies employed, and the benefits for long-term investors remain unknown. Stock market volatility will significantly impact capital market and economic growth (Wen et al. 2019). Understanding institutionally sensible and long-term productive investment policies is thus critical for a country’s development. The portfolio’s goal, as the core of investment strategies, is to regulate its systematic risk to the market and protect the entire portfolio’s security and income. Portfolio theory postulates that higher diversification gains can be obtained if the investment portfolio is composed of weakly correlated assets. Combining an asset with a negative or low correlation with other assets in a portfolio result in superior risk-adjusted returns (Markowitz 1952). This approach is readily used to diversify risks over the lifetime of a portfolio investment, although its long-term benefits are not well understood, and financial data distribution is typically very complex (Li et al. 2021). Given the importance of weakly correlated assets in portfolios and to the best of our knowledge, there is no research on the impact of weakly correlated asset portfolios on the long-term benefits of investors. Therefore, to elucidate the long-term diversification benefits of such a strategy, this study develops correlation-based portfolios for emerging stock markets in Asia, Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), and Latin America, taking into account a commonly used rebalancing/hedging strategy. This study specifically considers a long-term investor from an emerging nation (i) who invests in the domestic market (i) and all other emerging markets (js) in Asia, CEE, Latin America, and MENA. Such an investor also rebalances or hedges his or her portfolio based on the unconditional correlations between i and js. Rather than grouping all j markets into a single portfolio, we develop five portfolios based on the unconditional correlation between markets (i) and (j) over the study period. We then use cointegration methods and vector error correction models (VECMs) to test long-term comovement between (i) and (j) emerging markets for each region. To assess the long-term relationships under different economic/financial conditions, we condition the relationships between (i) and (js) with the S&P 500, oil price, global investor sentiment, and S&P 500 during the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) and non-GFC (NGFC) period. The empirical models used to evaluate the five portfolios are similar to the autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH) or generalized ARCH (GARCH) family, which is commonly used to evaluate the spillover effects of international markets on domestic markets. However, we use panel cointegration and VECM estimation methods because we are interested in the long-term benefits of the correlation-based portfolio development strategy. These methods can test whether or not a cointegrating or stable long-term equilibrium relationship exists between i and j equity markets. Furthermore, cointegration can be easily used to assess long-term diversification gains; that is, if markets are cointegrated, on the same long-term equilibrium path(s), or comove in the long-term, diversification gains are predicted to be weak, and vice versa. A strand of the portfolio diversification literature assesses long-term diversification gains using the cointegration method. However, three key features distinguish the current study from previous research. First, the current study is the first to examine long-term diversification gains for portfolios of emerging market Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) organized by pairwise unconditional correlations. Previous studies did not necessarily consider any portfolio development strategy, whereas the current study examines portfolios developed using a rebalancing and hedging strategy. As Narayan and Rehman (2021) pointed out, most previous cointegration-based studies on equity markets considered regionally biased strategies because they examined at the pairwise cointegration relationship between markets in the same region. To develop the correlation-based portfolios, we first calculate the unconditional correlations between an emerging stock market MSCI (i)) against the rest of the emerging stock markets MSCIs (j) in the four regions over the study period (2000–2016) (Additional file 1: Table S1). Here, emerging market (i) refers to a domestic emerging nation, whereas emerging market (j) refers to an emerging foreign country. This is repeated for all nations in the four regions. Moreover, although Markowitz’s (1952) portfolio theory suggests that a low-correlated portfolio provides the best opportunities for portfolio diversification, we develop and evaluate portfolios with low-correlated to high-correlated assets to ensure completeness in our analyses. Hence, for each emerging stock market (i), we divide the (j) emerging markets into five portfolios (yellow, blue, green, purple, and red) based on the size of the correlations between i and js (Additional file 1: Table S2). MSCIs (js) are negatively to lowly correlated, are divided into yellow and blue portfolios for each region. The green portfolio includes the medium correlated emerging market MSCIs, whereas the purple and red portfolios include the highly correlated emerging market MSCIs. Next, region-specific panels are developed, with five panels for each region. Each panel includes stock markets from all countries in a region and a portfolio of other emerging markets from all four regions. We consider this panel setup to be reliable because regression of the i’s against each of the five j portfolios by region produces the logical effect one would expect from this setup—that highly correlated (j) markets have a greater influence on domestic markets (i) than less correlated (j) markets. Second, as previously stated, the present study examines a portfolio of MSCIs from all four regions for a country’s representative investor. Modeling multiple assets simultaneously caters for a more realistic scenario in which investors diversify domestic equity market risk with more than one international asset. However, the literature is only concerned with pairwise relationships, for example, in Asia (Candelon et al. 2008; Gupta and Guidi 2012; Batareddy et al. 2012), CEE (Linne 1998; Demian 2011; Caporale and Spagnolo 2012; Bieńkowski et al. 2014), MENA (Gündüz and Omran 2001; Yu and Hassan 2008; Chortareas et al. 2011), and Latin America (Choudry 1997; Chen et al. 2002). These studies are explained in Sect. ""Literature review"". Third, in this study, the cointegration relationship between domestic markets and each of the five portfolios (with low-to-high-correlated assets) is evaluated in the presence of some economic and financial economic conditions, namely the U.S. stock market, Brent oil market, investor sentiments, and the GFC. However, the literature focuses on the spillover effects of other equity markets on the domestic market without considering such shocks. With the rapid development and diversification of the economy and finance (Kou et al. 2021), some studies take U.S. stock market shocks into account when examining a cointegration relationship between equity markets (Diamandis 2009; Abid et al. 2014; Lin and Lin 2018). A few recent studies evaluating portfolio diversification gains within Asia emphasize the importance of accounting for economic and financial conditions (Narayan and Rehman 2017, 2018, 2020). To foreshadow our key results, the cointegration results, which are consistent across all portfolios and regions, suggest that selecting a low-correlated portfolio to maximize diversification gains does not always translate into long-term diversification gains. We also find that investors in the four regions can improve their long-term diversification opportunities by hedging oil prices and changes in the U.S. stock market. Our findings imply that, in times of higher oil prices and negative S&P 500 shocks, emerging market investors can reduce their long-term vulnerability to these shocks by including (or switching from) minimally to highly correlated emerging markets in their portfolio. Lowly correlated emerging markets in the portfolio are beneficial because they have the least impact and act as effects to protect the domestic emerging market from varying investor sentiment. Given that our primary research uses average correlations calculated between 2000 and 2016 to develop the various portfolios, this suggests that investors have less-than-perfect knowledge when constructing their portfolios. We conduct the following to account for even more flaws in our knowledge. Using the correlation strategy applied over 2000–2016 (as shown in Additional file 1: Table S2), we re-develop portfolios over the recent years (2017–2022), replicating the behavior of investors who used prior knowledge (in this case, on the correlation strategy) to develop their portfolio over 2017–2022. We then reassess the long-term benefits of the newly developed portfolios. Although many portfolios constructed in this manner are found to be unsuitable for the long-term analysis performed here, this method that allows for imperfect knowledge confirms that our main findings are robust. The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.  ""Literature review"" section reviews the literature. ""Empirical method"" section describes the empirical model and the estimation method. Data and preliminary data analysis"" section describes the data and provides preliminary analyses of the data. ""Empirical results"" section presents the empirical results. ""Further analysis"" section delves into our out-of-sample analysis and key findings. Finally, ""Conclusion"" section concludes the paper.",

With technological advances, cash transactions have gradually evolved into noncash payments and governments worldwide are increasingly promoting digital payments, particularly in emerging economies (Gupta et al. 2020; Hung et al. 2021; Lonkani et al. 2020; Malaquias et al. 2021; Omigie et al. 2020; Wamba et al. 2021). Meanwhile, private digital currencies—such as Bitcoin and Libra, the super-sovereign digital currency issued by Facebook—have emerged consecutively, attracting widespread attention from central banks and all sectors of society. For instance, between 2019 and 2022, the digital currency electronic payment (DCEP) system was piloted and connected to Alipay and other platforms. By December 31, 2021, the number of DCEP pilot scenarios exceeded 8,085,100, with 261 million individual wallets opened and 87.565 billion Chinese yuan in transactions. The concept of DCEP has two key aspects. First, DCEP is fiat money issued in digital form by the People’s Bank of China, operated by designated operating institutions, and offered to the public. Based on the broad account system, DCEP supports the function of loose coupling of bank accounts. Second, DCEP is equivalent to cash and coins, implying that it predominantly resides at monetary base (M0)—that is, cash in circulation, referring to the sum of the cash in the hands of enterprises, departments, and other units outside the banking system and the cash held by residents. M0 is closely related to consumption: The more it is, the more willing residents are to consume. Developing countries are more active in the research, development, and promotion of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), for which payment security, payment efficiency, and financial stability are the most important driving forces. As a CBDC, the DCEP provides a more convenient and secure payment method. Its issuance impacts the existing payment system, currency supply and demand, and economic and financial systems (Yao 2018). CBDCs exhibit unique advantages, such as settlement finality, liquidity, and integrity. The ultimate benefits of adopting new payment technologies depend on the competitive structure and data-management arrangements of the payment system. Digital currencies should be designed with public interest in mind, and CBDCs and open platforms should create virtuous cycles that favor greater access, lower costs, and better services (BIS 2021). Digital and contactless payments accelerated owing to COVID-19. As a leader in the field of QR code payments, the Chinese market has cultivated two mature QR code payment methods—specifically, independent and dependent. Simultaneously, one of the most innovative and growing payment technologies is based on biometrics. American Express, Visa, and BNP Paribas have developed payment systems based on biometric technology. However, in developed regions, such as North America and Europe, the adoption level of these technologies is still insufficient (Liébana-Cabanillas et al. 2022). A payment system based on biometric technology can guarantee certain payment security because users are uniquely identified, but service providers must ensure users’ trust. Compared with cash, DCEP affects the privacy of user payment data, similar to the issues associated with mobile payments (Xia et al. 2022). However, unlike mobile payment platforms, the central bank—as a non-commercial entity—has no motivation to use private transaction data and can credibly commit to protect users’ data better than private banks or digital platforms, thus effectively addressing personal privacy issues and avoiding potential price discrimination against consumers (Auer et al. 2022). However, these advantages are based on the premise of assured data protection and public acceptance of DCEP. DCEP benefits users with payment security, transaction costs, and payment efficiency. Additionally, DCEP’s unique monetary qualities, such as anonymity control, anti-counterfeiting trait, traceability, and programmability, also contribute to its efficacy in monetary policy and financial stability maintenance. However, with numerous competitive applications, DCEP cannot entirely replace existing payment instruments. Simultaneously, the promotion of legal digital currency faces social and technical resistance, as well as the impact of other digital currencies. Hence, whether DCEP can be widely used and accepted by the market and the public depends on the applicability of its application scenarios, as presented in Table 1. Under different national backgrounds, digital fiat currencies precipitate various user benefits. CBDCs may be more challenging to be adopted in developing countries than in developed countries because of the scale of the informal economy and anonymity of cash that allows users to hide their transaction histories in developing countries (Oh and Zhang 2022). The informal economy is an alternative source of growth and a buffer for the business cycle, but it is also characterized by low productivity, inadequate social protection, and financial exclusion. For emerging economies, CBDCs can cover a broader tax base by limiting tax evasion and other illicit activities, thus improving financial inclusion and overall economic mobility, offering formal electronic payment options for the unbanked, and facilitating the formalization of a long-term virtuous business cycle. These benefits can help alleviate the cost and complexity of payment system monopolies and fragmentation. For example, in China, the switching barriers and transaction fees between different mobile payment platforms could make DCEP a viable choice to match varying transaction scenarios, boosting its acceptance by consumers and merchants. In other economies, their existing payment systems are either already sufficiently robust or can be easily amended through additional improvements and upgrades. Nevertheless, currency substitution risks and other spillover effects associated with the CBDCs of large economies cannot be underestimated. The DCEP promises to address these issues; however, it must exhibit significant technological improvements compared to the existing payment systems (Soffer and Abir 2022). Current studies related to mobile payment have predominantly focused on initial adoption and continuous usage behavior (Chin et al. 2020; Gupta et al. 2020; Humbani and Wiese 2019; Patil et al. 2020; Seth et al. 2020; Shao et al. 2019; Yuan et al. 2019), with a lack of attention to users’ switching behavior (Hu et al. 2021). As the issuing bodies of CBDC, banks also pay greater attention to fintech’s role in improving customer satisfaction (Kou et al. 2021a). Owing to the characteristics of DCEP and its advantages over other payment methods, it is suitable for exploring users’ switching behavior for specific DCEP payment scenarios (Gong et al. 2022). As the basis for studying the mechanisms of switching behavior, the push-pull-mooring (PPM) model includes push factors that drive users away from existing services, pull factors that attract users to alternative services, and mooring factors that hinder or promote transfer behavior (Tang and Chen 2020; Loh et al. 2020). Prior studies have generally considered dissatisfaction, substitution attraction, and switching costs as push, pull, and mooring factors; and explored the switching behaviors of payment instruments impacted by the original habits of payment instruments, perceived security and operability, product involvement, and consumers’ attitudes (Lee 2019; Liu et al. 2021; van der Cruijsen and van der Horst 2019). However, the specific situational variables affecting users’ switching behavior have not been entirely determined. For example, existing mobile payment service providers require users to disclose highly confidential personal information to complete transaction processes, wherein privacy issues may either be a driving factor for switching or a mooring factor for continuous usage (Yang et al. 2019). Against this backdrop, considering that DCEP is still in its pilot and promotion stages, this study aims to investigate users’ willingness to switch to DCEP from the current commonly adopted payment methods through the PPM framework and task-technology fit (TTF) theory by exploring the DCEP payment method’s advantages and application scenarios. Specifically, we aim to explore the following research questions: RQ1 What characteristics of the use context of DCEP are attractive to users? RQ2 What is the relationship between the characteristics of DCEP, user payment requirements, and user concerns compared to other payment methods? RQ3 How do the task-technology fitness and relative advantage of DCEP affect users’ willingness to adopt DCEP?",

Salisu,Rangan Gupta,Male,Unknown,Unknown,Male,"Previous studies tend to consider the relationship between Bitcoin prices and the aggregate US stock market index (see, among others, Bouri et al. 2017a; Baur et al. 2018; Das et al. 2020; Naeem et al. 2020; Shahzad et al. 2020; Koutmos et al. 2021; Bouri et al. 2022),Footnote 1 pointing to potential diversification benefits arising from the detachment of Bitcoin from the global financial system. Notably, studies examining the Bitcoin–stock nexus at the sectoral level of US stock data are few and limited. For example, Symitsi and Chalvatzis (2018) and Bouri et al. (2020a) focus on technology stocks and find evidence of significant linkages. According to Xu et al. (2022), the returns of blockchain and crypto-exposed US companies and major cryptocurrencies all jump together. However, the US stock market includes heterogenous stocks from not only the information technology sector, but also from ten different sector indices covering financials, telecommunications, and energy and gas, to name a few. Many US investors use sector rotation strategies in response to changes in market conditions and economic cycles.Footnote 2 Although preliminary, the consensus from those studies suggests that the magnitude and sign of the relationship between Bitcoin and US stock returns are sector dependent (see, Bouri et al. 2020a, b), indicating the utility of conducting an analysis at the sectoral level of US stock data. Stock volatility is important to traders, investors, and policymakers in addition to stock returns. Indeed, given the importance of exogenous variables in forecasting models, option pricing, volatility trading strategies, and portfolio allocation and risk management,Footnote 3 many practitioners are keen to understand more about them. Therefore, it would be useful to provide comprehensive evidence on whether Bitcoin prices contain valuable information that can be used to forecast stock volatility at the aggregate and sectoral levels. However, there is no evidence that Bitcoin prices can predict the volatility of the US stock market index and its various sector indices. Addressing this question is timely and relevant given that many retail and institutional stock investors in the United States view Bitcoin as an investment or trading venue. Furthermore, policymakers are looking for ways to leverage the cryptocurrency universe to launch a digital US dollar or a central bank digital currency. From policy and investment perspective, numerous compelling reasons exist to examine the Bitcoin–US stock nexus. First, policymakers are concerned about sustaining economic growth and therefore are constantly under immense pressure to understand macroeconomic variables capable of predicting stock market behavior, thereby influencing policy implementation. Therefore, understanding the predictive power of Bitcoin prices for the US stock volatility will aid relevant policymakers in developing policies to sustain economic growth. Second, stock market performance is regarded as an important indicator of macroeconomic stability within an economy, as well as a means of attracting foreign investment. Thus, policymakers must ensure stock market stability by monitoring risk factors that could distort its stability.Footnote 4 Third, in the valuation of investment securities, investors are frequently interested in information on market risk and its relevant predictors, which helps minimize risks and improve risk-adjusted returns. In sum, as long as the US stock market is an integral part of the US economy, discussions and analyses about risk predictors will be prominent among investors and policymakers. Motivated by evidence of stronger ties between Bitcoin and the US stock markets in the last 2 years (Kristoufek 2020; Kumar et al. 2022) and a lack of empirical evidence on the predictive power of Bitcoin prices for the volatility of US stock indices, particularly at the sectoral level, the goal of this paper is to examine Bitcoin prices’ ability to predict the realized volatility of the S&P 500 composite index and its 11 sector indices. Methodologically, we apply Westerlund and Narayan’s (2012, 2015) model, which accounts for key salient data features, such as endogeneity, persistence, and conditional heteroscedasticity. We conduct in-sample and out-of-sample analyses over multiple forecast horizons. Our analysis allows for possible structural breaks within the model framework to enhance the predictive capability of the applied model (Salisu et al. 2019a). Furthermore, we chose realized volatility because of its inherent ability to provide an observable and unconditional metric of volatility (model-free), whereas other volatility models, such as conditional volatility models and stochastic volatility models,Footnote 5 would have been a latent process (see Chan and Grant 2016; Bouri et al. 2021). Still, we consider conditional volatility obtained from GARCH modeling to ensure the robustness of our main results. Our main findings show that Bitcoin prices have an inverse relationship with the realized volatility of US stock indices. Regardless of stock sector or forecast horizon, the predictive model that accounts for Bitcoin prices and salient features of data outperforms the benchmark historical average model. Notably, incorporating Bitcoin prices as a predictor results in higher economic gains across a wide range of US stock sector indices. These results indicate the importance and utility of closely monitoring Bitcoin prices when forecasting the realized volatility of US stock sectors. Our methodology and findings contribute to three lines of investigation. The first line is about the literature on Bitcoin–US stock market links, which appears to show mixed findings. For example, some previous studies show a weak relationship and thus hedging and safe haven implications for asset allocation and risk management (Bouri et al. 2017a; Baur et al. 2018; Shahzad et al. 2020), whereas others find a stronger relationship after the pandemic jeopardizes Bitcoin’s hedging ability (see, Conlon and McGee 2020; Kristoufek 2020; Kumar et al. 2022). Elsayed et al. (2022), Jiang et al. (2022), Maghyereh and Abdoh (2022), and Akyildirim et al. (2021) have all documented significant volatility links between aggregate stock market returns and the Bitcoin market. Furthermore, the majority of previous studies have attempted to explain Bitcoin volatility (see, e.g., Walther et al. 2019; D’Amato et al. 2022; Sapkota 2022; Wang et al. 2022) or focused on the predictability of major cryptocurrencies and the profitability of trading strategies using machine learning techniques (Sebastião and Godinho 2021),Footnote 6 whereas our paper has a different scope by focusing on Bitcoin price ability to predict stock volatility. The second line of investigation focuses on Bitcoin and sectoral stock indices. For example, at the sectoral level of stock data, Bitcoin and US sector returns appear detached or weakly related, which has significant hedging implications (Bouri et al. 2020a). Given the need for specialized and powerful computers for Bitcoin mining, information technology firms that manufacture computer hardware and software should be involved in the Bitcoin market. In fact, academic research focuses on specific sectors, such as technology (Bouri et al. 2020b) or technology and energy stocks (see, Symitsi and Chalvatzis). For example, Symitsi and Chalvatzis (2018) used generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH)-based models to demonstrate significant return and volatility links between Bitcoin and energy and technology companies. Rathi (2022) provides evidence of the cryptocurrency market’s impact on the semiconductor industry. Recent press articles highlight Bitcoin’s ability to predict the dynamics of US stock market indexes, particularly technology stocks. They argue that “investors are fleeing riskier assets from tech stocks to cryptocurrencies as the Federal Reserve weighs whether to launch a US digital currency.”Footnote 7 The third line of investigation is concerned with the relationship between Bitcoin and US stock indices, which can be subject to structural breaks due to upsetting and irregular events (see, Ciaian et al. 2016; Salisu et al. 2019c). As a result, we account for structural breaks in the predictive models for volatility of US sector indices, and we then assess both the in-sample and out-of-sample predictive contents of Bitcoin prices, as well as other salient features of the series. Finally, we provide some utility metrics for assessing the value of observing Bitcoin prices when valuing stock market risk. The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. ""Related studies"" section examines the literature on the relationship between Bitcoin and traditional markets, particularly stock market indices. ""Methodology"" section describes the methodology. ""Data Description"" section contains the dataset. ""Results"" section presents and discusses the results, and conducts a robustness analysis.

9.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,05 March 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-023-00465-7,Fundamental and speculative components of the cryptocurrency pricing dynamics,December 2023,Jiri Kukacka,Ladislav Kristoufek,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Cryptoasset marketsFootnote 1 have come a long way from being a fringe curiosity of financial markets to being viewed as players of interest by regulators and central banks. They have attracted, albeit in waves, the attention of both institutional and retail investors. Overall market capitalization increased from $1B in 2013 to almost $3T in 2021 and hovered between $1T–$2T in 2022. As cryptoassets, particularly Bitcoin, have been developed and advertised to challenge standard financial assets and instruments, currencies, and the monetary system, much of the financial research on these assets has focused on their properties as diversifiers, safe havens, and inflation hedges (Bouri et al. 2017; Selmi et al. 2018; Urquhart and Zhang 2019; Dutta et al. 2020; Shahzad et al. 2019). In addition to the above, several studies have also presented rather standard forecasting exercises utilizing various methodologies (Atsalakis et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2018; Adcock and Gradojevic 2019; Mudassir et al. 2020; Sutiksno et al. 2018; Bedi and Nashier 2020; Alexander and Dakos 2020; Sebastião and Godinho 2021; Gradojevic and Tsiakas 2021; Fang et al. 2021). Xu et al. (2019) and Fang et al. (2022) provide comprehensive surveys of blockchain, its potential, and implications for trading. Moreover, because cryptoassets are very different from their conventional counterparts, standard pricing and valuation methods are difficult or impossible to implement. Thus, studies on pricing and valuation are relatively scarce. Kristoufek (2015), following the earlier works on speculative attention-driven price dynamics in Kristoufek (2013); Garcia et al. (2014), and Garcia and Schweitzer (2015), is among the first to examine potential fundamental factors in Bitcoin price dynamics via wavelet coherence analysis. The results show that both fundamental (transactions, price level, supply) and speculative attention-based factors drive these dynamics. Hayes (2019) argues that marginal cost of production is essential for explaining Bitcoin prices, thus, challenging the standard economic viewpoint that Bitcoin is worthless. Kristoufek (2019) added the quantity theory of money to the equation, showing that the price dynamics (not necessarily the price itself, as the price level for the US economy is not available in USD terms) closely follow those implied by fundamental economic laws. White et al. (2020) concluded that Bitcoin can be best classified as a technology-based product, an emerging asset class, rather than a currency or security, which has important legal implications. In their heterogeneous agents model, Lee et al. (2020) showed that Bitcoin price dynamics can be explained by the interactions between speculators and tech-savvy investors, each following a different trading strategy. In addition, recurrent pricing bubbles and busts appear to be inherent to the dynamics of cryptoassets (Cheung et al. 2015; Corbet et al. 2018; Kyriazis et al. 2020; Fry 2018; Wheatley et al. 2019). We build our analytical approach based on three aspects of crypto-markets, as reported in the literature reviewed above: a speculative component, fundamentals, and emergent bubble-burst episodes. The main contribution of the current study stems from connecting these three aspects into a single complex model, instead of studying them separately or in an additive manner. Moreover, we cover a wide range of fundamental and speculative factors, at work inside the crypto-markets and outside. By doing so, we deliver novel insights into pricing dynamics of cryptoassets, connecting the dots between different approaches presented in the current topical literature. The catastrophe theory framework brought to empirical finance by Barunik and Vosvrda (2009) and Barunik and Kukacka (2015) provides a coherent playground for the study of cryptoassets as it is specifically transferred from the natural sciences to finance for inspecting the interactions between fundamental and speculative components of the market with endogenous bubbles and busts. In addition, the current study focuses on a larger set of cryptoassets to examine the strength of the speculative and fundamental components, their tendency to fall into price bifurcations, and if and how these aspects are connected to specific properties of such cryptoassets. Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), XRP, and Dogecoin (DOGE) are studied as they represent different types of cryptoassets. The cusp catastrophe model is the ideal instrument for inspecting the rich dynamics of the above-mentioned interactions. We find that the price dynamics of all the assets under study (except Dogecoin) emerge from complex interactions between the fundamental and speculative components, passing through price bifurcation episodes and characteristic price surges and collapses. Bitcoin possesses the most solid fundamentals. Generally, the fundamental components driving these dynamics are dominated by on-chain activity, while investor attention mainly represents speculative drivers. Traditional financial markets also drive crypto-markets through both channels via stock market price dynamics and market uncertainty. Thus, both sides of the pricing system—fundamental and speculative—play a unique role in dynamics and price formation, and they are both influenced by the stock market. Thus, the crypto-market is not detached from traditional financial markets. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section provides an overview of the literature on catastrophe theory and the following section introduces “Cusp catastrophe model” and details of its application. In the section on “Estimation methodology and evaluation” we discuss the econometric procedures employed in this study. In the next section, “Data description and final sample,” we describe the datasets and discuss sample characteristics. The research hypotheses are developed in the next section. The following section “Empirical results” presents and interprets the quantitative and qualitative results of the empirical analysis. Finally, the “Conclusion” summarizes the study, discusses the implications and usefulness of the findings, and suggests potential avenues for future research. Additional details are provided in the Appendix.

9.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,03 March 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-023-00448-8,Smart cities from low cost to expensive solutions under an optimal analysis,December 2023,Romeo-Victor Ionescu,Monica Laura Zlati,Valentin-Marian Antohi,Unknown,Female,Unknown,Female,"From a social point of view, the sustainable development of cities under the smart city—smart community concept is the most important objective, ensuring the social well-being of community members; this is an important point. This is why the research examines the best practices in sustainable development and smart city development. Simultaneously, the current scale of the pandemic is an additional argument for examining urban development efforts for smart city-smart community solutions. The urban overpopulation and urban growth poles cause significant differences in social and economic development for these community members compared with other forms of population aggregation, and offer direct benefits to residents by sustainably increasing the quality of life and adaptability of the population to permanent societal challenges. In contrast, this urban agglomeration has amplified effects during the pandemic period through the accumulation of aggravating health and economic factors, but also during general periods through environmental pollution. In relation to the European strategic development objectives, the limitation in time of these effects is considered an aspect of sustainable development, the practices of limiting the adverse effects being supported by long-term financing by European and global organisms. In this context, the concept of smart city has acquired a nuance and aroused the interest of researchers both theoretically and practically, currently existing top cities on all indicators that have approached the concepts of smart cities or smart communities to manage the negative aspects of urban agglomeration growth. In this sense, a combination of scientific approaches shows that the implementation of smart management in communities can generate viable solutions to specific problems; however, there is need for an integrated approach to achieve the status of a smart city or community. The literature contains various concerns related to smart city development, particularly regarding the effect of smart cities on quality of life, in conjunction with the identification of funding sources to support urban administrative activity in the direction of decreasing pollution, increasing the dynamism of sustainable development, and reducing environmental effects. Therefore, the literature stipulates several models based on the six pillars (smart city economy, smart people, smart mobility, smart environment, smart living, and smart governance), as well as the psychological perception of smart development. These aspects will be analyzed in the literature review section and motivate the following research objectives: O1: critical analysis starting from the current state of scientific knowledge in the field. O2: the development of the smart city/smart community concept to objectively evaluate the progress of these forms of organization in relation to other classical/traditional forms of town organization. O3: the transposition of this model by pivoting the hypotheses into a minimal and extended dashboard with pivoting links on each branch of the table facilitates the step-by-step implementation of this form of superior organization of urban populations. O4: the identification of simple solutions, implementable in the short term, up to extensive solutions with high efficiency and high value-added contribution to the life of the applicant city inhabitants. The objective of this scientific approach is represented by a critical analysis starting from the current state of scientific knowledge in the field, the development of the smart city/smart community concept, to objectively evaluate the progress of these forms of organization in relation to other classical/traditional forms of town organization. In accordance with the objectives discussed earlier in this study, the authors achieved statistical analysis of the socio-demographic and economic indicators reported through the Eurostat platform by the first 10 European smart cities. The city of Bucharest was added to this list as an anti-pole for smart city development. The statistical data processed in dynamics allowed the consolidation of the smart indicators at the level of the selected sample (local Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Internet users, Research, Development and Innovation (RDI), Internet of Things (IoT), Internet banking, general motor rate, green vehicle motor rate, and polluting vehicle motor rate). These indicators were structured according to the average evolution of the selected sample during the period from 2009 through 2020. The main observations of the core indicators allowed the elaboration of a smart economic model, which analyzes the effect at the sample level of the adaptation of the smart city/smart community policies. The elaborated model allowed the construction of the dashboard of access actions in the smart city/smart community category on two levels of financial effort correlated with the effect on the sustainable development of smart cities. The results of the study are useful to all administrations ready for change and that want the rapid implementation of the measures with beneficial effects on the community or which, through a strategic vision, aim to connect to the European objectives of sustainable growth and social welfare for citizens.",2

A key benefit of “open innovation” is that it reduces production expenses (Povolna 2019; Poon et al. 2020). The current research paper analyzes the financial parameters of the US e-commerce sector from 1996 to 2021. The relationship between revenue forecasts for companies based on prepandemic and postpandemic values illustrates the effects on the industry (MacKinlay 1997; Lukin 2019). This idea ties in with the paper’s goal—to evaluate the impact of restrictive measures introduced during the pandemic on the role of market capitalization in e-commerce industry development. The sample data separately emphasize two individual firms in the analysis: Amazon and Alibaba. This approach is justified by the fact that these two companies are benchmarks and leaders of the global e-commerce sector in the strongest technological economies: the USA and China. At the end of 2020, Amazon accounted for 39% of all US e-commerce sales, while Alibaba had a 58.2% share of all retail e-commerce sales in mainland China (Nakhate and Jain 2020). The research methods presented in the analysis of Amazon and Alibaba are necessary to better understand the situation in the e-commerce industry. The objective of this paper is to analyze the effects of market capitalization shocks on open innovation models in the e-commerce industry. The novelty is based on new data for making forecasts about e-commerce companies in the USA. So, the findings fill the gap in the structure of the e-commerce sector in China and the USA, which is much more complex, with a weaker shock effect for small-market-capitalization companies (market capitalizations from $300 million to $2 billion). The finding adds to the growing literature on the effects of market capitalization on open innovation models in the e-commerce sector. The results show the positive impact of expanding production networks in e-commerce networks and further develop the ideas of Acemoglu et al. (2016) and Carvalho and Gabaix (2013). Moreover, the effect of market capitalization on open innovation models in US e-commerce companies in recent years is also determined. When analyzing the effects of market capitalization shocks on the e-commerce industry, companies should prioritize learning new financial ideas with competition and benchmarking. Within this framework, a detailed competitor analysis should be performed. With the help of this comprehensive analysis, creative ideas can be obtained. This situation has a positive impact on the development of successful financial innovation models for the e-commerce industry. Therefore, it may be possible to gain greater attention from e-commerce companies for these financial innovation products. Turan (2015), Akdere and Benli (2018), and Egorov and Pomazkin (2021) have highlighted the significance of creative ideas regarding the effectiveness of financial innovation models for the e-commerce industry. At the same time, the study shows that the state should seek more control in the production chain to strengthen the supervision of large-cap e-commerce companies, as existing studies have proven for the US and South African companies (Adam 2020). New data allow a detailed analysis and forecast of e-commerce companies in the USA and the underlying macroeconomic effects (Atalay et al. 2011; Tintelnot et al. 2017; Oberfield 2018; Khan et al. 2021). The novelty of the current study is the analysis of deglobalization effects amid the rapid development of e-commerce open innovation in the USA and China. In addition to this issue, another novelty of this study is developing evaluations by considering econometric models and a fuzzy decision-making methodology. This situation provides an opportunity to reach more precise results. Furthermore, appropriate strategies can be created to improve open financial innovation models for the e-commerce industry. The main finding is that appropriate strategies can be created to achieve these improvements. These findings add to the growing literature on the role of market capitalization for open innovation models in the e-commerce sector. Future research can explain how production networks spread impacts e-commerce networks exactly. This paper contributes to the literature on the effects of market capitalization for open innovation models on the e-commerce sector in the USA. This paper can prove the implications of the researchers make about market capitalization for open innovation models and deglobalization (Shea and Poast 2018; McCarthy 2019; Garcia-Sanchez and Garcia-Sanchez 2020). The structure of the paper is as follows. The introduction includes a description of the research problem; the second section of the study includes a literature evaluation of e-commerce, open innovation, market capitalization shocks, and methods. The third section discusses the methodology. The fourth section explains the analysis results. The fifth and seventh sections focus on the discussions and conclusions of the study. The final two sections focus on the strengths and limitations of the study and its practical and theoretical implications.",11
9.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,03 February 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-022-00440-8,A novel stochastic modeling framework for coal production and logistics through options pricing analysis,December 2023,Mesias Alfeus,James Collins,,Unknown,Male,Unknown,Male,"Coal is a combustible black or dark brown rock, mainly consisting of altered plant matter, inorganic matter and water. It is predominantly used for the production of electricity and in the steel making process. Whilst there is a strong political will against the use of fossil fuels like coal, commentators point out that the economical and socio-demographic drivers remain strong, see for instance (Schernikau 2010). The International Energy Agency’s World Energy Outlook 2021 has a forecast based on the stated policies of governments, both those implemented as well as in development. This only predicts a reduction in coal demand between 2020 and 2030 of less than 5% (IEA 2021) suggesting that Coal will remain an important commodity globally for several more years. The thermal coal market places more value on coal with a higher calorific value and a lower content of inorganic matter. Coal with a higher calorific value is less costly to transport and often more suitable for the power station boilers currently in existence. The inorganic mineral matter mainly consists of metal oxides such as silicon and aluminium which are incombustible and so this dilutes the thermal energy content of the coal. Furthermore, the inorganic matter forms ash and clinker in the furnace of a coal fired power station, which can be costly to dispose of. The industry commonly refers to the amount of inorganic mineral matter as the ash content of the coal. During the production of thermal coal the miner/producer can make various choices such as how the coal is mined, and how it is prepared which affect the quality and the amount of coal produced. For example, in a long-wall underground mine, the height of the section being mined can be modified. Typically, mining a narrow section allows the miner to select for the better quality coal but this is at the expense of not recovering all the resource in the seam. Similarly, industrial techniques such as density separation methods can be used to reduce the ash content of the coal; a process commonly referred to as washing. A sample of raw coal contains particles of all relative density values in a continuous range from the lowest to the highest value. The ash percentage of coal particles increases as their relative density increases, Nicol (1997). Therefore, the density of the medium that is used in the separation method can be varied to achieve different levels of ash content in the final coal product. Whilst washing harder removes more ash, the downside is that more organic combustible matter is also removed. The ratio of the weight of product coal to weight of the coal fed into the wash plant is known as the yield. Historically, the difference in price between high and low quality coals was relatively small and static. The decision on how to mine and wash the coal only needed to be periodically evaluated in a deterministic setting using tools that optimised based on discounted cash-flow analysis (“DCF”). However, more recently, the spread in prices between different grades of coal has become much more volatile and so the optimal configuration for mining would frequently change. One could seek to run DCF based optimisers more frequently, however, the use of DCF models for mine planning has been the subject of criticism (Davis and Newman 2008) given markets follow a stochastic process; not deterministic. Furthermore, the use of DCF optimisers does not allow for the economic valuation of the flexibility inherent in the mining operation. The ability to value such flexibility would allow mining producers to make better investment decisions on plant, machinery upgrades and process change. A different approach to DCF analysis is required in order to value the flexibility within a mining operation. We have therefore proposed to consider the application of Real Option Analysis (“ROA”) on the aforementioned mining and washing flexibilities—the most flexible parts of the coal production process—along with consideration for the stochastic process of coal prices. Which will be the first study of its kind (ROA) in regards to washing flexibilities at a coal mine. With the hypothesis that the value that could be monetized is at a level significant to warrant a change in business practises within the coal mining community. Real Option is the name given to assets or managerial flexibility that allow for choice and have payoffs similar to financial options such as calls or puts. Real Option Analysis is the application of mathematical finance techniques to value and risk manage these Real Options. A lot of the literature on Real Options focuses on managerial flexibility or long term investment decisions. Myers (1977) Pioneered real option pricing methodology and introduced ROA as a decision opportunity for a corporation or an individual. Likewise, Leslie and Michaels (1997) advocated the use of ROA with a hypothetical example applied to oil field extraction choices. Studies on ROA being applied to investment decisions also include the likes of Amusan and Adinya (2021) for the investment timing and value of iron ore mining projects; Chen et al. (2018) for the investment timing and value of gas storage; and also in the coal arena with Krisna and Faturohman (2021) for coal mining project investments. Recently (Alexander and Chen 2021) introduced a general decision-tree framework to manage model risk for real option to divest in a project. An ROA study on Power Generation Assets, Eydeland and Wolyniec (2002) shows how one can value and monetize flexibility within an asset or piece of equipment that has asymetric monetary pay-offs. This is very similar in nature to the asset flexibility inherent in a coal wash-plant, whereby the choice to generate electricity or not is akin to the choice of whether to wash coal or by-pass. Therefore, the first contribution of this paper is that we add to this literature which lacks a comprehensive study on stochastic modelling of coal production using real options in conjunction with option pricing theory. Secondly, we formulate a three-dimensional version of Fourier transform method for the flexible computation of the real option prices and performed a numerical experiment to show substantial computational gain compared to the Monte Carlo method. Thirdly, we carry out empirical analysis to provide important insights of using real options analysis in coal production to advance financial risk management for a hypothetical coal mine and this will be critical for risk assessment and business evaluation. Lastly, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to adopt option pricing theory to model real options with stochastic volatility component. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: in “Real options for investment projects” section, we describe the nature of the problem and reduce the valuation problem to a spread option pricing problem. “The model and methods” section discusses the model. Here we consider a 4-dimensional stochastic volatility model driving the modeling variables. We derive the numerical scheme based on a lower bound approximation for pricing a three-asset spread options. “Data and model parameters” section  focuses on data and data analysis. We also discuss the methodology to estimate the model parameters. In “Empirical analysis” section, we implement the model; we compare the semi-analytical formula with the Monte Carlo Simulation. “Conclusion” section  concludes.",
9.0,1.0,Financial Innovation,17 February 2023,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40854-023-00459-5,Management disclosure of risk factors and COVID-19,December 2023,Tim Loughran,Bill McDonald,,Male,Male,Unknown,Male,"The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) imposes reporting obligations on all firms with publicly traded securities. These reports are filed electronically and made available to the public on the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) website (https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml). The most comprehensive, and arguably most important, of these filings is the annual Form 10-K.Footnote 1 Form 10-K addresses 15 SEC-specified “Items”, such as “Risk Factors”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis”, and “Financial Statements”. Although Form 10-K is sometimes referred to as the “annual report”, it differs from the “annual report to shareholders”, which is typically made available to shareholders on the investor relations page of a firm. The 10-K—specifically Item 1A of the filing—should inform investors about the firm’s operational, legal, health, and environmental risks. Clearly, the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative effect on numerous US firms. For example, Fahlenbrach et al. (2021) examined the importance of financial flexibility during the COVID shock and documented that the average US firm experienced a − 37.8% decline in value from February 3, 2020, to March 23, 2020. Meanwhile, Altig et al. (2020) demonstrated that due to COVID-19 in the United States, the uncertainty proxied by implied stock market volatility, newspaper-based policy uncertainty, and even Twitter chatter about economic uncertainty increased dramatically. Baker et al. (2020) argued that strong US government restrictions on commercial activity and voluntary social distancing had a much greater impact on the stock market than previous pandemics. Using a large sample of firms in 61 economies, Ding et al. (2021) found that certain firm characteristics, such as more cash, less debt, and less entrenched executives, resulted in a milder stock price decline due to COVID. Moreover, Ramelli and Wagner (2020) demonstrated that firms with greater exposure to trade with China underperformed during the COVID-19 crisis.Footnote 2 In a textual analysis paper, Larcker et al. (2020) focused on the use of COVID-19 terminology (e.g., COVID, pandemic, epidemic, face mask, hand sanitizer, social distancing, and lockdown) in SEC filings between January 1 and May 29, 2020. They documented the speed with which firms disclosed COVID information to investors after the pandemic had begun. One of their intriguing findings is that National Beverage (the manufacturer of La Croix) made no mention of COVID in any of their financial disclosures through May 29, 2020, even as the virus was destroying the global economy. In contrast to Larcker et al. (2020) and prior research, we focus on firm disclosure to investors before the pandemic. Although the literature on the financial impacts of COVID is expanding rapidly, we are unaware of any that examines the correlation between managers’ foresight in acknowledging this risk when discussing the firm’s risk factors. In his Bloomberg blog, Matt Levine somewhat jokingly—with emphasis on “somewhat”—argues that all crimes or fraudulent activities associated with companies can be prosecuted as securities fraud. If a CEO is involved in an inappropriate liaison with an employee, it may be difficult to successfully prosecute in criminal court. However, if an executive of the firm is aware of this information and it is not made public, management has violated their obligation to disclose value-relevant information. The key point here, which has also been made in the academic literature (see Healy and Palepu 2001; Nagar et al. 2003), is that managers have a strong incentive to address the SEC’s required disclosures in a transparent and relatively exhaustive manner. The core theory of disclosure evolves from Akerloff’s (1970) result of market failure when product quality is uncertain in the presence of information asymmetry. Grossman and Hart (1980) and Milgrom (1981) showed that the conclusion of market failure can be avoided through disclosure and that, in equilibrium, there is an incentive for full disclosure. A branch of this literature focuses on disclosure in the context of managers signaling firm value. Full disclosure results become more nuanced in this literature as the assumptions of costless disclosure, certain information, and timing dynamics are considered.Footnote 3 Much of the empirical research on this topic focuses on management’s disclosure of earnings-related information. Although this literature provides a framework for understanding whether we expect managers to disclose COVID-related information, the threshold for disclosure attributable to disclosure costs and other extensions do not provide a conclusive answer.
 Note that the context for disclosure in our application differs from the typical context in which earnings-specific information is communicated. In our case, a company is required to describe all the material risks it may face. This disclosure will likely be repeated each year in the 10-K filing, barring any significant changes to the firm’s operating environment. This is more of an official recognition of risks that firms are likely already aware of, but which are not on the immediate event horizon and may be overlooked. We would argue that the simple concept of mandated disclosure, with incentives directly tied to shareholder lawsuits, would suggest that management should list broad macro risks fairly exhaustively. Thus, we will assume that managers who are well-informed and aware of potential macro risks have every incentive to disclose them. Typical 10-K filings are lengthy, and one might surmise that few people, other than Warren Buffet, read them in their entirety. For instance, Li (2008) reported that the average 10-K between 1994 and 2004 contained over 31,000 words, whereas Loughran and McDonald (2017) documented the paucity of investors and analysts who directly downloaded annual reports from EDGAR. In a two-day window surrounding the Form 10-K filing on EDGAR, Loughran and McDonald (2017) found that investors access annual reports of publicly traded companies 28.4 times on average. Meanwhile, Cohen et al. (2020) examined the variation in annual and quarterly filings from year to year. They reported that firms with substantial changes to their disclosures underperform those with only minor modifications. The three authors argue that investors are inattentive to these simple changes in financial disclosures because there is no announcement effect on the filing date. Thus, managers can potentially protect themselves from legal liability, as it is unlikely that the majority of individuals will notice any pertinent information they may reveal in the periodic filing. In fact, most large companies provide a comprehensive discussion of risks. The typical discussion of risk factors is gloomy, and it is difficult to imagine many investors immediately purchasing stock after reading this pessimistic information. For example, Sears Hometown & Outlet Stores devotes 11,844 words across 19 pages to describing their risks in their 2018 10-K filing. Meanwhile, Southwest Airlines discloses their risks in 4538 words across 9 pages. Southwest acknowledges that events with a low probability, such as “fires, floods, earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, power loss, computer and telecommunications failures, acts of war or terrorism, computer viruses, and security breaches…,” warrant disclosure. Similarly, Bed, Bath & Beyond, whose stock was significantly lower in 2020, lists “housing markets, recession, inflation, deflation, consumer credit availability, consumer debt levels, fuel and energy costs, interest rates, tax rates and policy, unemployment trends, the impact of natural disasters, civil disturbances and terrorist activities, foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation…” None of the pandemic-related terms we will discuss later are mentioned in any of these disclosures. Companies, particularly those in sensitive industries, should have anticipated pandemic risk. Long before the pandemic, the World Health Organization, the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, Bill Gates, and others identified this risk as nontrivial and consequential. Furthermore, articles from credible sources in the popular press highlighted the likelihood of a global crisis prior to its occurrence.Footnote 4 Given the stock market’s reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is abundantly clear that this risk is relevant to investors. The 1918 influenza pandemic and more recent outbreaks of SARS, MERS, H1N1, and Ebola are clear examples of pandemic risk potential. For instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic resulted in 12,469 deaths in the United States, a number quickly surpassed by COVID-19.Footnote 5 We contribute to the recently developed literature on the economic aspects of the COVID pandemic by investigating whether managers discussed the potential impact of a pandemic on their business prior to the outbreak. The COVID pandemic presents a unique circumstance in which an event with a relatively low probability could substantially impact a firm’s economic well-being. In retrospect, given the scientific community’s pre-COVID assessment that we were likely to experience a significant pandemic event, firms should have incorporated a discussion of this risk in their shareholder disclosures, particularly those firms that were more susceptible to such an event. We apply natural language processing techniques to 10-K filings to determine what percentage of firms addressed this risk.Footnote 6 We found that in 2018, less than 21% of firms included a pandemic-related word or phrase in Item 1A: Risk Factors of their 10-K. The most frequently occurring pandemic-related words are pandemic, epidemic, health concerns, contagious disease, Avian Flu, and infectious disease. Once COVID-19 began to devastate the financial markets in February–March 2020, one should expect a strong negative correlation between an industry’s propensity to warn of pandemic risks and their actual stock returns. In other words, industries with the greatest potential for economic disruptions during any pandemic should be the most forthright in alerting their shareholders of this risk. Once the pandemic struck, the stock performance of these high-risk industries would be negatively affected by the crisis. Therefore, there should be a negative relationship between pre-event pandemic-related word usage and actual stock returns during the pandemic. Interestingly, we do not find this relationship. We observe a correlation of 0.137 between the percentage of firms in a Fama and French (1997) industry that report at least one pandemic-related word and realized stock returns between February 3, 2020, and March 23, 2020. In hindsight, managers failed to adequately warn shareholders about the pandemic risk associated with their industry.",2

The most well-known benchmark for this purpose is the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) (Sharpe 1964), based on Markowitz’s mean–variance approach. Professionals and researchers have long been interested in improving the CAPM model. Numerous quantitative approaches and methods have been developed to solve some limitations of the CAPM or Markowitz’s portfolio optimization frameworks. Moreover, a large portion of the literature focuses on improving risk estimation in portfolio optimization. Financial network models enable a better understanding of the complex interactions between the various assets in a portfolio (Hautsch et al. 2015; Baitinger et al. 2017). Thus, Clemente et al. (2021) modified the model’s optimization program with financial network models. Yang et al. (2021) subsequently improved on this approach with a multiobjective model including idiosyncratic variance. Moreover, Yu and Chang (2020) employed network models to account for the effects of macroeconomic variables. They found that these approaches provide more diverse portfolios with better performance than standard methods. Following the development of Fintech, professionals are increasingly using quantitative approaches to assist financial and banking industries in lowering the costs of technology applications while increasing the quality of their services (Kou et al. 2021a, b). According to Kou et al. (2021a, b), the banking sector is motivated to invest in Fintech to gain a competitive advantage and payment and money transfer systems. Furthermore, as part of Fintech, many new mathematical and statistical approaches are being developed to improve financial risk analysis. According to Kou et al. (2021a, b), a two-stage multiobjective feature selection model is used to predict SME bankruptcy and improve firms’ performance classification. However, Fintech new approaches can also be used to improve portfolio allocation using automatic algorithms, as emphasized by Guidici et al. (2022). They associated the financial network with the random matrix theory (RMT) in their studies to differentiate the nature of a correlation based on a systematic or noise component. Many authors, including León et al. (2017), Raffinot (2017), and Ren et al. (2017), have demonstrated the value of using RMT to improve portfolio performance. Another literature section focuses on using wavelets’ time–frequency analysis to measure relationships between financial assets across various investment horizons (or macroeconomics cycles). The wavelets extract frequency components from time series while preserving their time information. Wavelets are then an extension of the spectral and cross-spectral analysis. The wavelets approach, which was originally developed for signal processing, is well suited to decomposing a time series into time–frequency space. In finance and economics, frequency is related to the period of cycles that comprise the original time series and is then applied to the investor’s investment horizon. Depending on the frequency grid, two wavelet transforms were developed: the maximal overlap discrete wavelets transform (MODWT) and the continuous wavelets transform (CWT). The primary distinction is the frequency grid used to select the accuracy of the results in the time and frequency domains. The MODWT provides frequency bands using a dyadic scale, whereas the CWT is finer and more accurate in extracting each frequency. Consequently, the computational time and effort differ in practice. When compared to the CWT approach, MODWT requires less computational effort. The studies of Gençay et al. (2003, 2005) were the first to use discrete wavelets decomposition in finance. They used a time–frequency least squares regression to estimate the beta parameter of the CAPM market line and to analyze the frequency-varying systematic risk and the frequency risk profiles of the stocks. They emphasize the wavelets’ interest in assessing the frequency dynamics of systematic risk. Other authors use wavelets in finance as a result of their research. Several studies have focused on its use in finance to model interdependencies and relationships between commodities, stock indexes, and other financial assets such as cryptocurrencies (Rua and Nunes 2012; Vacha and Barunik 2013; Aguiar-Conraria and Soares 2014; Bekiros and Marcellino 2014; Bekiros et al. 2016; Kahraman and Unal 2019). Recently, partial continuous wavelet approaches have been developed to examine better relationships between various financial asset classes, such as equities or cryptocurrencies (Athari and Hung 2022), Islamic equities (Al-Yahyaee et al. 2020), or metals and energy future prices (Michis 2022). These studies discover that investment horizons (frequencies) influence risk’s diffusion. As a result, the characteristics of the assets and their degree of correlation are related to different time–frequency schemes describing risk contagion mechanisms. As Gençay et al. (2003, 2005) demonstrated, using wavelets and a time–frequency analysis allows us to differentiate the beta parameter of the CAPM based on different investment horizons. The beta parameter of the market’s line is commonly used to establish an equity risk-profile. A beta of 1 indicates that the stock follows market movement in the same proportions that a beta greater (respectively lesser) than 1 indicates that the stock amplified (respectively attenuated) market fluctuation. Their results imply that the risk-profile (of a portfolio or a stock) is frequency dependent because the beta is frequency-varying. Mestre and Terraza (2018), McNevin and Nix (2018), Shah et al. (2018), and Sakemoto (2020) all confirmed that systematic risk is conditional on an investment horizon (frequencies). These studies also discovered that frequency dynamics differ across industries. These results are also observed and confirmed for CAPM extensions, such as Sakemoto’s (2020) intertemporal CAPM and Mestre’s (2021) arbitrage pricing theory (APT) and Fama–French models. Alexandridis and Hasan (2020) used wavelets to investigate the effect of the Global Financial Crisis on systematic risk. They found that the beta rises during the crisis period compared to the pre-crisis period, particularly at lower frequencies. The CAPM’s hypothesis of homogeneity of the agents’ behavior can then be relaxed using wavelets. In this case, we assume that agents are distinguished by their trading behavior related to a specific investment horizon (short-run investors vs. long-run investors). We suppose that agents’ investment strategies should include a better measure of the market risk that is more in line with their trading behaviors. As a result, we propose comparing short and long-run estimations of the CAPM market’s line to discuss the robustness of the stock’s risk-profile across frequency. Previous research has shown that systematic risk (the beta) varies with frequency. However, the authors assume that it is time-invariant. This is a well-known issue in the literature. Numerous studies on the CAPM in the literature highlight the instability of the beta parameter over time (Black et al. 1972; Fama and McBeth 1973; Fabozzi and Francis 1978). To overcome these constraints, scholars have used various methods, such as the GARCH process, Kalman–Bucy filter, or rolling window, to perform forward regression (Faff et al. 1992, Faff and Brooks 1998; Brooks et al. 1992, 1998; Groenewold and Fraser 1997). The time-varying systematic risk is an important extension of the CAPM to monitor the risk-profile time-robustness for various market conditions (e.g., expansion, turmoil, and crisis), especially with the recent COVID-19 pandemic and Ukrainian conflict affecting market conditions. Lopez et al. (2022) demonstrated that static beta estimation is irrelevant in COVID-19 because time-varying parameters are more appropriate. Similarly, Jain (2022) emphasized the value of time-varying betas. She observed increasing betas in the Indian stock market during the first COVID-19 wave but not during the second wave. She also claimed that beta dynamics are affected by firm sectors. Many studies in the literature, such as Zhang et al. (2020), He et al. (2020), and Hui and Chan (2022), highlighted the increasing risk during the COVID-19 crisis confirming Alexandridis and Hassan (2020)’s results for the Global Financial Crisis. However, they did not include wavelet decomposition. The main goal of the preset study is to highlight the role of investment horizons on systematic risk in different market conditions. Following the research of Mestre and Terraza (2019) and McNevin and Nix (2018), we combine time-varying estimation and frequency decomposition. They proposed a rolling time–frequency estimation of the market line and developed the concept of time–frequency-varying beta parameters. The evolution of time–frequency-varying betas can highlight various systematic risk patterns in the short and long-run. They demonstrated, among other things, that the time dynamics of systematic risk differ significantly, depending on the frequencies used. Therefore, we assume that various time–frequency patterns are influenced by agents’ perceptions of market conditions related to risky (or not) events. Furthermore, time–frequency-varying systematic risk assume that portfolio features (in the short or long-run) can change compared with a standard approach. The robustness of stock/portfolio risk profiles during expansion and turmoil periods can then be investigated. Thus, a risk-profile can be considered robust or not based on the volatility of the beta over time and frequency. Thus, analyzing systematic risk in the time–frequency space can induce adjustments in portfolio allocation based on the time and frequency characteristics of stocks. This study uses the time–frequency rolling window developed by Mestre and Terraza (2019) to analyze the time–frequency robustness of the initial risk-profile. We use the daily returns of selected stocks and the Eurostoxx index from 2012 to June 2022. Moreover, we provide a method for promptly assessing the time–frequency characteristics of stocks or portfolios. We also analyze the short-run and long-run patterns of systematic risk. We confirm the frequency differentiation of systematic risks observed in the literature and find that risk dynamics differ as well. The short-run patterns of time–frequency betas closely resemble the standard CAPM time-varying estimation approach, whereas the long-run pattern differs. We also highlight that the static CAPM beta’s initial value influences the stock risk-profile’s time–frequency robustness. The closer the beta is to 1, the less robust the risk-profile. These results are observed during periods of expansion and turmoil. However, during crisis, beta volatility is higher, resulting in drastic changes in stock and portfolio risk profiles. The different reactions of short-run and long-run betas to the early stages of the COVID-19 and Ukrainian conflict suggest that agents perceive these events differently depending on their investment horizon. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical aspects of time–frequency approach. Section 3 estimates the time–frequency-varying betas using the standards rolling approach and the time–frequency-varying rolling window. We use a standard approach to compare short and long-run time–frequency dynamics. We also created three portfolios with distinct features and present our methodology for evaluating the time–frequency robustness of their respective risk profiles. Section 4 examines the time–frequency robustness of these portfolios’ risk profiles during the COVID-19 and Ukraine war periods (2020–2022). Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the paper.",2
